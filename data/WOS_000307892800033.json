The l(*)-constrained minimal singular value (l(*)-CMSV) of the measurement operator is shown to determine the recovery performance of nuclear norm minimization-based algorithms. Compared with the stability results using the matrix restricted isometry constant, the performance bounds established using l(*)-CMSV are more concise, and their derivations are less complex. Isotropic and subgaussian measurement operators are shown to have l(*)-CMSVs bounded away from zero with high probability, as long as the number of measurements is relatively large. The l(*)-CMSV for correlated Gaussian operators are also analyzed and used to illustrate the advantage of l(*)-CMSV compared with the matrix restricted isometry constant. We also provide a fixed point characterization of l(*)-CMSV that is potentially useful for its computation.", "paper_title": "The Stability of Low-Rank Matrix Reconstruction: A Constrained Singular Value View", "paper_id": "WOS:000307892800033"}
