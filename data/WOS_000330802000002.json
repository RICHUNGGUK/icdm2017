For v is an element of V and r >= 1, we denote by B-G,B- r(v) the ball of radius r and centre v. A set C subset of V is said to be an r-identifying code in G if the sets B-G,B- r(v) boolean AND C, v is an element of V, are all nonempty and distinct. Lambda graph G admitting an r-identifying code is called r-twin-free, and in this case the size of a smallest r-identifying code in G is denoted by gamma(r)(G). We study the following structural problem: let G be an r-twin-free graph, and G* be a graph obtained from G by adding or deleting a vertex. If G* is still r-twin-free, we compare the behaviours of gamma(r)(G) and gamma(r)(G*), establishing results on their possible differences and ratios.", "paper_title": "Minimum sizes of identifying codes in graphs differing by one vertex", "paper_id": "WOS:000330802000002"}
