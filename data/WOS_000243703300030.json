This paper proposes an automated voltage island generation flow in standard cell based designs. Two important objectives in voltage island designs are addressed in this flow: 1) reducing power dissipation under given performance constraints; 2) reducing implementation overheads, mainly layout overheads caused by cell clustering to form islands. The first objective is handled with timing and power driven netweighting and timing analysis in voltage assignment. For the second objective, we propose layout aware voltage assignment, i.e., voltage assignment during placement. We iteratively perform the following to adjustments: adjustment on voltage assignment to facilitate voltage island generation, and adjustment on cell locations to cluster cells in voltage islands. These iterations lead to a flow featured with tightly integrated voltage assignment and cell placement. Experimental results have demonstrated the advantages of our approach.", "paper_title": "Voltage island generation in cell based dual-Vdd design", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703300030"}
