In particular, the proposed approach allows users to specify the probability of success in meeting design specifications in the presence of uncertainties. Three benchmark problems have been considered to demonstrate the proposed approach. In addition, a robust electromagnet design example is also considered. The results illustrate quantitative correspondence between the prescribed and the computed robustness.", "paper_title": "An Evolutionary Computing Approach to Robust Design in the Presence of Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000285059500005"}
