Pore growth by pore coalescence was treated as the nearly instantaneous formation of one large pore upon contact of two smaller pores. In that sense, three different types of pore replacement, irregular (pore skeleton), circular and ellipsoidal, were defined and applied for the study of diffusional effects on the microstructural development of the porous W-Ni system.
