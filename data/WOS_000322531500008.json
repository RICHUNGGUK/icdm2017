However, due to its assumption of state conditional independence between observations, HMM has a very limited capacity for recognizing complex patterns involving more than first-order dependencies in customer relationships management. Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH) could overcome the drawbacks of HMM, so we propose a hybrid model by combining the HMM and GMDH to score customer credit. There are three phases in this model: training HMM with multiple observations, adding GMDH into HMM and optimizing the hybrid model. The proposed hybrid model is compared with other exiting methods in terms of average accuracy, Type I error, Type II error and AUC. Experimental results show that the proposed method has better performance than HMM/ANN in two credit scoring datasets. The implementation of HMM/GMDH hybrid model allows lenders and regulators to develop techniques to measure customer credit risk.", "paper_title": "Customer credit scoring based on HMM/GMDH hybrid model", "paper_id": "WOS:000322531500008"}
