We focus on (delta, gamma)-matching. Given a text T of length n, a pattern P of length m,and two parameters delta and gamma, the aim is to find all the substring T[i, i + m - 1] such that (a) for all 1 <= j <= m, vertical bar T[i+j-1]-P[j]vertical bar <= delta (delta-matching), and (b) Sigma(1 <= j <= m) vertical bar T[i+j-1]-P[j]vertical bar <= gamma (gamma-matching). In this paper we consider three variations of (delta,gamma)matching: amplified matching, transposition-invariant matching, and amplified transposition-invariant matching. For each problem we propose a simple and efficient algorithm which is easy to implement.", "paper_title": "Algorithms on extended (delta, gamma)-matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300119"}
