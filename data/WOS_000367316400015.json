In the present paper, we aim to study homomorphisms between fuzzy relation information systems (FRISs) in dynamic environments, where the terminology of dynamic refers to the fact that the involved information systems need to be updated with time due to the inflow of new information. To be more specific, we firstly examine properties of consistent functions with respect to fuzzy relations and construct homomorphisms between FRISs. Then, we develop incremental mechanisms of computing homomorphisms between dynamic FRISs and illustrate how to construct relation reducts of dynamic FRISs using homomorphisms. Lastly, the experimental results are employed to demonstrate that compressing dynamic FRISs can be simplified significantly with the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Compression of Dynamic Fuzzy Relation Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000367316400015"}
