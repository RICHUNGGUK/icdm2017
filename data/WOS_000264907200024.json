Existing robust PICA methods like ROBPCA work best if the non-outlying data have an approximately symmetric distribution. When the original variables are skewed, too many points tend to be flagged as outlying. A robust PCA method is developed which is also suitable for skewed data. To flag the outliers a new outlier map is defined. Its performance is illustrated on real data from economics, engineering, and finance, and confirmed by a simulation study. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
