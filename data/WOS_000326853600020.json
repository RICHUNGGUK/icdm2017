However, airborne vehicle tracking is very challenging due to the factors such as platform motion, scene complexity, etc. In this paper, to address these problems, a new framework based on Kanade-Lucas-Tomasi (KLT) features and particle filter is proposed. KLT features are tracked throughout the video sequence. At the beginning of video tracking, a strategy based on motion consistence with RANSAC is utilized to separate background KIT features. The grouping of background features helps estimate the ego motion of the platform and the estimation is then incorporated into the prediction step in particle filter. Color similarity and Hu moments are used in the measurement model to assign the weights of particles. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed the other tracking methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
