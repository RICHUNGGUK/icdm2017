The knitting technique solves the structural problem. It contains some simple yet effective rules which can guide the synthesis of PN with desired properties. The previous knitting technique admits only TT generations among sequential or concurrent processes and PP generations among sequential or exclusive processes. The synthesized nets, however, are restricted because some generations are prohibited. Recently, we have improved the synthesis rules such that the previously forbidden generations are admissible if they are accompanied with additional generations. This paper deals with how to remove the restrictions of TP-path or PT-path generations.", "paper_title": "Knitting technique with TP-PT generations for Petri net synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239532700012"}
