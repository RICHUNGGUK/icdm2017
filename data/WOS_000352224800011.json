In this article, we explore this hybrid memory architecture by jointly optimizing time performance and temperature for embedded systems with loops. Our basic idea is to adaptively adjust the workload distribution between cache and SPM based on the current temperature. For a problem in which the workload can be estimated a priori, we present a nonlinear programming formulation to optimally minimize the total execution time of a loop under the constraints of SPM size and temperature. To solve a problem in which the workload is not known a priori, we propose a temperature-aware adaptive loop scheduling algorithm called TALS to dynamically allocate data to cache and SPM at runtime. The experimental results show that our algorithms can effectively achieve both performance and temperature optimization for embedded systems with cache and SPM.", "paper_title": "Temperature-Aware Data Allocation for Embedded Systems with Cache and Scratchpad Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000352224800011"}
