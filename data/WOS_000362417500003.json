We explicitly construct a discrete conformal map between the input triangulated surface and the deformed triangulated surface. Our algorithm can handle a surface with any topology, with or without boundary, and can find a deformed metric for any prescribed curvature satisfying the Gauss-Bonnet formula. In addition, we present the numerical examples to show the convergence of our discrete conformality and to demonstrate the efficiency and the robustness of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Discrete Conformal Deformation: Algorithm and Experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500003"}
