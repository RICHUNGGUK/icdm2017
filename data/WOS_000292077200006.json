We show that deciding whether a graph has a k-clique-coloring is Sigma(p)(2)-complete for every k >= 2. The complexity of two related problems are also considered. A graph is k-clique-choosable, if for every k-list-assignment on the vertices, there is a clique coloring where each vertex receives a color from its list. This problem turns out to be Pi(p)(3)-complete for every k >= 2. A graph G is hereditary k-clique-colorable if every induced subgraph of G is k-clique-colorable. We prove that deciding hereditary k-clique-colorability is also Pi(p)(3)-complete for every k >= 3. Therefore, for all the problems considered in the paper, the obvious upper bound on the complexity turns out to be the exact class where the problem belongs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
