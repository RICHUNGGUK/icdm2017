(t, k)-Diagnosis, which is one of the most important system-level diagnosis strategies, requires at least k faulty processors identified in each iteration provided there are at most t faulty processors, where t >= k. In this paper, a new (t, k)-diagnosis algorithm for regular networks is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has larger values of t for tori and matching composition networks, in comparison with previous (t, k)-diagnosis algorithms.", "paper_title": "(t, k)-Diagnosability for Regular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280134600001"}
