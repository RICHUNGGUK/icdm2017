This article proposes a web service-oriented approach, such that users can source competitive offers and generate feature-based CAD models from different vendors over the Internet. The key technique is to create feature markup descriptions for the requested library elements. Group technology is applied to classify and control the geometry configurations of component models. The approach enhances traditional un-parameterized and platform-dependent electronic catalogs by avoiding hard coding of catalogs within specific CAD systems, and thereby facilitates the updating of databases.", "paper_title": "Web Service-oriented Electronic Catalogs for Product Customization", "paper_id": "WOS:000261868600004"}
