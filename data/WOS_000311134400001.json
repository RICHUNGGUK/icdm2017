The nonadiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) simulation is based on Casida's linear response time-dependent density functional theory to describe electronic excited states and Tully's fewest-switches surface hopping approach to describe nonadiabatic electron-ion dynamics. To enable large NAQMD simulations, a series of techniques are employed for efficiently calculating long-range exact exchange correction and excited-state forces. The simulation program is parallelized using hybrid spatial and band decomposition, and is tested for various materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
