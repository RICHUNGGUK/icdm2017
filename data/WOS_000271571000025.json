This paper presents a hybrid classification model by integrating a case-based reasoning technique, a fuzzy decision tree (FDT), and genetic algorithms (GAs) to construct a decision-making system for data classification in various database applications. The model is major based on the idea that the historic database can be transformed into a smaller case base together with a group of fuzzy decision rules. As a result, the model can be more accurately respond to the current data under classifying from the inductions by these smaller case-based fuzzy decision trees. Hit rate is applied as a performance measure and the effectiveness of our proposed model is demonstrated experimentally compared with other approaches on different database classification applications. The average hit rate of our proposed model is the highest among others. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
