The method uses three algorithms: discrete wavelet transform (DWT), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and linear quadratic regulator (LQR). DWT is used to obtain the local energy distribution of the motivation over the frequency bands. PSO is used to determine the gain matrices through the online update of the weighting matrices used in the LQR controller while eliminating the trial and error. The method is tested on a 10-story structure subject to several historical pulse-like near-fault ground motions. The results indicate that the proposed method is more effective at reducing the displacement response of the structure in real time than conventional LQR controllers.", "paper_title": "Wavelet PSO-Based LQR Algorithm for Optimal Structural Control Using Active Tuned Mass Dampers", "paper_id": "WOS:000321438700007"}
