To answer this question we first introduce the notion of gaps of a code which allows us to characterize such subcodes easily. This property was first used and stated by Wieschebrink where he applied the Sidelnikov-Shestakov attack to break the Berger-Loidreau cryptosystem.", "paper_title": "The non-gap sequence of a subcode of a generalized Reed-Solomon code", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200022"}
