The selection process of the software has been based on the study of the capabilities of the commercial and general-purpose simulation and visualization tools available as well as on the quantification of user requirements and the development of trial versions. Analytical Hierarchy Process has been used to choose the platform, which is composed of a simulation model developed in JAVA and two visualization screens, one in JAVA and the other in Visual Basic.
