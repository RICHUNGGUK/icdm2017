The connection of power switch in parallel with inductor makes the boost converter operate in PCCM, which provides an additional degree of control freedom by inductor current freewheeling operation mode. Compared with boost PFC converter operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM) and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), tri-state boost PFC converter extends the load range and is therefore more suitable for wide range of load variation. However, for universal input applications, the input power factor (PF) of the tri-state boost PFC converter is relatively low when the sinusoidal reference current control strategy is used. To improve the PF over the whole input voltage range, the input current and PF expressions of the tri-state boost PFC converter is derived and the non-sinusoidal reference current control strategy is proposed. A 400W prototype of the tri-state boost PFC converter is built by using digital signal processing (DSP) as the controller. The experimental results verify the analysis results.", "paper_title": "DSP-Based Control of Tri-State Boost PFC Converter with High Input Power Factor for Wide Range of Load Variations", "paper_id": "WOS:000352640700013"}
