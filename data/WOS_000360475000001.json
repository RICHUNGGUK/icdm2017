In this paper, a position prediction based beacon approach is proposed to reduce beacon frequency and decrease bandwidth consumption. Vehicles track their neighbors using the predicted position instead of using periodic beacon broadcasting. Only when the prediction error is higher than a predefined tolerance will a beacon broadcasting be triggered. For improving the prediction accuracy, we classify the motion of vehicles into two typical patterns: a constant speed pattern and a maneuvering pattern. A maneuver detection module is responsible for recognizing current motion patterns, and a variable dimension filter that can switch dynamically between the two patterns is employed to generate high accurate position prediction. The simulation results show the proposed scheme can reduce significantly the number of beacons than three existing beacon approaches.", "paper_title": "Position Prediction Based Frequency Control of Beacons in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000360475000001"}
