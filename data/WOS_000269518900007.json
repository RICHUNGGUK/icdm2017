In this paper, we review the state of the art in such systems by first presenting the installation, the visual features used for skin lesion classification, and the methods for defining them. Then, we describe how to extract these features through digital image processing methods, i.e., segmentation, border detection, and color and texture processing, and we present the most prominent techniques for skin lesion classification. The paper reports the statistics and the results of the most important implementations that exist in the literature, while it compares the performance of several classifiers on the specific skin lesion diagnostic problem and discusses the corresponding findings.", "paper_title": "Overview of Advanced Computer Vision Systems for Skin Lesions Characterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000269518900007"}
