We are developing a handheld, dexterous surgical robot that can be controlled with one hand only, while standing at the operating table. The instrument is composed of a master part (the handle) and a slave part (the tip). This work compares the performance of different control modes, i.e. different ways to map the degrees of freedom of the handle to those of the tip. We ask users to drive the tip along complex trajectories in a virtual environment, using the real master to drive a simulated slave, and assess their performance. Results show that, concerning time, users with no training in laparoscopy prefer a direct mapping of position and orientation, like in free hand motion. However, users trained in laparoscopy perform equally fast with our hand-held robot and, concerning precision, make a smaller number of errors.", "paper_title": "Comparison of control modes of a hand-held robot for laparoscopic surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300053"}
