However, they do not take the social selfish nodes into consideration. To deal with the unpredictability in connections and uncooperative behaviors in the nodes, this paper proposes a transmission scheme to help the social selfish nodes to forward messages for other nodes. In the proposed scheme, priority is given to a message according to the cooperation degree, a cache management strategy is applied, and a delivery probability is calculated to guide nodes to select the better nodes as their relays. Simulation experiments show that the proposed transmission scheme protocol is effective and outperforms the existing transmission schemes.", "paper_title": "Transmission of multimedia contents in opportunistic networks with social selfish nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000355813200005"}
