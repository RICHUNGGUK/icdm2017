This opportunity may be of particular benefit to members of marginalized social groups, such as lesbians, who may underutilize mainstream health care services as a result of negative experiences with health care providers (Hutchinson, Thompson, and Cederbaum 2006). In this article, we describe the results of an analysis of government-sponsored or mainstream health information Web sites and alternative lesbian-focused health Web sites to explore the processes of production and representation. These processes comprise part of the circuit of culture, a cultural studies model that describes the relationships among the production, representation, consumption, regulation, and identity of cultural artefacts (Hall 1997). Our analysis reveals important differences in the ways in which mainstream and alternative sites represent lesbians and their health concerns. Whereas there is a clear division between producer and consumer roles on mainstream sites, on alternative sites these roles converge; that is, the producers of information content are also its consumers, with the result that the sites differ significantly in their objectives and their positioning of the health concerns of site users.", "paper_title": "Relations of Production: Representations of Consumers and Their Health Needs on Mainstream and Alternative Health Information Sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000205747900003"}
