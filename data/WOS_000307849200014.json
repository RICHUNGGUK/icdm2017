Upon such a transition a surface loses its properties of low adhesion and friction. We describe how to adapt the Surface Evolver algorithm to predict the parameters and mechanism of the collapse transition on posts of arbitrary shape. In particular, contributions to the free energy evaluated over the solid-liquid surface are reduced to line integrals to give good convergence. The algorithm is validated for straight, vertical and inclined, posts. Numerical results for curved posts with a horizontal section at their ends show that these are more efficient in stabilizing the Cassie state than straight posts, and identify whether the interface first depins from the post sides or the post tips.", "paper_title": "SURFACE EVOLVER SIMULATIONS OF DROPS ON MICROPOSTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307849200014"}
