The contribution in this paper is twofold. First, as each neighbor selects one message-bearing codeword from its unique codebook for transmission, it is shown that decoding their messages based on a superposition of those codewords through the multiaccess channel is fundamentally a problem of compressed sensing. In the case where each message is designed to consist of a small number of bits, an iterative algorithm based on belief propagation is developed for efficient decoding. Second, to satisfy the half-duplex constraint, each codeword consists of randomly distributed on-slots and off-slots. A node transmits during its on-slots and listens to its neighbors only through its own off-slots. Over one frame interval, each node broadcasts a message to its neighbors and simultaneously receives the superposition of neighbors' signals through its own off-slots and then decodes all messages. The proposed solution fully exploits the multiaccess nature of the wireless medium and addresses the half-duplex constraint at the fundamental level. In a network consisting of Poisson distributed nodes, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme often achieves several times the rate of slotted ALOHA and CSMA with the same packet error rate.", "paper_title": "Virtual Full Duplex Wireless Broadcasting via Compressed Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000344157600021"}
