We describe a week long DTN trial carried out during the summer of 2009 in the Laponia area of Northern Sweden that involved the provision of basic email and web services to users who were 57 km distant from any power or networking infrastructure. The trial validated our design and successfully demonstrated the use of email via helicopter-transported data-mules. With the aim of making it easier for others to replicate this kind of trial, the hardware and software used are described with references to full specifications, as are the results of the initial 2009 trial. We also describe plans for an extended trial in summer 2010 in the same area.", "paper_title": "Report on an Arctic summer DTN trial", "paper_id": "WOS:000291479200002"}
