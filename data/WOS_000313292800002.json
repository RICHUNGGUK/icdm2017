The algorithm detects building boundaries and features and converts the point cloud data into a solid model appropriate for computational modeling. The algorithm combines a voxel-based technique with a Delaunay triangulation-based criterion. In the first phase, the algorithm detects boundary points of the facade and its features from the raw data. Subsequently, the algorithm determines whether holes are actual openings or data deficits caused by occlusions and then fills unrealistic openings. The algorithm's second phase creates a solid model using voxels in an octree representation. The algorithm was applied to the facades of three masonry buildings, successfully detected all openings, and correctly reconstructed the facade boundaries. Geometric validation of the models against measured drawings showed overall dimensions correct to 1.2%, most opening areas to 3%, and simulation results within 5% of those predicted by CAD-based models.
