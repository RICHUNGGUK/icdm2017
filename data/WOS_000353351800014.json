To illustrate Ontology as a Service, we propose sub-ontology extraction and extension, whereby a sub-ontology is extracted from the main ontology and is then extended to cover new concepts and relationships. We use a maximum extraction method to facilitate this. Unified Medical Language System meta-thesaurus ontology is used as a walk-through case study to illustrate our proposed methods.
