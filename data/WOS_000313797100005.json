Our result guarantees the convergence of bounded sequences, under the assumption that the function f satisfies the Kurdyka-Aojasiewicz inequality. This assumption allows to cover a wide range of problems, including nonsmooth semi-algebraic (or more generally tame) minimization. The specialization of our result to different kinds of structured problems provides several new convergence results for inexact versions of the gradient method, the proximal method, the forward-backward splitting algorithm, the gradient projection and some proximal regularization of the Gauss-Seidel method in a nonconvex setting. Our results are illustrated through feasibility problems, or iterative thresholding procedures for compressive sensing.", "paper_title": "Convergence of descent methods for semi-algebraic and tame problems: proximal algorithms, forward-backward splitting, and regularized Gauss-Seidel methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100005"}
