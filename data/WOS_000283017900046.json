In this article, based on the weights proposed by He and Yang (2003), we develop a new quantile regression approach for left truncated data. Our method leads to a simple algorithm that can be conveniently implemented with R software. It is shown that the proposed estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal under appropriate conditions. We evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators through extensive simulation studies.
