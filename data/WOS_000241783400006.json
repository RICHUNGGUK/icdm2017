This paper explores the nature of the challenges that confront analysts and their clients during requirements elicitation. A review of the literature highlights communication as a persistent locus of concern among systems analysts, users and procurers. The paper presents a classification of communication challenges that arise during the requirements elicitation process. Empirical evidence from a brief case study is used to illustrate the scope and impact of these communication challenges and to present a complementary approach to requirements elicitation. The paper introduces the Repertory Grid technique as a means to ameliorate some of the communication issues that persist particularly in projects where information systems support specialized work. The paper is written in the form of a case tutorial, providing insight into the contribution of the Repertory Grid technique to requirements elicitation.", "paper_title": "Communication challenges in requirements elicitation and the use of the Repertory Grid Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000241783400006"}
