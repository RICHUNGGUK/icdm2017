We then show that two of these conjectures (if true) imply negative answers to the questions of Coppersmith & Winograd (J Symb Comput 9:251-280, 1990) and Cohn et al. (2005) regarding possible approaches for obtaining fast matrix-multiplication algorithms. Specifically, we show that the ErdAs-Rado sunflower conjecture (if true) implies a negative answer to the \"no three disjoint equivoluminous subsets\" question of Coppersmith & Winograd (J Symb Comput 9:251-280, 1990); we also formulate a \"multicolored\" sunflower conjecture in and show that (if true) it implies a negative answer to the \"strong USP\" conjecture of Cohn et al. (2005) (although it does not seem to impact a second conjecture in Cohn et al. (2005) or the viability of the general group-theoretic approach). A surprising consequence of our results is that the Coppersmith-Winograd conjecture actually implies the Cohn et al. conjecture. The multicolored sunflower conjecture in is a strengthening of the well-known (ordinary) sunflower conjecture in , and we show via our connection that a construction from Cohn et al. (2005) yields a lower bound of (2.51 . . .) (n) on the size of the largest multicolored 3-sunflower-free set, which beats the current best-known lower bound of (2.21 . . . ) (n) Edel (2004) on the size of the largest 3-sunflower-free set in Z(3)(n) .", "paper_title": "On sunflowers and matrix multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000319168000002"}
