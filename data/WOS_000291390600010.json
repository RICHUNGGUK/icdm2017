The joint distribution of class labels is explicitly modelled using the distances between feature vectors. Intuitively, a class label should depend more on class labels which are closer in the feature space, than those which are further away. Our approach builds on previous work by Holmes and Adams (J. R. Stat. Soc. Ser. B 64:295-306, 2002; Biometrika 90:99-112, 2003) and Cucala et al. (J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 104:263-273, 2009). Our work shares many of the advantages of these approaches in providing a probabilistic basis for the statistical inference. In comparison to previous work, we present a more efficient computational algorithm to overcome the intractability of the Markov random field model. The results of our algorithm are encouraging in comparison to the k-nearest neighbour algorithm.", "paper_title": "Classification using distance nearest neighbours", "paper_id": "WOS:000291390600010"}
