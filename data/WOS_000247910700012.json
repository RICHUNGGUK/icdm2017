Unfortunately, due in part to its history, parallel programming languages and tools still mostly focus on \"big iron\" and older languages such as C and Fortran. Performance improvement via parallelism should be of interest to anyone whose codes run too slowly. This requires a shift in focus.", "paper_title": "Python NetWorkSpaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000247910700012"}
