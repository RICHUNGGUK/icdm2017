Relationships with current and potential donors are often created and maintained via annual golf tournaments that pair donors with varsity players and team coaches in a scramble format tournament. This paper introduces a new spreadsheet-based DSS tool for optimizing the formation of teams for multi-round, unique-team, golf scramble tournaments. The DSS uses mixed-integer programming to create unique teams for each round of play while considering the handicaps of all teams and individual players to ensure a reasonable level of fairness in the tournament.
