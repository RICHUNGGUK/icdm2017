In traditional methods, the solution of initial-value problems (IVPs) using numerical methods like finite difference method leads to step by step and time-consuming recursive solutions. Design/methodology/approach - The present method is based on converting the IVP into boundary-value problems (BVPs) and utilizing the features of the latter problems in efficient solution of the former ones. Finite difference formulation of BVPs leads to matrices with repetitive tri-diagonal and block tri-diagonal patterns wherein the eigensolution and matrix inversion are obtained using graph products rules. To get advantage of these efficient solutions for IVPs like the dynamic analysis of single DOF systems, IVPs are converted to boundary-value ones using mathematical manipulations. The obtained formulation is then generalized to the multi DOF systems by utilizing modal analysis. Findings - Applying the method to the modal analysis leads to a simple and efficient formulation. The laborious matrix inversion and eigensolution operations, of computational complexities of O(n(2.373)) and O(n(3)), respectively, are converted to a closed-form formulation with summation operations. Research limitations/implications - No limitation. Practical implications - Swift analysis has become possible. Originality/value - Suitability of solving IVPs and modal analysis using conversion and graph product rules is presented and applied to efficient seismic optimal analysis and preliminary design.", "paper_title": "An efficient method for seismic analysis of structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000359048600009"}
