We generalize the classical definition so that we obtain a conchoid from any pair of curves B and C in the projective plane. We present two definitions, one purely algebraic through resultants and a more geometric one using an incidence correspondence in P (2) x P (2). We prove, among other things, that the conchoid of a generic curve of fixed degree is irreducible, we determine its singularities and give a formula for its degree and genus. In the final section we return to the classical case: for any given curve C we give a criterion for its conchoid to be irreducible and we give a procedure to determine when a curve is the conchoid of another.", "paper_title": "Conchoidal transform of two plane curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000278614200003"}
