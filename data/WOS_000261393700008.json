This provides multiwavelet-based embedded shadow images for progressive transmission and reconstruction. Both integer multiwavelet transform and balanced multiwavelet transform are considered in the method. It is secure and fault-tolerant, and gives small shadow size and excellent rate-distortion performance. Experimental results and sample applications are given to demonstrate the characteristics of this method.", "paper_title": "SECURE AND PROGRESSIVE IMAGE TRANSMISSION THROUGH SHADOWS GENERATED BY MULTIWAVELET TRANSFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000261393700008"}
