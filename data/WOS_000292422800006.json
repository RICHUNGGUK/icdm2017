However, the decentralised discovery and selection process due to services distributed over internet is a critical challenge. In this paper, we propose a cloud services acquisition system by introducing a Communication and Analysis Middleware (CAM) for efficient service discovery. To simultaneously meet multiple objectives, the discovery results are further evaluated to constitute compromised solutions through evolutionary analysis. The experimental results show that the derived compositions which satisfy multiple-objective optimisation can be derived efficiently.", "paper_title": "Adjustable flooding-based discovery with multiple QoSs for cloud services acquisition", "paper_id": "WOS:000292422800006"}
