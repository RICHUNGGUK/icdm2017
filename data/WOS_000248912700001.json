Instead of relatively poor representation of image features in a flat vector form, we proposed to extract the features and encode them into a binary tree representation. The proposed LEO model is used to generalize this tree representation in order to perform the classification task. The capabilities of the proposed LEO model are evaluated in simulations running under different image scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the LEO model is consistent in terms of robustness amongst the other tested classifiers.", "paper_title": "Local experts organization model for natural scene images classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000248912700001"}
