The model addresses the interdependency and feedback effects between criteria and alternatives by using the Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). Decision-makers may hold diverse opinions and preferences due to incomplete information, differences in knowledge or simply inherent conflicts between various departments. This can make it difficult to judge the importance of the selection criteria. To remedy the problem we further apply Fuzzy Preference Programming (FPP) to integrate the different expert opinions. The proposed model can help practitioners improve their decision making process, especially when criteria and alternatives are numerous and interrelated. The method is demonstrated using data from a Taiwanese airline. Specific companies can easily extend this generic model to address their individual needs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
