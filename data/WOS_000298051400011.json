This is achieved by maximizing a negentropy-based cost function, and is derived rigorously using the recently developed HR calculus in order to implement Newton optimization in the augmented quaternion statistics framework. It is shown that the use of augmented statistics and the associated widely linear modeling provides theoretical and practical advantages when dealing with general quaternion signals with noncircular (rotation-dependent) distributions. Simulations using both benchmark and real-world quaternion-valued signals support the approach.", "paper_title": "Fast Independent Component Analysis Algorithm for Quaternion Valued Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000298051400011"}
