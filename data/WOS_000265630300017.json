In this scheme. routes are pre-allocated and the injection rates of all routes are regulated at the traffic sources according to the average available bandwidths in the links. Then. the number of packets in the network is decreased and thus, the congestion probability is reduced and the communication performance is improved. Simulation results show that this scheme greatly increases the throughput and cuts down the average latency with little area and energy overhead. compared with the switch-to-switch flow control scheme.", "paper_title": "Pre-Allocation Based Flow Control Scheme for Networks-On-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630300017"}
