The Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) technique associated with a r-refinement grid adaption algorithm provides a good solution for studying the foil in a fixed reference frame while maintaining the grid quality over the whole simulation. Quantitative predictions were made, and showed very good agreement with the experimental data for a reduced frequency ranging in (0-0.6) and with the fixed values of Reynolds (4 x 10(3)), heave amplitude (3c/4) and maximum angle of attack (20 degrees). At low Strouhal numbers we observed a linear relationship between the thrust coefficient and the instantaneous angle of attack; for higher reduced frequency a non-linear behavior is observed, linked to added mass effects. Under the assumption of small angle of attack, these added mass effects correspond to a pitch stiffening and a heave damping. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
