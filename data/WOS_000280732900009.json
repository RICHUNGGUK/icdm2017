Most studies on liver disease diagnosis focus mainly on identifying the presence of liver disease in a patient. Not many diagnosis models have been developed to move beyond the detection of liver disease. The study accordingly aims to construct an intelligent liver diagnosis model which integrates artificial neural networks, analytic hierarchy process, and case-based reasoning methods to examine if patients suffer from liver disease and to determine the types of the liver disease.
