We propose it as a platform on which published and new algorithms for SMFS analysis can be integrated in a standard, open fashion, as a general solution to the current lack of a standard software for SMFS data analysis. Specific features and support for. le formats are coded as independent plugins. Any user can code new plugins, extending the software capabilities. Basic automated dataset filtering and semi-automatic analysis facilities are included.", "paper_title": "Hooke: an open software platform for force spectroscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000266109500016"}
