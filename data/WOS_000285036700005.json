However, the problem list is often incomplete Objective To determine whether association rule mining, a data mining technique, has utility for identifying associations between medications, laboratory results and problems Such associations may be useful for identifying probable gaps in the problem list Design. Association rule mining was performed on structured electronic health record data for a sample of 100,000 patients receiving care at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA The dataset included 272,749 coded problems, 442,658 medications and 11,801,068 laboratory results. Measurements. Candidate medication-problem and laboratory-problem associations were generated using support, confidence, chi square, Interest, and conviction statistics. High-scoring candidate pairs were compared to a gold standard. the Lexi-Comp drug reference database for medications and Mosby's Diagnostic and Laboratory Test Reference for laboratory results Results We were able to successfully identify a large number of clinically accurate associations A high proportion of high-scoring associations were adjudged clinically accurate when evaluated against the gold standard (89 2% for medications with the best-performing statistic, chi square, and 55.6% for laboratory results using interest). Conclusion. Association rule mining appears to be a useful tool for identifying clinically accurate associations between medications, laboratory results and problems and has several important advantages over alternative knowledge-based approaches (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
