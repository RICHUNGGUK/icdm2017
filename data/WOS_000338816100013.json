Neighbor-Joining is one solution for data-intensive and time-consuming evolutionary tree construction, with polynomial time complexity. However, its performance becomes poorer with the growth of massive datasets. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have brought about new opportunities for these time-consuming applications. Based on its high efficiency, a GPU-based parallel Neighbor-Joining method is proposed, and two efficient parallel mechanisms, data segmentation with asynchronous processing and the minimal chain model with bitonic sort, are put forward to speed up the processing. The experimental results show that an average speedup of 25.1 is achieved and even approximately 30 can be obtained with a sequence dataset ranging from 16,000 to 25,000. Moreover, the proposed parallel mechanisms can be effectively exploited in some other high performance applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
