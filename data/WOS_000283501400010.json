It has a multi-band topology and was fabricated with RF CMOS technology. For the purpose of lowering the K-VCO and reducing the nonlinearities of varactors, the sizes of the varactors are set small. Also noise filtering technique is adopted to minimize up-conversion of the low frequency noise as well as down-conversion of the high frequency noise, thus the phase noise performance of the VCO is greatly improved. Simulation and experimental results indicate that the LCVCO displays a phase noise of -126.1 dBc at 900 kHz offset in worst case with a tuning range from 1.76 to 1.96 GHz.", "paper_title": "A FULLY INTEGRATED MULTI-BAND LCVCO BASED ON CMOS TECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000283501400010"}
