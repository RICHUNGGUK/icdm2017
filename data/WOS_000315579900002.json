The aim of this study was to compare the performances of mono- and bi-planar setups to a marker-based gold-standard, during dynamic phantom knee acquisitions. Absolute pose errors for in-plane parameters were lower than 0.6 mm or 0.6A degrees for both mono- and bi-planar setups. Mono-planar setups resulted critical in quantifying the out-of-plane translation (error < 6.5 mm), and bi-planar in quantifying the rotation along bone longitudinal axis (error < 1.3A degrees). These errors propagated to joint angles and translations differently depending on the alignment of the anatomical axes and the fluoroscopic reference frames. Internal-external rotation was the least accurate angle both with mono- (error < 4.4A degrees) and bi-planar (error < 1.7A degrees) setups, due to bone longitudinal symmetries. Results highlighted that accuracy for mono-planar in-plane pose parameters is comparable to bi-planar, but with halved computational costs, halved segmentation time and halved ionizing radiation dose. Bi-planar analysis better compensated for the out-of-plane uncertainty that is differently propagated to relative kinematics depending on the setup. To take its full benefits, the motion task to be investigated should be designed to maintain the joint inside the visible volume introducing constraints with respect to mono-planar analysis.", "paper_title": "In vitro quantification of the performance of model-based mono-planar and bi-planar fluoroscopy for 3D joint kinematics estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315579900002"}
