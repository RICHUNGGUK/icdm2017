There are many scenarios where this approach is becoming no longer adequate. Many clear trends in Web technology are creating a need for owners of sensitive information to manage access to it by legitimate users using the services of honest but curious third parties, that is, parties trusted with providing the required service but not authorized to read the actual data content. In this scenario, the data owner encrypts the data before outsourcing and stores them at the server. Only the data owner and users with knowledge of the key will be able to decrypt the data. Possible access authorizations are to be enforced by the owner. In this article, we address the problem of enforcing selective access on outsourced data without need of involving the owner in the access control process. The solution puts forward a novel approach that combines cryptography with authorizations, thus enforcing access control via selective encryption. The article presents a formal model for access control management and illustrates how an authorization policy can be translated into an equivalent encryption policy while minimizing the amount of keys and cryptographic tokens to be managed. The article also introduces a two-layer encryption approach that allows the data owner to outsource, besides the data, the complete management of the authorization policy itself, thus providing efficiency and scalability in dealing with policy updates. We also discuss experimental results showing that our approach is able to efficiently manage complex scenarios.", "paper_title": "Encryption Policies for Regulating Access to Outsourced Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000277925600005"}
