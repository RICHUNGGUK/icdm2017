Controllability and observability criteria when the system is steered through initial and boundary data, which is achieved by an adequate choice of the homogeneity, are obtained. From the point of view of the technical applications, it seems to make more sense to consider boundary data controls as for instance in the management of high pressure gas networks. Stability criteria suitable computer simulations are also included.", "paper_title": "Modelling a gas pipeline as a repetitive process: controllability, observability and stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000361903800004"}
