A dedicated player is assumed to exist in the collective that forms the order of voting (order of moves) for the other participants. The problem of searching for the control strategy for the order of moves that ensures the win of alternative 1 that is preferable for the dedicated player is studied for the previously unstudied cases when such an order of moves exists. In particular, an algorithm for constructing such an order is proposed for the case when there is another participant for which alternative 1 is higher than the fourth from the end and when there is a group of participants that are relatively well-disposed to alternative 1 (more precisely, this alternative is higher than the third from the end for them). It is shown that the preference order of the alternatives that are better than alternative 1 is of no importance for the problem under consideration. It is proved that the conditions for the participants' preferences that are sufficient for the existence of the desired order of moves (they were obtained in the first part of this paper) are unimprovable.", "paper_title": "Controlling the order of moves in voting by veto.
