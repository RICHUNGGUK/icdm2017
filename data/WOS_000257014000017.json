This generalizes a class of Markovian adaptive CUSUM (ACUSUM) schemes to achieve the aim of providing an overall good performance over a range of future expected but unknown mean shifts. A two-dimensional Markov chain model is developed to analyze the run length performance of the new scheme. A comparison of run length performance of the proposed ACUSUM scheme and other control charts is shown favorable to the former. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
