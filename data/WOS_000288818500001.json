As the number of simulations is inferior to the number of studied factors, new resolution techniques are proposed and provide excellent results. Indeed, classical supersaturated treatments could not be applied to the high dimensional problem. We show that these designs are well adapted to the high dimensional problem while maintaining the number of simulations at reasonable levels. Very small-sized supersaturated designs show low reliability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
