However, as the core part of blocking, the blacklist is usually manually curated and is difficult to maintain. To make it easier to generate a blacklist and reduce human work, we propose an effective system with high accuracy, named Tracker-Detector, to detect third-party trackers automatically. Intuitively, the behaviors of trackers and non-trackers are different, which leads to different JavaScript API sets being called. Thus, an incremental classifier is trained from JavaScript files crawled from a large number of websites to detect whether a website is a third-party tracker. High accuracy of 97.34% is obtained with our dataset and that of 93,56% is obtained within a 10-fold cross validation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
