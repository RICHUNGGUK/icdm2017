Novel methods for rapid virtual prototyping, performance prediction, and evaluation are of critical importance in the engineering of complex reconfigurable systems and applications. These techniques can yield insightful tradeoff analyses while saving valuable time and resources for researchers and engineers alike. The research described herein provides a methodology for mapping arbitrary applications to targeted reconfigurable platforms in a simulation environment called RCSE. By splitting the process into two domains, the application and simulation domains, characterization of each element can occur independently and in parallel, leading to fast and accurate performance prediction results for large and complex systems. This article presents the design of a novel framework for system-level simulative performance prediction of RC systems and applications. The article also presents a set of case studies analyzing two applications, Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and Molecular Dynamics (MD), across three disparate RC platforms within the simulation framework. The validation results using each of these applications and systems show that our framework can quickly obtain performance prediction results with reasonable accuracy on a variety of platforms. Finally, a set of simulative case studies are presented to illustrate the various capabilities of the framework to quickly obtain a wide range of performance prediction results and power consumption estimates.", "paper_title": "A Simulation Framework for Rapid Analysis of Reconfigurable Computing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000208167100007"}
