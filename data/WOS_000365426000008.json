The algorithm uses a set of abstraction techniques that improve significantly the efficiency of WCET analysis of TA models with cyclic behaviour. We show that the proposed abstractions are exact with respect to the WCET problem in the sense that the WCET computed in the abstract model is equal to the one computed in the concrete model. We also compare our algorithm with the one implemented in the model checker UPPAAL which shows that when infinite cycles exist (i.e. cycles that can be run infinitely often), UPPAAL's algorithm may not terminate, and when largely repetitive finite cycles exist (i.e. cycles that can be run a large number of times but finite), UPPAAL's algorithm suffers from the state space explosion, thus leading to a low efficiency or resource exhaustion.", "paper_title": "Accelerating worst case execution time analysis of timed automata models with cyclic behaviour", "paper_id": "WOS:000365426000008"}
