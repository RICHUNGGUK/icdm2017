This paper designs a market model for aggregating re-configuration in heterogeneous networks based on the tradeoff between resource allocation and consumers' requirement. To unify the benefits of operators and consumers, a novel Stackelberg-based dynamic incentive pricing algorithm is proposed. The results of the theoretical analysis and simulation demonstrate that the proposed strategy provides incentive for cooperation by means of appropriate resource allocation, and improves the utilization of network resources, thereby effectively realizing the optimization of the whole network performance.", "paper_title": "Stackelberg-based dynamic incentive pricing algorithm in heterogeneous ubiquitous network", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000023"}
