One version of the model, expressed in levels, is highly non-linear and has at least two steady-state equilibria. One of these equilibria has an economically meaningful interpretation, while the other does not have a sensible economic interpretation. A second version of the model, expressed in logarithms, is linear and has a unique steady-state equilibrium, which corresponds to the economically meaningful equilibrium of the non-linear version of the model. The dynamic solution of each model version has a combination of stable and unstable eigenvalues so that any dynamic solution requires the calculation of appropriate \"jumps\" in endogenous variables. Attempts to solve these models, using forward-shooting and reverse-shooting algorithms, show that the forward-shooting algorithm chooses the \"wrong\" Solution for the non-linear model, but the \"right\" solution for the linear model. The reverse-shooting algorithm chooses the \"right\" solution in both cases. We demonstrate how this result is driven by particular properties of the two versions of the model. (c) 2008 IMACS.
