The input parameters of the model consist of alloy compositions (C, Si, Mn, P, S, Cu, Ni, Cr, Mo, Ti, V, Nb, Ca, Al, B) and tensile test results (yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, percentage elongation). The outputs of the ANN model include impact energy (-10 A degrees C). The model can be used to calculate the properties of low alloy steels as a function of alloy composition and thermomechanical treatment variables. The current study achieved a good performance of the ANN model, and the results are in agreement with experimental knowledge.", "paper_title": "An artificial neural-network model for impact properties in X70 pipeline steels", "paper_id": "WOS:000325026400029"}
