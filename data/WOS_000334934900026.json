Further, the topological evolution of the charge density, rho (r), the laplacian of rho (r), del(2)rho(r), and its gradient field along the reaction coordinate shed light on the regioselectivity of the process. The performance of most suitable functionals for DFT calculations in this kind of system was tested.", "paper_title": "On the regioselectivity of the mononuclear copper-catalyzed cycloaddition of azide and alkynes (CuAAC).
