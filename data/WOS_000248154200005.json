In modeling, effects of nonlinear flow through the valves, air compressibility in cylinder chambers, and time delay and attenuation of the pressure input in the connecting tubes are considered. Based on this mathematical model, the hybrid fuzzy control method for the precise force-feedback control is proposed and the fuzzy controllers are realized with the Mega8 MCUs as the units of the distributed control system in the Arm-Exoskeleton. At last a series of experiments validated the models and control method. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
