A systematic methodology for power reduction is proposed and applied at various design abstraction levels. At the algorithm level, the computational complexity is optimized. At the architecture level, pipelining and parallelism are widely adopted to reduce the operating frequency; hierarchical memory organization optimizes power-hungry memory accesses; hardware sharing reduces the total switching capacitance. At the circuit level, the knowledge about signal statistics is exploited to reduce number of transitions; data dependent signal-gating and clock-gating are introduced which are dynamic techniques for power reduction; multiplications are reduced and optimized, while complex dividers are totally eliminated. At the physical level, cell sizing and layout are optimized for power efficiency. The VLSI implementation shows that with UMC 0.18 mu m technology, the proposed design is able to decode realtime QCIF 30fps at 1.5 MHz. The decoder contains 169 k logic gates and 2.5 KB on-chip SRAM. The total chip area is 4.4x4.4 mm(2) in a CQFP 208 package. The measured power consumption is 973 mu W @ 1.8 V and 293 mu W @ 1.0 V. The low-power and realtime features make our design ideal for portable or mobile applications.", "paper_title": "Design a Low-Power H.264/AVC Baseline Decoder at All Abstraction Levels-A Showcase", "paper_id": "WOS:000303383700010"}
