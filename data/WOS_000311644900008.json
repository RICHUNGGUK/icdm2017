The method, similar to the approach in Tornberg and Greengard (2008) [26] for the Stokeslet, decomposes the tensor vector product into a sum of harmonic potentials and fields induced by four different charge and dipole distributions. Unlike the approach based on the kernel independent fast multipole method (Ying et al., 2004) [31], which requires nine scalar FMM calls, the method presented here requires only four. We discuss its applications to Brownian dynamics simulation with hydrodynamic interactions, and present some timing results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
