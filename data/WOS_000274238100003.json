The image can be visually decoded if any k(a parts per thousand yen2) of these sheets are stacked on top of one another, while this is not possible by stacking any k - 1 or fewer sheets. We employ a Kronecker algebra to obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a (k, n) VCS with a prior specification of relative contrasts that quantify the clarity of the recovered image. The connection of these conditions with an L (1)-norm formulation as well as a convenient linear programming formulation is explored. These are employed to settle certain conjectures on contrast optimal VCS for the cases k = 4 and 5. Furthermore, for k = 3, we show how block designs can be used to construct VCS which achieve optimality with respect to the average and minimum relative contrasts but require much smaller pixel expansions than the existing ones.", "paper_title": "Optimal (k, n) visual cryptographic schemes for general k", "paper_id": "WOS:000274238100003"}
