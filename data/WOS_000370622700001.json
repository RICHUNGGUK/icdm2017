Online digital libraries and cultural heritage institutions, as well as portals of publishers need an integrated multimedia back office in order to aggregate content collection and provide them to national and international aggregators, with respect to Intellectual Property Rights, IPR. The aim of this paper is to formalize and discuss requirements, modeling, design and validation of an institutional aggregator for metadata and content, coping with IPR Models for conditional access and providing content towards Europeana, the European international aggregator. This paper presents the identification of the Content Aggregator requirements for content management and IPR, and thus the definition and realization of a corresponding distributed architecture and workflow solution satisfying them. The main contributions of this paper consist of the formalization of IPR Model that enable the shortening of the activities for the IPR resolution, and avoid the assignment of conflicting rights/permissions during IPR model formalization, and thus of licensing. The proposed solution, models and tools have been validated in the case of the ECLAP service and results are reported in the paper. ECLAP Content Aggregator has been established by the European Commission to serve Europeana for the thematic area of Performing Arts institutions.", "paper_title": "IPR Centered Institutional Service and Tools for Content and Metadata Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000370622700001"}
