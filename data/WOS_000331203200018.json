However, it is crucial to have an accurate training data set for supervised classification techniques. Since different devices with, e.g., different protocols and/or field strengths cause different intensity profiles, each device/protocol must have an accompanying training data set, which is very costly to obtain. It is highly desirable to adapt the existing classifier(s) trained for one device/protocol to help classify data coming from another device/protocol. In this paper, we propose a novel method that has the ability to design classifiers obtained from one imaging protocol and/or MRI device to be used on a data set from another protocol and/or imaging device. As an example problem, we consider prostate cancer localization with multiparametric MRI. We show that simple normalization techniques such as z-score are not sufficient for cross-device automated cancer localization. On the other hand, the method we have originally developed based on relative intensity allows us to successfully use a classifier obtained from one device to be applied on a test patient imaged with another device. Proposed method also allows us to employ T2-weighted MR images directly instead of an additional step to normalize T2-weighted images usually performed in an ad hoc manner when T2 maps are not available. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we use a multiparametric MRI data set acquired from 18 biopsy-confirmed cancer patients with two separate scanners: 1) 1.5-T (Excite HD) GE and 2) 1.5-T (Achieva) Philips Healthcare scanners. A comprehensive visual, quantitative, and statistical analysis of the results show that methods we have developed allow us to: 1) perform cross-device automated classification and 2) use T2-weighted images without an ad hoc subject-specific normalization.", "paper_title": "Cross-Device Automated Prostate Cancer Localization With Multiparametric MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000331203200018"}
