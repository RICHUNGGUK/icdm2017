However, some other symmetric properties, say edge-transitivity and arc-transitivity, of BHn remained unknown. In this paper, we solve this problem and prove that BHn is an arc-transitive Cayley graph. Using this, we also investigate some reliability measures, including super-connectivity, cyclic connectivity, etc., in BHn. First, we prove that every minimum edge-cut of BHn(n >= 2) isolates a vertex, and every minimum vertex-cut of BHn(n >= 3) isolates a vertex. This is stronger than that obtained by Wu and Huang which shows the connectivity and edge-connectivity of BHn are 2n. Second, Yang [Applied Mathematics and Computation 219 (2012) 970-975.] proved that for n >= 2, the super-connectivity of BHn is 4n >= 4 and the super edge-connectivity of BHn is 4n - 2. In this paper, we proved that BHn(n >= 2) is super->= 0 but not super-k0. That is, every minimum super edge-cut of BHn(n >= 2) isolates an edge, but the minimum super vertex-cut of BHn(n >= 2) does not isolate an edge. Third, we also obtain that for n >= 2, the cyclic connectivity of BHn is 4n - 4 and the cyclic edge-connectivity of BHn is 4(2n - 2). That is, to become a disconnected graph which has at least two components containing cycles, we need to remove at least 4n - 4 vertices (resp. 4(4n - 2) edges) from BHn(n >= 2).", "paper_title": "Symmetric Property and Reliability of Balanced Hypercube", "paper_id": "WOS:000349672000022"}
