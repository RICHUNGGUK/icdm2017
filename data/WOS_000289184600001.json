Dynamic load balancing can be effective in decreasing simulation execution time and improving simulation performance. The characteristics of multi-agent systems and time synchronization mechanisms make the traditional dynamic load balancing approaches not suitable for dynamic load balancing in agent-based distributed simulations. In this paper, an adaptive dynamic load balancing model in agent-based distributed simulations is proposed. Due to the complexity and huge time consuming for solving the model, a distributed approximate optimized scheduling algorithm with partial information (DAOSAPI) is proposed. It integrates the distributed mode, approximate optimization and agent set scheduling approach. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed algorithm and the simulation performance under dynamic agent scheduling. The experiments indicate that DAOSPI has the advantage of short execution time in large-scale agent scheduling, and the distributed simulation performance under this dynamic agent scheduling outperforms that under static random agent distribution.
