Correlation measures and correlation coefficients have been applied widely in many research domains and practical fields. This paper focuses on the correlation measures and correlation coefficients of HFLTSs. To start the investigation, the definition of HFLTS is improved and the concept of hesitant fuzzy linguistic element (HFLE) is introduced. Motivated by the idea of traditional correlation coefficients of fuzzy sets, intuitionistic fuzzy sets and hesitant fuzzy sets, several different types of correlation coefficients for HFLTSs are proposed. The prominent properties of these correlation coefficients are then investigated. In addition, considering that different HFLEs may have different weights, the weighted correlation coefficients and ordered weighted correlation coefficients are further investigated. Finally, an application example concerning the traditional Chinese medical diagnosis is given to illustrate the applicability and validation of the proposed correlation coefficients of HFLTSs in the process of qualitative decision making.
