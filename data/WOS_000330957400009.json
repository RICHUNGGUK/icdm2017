Recent two-region models have used wave intermittency as a measurement of the disturbance wave contribution to gas-to-liquid momentum transfer and pressure loss. Data reduction algorithms for film thickness distribution, from planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging; and disturbance wave intermittency, from high-speed, backlit videos, have been improved. The revised data reduction results are then considered with regard to a recent two-region model. Outputs of average film thickness, pressure gradient, and average wave velocity are modeled with mean absolute errors of 8.70, 17.42, and 19.14 %, respectively.", "paper_title": "Improved visualization algorithms for vertical annular flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000330957400009"}
