Materials and methods: In order to better utilize relevant contour and gray information from liver images, we have improved the FCNN [Wang S, Wang M. A new algorithm NDA based on fuzzy cellular neural networks for white blood cell detection. IEEE Trans Inform Technol Biomed, in press], which proved to be very effective for the segmentation of microscopic white blood cell images, to create the novel neural network, AFCNN. Its convergent property and global stability are proved. Based on the ACNN-based NDA algorithm [Wang S, Wang M. A new algorithm NDA based on fuzzy cellular neural networks for white blood cell detection. IEEE Trans Inform Technol Biomed, in press], we developed the AFCNN-based NDA algorithm, which we used to segment 5 CT liver images. For comparison, we also segmented the same 5 CT liver images using the FCNN-based NDA algorithm. Results and conclusion: : AFCNN has distinct advantages over FCNN in both boundary integrity and recall accuracy. In particular, the performance index Binary-rate is generally much higher for AFCNN than for FCNN when applied to CT liver images. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
