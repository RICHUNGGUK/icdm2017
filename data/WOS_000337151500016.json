However, these low duty cycle, low power, and low data rate medical WPANs suffer from WiFi co-channel interferences. WiFi interference can lead to longer latency and higher packet losses in WPANs, which can be particularly harmful to safety- critical applications with stringent temporal requirements, such as ElectroCardioGraphy ( ECG). This paper exploits the Clear Channel Assessment (CCA) mechanism in WiFi devices and proposes a novel policing framework, WiCop, that can effectively control the temporal white-spaces between WiFi transmissions. Such temporal white-spaces can be utilized for delivering low duty cycle WPAN traffic. We have implemented and validated WiCop on SORA, a software-defined radio platform. Experimental results show that with the assistance of the proposed WiCop policing schemes, the packet reception rate of a ZigBee-based WPAN can increase by up to 116% in the presence of a heavy WiFi interferer. A case study on the medical application of WPAN ECG monitoring demonstrates that WiCop can bound ECG signal distortion within 2% even under heavy WiFi interference. An analytical framework is devised to model the CCA behavior of WiFi interferers and the performance of WPANs under WiFi interference with or without WiCop protection. The analytical results are corroborated by experiments.", "paper_title": "WiCop: Engineering WiFi Temporal White-Spaces for Safe Operations of Wireless Personal Area Networks in Medical Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000337151500016"}
