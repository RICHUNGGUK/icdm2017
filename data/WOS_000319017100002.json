As one of the first steps following the experimental part of the process, it significantly affects the quality of a resulting molecule model. In the paper we present a new approach for automated signal assignment in two-dimensional NMR spectra of RNA molecules. The proposed algorithm combines beam search with a neural network in order to reconstruct and evaluate solutions. Computational tests with a set of experimental and simulated NMR spectra show an excellent performance of the approach in comparison with the existing methods.
