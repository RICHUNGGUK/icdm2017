In this paper, we propose two techniques for document fragmentation considering the query statistics over XML data: path frequency tree (PFT). and Markov tables. Both techniques work by merging the nodes of low inquiring frequency to enhance fragment utilization, or by merging the nodes of high inquiring frequency to enhance fragment cohesion. Performance study shows that our algorithms perform well on query cost and other metrics.", "paper_title": "Document fragmentation for XML streams based on query statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200033"}
