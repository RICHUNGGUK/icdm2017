Our method is based on the observation that many deformations in real-world applications are isometric OF near isometric. By taking advantage of the intrinsic property of harmonic 1-form, i.e., it is determined by the metric and independent of the resolution and embedding, our method can easily find a consistent mapping between the reference and example poses which can be in different resolutions and triangulations. We first construct the skeleton-like Reeb graph of a harmonic function defined on the given poses. Then by examining the changes of mean curvatures, we identify the initial locations of joints. Finally we refine the joint locations by solving a constrained optimization problem. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework by pose space deformation, skeleton transfer, shape segmentation and pose-invariant shape signature. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
