In this work, both ligand- and receptor-based three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies were carried out using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) techniques on 122 pyrazinone derivatives as PDE inhibitors. The resultant optimum 3D-QSAR model exhibits a proper predictive ability as indicated by the statistical results of Q(2) of 0.584, R-ncv(2) of 0.884 and R-pre(2) of 0.817, respectively. In addition, docking analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were also applied to elucidate the probable binding modes of these inhibitors. Our main findings are: (1) Introduction of bulky, electropositive and hydrophobic substituents at 12- and 19-positions can increase the biological activities. (2) N atom at 8-position is detrimental to the inhibitor activity, and the effect of N atoms at 5- and 6-positions on compound activity is co-determined by both the hydrophobic force and the pi-pi stacking interaction. (3) Bulky and hydrophilic substitutions are favored at the 27-position of ring D. (4) Electronegative and hydrophilic substitutions around 5- and 6-positions increase the inhibitory activity. (5) Hydrophobic forces and pi-pi stacking interaction with Phe786 and Phe820 are crucial in determining the binding of pyrazinone derivatives to PDE5. (6) Bulky substitutions around ring C favors selectivity against PDE11, while bulky groups near the 21-position disfavor the selectivity. The information obtained from this work can be utilized to accurately predict the binding affinity of related analogues and also facilitate future rational designs of novel PDE5 inhibitors with improved activity and selectivity.
