We solve this problem by exploiting a reduction to the problem of finding a minimum weight K-link path in a properly designed Directed Acyclic Graph. Interestingly enough, our solution can be used with any compressed index based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. Our experiments compare this optimal strategy with several other known approaches, showing its effectiveness in practice.", "paper_title": "Distribution-Aware Compressed Full-Text Indexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324493700006"}
