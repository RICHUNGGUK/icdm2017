Let F-v and F-e be the sets of faulty nodes and faulty edges of an n-dimensional Mobius cube MQ(n), respectively, and let F = F-v boolean OR F-e. A faulty graph is pancyclic if it contains fault-free cycles of all lengths from 4 to \\V - F-v\\. In this paper, we show that MQ(n) - F contains a fault-free Hamiltonian path when \\F\\ <= n - 1 and n >= 1. We also show that MQ(n) - F is pancyclic when \\F\\ <= n - 2 and n >= 2. Since MQ(n) is regular of degree n, both results are optimal in the worst case.", "paper_title": "Hamiltonian path embedding and pancyclicity on the Mobius cube with faulty nodes and faulty edges", "paper_id": "WOS:000237631000006"}
