In this paper, we propose an image mining framework, Frequent Spatial Pattern mining in images (FSP), to mine frequent patterns located in a pair of spatial locations of images. A pattern in the FSP is associated with a pair of spatial locations and refers to the occurrence of the same image content in a set of images. This framework is designed to be general so as to accept different levels of representations of image content and different layout forms of spatial representations.", "paper_title": "Mining frequent spatial patterns in image databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600080"}
