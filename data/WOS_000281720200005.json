Using discourse analysis, textual and visual themes regarding the conveyance of emotional meaning were identified. Non-parametric measures found statistically significant differences between most relevant and least relevant pictures, between the number of views and number of favourites within each emotion, and between pictures with different emotion-based tags.", "paper_title": "Emotion-based tags in photographic documents: The interplay of text, image, and social influence", "paper_id": "WOS:000281720200005"}
