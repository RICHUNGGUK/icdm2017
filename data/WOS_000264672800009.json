The platform integrates the P2P computing techniques to provide users with flexible tools to manage personalized resources and services. The semantic object model provides an object-oriented semantic description language and a semantic object query language for publishing and querying resources. Semantic indexing mechanisms are used to support efficient semantic query processing. The semantic object model enables users to define and manipulate semantics with more explicit object semantics and can be well adapted to the P2P platform to support scalable and extensible management on semantics-rich Web resources.
