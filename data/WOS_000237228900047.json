The algorithm is based on several sub-modules: 3D Region Growing, Active Contour And Shape Models, Centre of Maximal Balls, but the core of our approach are Biological Models of ants known as Artificial Life models. In the first step of the algorithm images undergo a 3D region growing procedure for identifying the ribs cage; then Active Contour Models are used in order to build a confined area for the incoming ants that are deployed to make clean and accurate reconstruction of the bronchial and vascular tree, which is removed from the image just before checking for nodules.", "paper_title": "Artificial life models in lung CTs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900047"}
