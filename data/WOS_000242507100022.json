It is necessary to provide low-cost receivers for consumers to receive wide support for the MB-OFDM system. Such receivers can be achieved by utilizing direct-conversion architecture. Direct-conversion architecture suffers from IQ imbalance. IQ imbalance causes intercarrier interference (10) in the demodulated signals. In this paper, a new scheme of IQ imbalance compensation using transmit diversity is proposed. This scheme enables the system to achieve frequency diversity and simultaneously compensates for the influence of IQ imbalance. It is shown that the performance of the proposed scheme is better than that of the conventional IQ imbalance compensation scheme.", "paper_title": "IQ imbalance compensation scheme for MB-OFDM using transmission diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100022"}
