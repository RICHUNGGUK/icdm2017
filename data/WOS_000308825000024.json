The RNN is used in the closed-loop system to estimate online unknown nonlinear system function. A multivariable robust adaptive gradient-descent training algorithm is developed to train RNN. The weight convergence and system stability are proven in the sense of Lyapunov function. Simulation results are presented for a two-link robot tracking control problem.", "paper_title": "Recurrent neural tracking control based on multivariable robust adaptive gradient-descent training algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000024"}
