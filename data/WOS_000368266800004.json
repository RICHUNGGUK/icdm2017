The article deals with verification of action theories defined in a temporal extension of answer set programming which combines ASP with a dynamic linear time temporal logic (DLTL). The article proposes an approach to bounded model checking that exploits the Buchi automaton construction while searching for a counterexample, with the aim of achieving completeness. The article provides an encoding in ASP of the temporal action domains and of Bounded Model Checking of DLTL formulas. The article also deals with reasoning about epistemic knowledge and incomplete states.", "paper_title": "Achieving completeness in the verification of action theories by Bounded Model Checking in ASP", "paper_id": "WOS:000368266800004"}
