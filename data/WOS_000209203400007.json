Function P-sets has dynamic characteristics and law characteristics. Under certain conditions, function P-sets can return to the \"origin'' of function ground sets S. In the paper, it is proved that function P-sets is extension of P-sets, conversely, P-sets is special case of function P-sets. Applications of function P-sets in discovery of unknown information laws hidden information systems, are provided. Function P-sets is a new theory and a new method to research dynamic information laws for information systems.", "paper_title": "Function P-sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203400007"}
