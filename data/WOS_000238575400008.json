The COVAMOF Variability Modeling Framework is our approach to enable efficient variability management. As a practical realization of COVAMOF, swe developed the COVAMOF-VS tool suite, which provides several variability views on C#, C++, Java, and many other types of projects in Microsoft Visual Studio NET. In this paper, we show how COVAMOF facilitates an engineer during product derivation, and what benefits are gained by it.", "paper_title": "The COVAMOF derivation process", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575400008"}
