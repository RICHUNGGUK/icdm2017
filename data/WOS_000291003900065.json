This problem is known as the approximate integer common divisor problem in literature. Two versions of the problem, presented by Howgrave-Graham in CaLC 2001, turn out to be special cases of our analysis when k = 2. We relate the approximate common divisor problem to the implicit factorization problem as well. The later was introduced by May and Ritzenhofen in PKC 2009 and studied under the assumption that some of Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of certain primes are the same. Our strategy can be applied to the implicit factorization problem in a general framework considering the equality of (i) most significant bits (MSBs), (ii) least significant bits (LSBs), and (iii) MSBs and LSBs together. We present new and improved theoretical as well as experimental results in comparison with the state of the art work in this area.", "paper_title": "Approximate Integer Common Divisor Problem Relates to Implicit Factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900065"}
