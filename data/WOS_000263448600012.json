This is a consequence of the highly oscillatory behavior of the solutions corresponding to high eigenvalues. which forces a naive integrator to take increasingly smaller steps. We will discuss the most used approaches to the numerical solution of the Sturm-Liouville problem: finite differences and variational methods, both leading to a matrix eigenvalue problem; shooting methods using an initial-value solver; and coefficient approximation methods. Special attention will be paid to techniques that yield uniform approximation over the whole eigenvalue spectrum and that allow large steps even for high eigenvalues. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
