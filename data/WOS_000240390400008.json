A p-version finite element, where first-order shear deformation is followed and that was recently proposed for moderately thick plates, is employed to define the mathematical model. By applying transverse harmonic forces, the variation of the oscillations with the angle of the fibres is investigated. With this kind of excitation, only periodic motions with a period equal to the one of the excitation are found. However, introducing in-plane forces, m-periodic or quasi-periodic oscillations, as well as chaotic oscillations are computed. The existence of chaos is confirmed by calculating the largest Lyapunov exponent. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
