The hierarchical structure of the SVG content that maintains the relationship between the sub-divided content is formed during the process of sub-division. The divided content is selectively delivered and rendered on the mobile devices in an on-demand fashion. A prototypical system of the proposed approach is implemented and the performance of the framework is evaluated.", "paper_title": "Scalable vector graphics (SVG) based multi-level graphics representation for engineering rich-content exchange in mobile collaboration computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000238380100002"}
