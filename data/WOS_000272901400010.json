Many algorithms use interval analysis to approximate this curve, and to handle the topology of the final reconstruction. In this article, we use discrete geometry tools to build an original geometrical and topological representation of the implicit Curve. The polygonal approximation contains few segments, and the Reeb graph permits to sum up efficiently the shape and the topology of the curve. Furthermore, we propose two algorithms to process local cells refinement and local cells grouping schemes. We illustrate these schemes with a global system that efficiently handles manual or automatic fast updates on the global reconstruction, by considering topological or geometrical constraints. We also compare the speed and the quality Of Our approach with two classical methods. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
