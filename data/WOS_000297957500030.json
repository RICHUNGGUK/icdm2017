On each route, there are several carriers to deliver the freight, and each carrier possesses a delivery cost and multiple available capacities with a probability distribution because the capacity may be reserved for various orders. Carrier selection means selecting exactly one carrier to deliver the freight via each route and has significant influence on both customer service and cost. Hence, the transportation network associated with any carrier selection is a stochastic transportation network. Network reliability, the probability that d units of a given commodity are shipped successfully through the transportation network, is a performance index of freight delivery. This paper focuses on finding the optimal carrier selection based on network reliability criterion under a budget constraint. An optimization algorithm integrating a genetic algorithm, minimal paths, and the Recursive Sum of Disjoint Products is proposed to solve such a problem. A practical case of LCD television delivery from China to Germany is presented to illustrate the solution procedure.", "paper_title": "MAXIMIZING NETWORK RELIABILITY FOR STOCHASTIC TRANSPORTATION NETWORKS UNDER A BUDGET CONSTRAINT BY USING A GENETIC ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500030"}
