In its original and most basic form, the Faure sequence suffers from correlations between different dimensions. These correlations result in poorly distributed two-dimensional projections. A standard solution to this problem is to use a randomly scrambled version of the Faure sequence. We analyze various scrambling methods and propose a new nonlinear scrambling method, which has similarities with inversive congruential methods for pseudo-random number generation. We demonstrate the usefulness of our scrambling by means of two-dimensional projections and integration problems. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
