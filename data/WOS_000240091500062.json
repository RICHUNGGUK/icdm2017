We use motion segmentation algorithm that makes use of differencing to detect moving people's head. The novelty of this paper comes from adaptive frame differencing, detecting edge lines and restoration, finding the head area and cutting the head candidate. Moreover, we adopt nested K-means algorithm for finding head regions. Our system applies the statistical modeling of face and non - face classes and classifies multiple frontal face images with the Bayesian Discriminating Features (BDF) method to verify. Finally experimental results (using capture diverse image sources for 13 frames per second during 20 seconds and having 260 images per person) shows the feasibility of the differencing based head and Nested K-means Detection method.", "paper_title": "Use of nested K-means for robust head location in visual surveillance system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500062"}
