Furthermore, we introduce a pair of weight parameters to balance the impact of labeled and pseudolabeled data, and define a hybrid objective function to tune their values during co-training. The final prediction is given by the combination of base classifiers, and we define a pseudo-validation set to regulate their weight. Additionally, we present a strategy of pseudo-labeled data selecting to deal with the class imbalance problem. Experimental results on six datasets show that our method performs much better in practice, especially when the amount of labeled data is small. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
