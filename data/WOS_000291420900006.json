We experimentally investigate an historical and a layered queuing performance model and show how they can provide a good level of support for a dynamic-urgent cloud environment. Using this we define, implement and experimentally investigate the effectiveness of a prediction-based cloud workload and resource management algorithm. Based on these experimental analyses we: (i) comparatively evaluate the layered queuing and historical techniques; (ii) evaluate the effectiveness of the management algorithm in different operating scenarios; and (iii) provide guidance on using prediction-based workload and resource management.
