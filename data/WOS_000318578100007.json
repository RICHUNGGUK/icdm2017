Based on call of landform data partitioning organization and dynamic processing of visual regional data, for the present situation of commonly using ADO(ActiveX Data Objects) developing interface to realize the operation for database, OCI (Oracle Call Interface) programming is adopted in order to improve exchange efficiency with database, which can realize call of database partitioning data, improve 3D space database loading efficiency and realize quick plotting of landform model in flight view. The water body flow effect is represented by means of texture movement mode on basis of flow field visualization. It is indicated by results that optimization strategy and method improves graph plotting efficiency, intensifies visualization effect, effectively solves the contradiction between complicated landform model and limited plotting capability of graphic display hardware and realizes smooth running of digital basin flight view system of large-scale landform on ordinary PC.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON 3D SIMULATION OPTIMIZATION FOR DIGITAL BASIN OF LARGE-SCALE LANDFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578100007"}
