How this integration is implemented, however, leaves much room for improvement. Often the user must set parameters within the application, and when the person's context changes, they must manually reconfigure. What was meant to be a commodity in an unforeseen situation then becomes extra noise. Here, the authors describe a reference architecture that uses smartphones to improve integration with the IoT, thereby opening the way to new IoT scenarios that support evolution towards the Internet of People.", "paper_title": "From the Internet of Things to the Internet of People", "paper_id": "WOS:000351774200006"}
