An intelligent combined use of tools can facilitate the integration of unstructured or semistructured information resources and support individuals or groups of stakeholders in a complex environment, in order to structure a problem situation, to agree on a \"problem focus\" and to make commitments on a set of possible actions. The purpose of this article is to examine the potentiality of this system, above all in terms of knowledge acquisition, fusion, and use in various organizational contexts, and to describe an application in relation to an industrial project, in order to support the conceptual phase of the design process.", "paper_title": "An Integrated System to Acquire Knowledge and Support Decisions in Complex Innovation Design Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000354437100005"}
