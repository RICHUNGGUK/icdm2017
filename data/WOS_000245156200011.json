This allows to construct explicit filters for finding EEG waveforms, known from the visual analysis, in the matching pursuit decomposition of signals. In such a way detectors of relevant structures of both transient and oscillatory nature can be constructed in the space of physically meaningful parameters. This study presents evaluation of changes of power and frequency of sleep spindles and delta waves, related to the depth of the sleep, which were previously assessed in a qualitative way. We confirm quantitatively the decrease of frequencies of sleep spindles and delta waves with the depth of the sleep. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
