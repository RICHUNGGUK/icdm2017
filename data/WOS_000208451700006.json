According to the vehicle's characteristics such as nonlinearity, strong coupling and MIMO, firstly, the reason of the coupling between channels is analysed from the construct of BTT vehicle's mathematical model. Next, Gershgorin circle is adopted to analyse the diagonal dominance of this system. Furthermore, a robust decoupling matrix of the linearised models is obtained by using PSO, which makes the system fulfilled the diagonal dominance. Finally, quantitative feedback theory (QFT) is used to design the controller and the final results of the simulation show that this robust decoupling controller is effective and practical for engineering application.", "paper_title": "Robust decoupling control of BTT vehicle based on PSO", "paper_id": "WOS:000208451700006"}
