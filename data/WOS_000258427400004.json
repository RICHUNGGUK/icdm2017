In practice, the noise caused by changing market conditions and financial environments requires. investors to consider more market variables. However, conventional forecasting methods such as statistical methods require a strict assumption of probability density function, which may not adequately reflect actual market conditions. Hence, to overcome the limitations of conventional methods, this study proposes a novel method of using feature selection and entropy-based rough sets to classify IPO initial returns. The proposed procedure is illustrated by examining an IPO dataset for publicly traded electronics firms in Taiwan. The experimental results of the IPO dataset analyses indicate that the proposed procedure outperforms listing methods in terms of accuracy, number of attributes and number of rules. Further, the proposed procedure generates a set of easily understood rules that can be readily applied in knowledge-based investing systems.", "paper_title": "Forecasting IPO returns using feature selection and entropy-based rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400004"}
