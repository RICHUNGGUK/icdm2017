This research is motivated to explore how business value of IT in supply chain is co-created in downstream process and probe into the possible complementary effect of relational resources from retailers and customers during the Cooperative process. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - A model is proposed to conceptualize the process with three dimensions and six constructs, which emerges a causal link between organization resources application, e-supply chain capability (ESCC) and process performance. And then the research model was validated using partial least squares with data collected from 128 manufacturing firms in China. Findings - The results provide broad support for the following: the casual relationship among inter-organizational resources interaction, ESCC and process performance; the mediating role of ESCC in the e-CRM process is more significant than that in e-ordering process; and there is the moderating effect between relational resources and internal resources in e-CRM process. Practical implications. - It offers guidelines for managers to plan the roles played by resource, capabilities and performance for e-supply chain success in multi-firm environments. Originality/value - This study provides a novel perspective and offers important implications for e-supply chain research and practice, by exploring intermediate factors and shedding light on the process of co-creating business value of IT in supply chain.", "paper_title": "Co-creating business value of information technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000330079500004"}
