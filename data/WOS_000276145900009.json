Our proposal relies on both the most probable term pairs generated from the collection and the estimation of the topic homogeneity associated to these pairs Topics and their descriptions are generated from those term pairs whose support sets are homogeneous enough for representing collection topics Experimental results obtained over three benchmark text collections demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this new approach (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B V", "paper_title": "A document clustering algorithm for discovering and describing topics", "paper_id": "WOS:000276145900009"}
