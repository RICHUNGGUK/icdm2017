In this study, the feasibility and properties of the division of virtual machine resources on the cloud platform, using the virtual machine cluster as the management unit, are investigated. First, the definitions of virtual machine clusters are compared, and our own definitions are presented. Then, the feasibility of division using the virtual machine cluster as the management unit is described, and the isomorphism and reconfigurability of the clusters are proven. Lastly, from the perspectives of clustering and cluster segmentation, the dynamics of virtual machines are described and experimentally compared. This study aims to provide novel methods and approaches to the optimization management of virtual machine resources and the optimization configuration of the parameters of virtual machine resources and their application systems/components in large-scale cloud computing environments.", "paper_title": "The feasibility and properties of dividing virtual machine resources using the virtual machine cluster as the unit in cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358997000018"}
