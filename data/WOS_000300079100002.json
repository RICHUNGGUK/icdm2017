V is assigned a nonnegative integer w(v). A w- packing is a collection P of cycles (repetition allowed) in G such that every v. V is contained at most w(v) times by the members of P. Let < w > = 2|V | + Sigma(v is an element of V)[log(w(v)+ 1)] denote the binary encoding length (input size) of the vector (w(v): v is an element of V)(T).
