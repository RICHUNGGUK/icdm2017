The proposed approach uses a novel sampling technique, which eliminates the need for resolution/area tradeoffs. The programmability of each processing channel is based on the use of non-uniform clock signals with noise-shaped sampling energy. No capacitor values are modified for programming frequency response parameters and, hence, the performance of the TM SC filter is not sacrificed for programmability. Such a sampling technique not only leads to an accurate frequency response control, but also allows the design procedures and the resulting SC circuit implementation to be simplified. A test-chip including a programmable second-order TM SC filter with a multiplexing order of four, which operates in series or in parallel mode, was fabricated in conventional CMOS technology. Measurement results demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Series/parallel time-multiplexed switched-capacitor filters with programmability based on non-uniform sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000235671900006"}
