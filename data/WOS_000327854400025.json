This requires designing an efficient platform for inter-robot communication. P2P is a good approach to achieve this goal. P2P aims at making the communication ubiquitous thereby crossing the communication boundary and has many attractive features to use it as a platform for collaborative multi-robot environments. In this paper, we present our implemented P2P system based on JXTA Overlay. We use JXTA Overlay as a platform for robot collaboration and knowledge sharing. We also propose a fuzzy-based peer reliability system for JXTA-Overlay platform considering three parameters: Actual Behavior Criterion (ABC), Mutually Agreed Behavior (MAB) and Reputation (R). We evaluated the knowledge sharing system by many experiments and show that this system has a good performance and can be used successfully for knowledge sharing between robots. Also, we present some simulation results, which show the fuzzy-based peer reliability system has a good behavior and can successfully select the best peer candidate.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy-based reliability system for knowledge sharing between robots in P2P JXTA-overlay platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000327854400025"}
