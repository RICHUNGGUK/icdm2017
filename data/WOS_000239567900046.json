Moreover, the surfaces created using our method are connected. The modelers that are based on traditional fractal methods or shape grammars usually create disconnected surfaces and restrict the creative freedom of users. In most cases, the shapes are defined by hard-coded schemes that provide only a few parameters that can be adjusted by the users. We present a new approach for modeling such shapes. With this approach, novice users can interactively create a variety of unusual and interesting partially self-similar manifold surfaces.", "paper_title": "Interactive face-replacements for modeling detailed shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239567900046"}
