Some previous works use discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to extract license plate (LP), however, most of them are not capable of dealing with complex environments such as the low-contrast source images and the dynamic-range problems. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for license plate localization (LPL) based on OWL The LP can be extracted from different quality of source images under complex environments by using two frequency subbands. We first use the HL subband to search the features of LP and then verify the features by checking whether in the LH subband there exists a horizontal line around the feature or not. The proposed method can extract both front and back LPs of various vehicles. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve good LPL results with both short run-time and high accurate detection rate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
