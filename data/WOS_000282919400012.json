Then k-nearest neighbor classifier (kNN) and Gaussian mixture model are used to classify the any ran species based on another chosen feature set A series of experiments woe conducted to measure the outcome performance of the pin posed work. Experimental insults exhibit. that the recognition rate of k-nearest neighbor classifier using GMM non-anuran detection method with two different feature sets can achieve up to 80 42%. The effectiveness of the proposed identification system for anuran vocalizations that uses the combination with anuran detection and classification is thus verified.", "paper_title": "DEVELOPING THE IDENTIFICATION SYSTEM FOR ANURAN VOCALIZATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400012"}
