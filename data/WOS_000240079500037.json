This paper proposes a method for correcting reconstructed PET images through a list-mode rebinning process. Respiratory motion is compensated for by applying 2D affine transforms to the respiratory gated sequence of line-of-response events prior to image reconstruction. The affine transforms are derived from a non-rigid 3D/3D registration model derived from retrospectively gated MRI acquisitions of the same patient with free-breathing. The proposed motion correction scheme is evaluated with a simulation framework where the improvement in image quality is assessed by using data acquired from 10 normal subjects.", "paper_title": "List-mode affine rebinning for respiratory motion correction in PET cardiac imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500037"}
