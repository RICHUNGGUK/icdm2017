In addition to the known matrix-computation method for proving outer bounds for linear coding, we present a new method that yields actual characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities from which the desired bounds follow immediately.", "paper_title": "Achievable Rate Regions for Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700021"}
