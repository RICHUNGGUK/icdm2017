Currently, the personal digital assistant (PDA) has been widely used as the carrier for personal memos and daily records for its high mobility. Taking advantage of the personal information, the user requirements for knowledge can be determined. This research presents an intelligent KM scheme by integrating the PDA information (including notes, schedules and address book) mining model and mobile knowledge management mechanism. Based on the user profile mining technique, the PDA-ready knowledge that fits user requirements can be imported from the knowledge server to the client PDA. Demonstration cases are also provided to illustrate the applications of the proposed model in the content services and healthcare industry. By application of the mobile KM technique, the organization knowledge can be seamlessly provided to the PDA user via the data synchronization process. The attempt of this paper is to present an applicable and intelligent mobile knowledge carrier for realization of the mobile office. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
