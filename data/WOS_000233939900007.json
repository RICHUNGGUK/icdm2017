The service proxy is always colocated with the mobile user's location database such that whenever the MU's location database moves during a location handoff, a service handoff also ensues to colocate the service proxy with the location database. This allows the proxy to know the location of the mobile user all the time to reduce the network communication cost for service delivery. We investigate four integrated location and service management schemes. Our results show that the centralized scheme performs the best when the mobile user's SMR ( service to mobility ratio) is low and CMR ( call to mobility ratio) is high, while the fully distributed scheme performs the best when both SMR and CMR are high. In all other conditions, the dynamic anchor scheme is the best except when the service context transfer cost is high, under which the static anchor scheme performs the best. Through analytical and simulation results, we demonstrate that different users with vastly different mobility and service patterns should adopt different integrated location and service management methods to optimize system performance. Further, the best integrated scheme always performs better than the best decoupled scheme that considers location and service managements separately and management schemes that do not use any service proxy.", "paper_title": "On integrated location and service management for minimizing network cost in personal communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000233939900007"}
