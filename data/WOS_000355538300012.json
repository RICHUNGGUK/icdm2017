Despite all these facts, the way that GARCH models are built imposes limits on the heaviness of the tails of their unconditional distribution. The class of randomized generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic (R-GARCH) models includes the ARCH and GARCH models allowing the use of stable innovations. Estimation methods and empirical analysis of R-GARCH models are the focus of this work. We present the indirect inference method to estimate the R-GARCH models, some simulations and an empirical application.", "paper_title": "Indirect estimation of randomized generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedastic models", "paper_id": "WOS:000355538300012"}
