We present a new temporal texture synthesis algorithm, in which a segment genetic algorithm is introduced into the processes of synthesizing videos. In the algorithm, by analyzing and processing a finite source video clip, Infinite video sequences that are played smoothly in vision can be obtained. Comparing with many temporal texture synthesis algorithms nowadays, this algorithm can get high-quality video results without complicated pre-processing of source video while it improves the efficiency of synthesis. It is analyzed in this paper that how the population size and the Max number of generations influence the speed and quality of synthesis.", "paper_title": "A fast temporal texture synthesis algorithm using segment genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800009"}
