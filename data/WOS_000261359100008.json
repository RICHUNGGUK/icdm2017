The readability of network diagrams is discussed, anchored maps are proposed, and a method for drawing anchored maps is explained. The method uses indices to decide the orders of anchors because those orders markedly affect the readability of the network diagrams. Examples showing the effectiveness of the anchored maps are also shown.", "paper_title": "Anchored Map: Graph Drawing Technique to Support Network Mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000261359100008"}
