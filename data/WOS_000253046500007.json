Its main drawback is its massive data size. To solve this, the Spatial Bidirectional Reflectance Function (SBRDF) techniques compress BTFs into reflectance model parameters. However, SBRDF cannot produce the self-shadowing and self-occlusion mesostructure effects in many real-world surfaces. Aiming at this drawback, we investigate how self-shadowing and self-occlusion affect the surface appearance by additional physically-based analysis. We mainly rely on two physical phenomena to separate self-shadowing and self-occlusion into two independent effects. First, the self-shadowing is view independent. Second, the self-occlusion is independent of changes in lighting direction. After those analyses, we are able to add self-shadowing and self-occlusion effects to SBRDF to achieve rendering quality that is much closer to the original uncompressed BTF data than SBRDF.", "paper_title": "Physically-based analysis and rendering of bidirectional texture functions data", "paper_id": "WOS:000253046500007"}
