With the new approach the averaged system (or the formal first integral) may be written down immediately in terms of (i) suitable basis functions and (ii) scalar coefficients that are computed via simple recursions. Here we show how the coefficients/basis functions approach may be used advantageously to derive exponentially small error bounds for averaged systems and approximate first integrals.", "paper_title": "Higher-Order Averaging, Formal Series and Numerical Integration III: Error Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000351238600007"}
