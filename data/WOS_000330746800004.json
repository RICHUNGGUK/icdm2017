Our work identifies a set of distinctive features of specifications languages that have a fundamental role in defining and instantiating parameterised specifications. We consider both simultaneous and sequential instantiation of parameters, and allow not only sharing between the body of the parameterised specification and the instances of the parameters, but also between the parameters of a generic specification. The developments conclude with the examination of the relation between the results of simultaneous and sequential instantiation of parameters, which are shown to be isomorphic under a given set of sufficient abstract conditions.
