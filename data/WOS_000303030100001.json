Design/methodology/approach - Content analysis was applied to 67 unique and independent anti-smoking websites to determine their use of 20 intervention strategies based on the four theories. Findings - The findings reveal that anti-smoking websites used the health belief model the most and social cognitive theory the least. In addition, websites devoted to smoking cessation used these theories more extensively than websites devoted to smoking prevention. Research limitations/implications - The sample size is somewhat small, which may result in lack of sufficient statistical power. Also, the analysis may have overlooked some important intervention strategies that are particularly effective for smoking intervention programs. Practical implications - Anti-smoking website designers should take more advantage of the internet as a health promotion medium and use more intervention strategies that have been informed by scientifically tested theories of behavior change, particularly with respect to affective and behavioral strategies. Originality/value - This study contributes to current knowledge about which kinds of anti-smoking messages are available online and how extensively they employ theory-based intervention strategies.", "paper_title": "Theories into practice: a content analysis of anti-smoking websites", "paper_id": "WOS:000303030100001"}
