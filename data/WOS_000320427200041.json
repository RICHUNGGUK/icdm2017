It is able to simulate the interaction of two fluids like air and water based on a level-set approach. High-order finite difference schemes and Chorin's projection approach for space and time discretization are applied. An in-depth performance analysis shows a realistic speed-up of the order of three by comparing equally priced GPUs and CPUs and more than a doubling in energy efficiency for GPUs. We observe profound strong and weak scaling on two different multi-GPU clusters. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
