Thus we obtain a characterization of the class of regular languages as the weak-code images of the k-hairpin completion of center disjoint k-locally testable languages in the strict sense. This result completes two results from [3] and [11]. Then we investigate some decision problems and closure properties of the family of the iterated hairpin completion of singleton languages. Finally, we discuss some algorithms regarding the possibility of computing the values of k such that the non-iterated or iterated k-hairpin completion of a given regular language does not produce new words.", "paper_title": "SOME REMARKS ON THE HAIRPIN COMPLETION", "paper_id": "WOS:000282583600011"}
