The tool has been evaluated against different training set cases, suggesting that partially defined assembly models and training product variety are critical characteristics. Moreover, the tool is shown to be robust and insensitive to different modeling engineers. The tool has been implemented in a commercial CAD system and shown to yield results of within +/- 25% of predicted values. Additional extensions and experiments are recommended to improve the tool.", "paper_title": "Assembly Time Estimation: Assembly Mate Based Structural Complexity Metric Predictive Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000331145500004"}
