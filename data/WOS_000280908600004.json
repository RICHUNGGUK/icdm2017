However, creating procedural textures is much more difficult. This is unfortunate, since procedural textures have significant advantages over image textures. In this paper we address the problem of texture synthesis by example for procedural textures. We introduce a method for procedural multiresolution noise by example. Our method computes the weights of a procedural multiresolution noise, a simple but common class of procedural textures, from an example. We illustrate this method by using it as a key component in a method for texture synthesis by example for isotropic stochastic procedural textures. Our method significantly facilitates the creation of these procedural textures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
