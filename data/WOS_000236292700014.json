In this paper, this framework is applied with a new supershape implicit function that is based on the notion of radial distance and results are presented on realistic models composed of hundreds of hierarchically globally deformed supershapes. An implicit equation with guaranteed differential properties is obtained by simple combinations of the primitives' implicit representations using R-function theory. The surface corresponding to the zero-set of the implicit equation is efficiently and directly polygonized using the primitives' parametric forms. Moreover, hierarchical global deformations are considered to increase the range of shapes that can be modeled. The potential of the approach is illustrated by representing complex models composed of several hundreds of primitives inspired from CAD models of mechanical parts.", "paper_title": "Radial supershapes for solid modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000236292700014"}
