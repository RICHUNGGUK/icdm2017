In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the notion of algorithmic robustness (previously introduced by Xu and Mannor) that can be used to derive generalization bounds for metric learning. We further show that a weak notion of robustness is in fact a necessary and sufficient condition for a metric learning algorithm to generalize. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed framework, we derive generalization results for a large family of existing metric learning algorithms, including some sparse formulations that are not covered by the previous results.
