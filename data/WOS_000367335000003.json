Here, we propose a behavioral equivalence for feature transition systems (FTS) generalizing branching bisimulation for labeled transition systems (LTS). We prove that branching feature bisimulation for an FTS of a family of products coincides with branching bisimulation for the LTS projection of each the individual products. For a restricted notion of coherent branching feature bisimulation we furthermore present a minimization algorithm and show its correctness. Although the minimization problem for coherent branching feature bisimulation is shown to be intractable, application of the algorithm in the setting of a small case study results in a significant speed-up of model checking of behavioral properties.", "paper_title": "Coherent branching feature bisimulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367335000003"}
