The uncertainties in both local subsystems and their interconnections are considered. Sufficient conditions are presented for the stability of spatially interconnected systems with. guaranteed performance. The condition for the existence of decentralized robust controllers is also proposed. The main advantage is that the resulting decentralized controllers have the cooperative control capability, which is required in many applications of spatially interconnected systems. Another advantage lies in low computation cost, for the conditions are expressed as linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which only contain the parameters of the local subsystem. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "DECENTRALIZED ROBUST CONTROL DESIGN FOR SPATIALLY INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAINTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000018"}
