This scheme is based on the concept of equivalent dipole-moment method (EDM) that views the RaoWiltonGlisson and the SchaubertWiltonGlisson basis functions as dipole models with equivalent dipole moments. In the MLFDM, a simple Taylor's series expansion of the terms R-alpha (alpha = 1, -1, -2, -3) and (R)over-cap(R)over-cap in the formulation of the EDM transforms the interaction between two equivalent dipoles into an aggregationtranslationdisaggregation form naturally. Furthermore, benefiting from the multilevel grouping scheme, the matrix-vector product can be accelerated and the memory cost is reduced remarkably. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of this method. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
