A coupling scheme is introduced, in a general topological structure described by a direct or undirect graph, with a linear diffusive term and a discontinuous sign term. First, a set of sufficient conditions are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theory for ascertaining global robust synchronization of coupled MMNNs. Second, a pinning adaptive coupling method is proposed to ensure global synchronization without knowing the bound of parameter uncertainties. Two illustrative examples are discussed to substantiate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Robust Synchronization of Multiple Memristive Neural Networks With Uncertain Parameters via Nonlinear Coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000358246100008"}
