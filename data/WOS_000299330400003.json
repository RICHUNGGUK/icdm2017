We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of (nontrivial) negacyclic self-dual codes over a finite chain ring. As an application, we construct negacyclic MDR self-dual codes over GR(p (t) , m) of length p (m) + 1.", "paper_title": "Negacyclic self-dual codes over finite chain rings", "paper_id": "WOS:000299330400003"}
