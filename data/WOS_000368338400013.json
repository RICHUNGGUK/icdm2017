Only a few will burst and become trending topics. In this article, we provide the definition of a bursting hashtag and conduct a systematic study of a series of challenging prediction problems that span the entire life cycles of bursting hashtags. Around the problem of how to build a system to predict bursting hashtags, we explore different types of features and present machine learning solutions. On real data sets from Twitter, experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions and the contributions of features.", "paper_title": "Towards the prediction problems of bursting hashtags on Twitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000368338400013"}
