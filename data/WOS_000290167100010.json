We extend linear modal analysis to offer an efficient and robust numerical technique to generate physically-plausible dynamics even for very large deformation. Our method also provides a rich set of intuitive editing tools with real-time feedback, including control over vibration frequencies, amplitudes, and damping of the resulting interpolation sequence. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach through a series of complex dynamic shape interpolations.", "paper_title": "Interactive Shape Interpolation through Controllable Dynamic Deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290167100010"}
