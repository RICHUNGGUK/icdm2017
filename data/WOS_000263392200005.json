This is commonly achieved by introducing a prior which, together with the data constraints, determines a unique and hopefully stable solution. Choosing a \"correct\" prior is however a well-known obstacle. This paper demonstrates that in a certain class of motion estimation problems, the Bayesian technique of integrating out the \"nuisance parameters\" yields stable solutions even if a flat prior on the motion parameters is used. The advantage of the suggested method is more noticeable when the domain points approach a degenerate configuration, and/or when the noise is relatively large with respect to the size of the point configuration.", "paper_title": "A Probabilistic Method for Point Matching in the Presence of Noise and Degeneracy", "paper_id": "WOS:000263392200005"}
