Previous approaches to painterly animation typically emphasize either purely automatic stroke synthesis or purely manual stroke keyframing. Our system supports a spectrum of interaction between these two approaches which allows the user more direct control over stroke synthesis. We introduce an approach for controlling the results of painterly animation: keyframed Control Strokes can affect automatic stroke's placement, orientation, movement, and color. Furthermore, we introduce a new automatic synthesis algorithm that traces strokes through a video sequence in a greedy manner, but, instead of a vector field, uses an objective function to guide placement. This allows the method to capture fine details, respect region boundaries, and achieve greater temporal coherence than previous methods. All editing is performed with a WYSIWYG interface where the user can directly refine the animation. We demonstrate a variety of examples using both automatic and user-guided results, with a variety of styles and source videos.", "paper_title": "AniPaint: Interactive Painterly Animation from Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000299281700012"}
