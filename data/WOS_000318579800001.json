Operational requirements, such as high bandwidth, dependability and smooth manageability, are similar for both types Of clouds and their underlying data center architecture. Such requirements can be satisfied with utilizing fully distributed, low-overhead mechanisms at the algorithm level, and an efficient layer 2 implementation at the practical level. On the other hand, owners of evolving private data centers are in dire need of an incrementally upgradeable architecture which supports a small roll-out and continuous expansion in small quanta. In order to satisfy both requirements, we propose Poincare, a data center architecture inspired by hyperbolic tessellations, which utilizes low-overhead, greedy routing. On one hand, Poincare scales to support large data centers with low diameter, high bisection bandwidth, inherent multipath and multicast capabilities, and efficient error recovery. On the other hand, Poincare supports incremental plug & play upgradability with regard to both servers and switches. We evaluate Poincare using analysis, extensive simulations and a prototype implementation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
