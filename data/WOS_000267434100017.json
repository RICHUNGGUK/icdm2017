Elementary siphons are a novel concept in net theory. Based on graph theory, this paper proposes an effective algorithm with polynomial complexity to find a set of elementary siphons for a linear system of simple sequential processes with resources ((LSPR)-P-3), a subclass of Petri nets, which can model many flexible manufacturing systems. The algorithm is established through the use of a resource directed graph and complementary sets of strict minimal siphons (SMS) of the net. The upper bound of the number of SMS in such a net is identified. A running example is used to demonstrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Effective Algorithm to Find Elementary Siphons in a Class of Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000267434100017"}
