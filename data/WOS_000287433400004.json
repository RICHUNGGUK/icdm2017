In such architectures, middle-tier nodes take important roles, and preventing a malicious node from impersonating a middle-tier node and injecting falsified messages becomes critical. In this paper, we propose an energy efficient, distributed scheme to secure the multicast messages from the middle-tier nodes. Our scheme does not require a priori knowledge about the hierarchical relation between middle-tier nodes and lowest-tier nodes, and is adaptive to changes of this relation. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate our scheme, and the results show that the scheme is energy efficient.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Scheme for Securing Middle-Tier Multicast in Hierarchical Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287433400004"}
