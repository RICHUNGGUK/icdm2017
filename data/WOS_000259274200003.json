A description language for Workflow processes and an automatic transformation of a Workflow into a G-DEVS model have been defined. We then introduce a new distributed Workflow Reference Model with HLA-compliant Workflow components. We detail the HLA objects shared between Workflow federates and present the publishing/subscribing status of each of these federates. Finally, we illustrate the use of this distributed environment with an example of a Microelectronic production Workflow.", "paper_title": "G-DEVS/HLA environment for distributed simulations of workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000259274200003"}
