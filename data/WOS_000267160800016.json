Such graphs are extensively used to model wireless ad-hoc networks, and in particular sensor networks. It is well known that, over a critical value of r, the graph is connected with high probability. In this paper we study the robustness of the connectivity of random geometric graphs in the supercritical phase, under deletion of edges. In particular, we show that, for a sufficiently large r, any cut which separates two components of Theta(n) vertices each contains Omega(n(2)r(3)) edges with high probability. We also present a simple algorithm that, again with high probability, Computes one such cut of size O(n(2)r(3)). From these two results we derive a constant expected approximation algorithm for the beta-balanced cut problem on random geometric graphs: find an edge Cut of minimum size whose two sides contain at least beta n vertices each.
