ABC is adopted to increase the local search capacity as well as the randomness of the populations. In this way, the improved QEA can jump out of the premature convergence and find the optimal value. To show the performance of our proposed hybrid QEA with ABC, a number of experiments are carried out on a set of well-known Benchmark continuous optimization problems and the related results are compared with two other QEAs: the QEA with classical crossover operation, and the QEA with 2-crossover strategy. The experimental comparison results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid ABC and QEA approach is feasible and effective in solving complex continuous optimization problems.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID ARTIFICIAL BEE COLONY OPTIMIZATION AND QUANTUM EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM FOR CONTINUOUS OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274914700005"}
