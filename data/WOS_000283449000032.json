The multiresolution requirement imposes nontrivial constraints on the maximum distortion at each level of the quantizer. To quantify these constraints, we define the overall multiresolution L-infinity distortion of an MRSQ to be a weighted sum of L-infinity distortions over all refinement levels of the MRSQ. We then seek MRSQ constructions that minimize this average-max distortion measure. An interesting relationship between this problem and the structure of Huffman code trees is established. Lower bounds for the average-max distortion are derived based on this relationship. The derivation of these lower bounds also lead to efficient dynamic programming heuristic solutions.", "paper_title": "On L-infinity Properties of Multiresolution Scalar Quantizers", "paper_id": "WOS:000283449000032"}
