In this paper, we analyze burst queue with burst assembler at an edu in Optical Burst-Switched (OBS) networks. It is significant from the fact that most of processing and buffering are concentrated at the edge in OBS networks. Modeling the burst queue in terms of IP packets, we aim to investigate the waiting time in burst queue following burst assembler, the size of which influences the cost of constructing OBS networks. The proposed analytical model is verified through simulation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
