This paper is primarily focused on establishing an architecture based on field theory, using scalar and vector field to describe traffic and mobility, respectively. On the basis of their temporal-spatial evolution, we try to discover the relationship between traffic field and mobility field. This field architecture fits for mobility management in large temporal-spatial scale, since it not only benefits qualitative analysis of traffic and mobility in the perspective of field, but also provides a theoretical foundation and insight for issues in mobile communication.", "paper_title": "Field architecture for traffic and mobility modelling in mobility management", "paper_id": "WOS:000308928000005"}
