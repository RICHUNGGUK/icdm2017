WSNs are vulnerable to a wide class of attacks among which sinkhole attack puts severe threats to the security of such networks. This paper proposes two approaches to detect and mitigate such attack in. WSNs. It provides a centralized approach to detect suspicious regions in the network using geostatistical hazard model. Furthermore, a distributed monitoring approach has been proposed to explore every neighborhood in the network to detect malicious behaviors. Our simulation experiments validate the correctness and efficiency of the proposed approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
