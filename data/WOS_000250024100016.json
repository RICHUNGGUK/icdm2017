Although the issue has been argued long since, there is not a perfect solution to it so far. This paper proposed an innovative approach to successfully addressing such issue by the seamless integration of genetic algorithm (GA) and multi-agent system. In the design phase, a test ontology was firstly defined for smoothing the communication among agents. For the implementation of GA, The fitness function and the structure of chromosome were identified on the basis of the analysis of constraint conditions associated with a test. To demonstrate the task execution flow and messages passing among agents, the activity diagram and sequence diagram were also shown on the AUML basis. In the phase of implementation, the JADE based agent behavior model was described in detail and the implementation platform was also demonstrated. The final simulation results validated the feasibility of the proposed approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
