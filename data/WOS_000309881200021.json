However, most methods for calculating divergence times are limited to datasets that are orders of magnitude smaller than recently published large phylogenies. Here, we present an algorithm and implementation of a divergence time method using penalized likelihood that can handle datasets of thousands of taxa. We implement a method that combines the standard derivative-based optimization with a stochastic simulated annealing approach to overcome optimization challenges. We compare this approach with existing software including r8s, PATHd8 and BEAST.", "paper_title": "treePL: divergence time estimation using penalized likelihood for large phylogenies", "paper_id": "WOS:000309881200021"}
