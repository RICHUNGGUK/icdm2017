Optimization is performed using a small set of simple goals, for example, one hand should be on the ground, or the center-of-mass should be above a particular height. These objectives are applied to short spacetime windows which can be composed to express goals over an entire animation. Specific contact locations needed to achieve objectives are not required by our method. We show that the method can synthesize many different kinds of movement, including walking, hand walking, breakdancing, flips, and crawling. Most of these movements have never been previously synthesized by physics-based methods.", "paper_title": "Trajectory Optimization for Full-Body Movements with Complex Contacts", "paper_id": "WOS:000320658600014"}
