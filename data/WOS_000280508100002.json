Although Voronoi diagrams in the plane have been studied extensively, using different notions of sites and metrics, little is known for other geometric spaces. In this paper, we are interested in the Voronoi diagram of a set of sites in the 3D hyperbolic upper half-space. We first present some introductory results in 3D hyperbolic upper half-space and then give an incremental algorithm to construct Voronoi diagram. Finally, we consider five models of 3D hyperbolic manifolds that are equivalent under isometries. By these isometries we can transform the Voronoi diagram of each model to others.
