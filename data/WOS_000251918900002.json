Concerning a quantitative usage of such data the classical concept of relative frequencies for real data has to be extended to so-called fuzzy relative frequencies for fuzzy data, whereby the fuzzy relative frequency of a set is a fuzzy number. Analogous to A. Dempster's interval-valued probabilities induced by multi-valued mappings fuzzy-valued probabilities induced by fuzzy random vectors are considered and analyzed. It is proved that fuzzy relative frequencies can be interpreted as strongly consistent estimator for the corresponding fuzzy-valued probability. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
