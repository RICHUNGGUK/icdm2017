In MRWPT information such as the types of equipments, the required amount of electrical power, or the timing of power transfer should be exchanged. It is assumed here that power transfer coils in the MRWPT system are employed as antennas for data communication. The frequency characteristics of the antennas change due to coil displacements. The power transfer coils are modeled as a band puss filter (BPF) and the frequency characteristics of the filter are presented in this letter. The characteristics of the filter are derived through circuit simulation and resulting data communication performance is evaluated. Numerical results obtained through computer simulation show that the bit error late (BER) performance can be improved by controlling the center frequency of the communication link.", "paper_title": "Performance of Data Transmission in Wireless Power Transfer with Coil Displacements", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738500016"}
