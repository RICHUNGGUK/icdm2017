Because an uncooled microbolometer image sensor, used in an IR image sensor, is made by a micro electro mechanical systems process, the resistance of bolometer by each process does not appear same value under same temperature condition. This resistance variation generates a different output signal for same input by each chip. In order to improve on these drawbacks, a ROIC, which compensates for the error described above, was designed. Instead of a single input mode, a differential input mode ROIC was proposed and thus, a new circuit structure was proposed. Using results from a computer simulation, improvements such as that the effect of the process error was decreased 10-12% without an additional compensation circuit was found. Based on the simulation results, a prototype device including a ROIC and a micro bolometer with 16 x 16 cell arrays was fabricated and characterized.", "paper_title": "High performance read-out IC design for IR image sensor applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000279214200008"}
