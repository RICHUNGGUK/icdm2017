Some of the different metabolic pathways adopted within organisms have been experimentally determined. In this paper, we show that a number of experimentally determined metabolic pathways can be recovered by a mathematical optimization model.", "paper_title": "Recovering metabolic pathways via optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000243060300014"}
