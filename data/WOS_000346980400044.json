For STBCs, n is the number of antennas, k/p is the rate, and p is the decoding delay. A class of rate 1/2 CODs called balanced complex orthogonal designs (BCODs) has been proposed by Adams et al., who constructed BCODs with rate k/p = 1/2 and decoding delay p = 2(m) for n = 2(m). Furthermore, they proved that the constructions have optimal decoding delay when m is congruent to 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. They conjectured that for the case m = 0 (mod 4), 2(m) is also a lower bound on p. In this paper, we prove this conjecture.", "paper_title": "On the Minimum Decoding Delay of Balanced Complex Orthogonal Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000346980400044"}
