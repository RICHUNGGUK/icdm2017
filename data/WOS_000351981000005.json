To ensure the safety of twin tunnels in close proximity, it is often necessary to take protective measures that have not been well studied. Field monitoring was conducted for a project of twin earth pressure balance shield (EPBS) tunnels in typical soft ground. The preceding tunnel was reinforced by various measures, including trailer bracing, compensation grouting, artificial freezing and scaffold bracing. The entire deformation of the reinforced tunnel was recorded during the succeeding tunnelling process. A three dimensional finite-element method (FEM) model was established to simulate the entire process of twin EPBS tunnelling, particularly the reinforcement measures. The computed deformations of the reinforced tunnel were consistent with the measured data. Furthermore, the stress history and pore pressure of the surrounding soil were analysed to investigate the deformation mechanism of the tunnel. Both the measured and computed results indicate that although the face pressure of the succeeding tunnel was smaller than the earth pressure at rest, the preceding tunnel could still experience an inward horizontal convergence and a deflection away from the succeeding tunnel. These distortion modes were caused by the squeezing effect of the horizontal soil arch in front of the succeeding tunnel face. Finally, convergence and deflection indices were proposed to quantify and assess the effectiveness of the reinforcement measures. The trailer bracing, as an \"in-tunnel\" reinforcement technique, was found to be the most effective method for controlling tunnel convergence. However, artificial freezing as an \"out-tunnel\" reinforcement technique led to the largest reductions in tunnel deflection. A combination of both \"in-tunnel\" and \"out-tunnel\" reinforcements was recommended. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
