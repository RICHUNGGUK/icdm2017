However, due to the ever increasing complexity of SoC designs, the ever longer simulation times affect SoC exploration potential and time-to-market. We investigate the use of parallel computing to exploit the inherent concurrent execution of the hardware components, and thus to speed up the simulation of complex SoC's. A parallel SystemC prototype based on the open source OSCI kernel is introduced and preliminary results are discussed.", "paper_title": "A conservative approach to SystemC parallelization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500089"}
