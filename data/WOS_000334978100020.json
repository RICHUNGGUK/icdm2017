Most transformations are relatively easy to handle when contours are represented by strings. However, starting point invariance is difficult to achieve. One interesting possibility is the use of cyclic strings, which are strings that have no starting and final points. We propose new methodologies to use Hidden Markov Models to classify contours represented by cyclic strings. Experimental results show that our proposals outperform other methods in the literature.
