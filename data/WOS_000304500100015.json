In this work, a feature vector constructed by extracting numerical features from sequences based on hydrophobicity, polarity and charge properties, and a function possibility of sequence are proposed. Then the feature vector and function possibility are used to predict protein function with k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN). Our method avoids some problems of sequence similarity based methods, because it has involved both local and global information of sequences. The results of our experiments show that our method is more efficient.", "paper_title": "A Novel Method for Protein Function Prediction Based on Sequence Numerical Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000304500100015"}
