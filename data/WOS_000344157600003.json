This results in tight coupling between tenants and the landlord, extensive human resource deployment, and long ticket resolution time. We propose Routing-as-a-Service (RaaS), a framework for tenant-directed route control in data centers. We show that RaaS-based implementation provides a route control platform where multiple tenants can perform route control independently with little administrative involvement, and the landlord can set the overall network policies. RaaS-based solutions can run on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and leverage existing technologies, so it can be implemented in existing networks without major infrastructural overhaul. We present the design of RaaS, introduce its components, and evaluate a prototype based on RaaS.", "paper_title": "Routing-as-a-Service (RaaS): A Framework for Tenant-Directed Route Control in Data Center", "paper_id": "WOS:000344157600003"}
