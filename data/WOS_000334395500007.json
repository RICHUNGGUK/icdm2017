Persistence diagrams are signatures capturing meaningful properties of shapes, while the matching distance can be used to stably compare them. From the application viewpoint, one drawback of these tools is the computational cost for evaluating the matching distance. In this paper we introduce a new framework for the matching distance estimation: It preserves the reliability of the entire approach in comparing shapes, extremely reducing the computational cost.
