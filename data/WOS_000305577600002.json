Despite its ill-posed nature, this problem can often be solved in a unique and stable manner, provided appropriate assumptions on the nature of the images to be recovered. In this paper, however, a more challenging setting is considered, in which accurate knowledge of the blurring operator is lacking, thereby transforming the reconstruction problem at hand into a problem of blind deconvolution. As a specific application, the current presentation focuses on reconstruction of short-exposure optical images measured through atmospheric turbulence. The latter is known to give rise to random aberrations in the optical wavefront, which are in turn translated into random variations of the point spread function of the optical system in use. A standard way to track such variations involves using adaptive optics. Thus, for example, the Shack-Hartmann interferometer provides measurements of the optical wavefront through sensing its partial derivatives. In such a case, the accuracy of wavefront reconstruction is proportional to the number of lenslets used by the interferometer and, hence, to its complexity. Accordingly, in this paper, we show how to minimize the above complexity through reducing the number of the lenslets while compensating for undersampling artifacts by means of derivative compressed sensing. Additionally, we provide empirical proof that the above simplification and its associated solution scheme result in image reconstructions, whose quality is comparable to the reconstructions obtained using conventional ( dense) measurements of the optical wavefront.", "paper_title": "Image Deblurring Using Derivative Compressed Sensing for Optical Imaging Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000305577600002"}
