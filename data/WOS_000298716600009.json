The design and construction of a multi purpose and WBEP for the application of liquid flow control, liquid filling level control, liquid flow-filling control (MIMO) and robot arm control for control engineering education is the main purpose of this study. The experiment platform designed and constructed consists of three main stations: liquid flow station, liquid filling station and a 5 DOF robot arm. The platform provides monitoring, real-time control and programming of each station for experimental studies and, it allows to users conduct these studies through a standard web browser without any additional supporting or supplementary software.", "paper_title": "DEVELOPMENT OF A WEB-BASED CONTROL AND ROBOTIC APPLICATIONS LABORATORY FOR CONTROL ENGINEERING EDUCATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000298716600009"}
