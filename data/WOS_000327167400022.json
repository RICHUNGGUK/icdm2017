Based on the boundary constraint, we propose a novel algorithm to make the \"mutual coherence\" approach a lower bound. This algorithm is implemented by using an iterative strategy. In each iteration, a neighborhood interval of the maximal off-diagonal entry in the Gram matrix is scaled down with the same shrinkage factor, and then a lower mutual coherence between the measurement matrix and sparsifying matrix is obtained. After many iterations, the magnitudes of most of off-diagonal entries approach the lower bound. The proposed optimization algorithm demonstrates better performance compared with other typical optimization methods, such as t-averaged mutual coherence. In addition, the effectiveness of CS can be used for the compression of complex synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is verified, and experimental results using simulated data and real field data corroborate this claim.", "paper_title": "A Novel CS Model and Its Application in Complex SAR Image Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400022"}
