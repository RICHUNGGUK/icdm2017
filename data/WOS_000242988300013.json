Although inter-domain provisioning has been well studied for packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength dimension presents many additional challenges. To address this challenge, a detailed hierarchical routing GMPLS-based framework for provisioning all-optical and opto-electronic multi-domain DWDM networks is presented. The scheme adapts various topology abstraction schemes to improve routing scalability and lower inter-domain blocking probabilities. Related inter-domain lightpath RWA and signaling schemes are also tabled. Performance analysis results are also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms along with directions for future research work. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
