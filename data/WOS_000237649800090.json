Using the agreement relation defined in this paper between request specifics and component specifics can automatically search appropriate component by calling request specifics file without user's direct inquiry information. To improve trade off between Recall and Precision has abstracted by using component glossary which has a Lexical Chain addition. A plan has been presented that decrease development term and cost and also maximizes reusability, the strength of component system, by applying candidate component which was extracted at the beginning of system development.", "paper_title": "Components searching system using component identifiers and request specifics", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800090"}
