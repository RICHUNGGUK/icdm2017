Using semantic Web Services in service oriented architectures improves interoperability and scalability, A very important aspect of using semantic Web Services is the matchmaking process. Semantic matchmaking is used during discovery and composition of semantic Web Services to find valuable service candidates. Among these candidates, best ones are chosen to build up the composition, or for substitution in the case of an execution failure. Our proposed matchmaker architecture performs semantic matching of Web Services on the basis of input and output descriptions of semantic Web Services as well as precondition and effect matching. We present a novel approach for assigning matchmaking scores to condition expressions in OWL-S documents written in SWRL during matchmaking. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
