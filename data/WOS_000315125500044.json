Noya, C. Vega, C. McBride, J. Chem. Phys. 134 (2011) 054117] for a given value of PT and A, B and C, where P is the number of beads, T is the temperature, and A, B and C are the rotational constants for the system in question. The resulting NVM propagator calculated by the code provided can then be used to obtain the quantum rotational energy during a path integral Monte Carlo simulation of rigid bodies.
