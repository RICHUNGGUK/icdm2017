Equally pertinent to the domain of digital forensics, this imperative entails a research commitment in comparing and contrasting the respective codes of ethics to illustrate their variety, specificity and enforceability to inform the discussion on the associated regulative aspects. Accordingly, this paper reviews the professional regulation inaugurated in both the US and international digital forensics arena giving a detailed perspective on the consolidation of the practice.", "paper_title": "RULES OF PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN DIGITAL FORENSICS - A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000363876200003"}
