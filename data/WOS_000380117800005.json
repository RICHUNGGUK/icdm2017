We compute thresholds for the dimension of the system being traced out, so that the resulting bipartite quantum state satisfies the reduction criterion in different asymptotic regimes. We consider as well the basis-independent version of the reduction criterion (the absolute reduction criterion), computing thresholds for the corresponding eigenvalue sets. We do the same for other sets relevant in the study of absolute separability, using techniques from random matrix theory. Finally, we gather and compare the known values for the thresholds corresponding to different entanglement criteria, and conclude with a list of open questions.", "paper_title": "THRESHOLDS FOR REDUCTION-RELATED ENTANGLEMENT CRITERIA IN QUANTUM INFORMATION THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000380117800005"}
