This can be used in extreme environments such as mines, hostile areas, and other places where static nodes cannot be deployed directly. Design/methodology/approach - The distance between robot and beacon nodes is estimated by received signal strength indicator (RSSI). The adaptive Kalman filter algorithm is used to eliminate noise from the RSSI signal. Then, the paper gets the mobile robot's status information which includes position, velocity, and acceleration. In order to improve the real-time performance of systems and reduce the computation overhead of robot's CPU, the paper chooses a beacon node by some certain rules to implement the localization program. The robot and beacon nodes use the CC2430 as the communication and data-processing unit. Findings - The experiment shows it has the characteristics of good position precision, is easily realized, and inexpensive. Research limitations/implications - That the system needs so many beacon nodes, is the main limitation. Practical implications - A very useful and low-cost method for mobile robot localization and navigation. Originality/value - The innovative aspect of the paper is that it attempts an analysis of the localization system based on WSN, by attempting to analyze and explain the model of localization system which includes robot and beacon nodes.", "paper_title": "Localization and tracking algorithm for mobile robot based on wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000280732800022"}
