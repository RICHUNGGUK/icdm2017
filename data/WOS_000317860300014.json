A nonlinear hash function is introduced to capture the underlying relationship among data points. Thus, the dimensionality of the matrix for computation is not only independent from the dimensionality of the original data space but also much smaller than the one using linear hash function. To effectively deal with the error accumulated during converting the real-value embeddings into the binary code after relaxation, we propose a semi-supervised nonlinear hashing algorithm using bootstrap sequential projection learning which effectively corrects the errors by taking into account of all the previous learned bits holistically without incurring the extra computational overhead. Experimental results on the six benchmark data sets demonstrate that the presented method outperforms the state-of-the-art hashing algorithms at a large margin.", "paper_title": "Semi-Supervised Nonlinear Hashing Using Bootstrap Sequential Projection Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000317860300014"}
