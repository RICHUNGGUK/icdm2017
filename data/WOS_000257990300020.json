The proposed approach reduces the constrained optimization problem to an unconstrained optimization problem by appropriate variable transformation. Furthermore, restricting ourselves to the case of second-order state-space digital filters, we can express the L-2-sensitivity by a simple linear combination of exponential functions and formulate the L-2-sensitivity minimization problem by a simple polynomial equation. As a result, L-2-sensitivity is expressed in closed form, and its minimization subject to L-2-scaling constraints is achieved without iterative calculations.", "paper_title": "A closed form solution to L-2-sensitivity minimization of second-order state-space digital filters subject to L-2-scaling constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300020"}
