We assume that job processing times are position-dependent. The objective functions considered are minimum makespan, minimum total completion time and minimum number of tardy jobs. All these problems are known to be NP-hard even without position-dependent processing times. For all three cases we introduce simple heuristics which are based on solving the classical assignment problem. Lower bounds, worst case analysis and asymptotic optimality are discussed. All heuristics are shown numerically to perform extremely well. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
