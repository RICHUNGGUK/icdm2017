The numerical simulations of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability confirm the capability of Lee's method to reproduce literature results obtained with previous Lattice-Boltzmann models for non-ideal fluids. Simulations of two-dimensional droplet breakup reproduce the qualitative regimes observed in three-dimensional simulations, with mild quantitative deviations. Finally, the simulation of droplet coalescence highlights major departures from the three-dimensional picture.", "paper_title": "APPLICATIONS OF FINITE-DIFFERENCE LATTICE BOLTZMANN METHOD TO BREAKUP AND COALESCENCE IN MULTIPHASE FLOWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272468000008"}
