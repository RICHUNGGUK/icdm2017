It is based on centralized data envelopment analysis (DEA) and uses a weighted, slacks-based, nonradial metric. The approach is units-invariant and takes into account the inefficients in the assessed decision making units (DMUs). The approach works when the fixed cost is a complement of another input as well as when no other inputs exist. The proposed approach is compared with existing allocation methods using several datasets from the literature.", "paper_title": "NONRADIAL APPROACH TO ALLOCATING FIXED-COSTS AND COMMON REVENUE USING CENTRALIZED DEA", "paper_id": "WOS:000330586100003"}
