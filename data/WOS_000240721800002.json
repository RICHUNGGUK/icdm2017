The approach involved estimating the solution to a least squares problem by means of a number of smaller least squares approximations on local portions of the data. In this work we use a result by Dahlquist, et al. on the method of averages to make observational comparisons between this local least squares estimation and full least squares approximation. We have explored examples in two problem domains: data reduction and data approximation. We observe that, particularly for design matrices with a repetitive pattern of column entries, the least squares solution is often well estimated by local least squares, that the estimation rapidly improves with the size of the local least squares problems, and that the quality of the estimate is largely independent of the size of the full problem.", "paper_title": "Some observations on local least squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000240721800002"}
