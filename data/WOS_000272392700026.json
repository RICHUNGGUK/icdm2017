Unlike previous work, which considered the discrepancy and common property separately among all categories, Our approach combines universal topics from all categories with specific topics from each category. As a result, the model is implemented to produce a few but specific topics and more generic topics among categories, and each category is represented in a different topics simplex, which correlates well with human scene understanding. We investigate the classification performance with variable scene category tasks. The experiments have shown Our model outperforms latent-space methods with less training data.", "paper_title": "Natural Scene Classification Based on Integrated Topic Simplex", "paper_id": "WOS:000272392700026"}
