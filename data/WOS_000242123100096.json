The Web offers a huge amount of valuable information, but its interaction is very hard and time consuming for humans because it requires to filter, analyse all related web pages and integrate it in a knowledge repository. This paper describes an integrated agent-based ontology-driven approach to retrieve web pages that contain data relevant to each of the main concepts of the domain of interest in a completely automatic, unsupervised and domain independent way.", "paper_title": "Integrated agent-based approach for ontology-driven web filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100096"}
