We motivate the methodology using a real data chemical engineering example and show that a variety of restrictive constraints from earlier analyses do not address the problem of interpretability. Our proposed method estimates parameters using a smoothing-based relaxation of the model to enforce interpretability of the observed and unobserved system states.
