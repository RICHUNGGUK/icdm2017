Again, backup of the resource is also an important concern of the scatter. So far, most of the password authentication schemes are designed for single-server environments, users who want to access different remote servers need to register many times and keep many accounts and passwords. To solve this problem, we propose a more efficient version for multi-server architecture. In particular, the new method employs a time-bound mechanism such that the remote system can effectively conduct the valid access period for each legitimate user.", "paper_title": "TIME-BOUND BASED AUTHENTICATION SCHEME FOR MULTI-SERVER ARCHITECTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000260923100020"}
