It develops a modelling method for the dynamic response of the large flexible structure of the QCC boom under a moving trolley. By using FEM the original structure of the whole crane structure is reduced to an equivalent model of the boom. The boom is in this way modelled as a system with distributed parameters, comprising reduced stiffnesses and lumped masses from other parts of the upper structure. The article looks at the moving mass approach to achieve the desired performance of the QCC. Differential equations of the mathematical model are obtained by using Lagrange's equations and the assumed mode method. The continuum is discretized by a finite number of admissible functions. Deterministic simulation gives the dynamic response of the boom for quay-to-ship container transfer. Results are obtained for the boom deflection and bending moment values, as well as for the dynamic amplification factor of deflection.", "paper_title": "Modelling of dynamic interaction between structure and trolley for mega container cranes", "paper_id": "WOS:000266248600005"}
