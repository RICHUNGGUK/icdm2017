A special risk decision-making problem with dynamic and risky characteristics needs to be considered in work system which involves many complex factors in safety risks and control measurements. Furthermore, taking into account the inherent imprecision and uncertainty of the available data, a method based on Fuzzy Fault Tree Analysis (FFTA) is proposed to solve the problem. Unlike conventional fuzzy fault tree analysis, the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process is applied to eliminate ambiguity and subjectivity in determining the weights of criteria. Furthermore, a more simple and effective method for ranking fuzzy numbers is introduced to determine the relationships among the fuzzy results. Based on these methods, a hybrid approach is proposed for risk decision-making in accident emergency response of work system. Finally, a case study on the accident of crane hitting the high bent is given to demonstrate the proposed the validity and objectivity of the method. Compared with other available methods in the literature, the results reported here suggest that the hybrid method is more reasonable under the conditions of limited decision data and possible evolvement of emergency states.", "paper_title": "A hybrid fuzzy FTA-AHP method for risk decision-making in accident emergency response of work system", "paper_id": "WOS:000364407900012"}
