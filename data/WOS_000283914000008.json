It possesses many features in common with finite element methods (FEM) but takes some inspiration from Computer Aided Design tools. We illustrate how quasi-interpolation methods can be suitably used to set Dirichlet boundary conditions in isogeometric analysis. In particular, we focus on quasi-interpolant projectors for generalized B-splines, which have been recently proposed as a possible alternative to NURBS in isogeometric analysis.
