In this article we outline a common scenario, currently arising standards, and other emerging technologies having a direct impact on network architecture. In particular we introduce a novel network architecture based on an M2M Gateway and discuss it in relation to smart building applications. The proposed network architecture will improve services for users and will offer new opportunities for both service providers and network operators.", "paper_title": "A NETWORK ARCHITECTURE SOLUTION FOR EFFICIENT IOT WSN BACKHAULING: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629400016"}
