A larger family of LCZ/ZCZ sequence sets with longer period are generated by these constructions, which are more flexible among the selection of the alphabet size, the period of the sequences and the length of LCZ/ZCZ, compared with those generated by the known constructions. Especially, two families of the newly constructed sequences can achieve or almost achieve the theoretic bound.", "paper_title": "New General Constructions of LCZ Sequence Sets Based on Interleaving Technique and Affine Transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342800011"}
