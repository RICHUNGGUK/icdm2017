We have already presented in (Touati and Eisenbeis, Parallel Process. Lett. 14(2):287-313, 2004) a theoretical framework that allows an optimal optimisation of periodic storage requirement in a cyclic schedule. Since our optimisation problem is NP-hard (Touati, PhD thesis, 2002), solving an exact integer linear programming formulation is too expensive in practice. In this article, we propose an efficient two-steps heuristic using model's properties that allows fast computation times while providing highly satisfactory results. This method includes the solution of an integer linear program with a totally unimodular constraints matrix in first step, then the solution of a linear assignment problem. Our heuristic is implemented for an industrial compiler for embedded VLIW processors.", "paper_title": "SIRALINA: efficient two-steps heuristic for storage optimisation in single period task scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200023"}
