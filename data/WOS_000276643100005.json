This study deals with weaknesses of the current video inpainting techniques, when an object is totally damaged, and a framework for video inpainting is proposed. Using this framework, the moving object is separated from the background. A large mosaic image is constructed using the moving object and then a patch-based method with large patches is used to fill holes. In each frame, the inpainted foreground is obtained by placing the object in its location. Missing areas of the stationary background are also filled separately and the final video is produced by composing the inpainted background and object frames. Results for three video sequences with an occluded object show that this approach represents the object in the missing region better than other approaches.", "paper_title": "Exemplar-based video inpainting with large patches", "paper_id": "WOS:000276643100005"}
