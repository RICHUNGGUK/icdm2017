We consider a general network model where the CR users can utilize spectrum sensing and channel switching to determine the status of a channel and use a restoration process when a link failure occurs. We first classify the reliability metrics in CR networks based on the perspective and severity of the failures. We then derive analytical relations for the mean time to failure (MTTF) and mean time to repair (MTTR) of the CR users. With the proposed USA channel restoration scheme, we show that the MTTF between hard failures, where a user cannot communicate for a long interval, increases exponentially with the number of channels available to the CR users. When a failure occurs, the MTTR also decreases exponentially with the number of channels, thereby providing a highly robust communication environment. Finally, we provide design guidelines that can be used to evaluate the tradeoffs between the number of users and channels versus the required reliability. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
