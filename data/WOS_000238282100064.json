Facing this situation, to exploit RAID I/O performance fully, this paper proposes a new algorithm PMSH (Placement and Migration based on Stripe unit Heat) for RAID stripe unit data to be placed optically and migrated dynamically. Based on the heat of RAID stripe unit, PMSH keeps migrating the frequently accessed stripe unit to the disk zone with higher data transfer rate to optimize the location of data in RAID disks and make the data distribution adapt to the evolution of file access pattern dynamically as well. Simulation results demonstrate significant RAID I/O performance improvement using PMSH.", "paper_title": "Data migration in RAID based on stripe unit heat", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100064"}
