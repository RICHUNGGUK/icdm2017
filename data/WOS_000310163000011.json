The conditional diagnosability, which is more general than the classical diagnosability, is to measure the diagnosability of a multiprocessor system under the assumption that all of the neighbors of any node in the system cannot fail at the same time. This study shows that the conditional diagnosability for k-ary n-cubes under the PMC model is 8n-7 for k >= 4 and n >= 4.", "paper_title": "Conditional Diagnosability of k-Ary n-Cubes under the PMC Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000310163000011"}
