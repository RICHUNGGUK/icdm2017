To tackle this challenge, a central pattern generator (CPG)-based locomotion control methodology is proposed, integrated with a contact force feedback function. In this approach, multiple gaits are produced by the CPG module. After passing through a post-processing circuit and a delay-line, the control signal is fed into six trajectory generators to generate predefined feet trajectories for the six legs. Then, force feedback is employed to adjust these trajectories so as to adapt the robot to rough terrains. Finally the regulated trajectories are sent to inverse kinematics modules such that the position control instructions are generated to control the actuators. In both simulations and real robot experiments, we consistently show that the robot can perform sophisticated walking patterns. What is more, the robot can use the force feedback mechanism to deal with the irregularity in rough terrain. With this mechanism, the stability and adaptability of the robot are enhanced. In conclusion, the CPG-base control is an effective approach for legged robots and the force feedback approach is able to improve walking ability of the robots, especially when they walk on irregular terrains.", "paper_title": "An adaptive locomotion controller for a hexapod robot: CPG, kinematics and force feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700005"}
