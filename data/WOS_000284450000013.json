Specifically, there is a constant eta > 0 such that for any zeta > n(-eta), our algorithm extracts m = (delta - zeta)n bits that are exponentially close to uniform (in variation distance) from space s sources with min-entropy delta n, where s =Omega(zeta(3)n). Previously, nothing was known for delta <= 1/2, even for space 0. Our results are obtained by a reduction to the class of total-entropy independent sources. This model generalizes both the well-studied models of independent sources and symbol-fixing sources. These sources consist of a set of r independent smaller sources over {0, 1}(l), where the total min-entropy over all the smaller sources is k. We give deterministic extractors for such sources when k is as small as polylog(r), for small enough l. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
