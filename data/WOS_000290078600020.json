Mathematically, they can all be unified into a graph embedding framework with different construction criteria. However, such learning algorithms are limited by the curse-of-dimensionality if the original data lie on the high-dimensional manifold. Different from the existing algorithms, we consider the discriminant embedding as a kernel analysis approach in the sample space, and a kernel-view based discriminant method is proposed for the embedded feature extraction, where both PCA preprocessing and the pruning of data can be avoided. Extensive experiments on the high-dimensional data sets show the robustness and outstanding performance of our proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
