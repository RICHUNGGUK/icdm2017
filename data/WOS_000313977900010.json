SIMO-OFDM systems have been widely used in wireless communications. Compared to those approaches using training sequences, blind channel estimation methods for SIMO-OFDM systems have the advantage of saving bandwidth and improving energy efficiency and system throughput. As far as blind channel identification is concerned, it is known that zero padding (ZP)-based single-input single-output (SISO)-OFDM systems have desirable features compared to conventional cyclic prefix (CP)-based SISO-OFDM systems. However, it is yet unknown whether ZP- or CP-based SIMO-OFDM systems are favourable for blind channel estimation. To investigate this problem, we first propose a short-data effective method for blind channel estimation for ZP-based SIMO-OFDM systems. Then we analyse a number of issues surrounding blind channel estimation for ZP- and CP-based SIMO-OFDM systems. The issues brought up in the paper have not been discussed in the existing research. The significance of our investigation is that it provides a deep insight into blind channel estimation for ZP- and CP-based SIMO-OFDM systems.
