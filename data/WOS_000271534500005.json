The Hybrid Controlled Channel Access (HCCA) has been proposed as the mechanism to provide the means for guaranteed QoS in networks controlled by a single Access Point (AP). Moreover, scheduling algorithms have been developed allowing efficient scheduling of Variable Bit Rate (VBR) traffic flows. However, little research may be found regarding the problem of applying HCCA on networks with multiple APs. In this paper, various VBR scheduling mechanisms and methods for multi-AP HCCA are presented and evaluated. In addition, this paper introduces the Dynamic Parallel Scheduler (DPS), a novel HCCA scheduling algorithm for VBR traffic among multiple APs that takes advantage of the rate variability and spatial reuse. DPS's performance evaluation shows that the proposed scheme achieves improved performance in terms of delay, throughput and packet loss.", "paper_title": "DPS: An Architecture for VBR Scheduling in IEEE 802.11e HCCA Networks with Multiple Access Points", "paper_id": "WOS:000271534500005"}
