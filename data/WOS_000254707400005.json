These results are applied to the Walsch transforms of the Gold and Kasami-Welch functions. We prove that the Gold functions yield bent functions when restricted to certain hyperplanes. We also use the sign information to determine the dual bent function.", "paper_title": "Gold and Kasami-Welch functions, quadratic forms, and bent functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000254707400005"}
