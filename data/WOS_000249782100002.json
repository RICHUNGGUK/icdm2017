This model includes a spatial extension allowing spatiality in levels, hierarchies, fact relationships, and measures. In this way decision-making users can represent in an abstract manner their analysis needs without considering complex implementation issues and spatial OLAP tools developers can have a common vision for representing spatial data in a multidimensional model. In this paper we propose the transformation of a conceptual schema based on the MultiDimER constructs to an object-relational schema. We based our mapping on the SQL:2003 and SQL/MM standards giving examples of commercial implementation using Oracle 10g with its spatial extension. Further we use spatial integrity constraints to ensure the semantic equivalence of the conceptual and logical schemas. We also show some examples of Oracle spatial functions, including aggregation functions required for the manipulation of spatial data. The described mappings to the object-relational model along with the examples using a commercial system show the feasibility of implementing spatial DWs in current commercial DBMSs. Further, using integrated architectures, where spatial and thematic data is defined within the same DBMS, facilitates the system management simplifying data definition and manipulation.", "paper_title": "Logical representation of a conceptual model for spatial data warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000249782100002"}
