In particular, rather than considering mutation parameters as global environmental features, we regard them as endogenous features of the individuals by putting them directly in the genotype. In this way we let the optimal values emerge from the evolutionary process itself. As case study, we apply the proposed methodology to the training of feed-forward neural netwoks on nine classification benchmarks and compare it to other five well established techniques. Results show the effectiveness of the proposed appraoch to get very promising results passing over the boring task of off-line optimal parameters tuning.", "paper_title": "Evolving feed-forward neural networks through evolutionary mutation parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900067"}
