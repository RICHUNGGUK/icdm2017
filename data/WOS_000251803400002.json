Moreover, we propose a precise framework for this amalgamation. In a sense, we utilize the best of both worlds: (I) the use of higher order derivatives through a variant of the Chambolle-Lions inf convolution energy (an image decomposition model in itself) along with (II) approximations to Meyer's G and E norms including the H-1 negative norm for ameliorating staircasing in image decomposition and restoration problems.
