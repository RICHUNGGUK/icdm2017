However, the use of these techniques often results in difficulty distinguishing between benign and malignant growth due to the ambiguous nature of some of the morphological features observed. In order to improve this situation, public domain gene expression data has been analysed and a set of molecular gene expression signatures has been discovered that distinguishes between normal and malignant growth. In addition, a separate distinct gene expression signature has been identified that appears to aid in the prognosis and indicate survival rates of patients. It is proposed that the use of the molecular gene expression signatures described in this manuscript when used in conjunction with the traditional histological techniques already in clinical practice will enhance and improve the diagnosis of gastric cancer.
