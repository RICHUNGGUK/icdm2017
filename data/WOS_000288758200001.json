It is known that it suffices to prove this conjecture for (4p + 1)-regular, 4p-edge connected graphs. Here we show that there exists a finite p(0) such that for every p > p(0) the assertion of the conjecture holds for all (4p + 1)-regular graphs that satisfy some mild quasi-random properties, namely, the absolute value of each of their non-trivial eigenvalues is at most c(1)p(2/3) and the neighbourhood of each vertex contains at most c(2)p(3/2) edges, where c(1), c(2) > 0 are two absolute constants. In particular, this implies that for p > p(0) the assertion of the conjecture holds asymptotically almost surely for random (4p + 1)-regular graphs.", "paper_title": "Modular Orientations of Random and Quasi-Random Regular Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000288758200001"}
