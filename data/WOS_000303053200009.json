The constituent materials are supposed to lack in general of centro-symmetry, which means that force stresses and microcurvatures are coupled, and so are couple stresses and micropolar strains. The maximum global stiffness is taken as objective function. According to the SIMP model, the constitutive tensors are assumed to be smooth functions of the design variable, that is, the material density. Optimal material distributions are obtained for several significant three-dimensional cases. The differences respect to the optimal configurations obtained with classical Cauchy materials and centrosymmetric materials are pointed out. The influence of the constants defining the non-centrosymmetric behaviour on the optimal configurations is discussed.", "paper_title": "Topology optimization of three-dimensional non-centrosymmetric micropolar bodies", "paper_id": "WOS:000303053200009"}
