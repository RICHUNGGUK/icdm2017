In this paper, a computationally effective algorithm of combining PSO with AIS for solving the minimum makespan problem of job-shop scheduling is proposed. In the particle swarm system, a novel concept for the distance and velocity of a particle is presented to pave the way for the job-shop scheduling problem. In the artificial immune system, the models of vaccination and receptor editing are designed to improve the immune performance. The proposed algorithm effectively exploits the capabilities of distributed and parallel computing of swarm intelligence approaches. The algorithm is examined by using a set of benchmark instances with various sizes and levels of hardness and is compared with other approaches reported in some existing literature works. The computational results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "An effective PSO and AIS-based hybrid intelligent algorithm for job-shop scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000253601900009"}
