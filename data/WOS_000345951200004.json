To explore the formalism's potential contribution to these applications, we need to investigate the definition of moving gases, liquids, rigid bodies, and deformable solids. Here, we show how to use Cell-DEVS to analyze the movement and interactions of fluids using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We describe a set of rules that produce the same patterns as traditional CFD implementations. We present the inner workings of the CFD algorithm, the incorporation of solid barriers, and the adoption of variable time steps within the context of biomechanical simulations.
