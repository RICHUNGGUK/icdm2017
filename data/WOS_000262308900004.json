Our structure is an axis-aligned bounding-box hierarchy and as such it is the first cache-oblivious R-tree with provable performance guarantees. If no point in the plane is contained in more than a constant number of rectangles in S, we can construct, for any constant e, a structure that answers a rectangle query using O(root N/B + T/B) memory transfers and a point query using O((N/B)(epsilon)) memory transfers, where T is the number of reported rectangles and B is the block size of memory transfers between any two levels of a multilevel memory hierarchy. We also develop a variant of our structure that achieves the same performance on input sets with arbitrary overlap among the rectangles. The rectangle query bound matches the bound of the best known linear-space cache-aware structure.", "paper_title": "Cache-Oblivious R-Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000262308900004"}
