This research work therefore presents a hybrid service composition mechanism coupling logic-based and syntactic matchmaking of services and messages to transform a business process into an executable workflow. To meet the business requirements, this mechanism is based on both top-down and bottom-up approaches using available technical services and a generic semantic profile as pivot model. Whereas the service matchmaking focuses on the functional coverage of the generated workflow, the messageone generates the message transformation needed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
