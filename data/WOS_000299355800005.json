The aim of the study was to compare clay psychomotor performances of people suffering from sleep disorders and a control group of healthy people, and to test the hypothesis that a short, 15 minute long sleep causes more important sleep inertia at 3 p.m. than at 1 p.m. Sleepiness was objectively evaluated on a group of 35 tested probands, consisting of 29 patients (13 women and 16 men) with given excessive daytime sleepiness accompanying sleep disorder, and of a control group of 6 healthy subjects, with help of Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) and subjectively with help of Alertness Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). Psychomotor performance was examined by Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT). We found out an Unimportant difference in the intensity of sleep inertia after a sleep at 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. We proved significant prolongation of a reaction time and an increase in number of lapses on the group with pathologically shortened sleep latency in IVISLT compared to the group with the normal sleep latency. Our work also shows the difference between the subjective and objective evaluation of sleepiness of subjects. Our results show that the prolonged reaction time and increase in number of lapses of the patient group are significant in all PVT examinations compared to the control group. Further, it is obvious that the PVT test is a more sensitive method for judging psychomotor performance and indirectly for judging sleepiness than the MSLT. These facts seem to be important especially from the two following reasons: 1. They can be a help for recommendation of improved regime for driver relaxation. 2. They can help in search for deeper understanding of mechanisms of attention decreases.", "paper_title": "THE INFLUENCE OF A SHORT DAYTIME NAP AND THE INFLUENCE OF ITS TIMING ON PSYCHOMOTOR EFFICIENCY", "paper_id": "WOS:000299355800005"}
