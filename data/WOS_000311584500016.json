Magic Learning enables each student to be in a multimedia virtual world in which he/she is a magician. The magician has to find several educational challenges (such as questions, crosswords, or reading contents) that are in the magic world and, depending on his/her performance, can then obtain various magic powers (such as invisibility, different types of attacks, or robbing colleagues' notes). The student can apply these powers against monsters, other players or himself/herself. As a result, students will experience more enjoyment while they are learning, so we can expect student learning and motivation to improve. The MagicLearning system also generates adaptive notes for each student related to the specific student interactions, meaning that the better notes a student produces, the better their performance in the game will be.", "paper_title": "MAGICLEARNING: A SERIOUS GAME FOR LEARNING BASED IN A MAGIC WORLD", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500016"}
