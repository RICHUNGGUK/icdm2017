To learn the sizes and orientations of ellipsoids, an algorithm called evolutionary ellipsoidal classification algorithm (EECA) that integrates the genetic algorithm (GA) with the Gustafson-Kessel algorithm (GKA) is proposed. Within EECA the GA is employed to learn the size of every ellipsoid. With the size of every ellipsoid encoded and intelligently estimated in the GA chromosome, GKA is utilized to learn the corresponding ellipsoid. GKA is able to adapt the distance norm to the underlying distribution of the prototype data points for an assigned ellipsoid size. A process called directed initialization is proposed to improve EECA's learning efficiency. Because EECA learns the data point distribution in every cluster by adjusting an ellipsoid with suitable size and orientation, the information contained in the ellipsoid is further utilized to improve the cluster validity. A cluster validity measure based on the ratio of summation for each intra-cluster scatter with respect to the inter-cluster separation is defined in this paper. The proposed cluster validity measure takes advantage of EECA's learning capability and serves as an effective index for determining the adequate number of ellipsoids required for classification.", "paper_title": "LEARNING DECISION REGIONS BASED ON ADAPTIVE ELLIPSOIDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332729900003"}
