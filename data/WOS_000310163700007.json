This implies that Gcontains an edge-cut of size at least 1.33008n, where nis the number of vertices of G, and has fractional cut covering number at most 1.127752. The lower bound on the size of maximum edge-cut also applies to random cubic graphs. Specifically, a random n-vertex cubic graph a.a.s. contains an edge-cut of size 1.33008n- o(n).
