When the unperturbed system has a limit cycle, we give a condition for its persistence; when the unperturbed system has an annulus of periodic orbits, we derive an expression of the first order Melnikov function which can be used to study the number of limit cycles bifurcated from the annulus. As an application, we construct a piecewise cubic system with 4 limit cycles bifurcated from the periodic annulus. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
