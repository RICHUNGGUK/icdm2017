The specification mandates that packets delivered between an MS and a PDG should be protected by IPsec. This article studies IPsec-based VoIP performance (in terms of throughput, packet loss rate, latency, and jitter) in the 3G-WLAN integration environment. The study is designed to provide guidelines for selecting appropriate system parameter values for VoIP over WLAN.", "paper_title": "IPsec-Based VoIP Performance in WLAN Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000260722800011"}
