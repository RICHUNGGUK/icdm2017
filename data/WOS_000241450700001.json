The paper describes the key elements of design methods for component based software product lines, which promote reuse, variability management, and evolution. Approaches for executable models and performance analysis of concurrent and real-time design are discussed. Finally, some outstanding challenges are outlined, in particular the design of evolutionary and dynamically reconfigurable software architectures.", "paper_title": "A software modeling odyssey: Designing evolutionary architecture-centric real-time systems and product lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700001"}
