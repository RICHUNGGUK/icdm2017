The proposed scheme consists of two components: measurement process and admission decision. The measurement process applies a linear Kalman filter to estimate statistical parameters of aggregate VBR video traffic. The estimated statistical parameters are used to calculate the effective bandwidth for admission decision. Variable bit rate (VBR) video traffic with high data rate is expected to occupy a dominant proportion of bandwidth for future wireless broadband home networks. To guarantee quality-of-service (QoS) of such VBR video streams, while achieving a high level of channel utilization, an efficient admission control scheme is urgently required, especially for emerging wireless multimedia indoor services, such as HDTV, online video game, etc. The proposed scheme is computationally efficient and accurate without much prior traffic information. Simulation results verify its effectiveness and show that it performs well for both a small number of connections and a large number of connections.", "paper_title": "An admission control scheme based on online measurement for VBR video streams over wireless home networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258767100015"}
