In order to discover useful knowledge, one often ignores some attributes according to a particular purpose and merely considers the subcontexts of a rather complex context. In this paper, we make a deep investigation on the theory of concept lattices of subcontexts. An approach to construct the concept lattice of a context is first presented by means of the concept lattices of its subcontexts. Then the concept lattices induced by all subcontexts of the context are considered as a set, and an order relation is introduced into the set. It is proved that the set together with the order relation is a complete lattice. Finally, the top element and the bottom element of the complete lattice are also obtained.", "paper_title": "Concept Lattices of Subcontexts of a Context", "paper_id": "WOS:000264096600011"}
