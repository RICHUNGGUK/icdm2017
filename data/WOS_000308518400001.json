In proposed model, the nonlinear electromagnetic field equations and the circuit equations are strongly coupled and solved together with motion equation at each time step. The nonlinearity problem is solved employing the Newton-Raphson (NR) procedure. Presented control technique is based on linear-quadratic problem and adopted to the nonlinear finite element model. The optimal control strategy is numerically investigated and compared with commonly used control strategy for the square wave excitation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
