In this paper, an efficient packet loss resilience method is proposed using closed form solution for unequal FEC assignment based on a new packet distortion model. We first derive the packet distortion model by investigating the error concealment property and error propagation effect in H.264. To select the source and channel rate minimizing the overall distortion, we present a model-based rate allocation algorithm using the packet distortion model and rate-distortion function. Then we propose the closed form solution for unequal FEC assignment, which uses the packet distortion model and considers channel status information. Simulation results show that the proposed method gives substantial improvement for the received video quality in packet-lossy Internet and wireless network environments, while it requires much less computational complexity compared to the previous scheme.
