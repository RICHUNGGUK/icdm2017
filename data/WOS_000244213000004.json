The compliance of the components is significant and simple 'pick and place' approaches cannot be used due to the inherent dimensional variability between mating parts. The research described in this paper aims to solve this problem by using a noncontact sensing system to measure part deformation and misalignment in real time. The acquired data can then be processed through a mathematical algorithm to calculate the relative component positions required for optimal assembly. The data can also be used to check gross distortion of components and to reject those outside the specification limits. Existing part-to-part holes were used to provide alignment for individual components within the structure. A series of experiments were performed to investigate the feasibility of the method. Results are presented along with a discussion of the problems that may be encountered during robotic assembly. The experimental results show that robots when combined with non-contact metrology can be used for the assembly of compliant aero-structure components within required tolerance limits.
