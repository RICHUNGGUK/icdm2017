This instruction brings dramatic change to software implementation of multiplication in GF(2(m)) fields. In this paper, we present improved Karatsuba formulae for multiplying two small binary polynomials, compare different strategies for PCLMULQDQ-based multiplication in the five GF(2(m)) fields recommended by NIST and conclude the best design approaches to software implementation of GF(2)[x] multiplication.
