The latter case is particularly interesting when an individual's cohesion ability is not reliable due to the limitation of communication range. The effect of external boundary constraints on the connectivity property of multiagents has been intensively investigated in natural observation and engineering simulation. A theoretical analysis is given in this paper which reveals that a group of agents in a bounded plane can be almost always jointly connected and hence form a complete flock.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Joint Connectivity Condition for Multiagents With Boundary Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000317644300004"}
