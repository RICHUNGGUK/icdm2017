Time series data have been analyzed in either the time or frequency domains. The objective of this study is to propose a forecasting method based on wavelet filtering. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into the trend and variation parts and constructs a separate model for each part. Simulation and real case studies were conducted to examine the properties of the proposed method under various scenarios and compare its performance with time series forecasting models without wavelet filtering. The results from both simulated and real data showed that the proposed method based on wavelet filtering yielded more accurate results than the models without wavelet filtering in terms of mean absolute percentage error criterion.
