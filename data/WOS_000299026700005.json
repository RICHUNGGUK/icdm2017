The blue light intensity required to evoke the photophohic reactions of Euglena cells was experimentally determined, and the empirically derived auto-adjustment of parameters was incorporated in the algorithm. The Euglena-based neurocomputing of 4-city traveling salesman problem possessed two fundamental characteristics: (1) attaining one of the best solutions of the problem and (2) searching for a number of solutions via dynamic transition among the solutions (multi-solution search). The spontaneous reduction in cell number in illuminated areas and the existence of photo-insensitive robust cells are the essential mechanisms responsible for the two characteristics of the Euglena-based neurocomputing.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Microbe-Based Neurocomputing with Euglena Cells Confined in Micro-Aquariums", "paper_id": "WOS:000299026700005"}
