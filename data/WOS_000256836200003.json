First, stochastic optimization techniques are used in combination with approximate models. Second, line-search techniques are combined with full-wave modeling. For the first stage, we show an illustrative example. The second stage is considered in detail; both the acceleration of the underlying field computations and the implementation of the optimization are discussed.", "paper_title": "From engineering electromagnetics to electromagnetic engineering: Using computational electromagnetics for synthesis problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256836200003"}
