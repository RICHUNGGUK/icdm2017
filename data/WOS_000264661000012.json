Double layers fuzzy logic is used to control both the speed and the turning angle of the mobile robot. A method of \"virtual target\" is introduced to deal with the problem of local minimal, which often occurs in local path planning. The results of simulation and experiment show its effectiveness and feasibility.", "paper_title": "DOUBLE LAYERS FUZZY LOGIC BASED MOBILE ROBOT PATH PLANNING IN UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000264661000012"}
