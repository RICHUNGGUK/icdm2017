Transcoding H.264 video to HEVC video is important to enable gradual migration to HEVC. Therefore, a fast H.264 to HEVC transcoding algorithm based on region feature analysis is proposed. First, each frame is segmented into three regions in units of coding tree unit (CTU) based on the correlation between image coding complexities and coding bits of the H.264 source stream. Then the searching depth range of each CTU is adaptively decided according to the region type. After that, motion vectors are de-noise filtered and clustered in order to analyze the region features of coding unit (CU). Based on the analysis results, the minimum searching depth of CU and partitions of prediction unit (PU) are optimally selected, and the motion vector predictor and search window size of motion estimation are also optimally decided for further reduction of the computational complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significant improvement on transcoding speed, while maintaining high Rate-Distortion performance.", "paper_title": "Fast transcoding from H.264 to HEVC based on region feature analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200048"}
