In this context sensors synchronization, that provides simultaneous change-point instants on the data, is in practice a constraint hard to maintain. The contribution of this work is the proposition of a hybrid fusion system that performs as well as the centralized fusion detector respectively optimal for simultaneous and not simultaneous change. The system we propose is composed of two GLR tests (Generalized Likelihood Ratio) defined as centralized fusion detectors for the two configurations of change-point (simultaneous and not simultaneous). Decisions of these fusion detectors are combined in a fusion operator. The system is hybrid (centralized and distributed) because the distributed decisions supplied by the centralized fusion systems are combined in a global fusion operator. The contribution of our method is shown on synthetic data. The application to the treatment of a real multi-carrier GPS signal shows the feasibility of the method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
