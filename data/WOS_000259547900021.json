We propose a new semi-global method for SFS using graph cuts. The new algorithm combines the local method proposed by Lee and Rosenfeld [C.H. Lee, A. Rosenfeld, Improved methods of estimating shape from shading using the light source coordinate system, Artif. Intell. 26 (1985) 125-143] and a global method using an energy minimization technique. By employing a new global energy minimization formulation, the convex/concave ambiguity problem of Lee and Rosenfeld's method can be resolved efficiently. A new combinatorial optimization technique, the graph cuts method, is used for the minimization of the proposed energy functional. Experimental results on a variety of synthetic and real-world images show that the proposed algorithm reconstructs the 3-D shape of objects very efficiently. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
