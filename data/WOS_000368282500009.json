The nested m-trail method decomposes each network topology that is at least d-connected into virtual cycles and trails, in which sets of m-trails that traverse through a common monitoring node (MN) can be obtained. The nested m-trails are used in the monitoring burst (m-burst) framework, in which the MN can localize any SRLG failure by inspecting the optical bursts traversing through it. An integer linear program (ILP) and a heuristic are proposed for the network decomposition, which are further verified by numerical experiments. We show that the proposed method significantly reduces the required fault localization latency compared with the existing methods. Finally, we demonstrate that nested mtrails can also be used in adaptive probing to find SRLG faults in all-optical networks. The nested m-trail based probing method needs a significantly reduced number of sequential probes. Thus, the method overcomes one of the important hurdles to deploy adaptive probing in alloptical networks: the large number of sequential probes needed to localize SRLG faults.
