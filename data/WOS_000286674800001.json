Such a recurrent neural dynamics is designed based on an indefinite error-monitoring function instead of a usually norm- or square-based energy function. In addition, Zhang neural dynamics (ZND) are depicted generally in implicit dynamics, whereas gradient-based neural dynamics (GND) are associated with explicit dynamics. In this paper, we generalize the ZND design method to solving online nonlinear time-varying equations in the form of f (x, t) = 0. For comparative purposes, the GND model is also employed for such time-varying equations' solving. Computer-simulation results via power-sigmoid activation functions substantiate the theoretical analysis and efficacy of the ZND model for solving online nonlinear time-varying equations.", "paper_title": "Comparison on Zhang neural dynamics and gradient-based neural dynamics for online solution of nonlinear time-varying equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286674800001"}
