The P, D, and C are the abbreviation of policies, desires and contracts respectively. The PEAU system is designed to realize the properties of autonomic computing, including self-configuration, self-optimization, self-healing, and self-protection, etc. This paper focuses on the autonomous VO (virtual organization) formation and service composition.", "paper_title": "PDC-agent enabled autonomic computing: A theory of autonomous service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100065"}
