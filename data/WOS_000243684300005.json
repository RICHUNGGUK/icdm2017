This modification can be applied to three of the already existing criteria: that of Bieniawski-Yudhbir-Kalamaras, that of Sheorey, and that of Hock-Brown. comparatively analysing the effects of the three modifications that have been proposed. The new, modified criterion will be validated with new data obtained in a marble mine exploited by means of rooms and pillars. The values observed and measured in the mine are compared to those obtained through numerical modelling of the pillars, using the Analisis Lagrangiano de Medios Continuos, Lagrangian Analysis of Continuous Media (ALMEC) program. Finally, several conclusions related to the application of these rock failure criteria to the analysis of mining excavation of rooms and pillars will be proposed. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
