This algorithm is based on a combination of the Angular Z-Buffer (AZB), the Space Volumetric Partitioning (SVP) and the A*Heuristic search method. The algorithm is very useful for different applications. Basically, four kinds of analysis can be done with the tool: radiation pattern of antennas, electromagnetic field values in observation points in the near field, mutual coupling between antennas and propagation at indoor/outdoor environments. A computational analysis is shown for the different strategies of parallelization for shared and distributed memory computers. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
