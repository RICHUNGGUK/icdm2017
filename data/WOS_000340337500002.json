This paper presents a rigorous runtime analysis of the well-known Simple Genetic Algorithm (SGA) for ONEMAx. It is proved that the SGA has exponential runtime with overwhelming probability for population sizes up to mu <= n(1/8-epsilon) for some arbitrarily small constant epsilon and problem size n. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time non-trivial lower bounds are obtained On the runtime of a standard crossover-based GA for a standard benchmark function. The presented techniques might serve as a first basis towards systematic runtime analyses of GAS. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
