The controlled systems consist of a chain of integrators perturbed by a lower-triangular vector field with nonlinear parametrization. By using the completion of square and the parameter separation technique, a smooth adaptive controller is explicitly constructed to attenuate the influence of the disturbance on the output with an arbitrary degree of accuracy without imposing any extra growth condition. The designed adaptive controller is in its minimum-order property, since the order of the dynamic compensator is equal to one.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE REGULATION WITH ALMOST DISTURBANCE DECOUPLING FOR INTEGRATOR TRIANGULAR SYSTEMS WITH NONLINEAR PARAMETRIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100015"}
