Firstly, to deal with the data association problem that arises due to the uncertainty of the measurements, the fuzzy clustering method with the maximum entropy principle is utilized, which eliminates those invalid measurements. Secondly, this paper employs GPF to update each target state independently, since it has a much-improved performance and versatility over other Gaussian filters, especially when nontrivial nonlinearities are present. Moreover, in the multisensor scenario, a statistic test method based on the cotangent values of bearings is proposed, for associating the target bearing data observed at each sensor. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Multitarget bearings-only tracking using fuzzy clustering technique and Gaussian particle filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000294498100002"}
