Although, our main focus is on estimation (from both frequentist and Bayesian point of view) yet, the stochastic ordering, the Bonferroni and the Lorenz curves, various entropies and order statistics are derived first time for the said distribution. Different types of loss functions are considered for Bayesian estimation. Furthermore, the Bayes estimators and their respective posterior risks are computed and compared using Gibbs sampling. The different reliability characteristics including hazard function, stress and strength analysis, and mean residual life function are also derived. Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compare the performances of the proposed methods of estimation and two real data sets have been analysed for illustrative purposes.", "paper_title": "Weighted exponential distribution: properties and different methods of estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000361612800003"}
