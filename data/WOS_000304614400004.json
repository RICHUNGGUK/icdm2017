Thresholds were measured during quasi-sinusoidal head yaw, single left-to-right or right-to-left head yaw, different phases of head yaw, slow to fast head yaw, scene motion relative to head yaw, and two scene-illumination levels. We found that across various conditions (1) thresholds are greater when the scene moves with head yaw (corresponding to gain < 1.0) than when the scene moves against head yaw (corresponding to gain > 1.0), and (2) thresholds increase as head motion increases.", "paper_title": "Scene-Motion Thresholds During Head Yaw for Immersive Virtual Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000304614400004"}
