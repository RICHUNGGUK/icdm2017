NSSWD and other criteria for the related problem of number partitioning are presented from a statistical viewpoint, which allows to derive some insightful connections with statistical measures of dispersion. A new local search algorithm is also developed. The algorithm at first generates and merges a set of partial solutions in order to obtain a feasible solution for the multiprocessor scheduling problem. Then a set of interchange procedures are utilized in order to improve the solution. The effectiveness of this approach is evaluated by solving a large number of benchmark instances.
