Our goal is to design technology that brings education to a higher level; a level where students not only learn subject matter, but also gain a set of critical skills needed to engage in and self-regulate collaborative learning experiences in science and math education. To achieve this goal, we need to understand how educational technology can bring students' attention to, and promote these higher level skills. We first discuss the core skills that students need as they learn to learn together. We then present a platform and pedagogy to support the acquisition of the critical skills. Finally, we present an example use of our system based on results from pilot studies. This example demonstrates interaction with the platform to highlight potential benefits and limitations of our approach to promoting the associated skills.", "paper_title": "Metafora: A Web-Based Platform for Learning to Learn Together in Science and Mathematics", "paper_id": "WOS:000324386000003"}
