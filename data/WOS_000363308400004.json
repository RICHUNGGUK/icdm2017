The proposed approach allows the evolution of the type, size, rotation and position of each object, constructing a non-photorealistic transformation of a source image or 3D model. The creator evaluates each individual of the population accordingly to his/hers aesthetics preferences, influencing the final outcome of the process. The evolution of assemblages which are mapped to a 3D model is described. The experimental results presented highlight the generalisation abilities of the evolved individuals and the expressiveness of the evolutionary tool.", "paper_title": "Evolving assemblages", "paper_id": "WOS:000363308400004"}
