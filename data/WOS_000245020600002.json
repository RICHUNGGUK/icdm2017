It defines a standard form to translate the correction to the effective action corresponding to a given supergraph into a Mathematica expression, which is then evaluated and simplified. Several functions for manipulations of these expressions are provided, and the package also has the ability to save the outcomes of its calculations in (LTEX)-T-A form.

Ireland, also at http://fma.if.usp.br/-alysson/SusyMath Licensing provisions: LGPL, CPC non-profit use license Programming language: Mathematica Platform: Any platform supporting Mathematica 4.0 or higher Computer tested on: PC (Athlon64 X2 +3800); 1 GB RAM Operating system under which the program has been tested: Linux (Debian 4.0); XOrg 7.0.22; Mathematica 5.2 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 42 472 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 471596 Distribution format: tar.gz Nature of the problem: Evaluate quantum corrections to the effective action of supersymmetric field theories, formulated in the superfield formalism, both in three- and four-spacetime dimensions. Solution method: A set of procedures for integration by parts, application of the algebra of covariant derivatives and Grassman integration, along with several auxiliary functions, is introduced. Restrictions: At the moment, the background field method is not implemented, but the system is designed to be further generalized. Running time: Depends on the complexity of the problem. From seconds for simpler one-loop diagrams to several hours for simple two-loop graphs. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
