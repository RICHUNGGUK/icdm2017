By employing the Lyapunov functional method combined with the stochastic analysis as well as the feedback control technique, several sufficient conditions are established that guarantee the mean square exponential anti-synchronization of two identical delayed networks with stochastic disturbances. These sufficient conditions, which are expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), can be solved efficiently by the LMI toolbox in Matlab. Two numerical examples are exploited to demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed synchronization approaches.", "paper_title": "Anti-synchronization of stochastic perturbed delayed chaotic neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266665300013"}
