We optimize Serially-Concatenated Low-Density Generator Matrix (SCLDGM) codes (a subclass of LDPC codes) for each system configuration, with the goal of assessing its ability to approach the capacity limits in either ergodic or quasi-static channels. Our focus is on three relevant STBCs: the Orthogonal Space-Time Block Codes (OSTBCs) for two transmit antennas (i.e., the Alamouti code), which enables optimum detection with low complexity; the Golden code, which provides a capacity increase with respect to the input constellation; and Linear Dispersion (LD) codes, which enable practical detection in asymmetrical antenna configurations (i.e., more transmit than receive antennas) for cases in which optimum detection is infeasible. We conclude that BICM without concatenation with STBCs is in general the best option, except for Alamouti-coded 2 x 1 and Golden-coded 2 x 2 MIMO systems.
