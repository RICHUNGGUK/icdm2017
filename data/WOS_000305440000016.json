We propose two algorithms for the identification of determining sets. The first approach is inspired by the well-known Apriori algorithm for frequent item sets. The second algorithm makes use of information-theoretical techniques. A comparative and experimental evaluation of these approaches is also presented.", "paper_title": "Learning Determining Sets of Finite Partially Defined Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000305440000016"}
