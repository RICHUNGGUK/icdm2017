The design concept is based on body biasing. An off chip Digital to Analog Converter is used to generate the proper body bias voltage to control the LNA gain and linearity. Measurement results show that in the high gain mode, for V (BS) = 0.3 V, the cascode LNA, implemented in a 0.13 mu m CMOS standard process, exhibits a 14 dB power gain, a 3.6 dB noise figure (NF) and -4.6 dBm of third order intercept point (IIP3) for a 4 mA current consumption under 1 V supply. Tuning V (BS) to -0.55 V, switches the LNA into the low gain mode. It achieves 8.6 dB power gain, 6.2 dB NF and 6 dBm IIP3 under a constrained power consumption of 1.7 mW.", "paper_title": "A dual mode 2.4-GHz CMOS low noise amplifier employing body biasing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700018"}
