However, the latency unfairness problem and the associated performance degradation due to the circuit switched characteristic of HONoC must be resolved. In this paper, we propose a new shortest path adaptive routing technique for HONoC by exploiting an elaborate rollback scheme and a rapid flow control method to promote the fast routing path setup and the parallel data transfers. Compared to existing works, experimental results show reduction by 41.6% in latency and improvement by 16.9% in throughput with negligible extra energy consumption. Additional benefits in the network resource utilization and the performance under increasing network sizes are also analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
