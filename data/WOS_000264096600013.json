The new scheme has some advantages over the available schemes: the private keys size shrinks as the identity depth increases and the signature size is a constant as it consists of three group elements. Furthermore, under the h-CDH assumption, our scheme is provably secure in the standard model. This assumption is more natural than many of the hardness assumptions recently introduced to HIBS in the standard model.", "paper_title": "New Construction of Short Hierarchical ID-Based Signature in the Standard Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000264096600013"}
