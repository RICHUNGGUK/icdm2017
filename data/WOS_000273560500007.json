This model of classification is based primarily on the Bayes rule and secondarily on the notion of fuzzy numbers. In adopting a probability-fuzzy model two concepts of hierarchical rules are proposed. In the first approach the local criterion that denote the probabilities of misclassification for particular nodes of a tree is considered. In the second approach the global optimal strategy that minimises the mean probability of misclassification on the whole multistage recognition process is considered. A probability of misclassifications is derived for a multiclass hierarchical classifier under the assumption that the features at different nodes of the tree are class-conditionally statistically independent, and we have fuzzy information on object features instead of exact information. Numerical example of this difference concludes the work.", "paper_title": "Classification error in Bayes multistage recognition task with fuzzy observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000273560500007"}
