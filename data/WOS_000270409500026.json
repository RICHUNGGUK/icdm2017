In this paper, the concept of fractional Liu process is proposed as an extension of Liu process. Furthermore, we obtain the expressions of the membership functions, expected values and variances of arithmetic and geometric fractional Liu processes for each fixed time. As an application, geometric fractional Liu process is assumed to characterize the stock price, which formulates a new fuzzy stock model. Based on this proposed model, European option pricing formulas are gained and two numerical examples are given with different parameters. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
