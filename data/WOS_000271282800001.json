This notion turned out to be important in low-rank approximations to matrices and rank revealing QR factorizations which have been investigated in the linear algebra community and can be quantified in a few different ways. In this paper, from a complexity theoretic point of view, we propose four related problems in which we try to find a sub-matrix C is an element of R(m x k) of a given matrix A is an element of R(m x n) such that (i) ((sigma)max(C) (the largest singular value of Q is minimum, 00 ((sigma)min(C) (the smallest singular value of C) is maximum, (iii) K (C) = ((sigma)max (C)/((sigma)min (C) (the condition number of C) is minimum, and (iv) the volume of the parallelepiped defined by the column vectors of C is maximum. We establish the NP-hardness of these problems and further show that they do not admit PTAS. We then study a natural Greedy heuristic for the maximum volume problem and show that it has approximation ratio 2(-0(klogk)). Our analysis of the Greedy heuristic is tight to within a logarithmic factor in the exponent, which we show by explicitly constructing an instance for which the Greedy heuristic is 2(-Omega(k)) from optimal. When A has unit norm columns, a related problem is to select the maximum number of vectors with a given volume. We show that if the optimal solution selects k columns, then Greedy will select Omega(k/ log k) columns, providing a log k approximation. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
