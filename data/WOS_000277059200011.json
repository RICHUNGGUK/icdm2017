In this paper we present a few theoretical results on FISs (finite interactive systems), the underlying mechanism used for specifying control and interaction in these systems. First, we give a proof for the undecidability of the emptiness problem for FISs, by reduction to the Post Correspondence Problem. Next, we use the construction in this proof to get other undecidability results, e.g., for the accessibility of a transition in a FIS, or for the finiteness of the language recognized by a FIS. Finally, we present a simple proof of the equivalence between FISs and tile systems, making explicit that they precisely capture recognizable two-dimensional languages.", "paper_title": "Undecidability Results for Finite Interactive Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277059200011"}
