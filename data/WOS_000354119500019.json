We give a rigorous analysis of the conservation properties, including mass conservation and energy conservation in the discrete sense. Based on Brouwer fixed point theorem, the existence of the difference solution is proved. By virtue of the energy method, the difference solution is shown to be unique and convergent at the order of 0 (tau(2) + h(2)) in the l(2)-norm with time step tau and mesh size h. Finally a linearized iterative algorithm is presented and numerical experiments are given to confirm the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
