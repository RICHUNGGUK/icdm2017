Within the spray model, both distributions must be calculated at every control volume at every time-step where the spray is present and valid distributions must be guaranteed. Results show that the Maximum Entropy formalism combined with the Gamma distribution satisfy these conditions for the droplet size distributions. Approximating the droplet velocity profile is shown to be considerably more difficult due to the fact that it does not have compact support. An exponential model with a constrained exponent offers plausible profiles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
