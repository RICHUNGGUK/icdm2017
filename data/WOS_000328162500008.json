Service-oriented paradigms have been successfully applied to distributed environments, increasing their flexibility and allowing the reusability of their components. Besides, distributed real-time Java technologies have shown to be a good candidate to deploy real-time distributed applications. This paper presents a model for service-oriented applications on a time-triggered distributed real-time Java environment, focusing on the definition of the temporal model of an application and its schedulability, applying and evaluating this model in real-time service-oriented composition algorithms.
