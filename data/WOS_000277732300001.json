The real and imaginary parts of the most unstable eigenmode, responsible for vortex shedding, are very similar but associated with a spatial shift in the vortex structures. This shift results in the convection of vortices that are observed in the unsteady flow, which is actually a consequence of global absolute instability. The kinetic energy density, associated with the most unstable eigenmode, is studied. At the onset of the instability the energy density of the disturbance field is found to be stronger in the far wake compared with the near wake. With increase in Re the region where the disturbance is strong moves upstream closer to the cylinder. However, the maximum value of the kinetic energy density of the disturbance lies outside the recirculation zone even for Re upto 100. A linearized mechanical energy equation for the time evolution of the kinetic energy density of the disturbance is utilized to examine the energy budget of the most unstable eigenmode at various Re. It is found that the most significant contribution to the growth rate of the disturbance arises from the transfer of the energy due to the strain rate of the base flow to the perturbation. The stabilizing effect of the viscous dissipation increases with increase in Re, but saturates for Re beyond similar to 70.
