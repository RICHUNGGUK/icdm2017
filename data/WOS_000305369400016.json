Specifically, this paper aims to compare two theoretical models and an integrated model to identify which theoretical models best predicts blog continuance intention. Design/methodology/approach - An empirical study was conducted through an online survey. Data collected from six famous blogs in Taiwan (n = 361) were analyzed using structural equation modeling and pairwise nested F-tests. Findings - Results show that the ECT-IS model and the integrated model have greater explanatory power of blog continuance intention than the technology acceptance model (TAM). The results of pairwise nested F-tests show that the ECT-IS model exhibits statistically significant R-2 improvement compared to TAM. However, the R-2 improvement in the integrated model is not statistically different from that in the ECT-IS model. The ECT-IS model is also more parsimonious than the integrated model. Thus, the ECT-IS is a preferable model. Confirmation and satisfaction are salient factors influencing this intention. Practical implications - The results of this study provide useful information for blogging service providers (BSPs) to enhance and develop useful blog functions for user satisfaction. By revealing the differences and comparisons among these three models, this study can help BSPs promote the benefits of their blogs to strengthen the continuance intentions of their customers. Originality/value - This paper is one of the first studies to examine of influence change of variables and compare the relative ability of two competing theories, ECT-IS and TAM, and an integrated model in explaining blog continuance intention. The results confirm that the ECT-IS is a better model than the other two for explaining blog continuance intention.", "paper_title": "Understanding blog continuance: a model comparison approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000305369400016"}
