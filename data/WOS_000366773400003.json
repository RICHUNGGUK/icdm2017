That is, after adding these \"dummy vertices\", for every vertex degree d appearing in the resulting graph, there shall be at least k vertices with degree d. We explore three variants of vertex addition (justified by real-world considerations) and study their (parameterized) computational complexity. We derive mostly intractability results, even for very restricted cases (including trees and bounded-degree graphs) but also obtain some encouraging fixed-parameter tractability results.
