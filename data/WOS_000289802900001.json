Some DOA estimation methods have already been proposed for underdetermined cases. However, since most of them restrict their microphone array arrangements, their DOA estimation ability is limited to a 2-dimensional plane. To deal with an underdetermined case where sources are distributed arbitrarily, we propose a method that can employ a 2- or 3-dimensional sensor array. Our new method employs the source sparseness assumption to handle an underdetermined case. Our formulation with the sensor coordinate vectors allows us to employ arbitrarily arranged sensors easily. We obtained promising experimental results for 2-dimensionally distributed sensors and sources 3x4, 3x5 (#sensors x #speech sources), and for 3-dimensional case with 4x5 in a room (reverberation time (RT) of 120 ms). We also investigate the DOA estimation performance under several reverberant conditions.", "paper_title": "DOA Estimation for Multiple Sparse Sources with Arbitrarily Arranged Multiple Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000289802900001"}
