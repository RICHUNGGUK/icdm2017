DE (a population heuristic for optimization over continuous search spaces) is used as global optimizer for solution evolution guiding the search toward the optimal regions of the search space; VNS (a random local search heuristic based on the systematic change of neighborhood) is used as a local optimizer performing a sequence of local changes on individual DE solutions until a local optimum is found. The effectiveness of a DE-VNS approach is demonstrated on the solution of the single-machine total weighted tardiness scheduling problem. The concepts of Lamarckian and Baldwinian learning are also investigated and discussed. Experiments on known benchmark data sets show that DE-VNS with Lamarckian learning can produce high-quality schedules in a rather short computation time. DE-VNS uses a self-adapted mechanism for tuning the required control parameters, a critical feature rendering it applicable to real-life scheduling problems.", "paper_title": "A HYBRID METAHEURISTIC FOR THE SINGLE-MACHINE TOTAL WEIGHTED TARDINESS PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000311944500002"}
