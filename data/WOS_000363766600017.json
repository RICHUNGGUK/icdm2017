In this paper, we first discuss representing physical entities as IoT resources in the cyber world and integrate them into IoT services and then use an event session mechanism to express the coordination logic in an IoT service system. Given their event-driven models, the scalable IoT services are constructed through decoupling one service at behavior from others, where running atomic service instances with high concurrency is our first focus, and distributed execution of an IoT business process is our second focus. Our last focus is to make each distributed business process execution unit hold its properties in the whole process, which requires modeling the environment as a prerequisite to compute its properties, and some assume-guarantee rules for composing the services from the environment's perspective. We then propose a platform to support the construction, where according to the behavior decoupling features, one IoT business process is decomposed into pieces of event composition logic and business computation logic, together with separating the data dependency of computation functions in each process fragment, such that it can be concurrently executed and distributed. A practical application is implemented to concept-prove our work.
