As a case study we describe a structural health monitoring application which was used to illustrate and assess the proposed model. We conduct experiments in order to evaluate the proposal in two different scenarios of damage with different data aggregation methods. We also compared our proposal, using the same data set, with a deterministic clustering method and with the LEACH algorithm. The results indicate that our approach is an energy-efficient clustering method for WSNs, outperforming both the deterministic clustering and LEACH algorithms in about 70% and 47% of energy savings respectively. The energy saving comes from the fact that we have a more efficient in-network data aggregation process since by exploiting the semantic relation between sensor nodes we can potentially aggregate more similar data and consequently, decrease the data redundancy (thus minimizing transmissions). Nodes that are semantically unrelated can operate in low-duty cycle, further reducing the energy consumption. Moreover, our proposal has the potential to improve the data accuracy provided for the application where accuracy is a QoS requirement in typical WSN applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
