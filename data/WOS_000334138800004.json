This paper introduces destination differentiation in ingress aggregated fairness for RPR and focuses on the RPR MAC client implementation of the IEEE 802.17 RPR MAC in the aggressive mode of operation. It also introduces an enhanced active queue management scheme for ring networks that achieves destination differentiation as well as higher overall utilization of the ring bandwidth with simpler and less expensive implementation than the generic implementation provided in the standard. The enhanced scheme introduced in this paper provides performance comparable to the per destination queuing implementation, which is the best achievable performance, while providing weighted destination based fairness as well as weighted ingress aggregated fairness. In addition, the proposed scheme has been demonstrated via extensive simulations to provide improved stability and fairness with respect to different packet arrival rates as compared to earlier algorithms.
