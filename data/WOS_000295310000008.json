However, drawing and alignment of two-dimensional structures (the images) are usually performed manually, resulting in a few imperfections. Selection of descriptors, which are in fact pixels of images, can minimize such effects; also, it enables selection of those variables which indeed explains the variance in the activities block. Therefore, in order to obtain more parsimonious, predictive models, interval PLS (iPLS), genetic algorithm (GA), and ordered predictors selection (OPS) were applied to select appropriate MIA descriptors to model kinetic constants, namely substrate cleavage rate (k(cat)) and Michaelis (K(m)) constants, which correlate to the bioactivities of peptides against Dengue type 2 (DEN-2). The models built were used to predict k(cat) and K(m) of new proposed peptides, which are miscellany of substructures of the most promising peptides experimentally tested elsewhere.
