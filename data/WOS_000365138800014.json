In this regard, System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) and System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) as the \"customer-orientated indices\" and Average Energy Not Supplied (AENS) as the \"load and energy-orientated index\" are utilized as the reliability objective functions. Meanwhile, to reach a compromise between the original objective functions and reliability ones, the total system cost including the MW cost of power losses as well as the capacitor investment cost is also considered as an objective function. In order to handle the proposed nonlinear constraint multi-objective optimization problem suitably, a new self adaptive modification method based on Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) is proposed. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated through a standard test system.", "paper_title": "An intelligent approach for optimal capacitor placement problem as a reliability reinforcement strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800014"}
