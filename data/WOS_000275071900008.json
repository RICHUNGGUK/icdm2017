The quality index (QI) that is used to calculate acknowledged project effort is empirically evaluated in order to find interchangeable metric sets that can be used when calculating QI. In the evaluation, ten metric sets with four metrics in the set were used to calculate ten different quality indexes that were then evaluated on 25 projects. The results indicate that six metric sets are interchangeable, making the calculation of the QI easy.
