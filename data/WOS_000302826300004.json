Many web applications (such as those for electronic commerce) demand a secure cookie scheme. Such a scheme needs to provide the following four services: authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and anti-replay. Several secure cookie schemes have been proposed in previous literature; however, none of them are completely satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a secure cookie scheme that is effective, efficient, and easy to deploy. In terms of effectiveness, our scheme provides all of the above four security services. In terms of efficiency, our scheme does not involve any database lookup or public key cryptography. In terms of deployability, our scheme can be easily deployed on existing web services, and it does not require any change to the Internet cookie specification. We implemented our secure cookie scheme using PHP and conducted experiments. The experimental results show that our scheme is very efficient on both the client side and the server side. A notable adoption of our scheme in industry is that our cookie scheme has been used by Wordpress since version 2.4. Wordpress is a widely used open source content management system.
