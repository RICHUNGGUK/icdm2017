Design/methodology/approach - This research work will present an interactive software package that has been fitted and verified by the results based on full-wave full domain Lagrange differential (FDLD) method and experimental approach to realize EDA of RFIC RFIC/MMIC passive components. The developed web platform is based on browser/server pattern, by use of VisualStudio.NET and ASP.NET technologies. Findings - Its functionality may include analysis, synthesis, optimization, interpolation, and modeling of spiral inductors and coplanar waveguide (CPW) with any shape on any material substrate for microwave and wireless applications. Through the complete online processing of the inductors and CPW designs, it is approvable to expand to design applications of other passive components such as resistor (R), capacitor (C), transmission line and connector, etc. Originality/value - This compute-online algorithm is first developed by the use of the originally established numerical method FDLD makes one case design possible to be done online in the time range of seconds.", "paper_title": "Compute-online designs of RFIC/MMIC passive components", "paper_id": "WOS:000277371500002"}
