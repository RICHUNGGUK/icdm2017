However, they face the challenge of organizing these documents in order to facilitate searching through them at a later time and sharing them with other users. We propose using context awareness and semantic technologies in order to improve and facilitate the organization, annotation, retrieval and sharing of personal mobile multimedia documents. Our approach combines metadata extracted and enriched automatically from the users' context with annotations provided manually by the users and with annotations inferred by applying user-defined rules to context features. These new contextual metadata are integrated into the processes of annotation, sharing and keyword-based retrieval.", "paper_title": "Towards the semantic and context-aware management of mobile multimedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000289739800004"}
