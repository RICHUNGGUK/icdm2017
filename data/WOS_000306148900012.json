A prompt detection of abnormalities in these signals is essential for the timely resolution of situations that may put both mother and fetus at risk. Uterine contraction signals provide information that is important to evaluate the onset and progress of labor, as well as the significance of certain fetal heart rate abnormalities. We present a model for educational simulation of the spontaneous evolution of uterine contractions during labor, which combines a previously published signal generator with literature-based pre-programmed scripts for educationally relevant scenarios. This model is an essential component of a high-fidelity simulator of intrapartum emergencies, aimed to improve the competency of healthcare providers. Real and simulated tracings were presented to three independent clinical experts who judged simulated signals to be indistinguishable or negligibly different from real tracings.
