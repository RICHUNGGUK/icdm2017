We investigate the impact that trust both at the individual level and network level has on the strength of association between members of the professional social networking site Linked In. A model of trust adapted from previous literature is empirically tested using an online survey sent to a random sample of Linked In members. The findings indicate that dyadic tie strength is influenced by an individual's disposition to trust and by the trust belief between the respondent and the respondent's last connection made in Linked In. Trust in Linked In did not influence the relationship.", "paper_title": "UNDERSTANDING PROFESSIONAL CONNECTIONS IN LINKEDIN - A QUESTION OF TRUST", "paper_id": "WOS:000332131000010"}
