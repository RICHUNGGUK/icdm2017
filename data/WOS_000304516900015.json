Images from four different classes of raisins (green, green with tail, black, and black with tail) were acquired using a color CCD camera. After pre-processing and segmentation of images, 44 features including 36 color and eight shape features were extracted. Correlation-based feature selection was used to select best features for grading the raisins. Seven features were found superior. To classify raisins, four different data mining-based techniques including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs) and Bayesian networks (BNs) were investigated. Results of validation stage showed ANN with 7-6-4 topology had the highest classification accuracy, 96.33%. After ANN, SVM with polynomial kernel function (95.67%), DT with J48 algorithm (94.67%) and BN with simulated annealing learning (94.33%) had higher accuracy, respectively. Results of this research can be adapted for developing an efficient raisin sorting system. (C) 2012 Elsevier By.
