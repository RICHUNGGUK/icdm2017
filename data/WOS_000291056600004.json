The drawback of these techniques has been gray transition regions between solid and void parts, but this problem has recently been alleviated using various projection methods. In this paper we show that simple projection methods do not ensure local mesh-convergence and propose a modified robust topology optimization formulation based on erosion, intermediate and dilation projections that ensures both global and local mesh-convergence.", "paper_title": "On projection methods, convergence and robust formulations in topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000291056600004"}
