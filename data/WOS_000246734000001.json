A holonomic function over K is a solution f to the equation Lf = 0. We will also assume that f admits initial conditions in K at a non-singular point z is an element of K. Given a broken-line path gamma = z -> z' between z and z', which avoids the singularities of L and with vertices in K, we have shown in a previous paper [van der Hoeven, J., 1999. Fast evaluation of holonomic functions. Theoret. Comput. Sci. 210, 199-215] how to compute n digits of the analytic continuation of f along gamma in time Omicron (n log(3) n log log n). In a second paper [van der Hoeven, J., 2001b. Fast evaluation of holonomic functions near and in singularities. J. Symbolic Comput. 31, 717-743], this result was generalized to the case when z' is allowed to be a regular singularity, in which case we compute the limit of f when we approach the singularity along gamma. In the present paper, we treat the remaining case when the end-point of gamma is an irregular singularity. In fact, we will solve the more general problem to compute \"singular transition matrices\" between nonstandard points above a singularity and regular points in 1K near the singularity. These non-standard points correspond to the choice of \"non-singular directions\" in Ecalle's accelero-summation process. We will show that the entries of the singular transition matrices may be approximated up to n decimal digits in time O (n log(4) n log log n). As a consequence, the entries of the Stokes matrices for L at each singularity may be approximated with the same time complexity.
