The mapping relationship among personality, mood and emotion is built. The equations for updating the affective and mood states are induced and a generic computing model for personality mood and emotion simulation for virtual human is constructed. The simulation results demonstrate that the affective model can better simulate the dynamic process of emotion and mood change under various environment stimulus. The model provides a valid method to the emotional robot modelling and affective decision system.", "paper_title": "Affective computing model based on emotional psychology", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600037"}
