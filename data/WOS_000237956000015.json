However, previous approaches assume that buffers are free to be placed anywhere. In practice, designs frequently have large blocks that make the ideal buffer-insertion solution unrealizable. The theory of Otten (ACM/IEEE Intl. Symp. Physical Design, p. 104, 1998) is extended to show how one can model the blocks into a simple delay-estimation technique that applies to both two-pin and multipin nets. Even though the formula uses one buffer type, it shows remarkable accuracy in predicting delay when compared to an optimal realizable buffer-insertion solution. Potential applications include wire planning, timing analysis during floorplanning, or global routing. The authors' experiments show that their approach accurately predicts delay when compared to constructing a realizable buffer insertion with multiple buffer types.", "paper_title": "Accurate estimation of global buffer delay within a floorplan", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000015"}
