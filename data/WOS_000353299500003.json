However, as organizations switch to different vendors, upgrade their systems, or implement new systems, widespread user resistance is often encountered. Resistant behaviors often occur in these large-scale system implementations because the implementation transforms the jobs of employees and mandates system use. In order to understand resistant behaviors better as well as management strategies to minimize these behaviors, this study uses a focus group and qualitative semi-structured interviews. Based on the data collection, this study first creates a resistant behavior framework and a management strategy framework using a data-driven approach. The findings from the user resistance behaviors are classified into four categories. Also, eight preferred management strategies are identified by users, which are grouped into three categories. Then, the Framework-based Theory of User Resistance is proposed, which examines the causes and moderating forces that affect resistant behaviors. The practical implications of these frameworks also are described.", "paper_title": "User Resistance Behaviors and Management Strategies in IT-Enabled Change", "paper_id": "WOS:000353299500003"}
