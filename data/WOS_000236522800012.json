An atom-based evolutionary approach was used allowing both several types of mutation and crossover to occur. The novelty, we claim, is the unprecedented interactive evolution, in which the user acts as a fitness function. This brings a human being's creativity, implicit knowledge, and imagination into the design process, next to the more standard chemical rules. Proof-of-concept was demonstrated in a number of ways, both computationally and in the lab. Thus, we synthesized a number of compounds designed with the aid of the Molecule Evoluator. One of these is described here, a new chemical entity with activity on alpha-adrenergic receptors.", "paper_title": "The molecule evoluator.
