The source, destination, and relay are equipped with multiple antennas, denoted by N (S), N (D), and N (R), respectively. Specifically, the paper derives the asymptotic outage probability and symbol error rate (SER) of the proposed schemes in the cooperative AF MIMO relaying scenario. These analyses in high SNR regime lead to the conclusion that TAS-SD&RD and TAS-SR&RD can achieve full diversity order, N (S) N (D) + NR min {N (S),N (D)}, in some antenna configurations of the cooperative scenario. Numerical results that confirm our analyses are also presented in the paper.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic performance of amplify-and-forward MIMO relaying with transmit antenna selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500023"}
