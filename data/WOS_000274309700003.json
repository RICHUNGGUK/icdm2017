As none of these approaches is fully satisfactory, a novel method using an approximated finite-element approach is presented and analysed. The methods are compared for the linear heat equation and the Navier-Stokes equations. While the novel approximated finite-element method performs significantly better for the linear heat equation, a stabilised edge-based method performs equally well for the considered test-cases for the Navier-Stokes equations.
