The cascade of two omega networks appended with a certain interconnection pattern is also rearrangeable. These belong to the general problem: for what banyan-type network (i.e., bit-permuting unique-routing network) is the tandem cascade a rearrangeable network? We relate the problem to the trace and guide of banyan-type networks. Let tau denote the trace permutation of a 2(n) x 2(n) banyan-type network and gamma the guide permutation of it. This paper proves that rearrangeability of the tandem cascade of the network is solely determined by the transposition tau gamma(-1). Such a per-mutation is said to be tandem rearrangeable when the tandem cascade is indeed rearrangeable. We identify a few tandem rearrangeable permutations, each implying the rearrangeability of the tandem cascade of a wide class of banyan-type networks.", "paper_title": "Rearrangeability of tandem cascade of banyan-type networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703600009"}
