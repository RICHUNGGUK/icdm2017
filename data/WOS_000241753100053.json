In this paper, we evaluate the performance of seven wavelet energy signatures and eight wavelet basis for texture discrimination. Experimental results on 111 Brodatz textures show that the feature extracted from high and middle frequency channels is more suitable for texture analysis and the choice of wavelet basis has some influence on texture discrimination.", "paper_title": "Wavelet energy signature: Comparison and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100053"}
