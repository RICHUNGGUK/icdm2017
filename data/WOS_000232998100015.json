In this paper, a dynamic vehicle routing and scheduling problem with time windows is described where both real-time customer requests and dynamic travel times are considered. Different reactive dispatching strategies are defined and compared through the setting of a single \"tolerance\" parameter. The results show that some tolerance to deviations with the current planned solution usually leads to better solutions. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
