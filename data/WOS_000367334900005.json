QR-ULMPS was specifically designed to support the development of u-learning materials and create an engaging context-aware u-learning environment for students. A quasi-experimental research design was used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of QR-ULMPS; the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) assessed the feasibility of using QR-ULMPS to implement teaching activities; while the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was used to measure the students' learning motivation after using the proposed u-learning system. From the results of the UTAUT questionnaire, we found that teachers rated the system postively and were willing to accept and adopt QR-ULMPS into their course content. Teachers also agreed that QR-ULMPS was a useful tool to motivate students' learning during outdoor teaching activities. Moreover, results of the IMMS questionnaire indicated that students assigned to the proposed u-learning system achieved better results than participants learning via conventional methods. We believe that the proposed u-learning system is advantageous because it enhances student motivation and allows for higher levels of engagement, particularly during outdoor learning activities. Thus, we conclude that the proposed u-learning system can create a learning experience that both interests and engages students. Although QR-ULMPS is not mature enough to be used across a sundry of educational domains, it provides an innovative opportunity for teachers to integrate a novel teaching methodology that challenges traditional educational norms.", "paper_title": "Impact on Student Motivation by Using a QR-Based U-Learning Material Production System to Create Authentic Learning Experiences", "paper_id": "WOS:000367334900005"}
