The method is applicable to any kind of load and helps to find the optimal motor gearhead combination with respect to output torque, peak power, mass/size and/or cost. The input to the method is the load cycle and component data on candidate motors and gearheads. Output is a set of graphs of all motor/gear ratio combinations that can drive the given load. From these graphs it is easy to read out the peak power, motor torque and energy efficiency for all feasible motor/gear ratio combinations. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
