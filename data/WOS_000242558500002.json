In previous work, we have demonstrated how such interactions between web services can be modeled as feature interactions. In this paper, we outline a classification of web service feature interactions. The goals of this classification are to understand the scope of the feature interaction problem in the web services domain, and to propose a benchmark against which to assess the coverage of solutions to this problem. As there is no standard set of web services that one could use as examples, we illustrate the interactions using a fictitious e-commerce scenario. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
