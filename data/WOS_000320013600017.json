QR decomposition (QRD) is commonly used in many MIMO detection algorithms. In particular, sorted QR decomposition (SQRD) is an advanced algorithm that improves MIMO detection performance. The proposed detector uses SQRD to achieve better performance. To reduce the computational complexity, the received layers of each subcarrier are ordered by using the post SNR and are detected by DFE and QRD-M detector based on the order. Therefore, the proposed detector structure is varied according to the channel state. In other words, the proposed detector achieves a good tradeoff between complexity and performance. A simulation confirms the substantial performance improvements of the proposed adaptive detector with only slightly greater complexity than the conventional detector.", "paper_title": "A Reduced MIMO Detector Using Post SNR Ordering", "paper_id": "WOS:000320013600017"}
