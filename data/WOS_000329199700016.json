Excessive stresses at pen-implant area may result in bone failure. Finding the critical point at the implant-bone interface and evaluating the influence of implant diameter-to-length ratio on adjacent bone stresses makes it possible to select implant dimensions. For this, different cylindrical implants were numerically analysed using geometrical models generated from computed tomography images of mandible with osseointegrated implants. All materials were assumed to be linearly elastic and isotropic. Masticatory load was applied in its natural direction, oblique to occlusal plane. Maximum von Mises stresses were located around the implant neck at the critical point of its intersection with the plane of loading and were functions of implant diameter-to-length ratio. It was demonstrated that there exists a certain spectrum of diameter-to-length ratios, which will keep maximum bone stresses at a preset level chosen in accordance with patient's bone strength.", "paper_title": "Importance of diameter-to-length ratio in selecting dental implants: a methodological finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000329199700016"}
