This combinatorial construction shows that the asymptotic order of the cardinality of A(n) is related to the Stirling number {(kn)(n)}. Our bijective approach also yields an efficient random sampler, for the uniform distribution, of automata with n states, its complexity is O(n(3/2)), using the framework of Boltzmann samplers.
