Basing evaluations on a pool of existing designs or quickly delivered graphical specifications enables an Evolutionary Algorithm to become an open-ended system, where problem definitions can be kept open for fast updating. Through its flexible and open-ended aspects, the approach is able to develop draft layouts for an unlimited variety of tasks, which are not implied within the initial task definition. This enables a versatile computational layout design assistant, which can be easily adopted within regular design processes through usual graphic media. In this paper, the functioning of the approach is described and verified; the versatility of the resulting assistant, its intuitive graphical interface, and its usage scenario are demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Architectural Layout Evolution Through Similarity-Based Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366656800004"}
