This letter introduces a weighting function such that the pixel value is smoothly reduced to zero at the boundary of the image. Image moments of the weighted image are robust against quantization errors, and the moment invariants of the weighted image are more invariant than those of the unweighted image.", "paper_title": "Moment Invariants of the Weighted Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000276759500035"}
