PNN assigns the test data to the class with maximum likelihood compared with other classes. Likelihood of the test data to each training data is computed in the pattern layer through a kernel density estimation using a simple Bayesian rule. The kernel is usually a standard probability distribution function such as a Gaussian function. A spread parameter is used as a global parameter which determines the width of the kernel. The Bayesian rule in the pattern layer estimates the conditional probability of each class given an input vector without considering any probable local densities or heterogeneity in the training data. In this paper, an enhanced and generalized PNN (EPNN) is presented using local decision circles (LDCs) to overcome the aforementioned shortcoming and improve its robustness to noise in the data. Local decision circles enable EPNN to incorporate local information and non-homogeneity existing in the training population. The circle has a radius which limits the contribution of the local decision. In the conventional PNN the spread parameter can be optimized for maximum classification accuracy. In the proposed EPNN two parameters, the spread parameter and the radius of local decision circles, are optimized to maximize the performance of the model. Accuracy and robustness of EPNN are compared with PNN using three different benchmark classification problems, iris data, diabetic data, and breast cancer data, and five different ratios of training data to testing data: 90:10, 80:20, 70:30, 60:40, and 50:50. EPNN provided the most accurate results consistently for all ratios. Robustness of PNN and EPNN is investigated using different values of signal to noise ratio (SNR). Accuracy of EPNN is consistently higher than accuracy of PNN at different levels of SNR and for all ratios of training data to testing data.", "paper_title": "Enhanced probabilistic neural network with local decision circles: A robust classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000280549900002"}
