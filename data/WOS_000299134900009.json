Using Gestalt's laws of proximity, closure and good continuity as guidance for visual aesthetics, we require that our constructed shape be a minimal perimeter, non-self intersecting manifold. We find that this yields visually pleasing results. Our algorithm is distinct from earlier shape reconstruction approaches, in that it exploits the overlap between the desired shape and a related minimal graph, the Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST). Our algorithm segments the EMST to retain as much of it as required and then locally partitions and solves the problem efficiently. Comparison with some of the best currently known solutions shows that our algorithm yields better results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
