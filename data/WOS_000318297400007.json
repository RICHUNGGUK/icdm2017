In this paper we discuss how such plans are represented, maintained and constructed in our BML realizer Elckerlyc. We argue that behavior scheduling for Virtual Humans can be viewed as a constraint satisfaction problem, and show how Elckerlyc uses this view in its flexible behavior plan representation that allows one to make on-the-fly adjustments to behaviors while keeping the specified constraints between them intact.", "paper_title": "Multimodal plan representation for adaptable BML scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000318297400007"}
