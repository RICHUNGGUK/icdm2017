The proposed approach is intended to achieve not only fast signing/verifying transaction but also low transmission overhead. In particular, the consideration on the performance is one of key issues for increasingly widespread using of wireless communication since there are lots of limitations including scarce network resources, low computing power and limited energy of nodes. To meet such requirements, we take advantage of using a short-lived key(s) that allow an authentication system to overcome the performance degradation caused by applying highly expensive cryptographic primitives such as digital signature. The major concern of this paper, therefore, is to derive an appropriate length of a key and hash value without compromising the security of an authentication system.", "paper_title": "A short-lived key selection approach to authenticate data origin of multimedia stream", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300053"}
