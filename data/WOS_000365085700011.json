We consider networks described by time-varying weighted graphs and featuring generic linear interaction protocols. Sufficient conditions for the absence of Zeno behavior are derived and exponential convergence of a global normed error function is proven. Static networks are considered as a special case, wherein the existence of a lower bound for interevent times is also proven. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Event-Triggered Pinning Control of Switching Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365085700011"}
