Buchi and Landweber proved that the Church synthesis problem is decidable; moreover, they showed that if there is an operator F that solves the Church Synthesis Problem, then it can also be solved by an operator defined by a finite state automaton or equivalently by an MLO formula. We investigate a parameterized version of the Church synthesis problem. In this version psi might contain as a parameter a unary predicate P. We show that the Church synthesis problem for P is computable if and only if the monadic theory of < Nat,<, P > is decidable. We prove that the Buchi-Landweber theorem can be extended only to ultimately periodic parameters. However, the MLO-definability part of the Buchi-Landweber theorem holds for the parameterized version of the Church synthesis problem.", "paper_title": "THE CHURCH SYNTHESIS PROBLEM WITH PARAMETERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262642600009"}
