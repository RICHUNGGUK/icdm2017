Some traditional self-localization algorithms can provide a reasonable positioning accuracy only in a uniform and dense network, while for a nonuniform network the performance is not acceptable. In this paper, we presented a novel grid-based linear least squares (LLS) self-localization algorithm. The proposed algorithm uses the grid method to screen the anchors based on the distribution characteristic of a nonuniform network. Furthermore, by taking into consideration the quasi-uniform distribution of anchors in the area, we select suitable anchors to assist the localization. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can greatly enhance the localization accuracy of the anonymous nodes and impose less computation burden compared to traditional Trilateration and Multilateration.", "paper_title": "A Grid-Based Linear Least Squares Self-Localization Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000360167800001"}
