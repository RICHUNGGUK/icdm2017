This goal is best achieved by considering the Robinson property: a distance d (R) on X is Robinsonian if its matrix can be symmetrically permuted so that its elements do not decrease when moving away from the main diagonal along any row or column. If the distance d fails to satisfy the Robinson property, then we are lead to the problem of finding a reordering of d which is as close as possible to a Robinsonian distance. In this paper, we present a factor 16 approximation algorithm for the following NP-hard fitting problem: given a finite set X and a dissimilarity d on X, we wish to find a Robinsonian dissimilarity d (R) on X minimizing the l (a)-error aEuro-d-d (R) aEuro-(a)=max (x,yaX) {vertical bar d(x,y)-d (R) (x,y)vertical bar} between d and d (R) .", "paper_title": "Seriation in the Presence of Errors: A Factor 16 Approximation Algorithm for l (a)-Fitting Robinson Structures to Distances", "paper_id": "WOS:000287319100005"}
