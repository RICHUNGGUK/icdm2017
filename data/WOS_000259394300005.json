The algorithm uses information on geometrical parameters of straight lines found on the images and on distribution of color and/or brightness around these lines. Colors are taken into account by using the fuzzy logic technique. The result of the algorithm operation is a planar projective transformation (planar homography) matching approximately the images. In order to use the technique in algorithms of 3D scene reconstruction, an estimate of size of the window used for searching correspondent points after the coarse image registration is obtained.", "paper_title": "Preliminary coarse image registration by using straight lines found on them for constructing super resolution mosaics and 3D scene recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000259394300005"}
