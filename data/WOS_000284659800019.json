Here, we describe the motion of holes in silicon by also taking into account the non-parabolicity of the heavy and light bands. The model is still based on the moment method and the closure of the system of equations is obtained by using the maximum entropy principle. Comparisons are made with the results in [5], in the case of bulk silicon, in order to establish the importance of non-parabolicity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
