It incorporates a novel address mapping scheme called Biased Chinese Remainder Mapping (BCRM) to resolve the address mapping issue for memories of page interleaving, plus a simple and effective cache design to reduce extra ECC traffic. Our evaluation using SPEC CPU2006 benchmarks confirms the performance and power efficiency of the (ECC)-C-3 scheme for subranked memories as well as conventional memories.", "paper_title": "(ECC)-C-3: A Memory Error Protection Scheme with Novel Address Mapping for Subranked and Low-Power Memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000330509300011"}
