The advantage of our approach over the usual report pattern (average iterations to reach a predefined goal, success rates, and standard deviations) found in the current PSO literature is that it is possible to evaluate the performance of an algorithm on different application scenarios at the same time. The RLDs reported in this paper show some of the strengths and weaknesses of the studied algorithms and suggest ways of improving their performance.", "paper_title": "A comparison of particle swarm optimization algorithms based on run-length distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100001"}
