In such a context, Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) positioning is a particularly viable solution in terms of hardware and installation costs due to the ubiquity of WLAN infrastructures. This paper examines three aspects of the problem of indoor WLAN positioning using received signal strength (RSS). First, we show that, due to the variability of RSS features over space, a spatially localized positioning method leads to improved positioning results. Second, we explore the problem of access point (AP) selection for positioning and demonstrate the need for further research in this area. Third, we present a kernelized distance calculation algorithm for comparing RSS observations to RSS training records. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system leads to a 17 percent (0.56 m) improvement over the widely used K-nearest neighbor and histogram-based methods.", "paper_title": "Kernel-based positioning in Wireless Local Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000245757500010"}
