To achieve these goals, a H-CRAN is presented in this article as the advanced wireless access network paradigm, where cloud computing is used to fulfill the centralized large-scale cooperative processing for suppressing co-channel interferences. The state-of-the-art research achievements in the areas of system architecture and key technologies for H-CRANs are surveyed. Particularly, Node C as a new communication entity is defined to converge the existing ancestral base stations and act as the base band unit pool to manage all accessed remote radio heads. Also, the software-defined H-CRAN system architecture is presented to be compatible with software-defined networks. The principles, performance gains, and open issues of key technologies, including adaptive large-scale cooperative spatial signal processing, cooperative radio resource management, network function virtualization, and self-organization, are summarized. The major challenges in terms of fronthaul constrained resource allocation optimization and energy harvesting that may affect the promotion of H-CRANs are discussed as well.", "paper_title": "System Architecture and Key Technologies for 5G Heterogeneous Cloud Radio Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352106500002"}
