In particular, it is shown that all the standard pairs of adjacencies (namely the (4,8) and (8,4)-adjacencies in a\"currency sign(2), the (6,18), (18,6), (6,26), and (26,6)-adjacencies in a\"currency sign(3), and more generally the (2n,3 (n) -1) and (3 (n) -1,2n)-adjacencies in a\"currency sign (n) ) can then be correctly modelled in . Moreover, it is established that the digital fundamental group of a digital image in a\"currency sign (n) is isomorphic to the fundamental group of its corresponding image in , thus proving the topological correctness of the proposed approach. From these results, it becomes possible to establish links between topology-oriented methods developed either in classical digital spaces (a\"currency sign (n) ) or cubical complexes (), and to potentially unify some of them.", "paper_title": "Digital Imaging: A Unified Topological Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000304653600002"}
