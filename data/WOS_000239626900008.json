While significant progress has been made in formalising argument-based communication, (possibly adaptive) agent-level argumentation strategies as a practical integration of rational agent reasoning and inter-agent argumentation dialogues have received fairly little attention. In this paper we propose the use of the InFFrA framework in argument-based negotiation. This framework allows for a strategic and adaptive communication to achieve private goals within the limits of bounded rationality in open argumentation communities. The feasibility of the approach is illustrated in an agent-based web linkage scenario, showing that its performance is comparable to that of simple proposal-based negotiation while accommodating much stricter constraints regarding \"what can be said\" like those used in argumentation.", "paper_title": "Practical strategic reasoning and adaptation in rational argument-based negotiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626900008"}
