Feature selection has some merit regarding pattern recognition performance. Thus, we implemented a simulator called an 'IFS system' and the results of the IFS were applied to an emotion recognition system(ERS). Our innovative feature selection method was based on a Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and since it required responses from human users, it was denoted an 'Interactive Feature Selection'. By performing an IFS, we were able to obtain three top features and apply them to the ERS.", "paper_title": "The interactive feature selection method development for an ANN based emotion recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100031"}
