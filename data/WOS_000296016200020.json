To resolve this problem within the CVT methodology, in this paper we incorporate the information of local variation of colors/intensities and the length of boundaries into the energy functional and develop a new model called the Local Variation and Edge-Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (LVEWCVT) for image segmentation. Its mathematical formulation and practical implementations are also discussed and given. We test the LVEWCVT method on various type of segments and also compare it with several state-of-art algorithms using extensive segmentation examples, the results demonstrate excellent performance and competence of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Image Segmentation Using Local Variation and Edge-Weighted Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations", "paper_id": "WOS:000296016200020"}
