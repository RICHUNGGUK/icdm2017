Via fuzzy modeling of nonlinear systems, the proposed piecewise fuzzy anti-windup dynamic output feedback controller is designed based on piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions. It is shown that with sector conditions, robust output feedback stabilization of an input-constrained nonlinear process can be formulated as a convex optimization problem subject to linear matrix inequalities. Simulation study on a strongly nonlinear continuously stirred tank reactor (CSTR) benchmark plant is given to show the performance of the proposed anti-windup dynamic compensator.", "paper_title": "Piecewise Fuzzy Anti-Windup Dynamic Output Feedback Control of Nonlinear Processes With Amplitude and Rate Actuator Saturations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265089700001"}
