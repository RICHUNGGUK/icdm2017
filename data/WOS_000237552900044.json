After the purely geometric constraints associated with the silhouettes found in each image have been used to construct a coarse surface approximation in the form of a visual hull, photoconsistency constraints are enforced in three consecutive steps: (1) the rims where the surface grazes the visual hull are first identified through dynamic programming; (2) with the rims now fixed, the visual hull is carved using graph cuts to globally optimize the photoconsistency of the surface and recover its main features; (3) an iterative (local) refinement step is finally used to recover fine surface details. The proposed approach has been implemented, and experiments with six real data sets are presented, along with qualitative comparisons with several state-of-the-art image-based-modeling algorithms.", "paper_title": "Carved visual hulls for image-based modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000237552900044"}
