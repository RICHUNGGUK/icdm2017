For a low-cost and low-power demand, we consider the plain compressive sampling and low sampling rates and propose a Compressed Video Sensing scheme. As a result, most burden of video processing can be shifted to the decoder which employs a hybrid hypothesis prediction method in reconstruction. The Elastic net-based multi-hypothesis mode, one part of the prediction method, combines the multi-hypothesis prediction and the elastic net regression together. And in the process of decoding, either this mode or the single-hypothesis one is implemented based on the threshold which is selected from [1e-11, 1). Both of the prediction modes are carried out in the measurement domain and a residual reconstruction as the final step is executed to accomplish the recovery. According to the performance presented by the simulation results, the proposed multi-hypothesis mode provides a better reconstruction quality than the other multi-hypothesis ones and the proposed scheme outperforms the observed state-of-the-art schemes for compressed-sensing video reconstruction at low sampling rates.", "paper_title": "An elastic net-based hybrid hypothesis method for compressed video sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500018"}
