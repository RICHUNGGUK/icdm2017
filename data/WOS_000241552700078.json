For each incoming frame, a likelihood image of the target is created according to the automatically chosen best feature, where the target's area turns into a blob. The scale of this blob can be determined based on the local maxima of differential scale-space filters. We employ the QP_TR trust region algorithm to search for the local maxima of orientational multi-scale normalized Laplacian filter of the likelihood image to locate the target as well as to determine its scale and orientation. Based on the tracking results of sequence examples, the novel method has been proven to be capable of describing the target more accurately and thus achieves much better tracking precision.", "paper_title": "QP_TR trust region blob tracking through scale-space with automatic selection of features", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700078"}
