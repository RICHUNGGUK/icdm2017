The wide spread use of signcryption in a mobile computing environment, however, is accompanied by an increased risk of private key exposure. This paper addresses the issue of key exposure by proposing a key-insulated signcryption technique. We define a security model for key-insulated signcryption and prove that the key-insulated signcryption technique is provably secure in the security model.", "paper_title": "Key-Insulated Signcryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000327374600002"}
