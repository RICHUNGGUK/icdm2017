To tackle this challenging issue, in this paper, we first propose an efficient IND-CCA2-secure public key encryption scheme based on coding theory. We then use the provable security technique to formally prove the security of the proposed scheme is tightly related to the syndrome decoding (SD) problem in the random oracle model. Compared with the previously reported schemes, the proposed scheme is merited with simple construction and fast encryption speed.
