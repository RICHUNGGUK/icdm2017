Based on the standard model, the scheme can achieve constant-size public parameters, the public parameters do not impose additional limitations on the functionality of the systems (unbounded) and either a small universe size or a bound on the size of attribute sets avoid to fixed at setup. The scheme is proved by using the dual system encryption argument and the four static assumptions which do not depend on the number of queries the attacker makes. The analysis results show that the scheme of this paper is selective secure.", "paper_title": "A Key-Policy Attribute-Based Broadcast Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000325785200004"}
