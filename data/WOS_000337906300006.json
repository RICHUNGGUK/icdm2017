Sufficient conditions for global convergence of the proposed neural networks are provided based on Lyapunov stability. Compared with the existing neural networks for variational inequalities and optimization, the proposed neural networks have lower model complexities. In addition, some improved criteria for global convergence are given. Compared with our previous work, a design parameter has been added in the projection neural network models, and it results in some improved performance. The simulation results on numerical examples are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness and characteristics of the proposed neural networks.", "paper_title": "One-Layer Continuous- and Discrete-Time Projection Neural Networks for Solving Variational Inequalities and Related Optimization Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337906300006"}
