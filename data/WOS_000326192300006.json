As a consequence, the integration of heterogeneous devices into the same system is a very difficult task which usually requires ad hoc solutions. For this reason, different interoperability standards have been proposed during the last two decades. In this paper we use a novel interoperability protocol: Digital Home Compliant (DHC) which is focused on the solution of the interoperability problem between domotic and robotic devices. In particular, we have implemented the DHC-Groups module in a Roomba which allows a robot group (hive) to perform collaborative tasks. Finally, an experiment is shown in order to test the DHC-Groups module and show its possibilities.", "paper_title": "Collaborative Tasks Between Robots Based on the Digital Home Compliant Protocol over UPnP", "paper_id": "WOS:000326192300006"}
