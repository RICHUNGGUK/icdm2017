First, a scene is acquired via a pose camera, which annotates each image with navigation information using GPS and a digital compass. An adjacency graph was built to determine the approximate spatial adjacency given roughly known poses of each image sequences, to organize the nodes into a set of sequences and to access the nodes. The camera positions are obtained by using a standard Structure from Motion algorithm. After the pose estimation, the user-assistant modeling approach is used based on a half-edge data structure. For accuracy and validity in the approach, some experimental results are shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
