However, no robust normal basis multiplier has been proposed in the literature. Therefore, this investigation presents a semisystolic Gaussian normal basis multiplier. Based on the proposed Gaussian normal basis multiplier, both concurrent error detection and correction capabilities can be easily achieved using time redundancy technology with no hardware modification.", "paper_title": "Concurrent Error Detection and Correction in Gaussian Normal Basis Multiplier over GF(2(m))", "paper_id": "WOS:000265412200011"}
