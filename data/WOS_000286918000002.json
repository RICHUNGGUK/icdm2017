These neighborhoods are defined by restricted versions of a new dynamic programming formulation for the problem and provide a systematic way of searching neighborhood structures based on node-level exchanges. We have also developed several local search methods that are based on the new neighborhoods. Computational experiments for a set of benchmark instances with up to 80 nodes show that the more elaborate methods produce in a quite fast way, heuristic solutions that are, for all cases, within 2% of the optimum.", "paper_title": "Restricted dynamic programming based neighborhoods for the hop-constrained minimum spanning tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000286918000002"}
