For cloud providers, minimizing the number of used resources is one of the main services that such environments must ensure. Cloud customers are also concerned with the minimization of used resources in the cloud since they want to reduce their invoice. Thus, resource management in the cloud should be considered by the cloud provider at the virtualization level and by the cloud customers at the application level. Many research works investigate resource management strategies in these two levels. Most of them study virtual machine consolidation (according to the virtualized infrastructure utilization rate) at the virtualized level and dynamic application sizing (according to its workload) at the application level. However, these strategies are studied separately. In this article, we show that virtual machine consolidation and dynamic application sizing are complementary. We show the efficiency of the combination of these two strategies, in reducing resource usage and keeping an application's Quality of Service. Our demonstration is done by comparing the evaluation of three resource management strategies (implemented at the virtualization level only, at the application level only, or complementary at both levels) in a private cloud infrastructure, hosting typical JEE web applications (evaluated with the RUBiS benchmark).
