Let k be the parameter which represents the size of the solution. The core of the technique is to first obtain a tight 18k bound (for the method) on the parameterized solution search space, which is done through a mixed global rules and local rules, and via an inverse amortized analysis. Then we apply additional data-reduction rules to obtain a 78k kernel for the problem, which is again tight for the method. Combined with the known algorithm using bounded degree search, we obtain the best Fixed-Parameterized-Tractable algorithm for CMSR to this date, running in O (2.36(k)k(2) + n(2)) time.
