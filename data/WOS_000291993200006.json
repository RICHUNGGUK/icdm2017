The key challenge to this integration stems from the distinct and often incompatible roles geometric representations play, respectively, in design and analysis. This paper critically examines and compares known mesh-based and meshfree approaches to CAD/CAE integration, focusing on the basic tasks and components required for building fully integrated engineering applications. For each task, we identify the fundamental requirements and challenges and discuss how they may be met by known techniques and proposed solutions.
