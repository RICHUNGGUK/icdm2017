Several learning frameworks, such as the traditional supervised learning. can be regarded as degenerated versions of MIML. Therefore, an intuitive way to solve MIML problem is to identify its equivalence in its degenerated versions. However, this identification process would make useful information encoded in training examples get lost and thus impair the learning algorithm's performance. In this paper, RBF neural networks are adapted to learn from MIML examples. Connections between instances and labels are directly exploited in the process of first layer clustering and second layer optimization. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance on two real-world MIML tasks. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
