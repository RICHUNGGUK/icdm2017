The base shear of steel frames was formulated in terms of the number of bays, number of storey, soil type, and situation of braced or unbraced. A classical GP model was developed to benchmark the GP/SA model. The comprehensive database used for the development of the correlations was obtained from finite element analysis. A parametric analysis was carried out to evaluate the sensitivity of the base shear to the variation of the influencing parameters. The GP/SA and classical GP correlations provide a better prediction performance than the widely used UBC code and a neural network-based model found in the literature. The developed correlations may be used as quick checks on solutions developed by deterministic analyses.", "paper_title": "A robust predictive model for base shear of steel frame structures using a hybrid genetic programming and simulated annealing method", "paper_id": "WOS:000300280100022"}
