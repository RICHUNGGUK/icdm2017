Reconfigurable hardware, including FPGAs, is an attractive platform for implementing vision algorithms due to its ability to exploit parallelism often found in these algorithms, and due to the speed with which applications can be developed as compared to hardware. The system outputs 8-bit, subpixel disparity estimates for 256 x 360 pixel images at 30 fps. A local-weighted phase correlation algorithm for stereo disparity [Fleet, D. J.: {Int. Conf. Syst. Man Cybernetics 1:48-54 (1994)] is implemented. Despite the complexity of performing correlations on multiscale, multiorientation phase data, the system runs as much as 300 times faster in hardware than its software implementation. This paper describes the hardware platform used, the algorithm, and the issues encountered during its hardware implementation. Of particular interest is the implementation of multiscale, steerable filters, which are widely used in computer vision algorithms. Several trade-offs (reducing the number of filter orientations from three to two, using fixed-point computation, changing the location of one localized low-pass filter, and using L1 instead of L2 norms) were required to both fit the design into the available hardware and to achieve video-rate processing. Finally, results from the system are given both for synthetic data sets as well as several standard stereo-pair test images.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable hardware implementation of a phase-correlation stereoalgorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000236627400003"}
