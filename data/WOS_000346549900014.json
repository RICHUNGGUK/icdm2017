Firstly, the structural responses and power spectral density under stationary and random excitations are calculated using pseudo excitation method. Then, the sensitivities of power spectral density with respect to the structural damage parameters are obtained. Finally, the finite element model updating method is adopted to identify the structural damages from the calculated and the simulated measured power spectral density. Two numerical examples demonstrate the satisfactory identification results obtained from the present method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
