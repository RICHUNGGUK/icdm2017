On the other side, the emotional learning from brain model has shown good performance and is characterized by high generalization property. New approach is developed to deal with low computational and memory resources and can be used with the largest available data sets. The scope of paper is to reveal the advantages of emotional learning interpretations of brain as a purposeful forecasting system designed to warning; and to make a fair comparison between the successful neural (MLP) and neurofuzzy (ANFIS) approaches in their best structures and according to prediction accuracy, generalization, and computational complexity. The auroral electrojet (AE) index are used as practical examples of chaotic time series and introduced method used to make predictions and warning of geomagnetic disturbances and geomagnetic storms based on AE index.", "paper_title": "Learning based brain emotional intelligence as a new aspect for development of an alarm system", "paper_id": "WOS:000255034600002"}
