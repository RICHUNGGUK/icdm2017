However, great challenges are also met due to the network-induced imperfections. Such network-induced imperfections are handled as various constraints, which should appropriately be considered in the analysis and design of NCSs. In this paper, the main methodologies suggested in the literature to cope with typical network-induced constraints, namely time delays, packet losses and disorder, time-varying transmission intervals, competition of multiple nodes accessing networks, and data quantization are surveyed; the constraints suggested in the literature on the first two types of constraints are updated in different categorizing ways; and those on the latter three types of constraints are extended.", "paper_title": "Network-Induced Constraints in Networked Control Systems-A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600043"}
