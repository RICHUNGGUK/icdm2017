A convex analysis method is developed to estimate the total orientation WFW of CDPMs. The effect of the distribution of winches and hinges on the WFW is investigated for spatial 6-DOF redundantly restrained CDPMs, and the optimal size of the CDPMs can be obtained by the grouped coordinate descent (GCD) method. The optimization algorithm is implemented on a 6-DOF spatial CDPM with eight cables. The simulation results indicate that the mechanical property of CDPMs can be improved by optimizing the distribution of winches and hinges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
