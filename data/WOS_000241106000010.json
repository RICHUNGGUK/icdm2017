In fact there are situations where vague relations are more appropriate. In this paper, fuzzy clustering based on vague relations is investigate. On the basis of max-t & min-s compositions, we make a further extension of n-step procedure. With the proposed n-step procedure, a similarity vague relation matrix is obtained by beginning with a proximity vague relation matrix. Then a clustering algorithm is proposed for the similarity vague relation matrix.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy clustering based on vague relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000010"}
