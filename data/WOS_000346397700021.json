Also, numerical modelling of experiments were carried out by using FEM software, PLAXIS 3D. Hardening soil model was employed to model the sand, and elastic model was used for the pile and the raft. Soil parameters were estimated from consolidated drained triaxial tests carried on the sand samples and pile parameters were estimated from simple bending tests. It is seen that the behaviour of piled raft is considerably influenced by the interaction of the raft and the piles, and that it is not possible to estimate piled raft behaviour by examining its components individually.
