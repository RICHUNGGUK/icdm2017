In this sense we make a step in the direction of quadratic discriminance analysis in statistics where classwise variance matrices are used for class adapted discriminance functions. We demonstrateb the performance of the model for a medical application.", "paper_title": "Learning Vector Quantization classification with local relevance determination for medical data", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000063"}
