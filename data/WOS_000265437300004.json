In this paper, we introduce a conceptual system model. According to this model, we present a physical structure model and a multiagent system based software architecture in the following step. We also give a data management mechanism model for the AmI environment. To evaluate our models, we implement them in a prototype \"Smart-Oven\" system. Our models are suitable for rapid system modeling and development; they,can help the designers and the programmers develop new AmI applications more rapidly and conveniently. Using the simplified AmI physical structure model, the physical AmI supporting environment can be established easily and rapidly. Via the software architecture and data management model, AmI application systems achieve flexibility, service discovery, and interoperability, which are the most common technical limitations in other related systems. Furthermore, our models can also help the terminal users configure their own AmI system by themselves. As a result of the works carried out in this paper, one can simplify the procedures and enhance the efficiency of AmI applications system design and development.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Ambient Intelligence Application System: Concept, Software, Data, and Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437300004"}
