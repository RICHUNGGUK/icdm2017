As a part of this experience, we analyzed the reports elaborated by students in three consecutive academic years. In this article we present our findings, which include several unexpected misunderstandings of students. We also describe the interventions addressed, which resulted in the removal of the most severe misunderstanding. The main contributions of the article are two-fold. On the one hand, we identify several misunderstandings on basic optimization concepts that underlie greedy algorithms. On the other hand, we present the successful removal of misconceptions thanks to an adequate combination of: didactic method, educational software, scheduling of classes and lab sessions, and teaching materials.", "paper_title": "Identification and Removal of Misconceptions on Optimization Concepts Underlying Greedy Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000209590100004"}
