The purpose of this paper is to analyze the electromagnetic excited structure-borne sound and air-borne noise of an AC servo drive. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents the required steps for the multiphysics acoustic simulation of electrical machines to evaluate its noise behaviour. This numerical approach starts with the electromagnetic force-wave simulation. The computation by a structure dynamic model determines the deformation of the mechanical structure due to the force-waves. The final step of the simulation approach consists of the computation of the acoustic radiation. Findings - For the electromagnetic simulation analytical and numerical methods are combined to gain some acceleration of the entire multiphysics simulation approach. This combination offers additionally a detailed understanding of the noise generation mechanism in electrical machines. Originality/value - Particular attention is paid to the structural-dynamic model. Modelling of microstructures, such as the laminated iron core or insulated coils, is memory and computational expensive. A systematic material homogenisation technique, based on experimental- and numerical modal analyses, yields a higher accuracy at lower computational costs when compared to standard numerical approaches. The presented multiphysics simulation is validated by measurements. The methods are presented by means of a case study.", "paper_title": "Simulation of acoustic radiation of an AC servo drive", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700017"}
