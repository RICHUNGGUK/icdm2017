In this paper, we propose an enhanced swarm intelligence clustering (ESIC) method to select hidden layer neurons, and then, train a cosine RBFNN based on the gradient descent learning process. Also, we apply this new method for classification of deep Web sources. Experimental results show that the average Precision, Recall and F of our ESIC-based RBFNN classifier achieve higher performance than BP, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and OLS RBF for our deep Web sources classification problems.", "paper_title": "An enhanced swarm intelligence clustering-based RBFNN classifier and its application in deep Web sources classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000292505400015"}
