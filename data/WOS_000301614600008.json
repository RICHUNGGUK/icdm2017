Variable-weight optical orthogonal codes (OOCs) can be used for OCDMA networks supporting multiple quality of services (QoS). Most constructions for optimal variable-weight OOCs have focused on the case where the number of distinct Hamming weights of all code-words is equal to two, and the codewords of weight 3 are normally included. In this letter, four explicit constructions of optimal (v, {4, 5, 6}, 1, Q)-OOCs are presented, and more new optimal (v,{4, 5, 6}, 1, Q)-OOCs are obtained via recursive constructions. These improve the existing results on optimal variable-weight OOCs with at least three distinct Hamming weights and minimum Hamming weight 4.", "paper_title": "Constructions of Optimal (v, {4, 5, 6}, 1, Q)-OOCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000301614600008"}
