BLG was chosen, since it is a well-characterized model protein, for which structural and folding properties have been widely investigated by X-ray and NMR. MD trajectories were analyzed not only in terms of standard progress variables, such as backbone H-bonds, gyration radius width, secondary structure elements, but also through the scrutiny of interactions and dynamical behavior of specific key residues previously pointed out and investigated by NMR and belonging to a well known hydrophobic cluster. MD trajectories simulated in different unfolding conditions suggest that urea destabilizes BLG structure weakening protein::protein hydrophobic interactions and the hydrogen bond network. The early unfolding events, better observed at higher temperature, affect both secondary and tertiary structure of the protein. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
