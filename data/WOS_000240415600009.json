Topologically irregular regions of the network are approximated by implicit surfaces, which are used to generate split curves, which subdivide the regions into triangular and/or rectangular sub-regions. The subdivided regions are then interpolated with Bezier patches. We analyze various singular cases of the G(1) condition that is to be met by the interpolation and propose a new G(1) continuity condition using linear and quartic scalar weight functions. Using this condition, a curve network can be interpolated without modification at 4-valent nodes with two collinear tangent vectors, even in the presence of singularities. We demonstrate our approach in a ship hull. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
