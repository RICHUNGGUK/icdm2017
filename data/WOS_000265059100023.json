It is further shown that methods constructed in this way are multi-symplectic and preserve exactly the discrete charge conservation law provided appropriate boundary conditions. In the aim of the commonly practical applications, a novel 2-order-one-parameter family of explicit multi-symplectic schemes through such concatenation is constructed, and the numerous numerical experiments and comparisons are presented to show the efficiency and some advantages of the our newly derived methods. Furthermore, some high-order explicit multi-symplectic schemes of such category are given as well, good performances and efficiencies and some significant advantages for preserving the important invariants are investigated by means of numerical experiments.
