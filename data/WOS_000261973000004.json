The equations in use have a solid theoretical meaning and are derived from a porous media technique, which is a special branch of the more general mixture theory. The effect of chemical action is ignored, making the presented model suitable to be implemented into codes dealing solely with chemical equilibrium. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
