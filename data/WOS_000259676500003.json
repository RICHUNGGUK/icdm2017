Current TCP congestion control algorithms may lead to the premature termination of the slow-start phase, resulting in an under-utilization of network resources and a corresponding degradation of the network performance. Consequently, this paper develops an algorithm which estimates the network conditions during the startup phase and rapidly expands the congestion window to match the available bandwidth. The simulation results confirm that the proposed TCP startup procedure improves the throughput of the modified TCP connection while remaining fair to other active TCP implementations in terms of bandwidth consumption.", "paper_title": "Modified TCP startup procedure for large bandwidth-delay networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259676500003"}
