Some of the concepts are defined, such as the distance between two 2-tuple linguistic variables, the expectation level of alternative, the achievement scale, the alternative comprehensive scale under linguistic environment. Based on these concepts, we establish some linear programming models, through which the decision maker interacts with the analyst. Furthermore, we establish a practical interactive approach for selecting the most desirable alternative(s). The interactive process can be realized by giving and revising the achievement scale and comprehensive scale of alternatives till the achievement scale and the comprehensive scale are achieved to the decision maker's request. Finally, an illustrative example is also given.", "paper_title": "An Interactive Approach Based on Alternative Achievement Scale and Alternative Comprehensive Scale for Multiple Attribute Decision Making under Linguistic Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000313101300008"}
