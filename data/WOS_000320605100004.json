[G. Chen, L. Chacon, D. C. Barnes, An energy-and charge-conserving, implicit, electrostatic particle-in-cell algorithm, Journal of Computational Physics 230 (2011) 7018-7036]. The approach computes particle orbits exactly for a given piece-wise linear electric field. The resulting PIC algorithm maintains the exact charge and energy conservation properties of the original algorithm, but with improved performance (both in efficiency and robustness against the number of particles and timestep). We demonstrate the advantageous properties of the scheme with a challenging multiscale numerical test case, the ion acoustic wave. Using the analytical mover as a reference, we demonstrate that the choice of error estimator in the Crank-Nicolson mover has significant impact on the overall performance of the implicit PIC algorithm. The generalization of the approach to the multi-dimensional case is outlined, based on a novel and simple charge conserving interpolation scheme.
