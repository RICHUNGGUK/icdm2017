The robots path planning based on potential field method are accomplished and a novel formation controller for mobile robots based on potential field method is proposed. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through simulation and experimental studies by applying them to control the formation of four e-Pucks robots (low-cost mobile robot platform). Also the proposed method is compared with Simulated Annealing, Improved Harmony Search and Cuckoo Optimization Algorithm methods and the experimental results, higher performance and fast convergence time to the best solution of the ARO demonstrated that this optimization method is appropriate for real time control application.
