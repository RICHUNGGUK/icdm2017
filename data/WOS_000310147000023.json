Previous research in this field has focused mainly on studying isolated instances of NVVI (such as mouse cursor control in computer games) and their performance. This paper presents a study with 36 elderly users in which basic NVVI vocal gestures (commands) were ranked by their perceived fatigue, satisfaction, and efficiency. The results of this study inspired a set of NVVI gesture design guidelines that are also presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "A Comparative Study of Pitch-Based Gestures in Nonverbal Vocal Interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000310147000023"}
