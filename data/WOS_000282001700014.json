Most previous works on cooperative communications focus on the physical layer aspects such as coding, modulation, and transceiver signal processing techniques. In this work, we study the advantages of user cooperation from a MAC layer perspective and devise queueing strategies to exploit cooperative gains in random access networks. Based on the conventional slotted ALOHA protocol, we propose a simple cooperative transmission mechanism for a two-user cooperative pair. We derive the two-user stability region of the proposed system and show the improvements compared to noncooperative systems. The benefits can be attributed to both physical layer cooperation, where users with good channels may relay for those with bad channels, and MAC layer cooperation, where system parameters can be chosen to enhance cooperation and reduce competition. Then, we extend the proposed strategy to a finite-user system that consists of multiple cooperative pairs. By treating each pair as a single transmission entity, we derive inner bounds for the finite-user stability region and propose a ranking system to characterize the transmission entities' relative tendency of being stable (or unstable).", "paper_title": "Exploiting Cooperative Advantages in Slotted ALOHA Random Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282001700014"}
