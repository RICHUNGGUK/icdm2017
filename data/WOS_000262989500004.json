The current study explored the potential moderating effect of mood on media equation behaviour. Specifically, the study assessed whether participants' tendency to stereotype when interacting with a computer varied as a function of mood. Seventy-six undergraduate students were exposed to either a positive or negative mood manipulation and then completed a computer-based tutorial on car engines. The tutorial was presented using either a male or female synthesised voice. Participants' affective state, attitudes and opinions were assessed via questionnaire. Female participants in a positive mood showed a greater propensity to gender-stereotype computers than female participants in a negative mood, suggesting that media equation behaviour is more likely to result when people are in a mindless state. Male participants, however, did not show the same pattern of behaviour.", "paper_title": "Exploring mindlessness as an explanation for the media equation: a study of stereotyping in computer tutorials", "paper_id": "WOS:000262989500004"}
