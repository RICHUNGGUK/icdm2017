Among the existing decomposition approaches, one may cite the use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) to combine pairwise classifiers. This work presents a study on the influence of the DAG structure in the performance obtained in multiclass problems when Support Vector Machines are used in the induction of the binary predictors.", "paper_title": "Design of directed acyclic graph multiclass structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000253142500010"}
