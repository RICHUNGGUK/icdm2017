More precisely, the formulas of the (a)-coalgebra maps (2) and (3) using the notion of AT-model of a digital image, and the HPT technique are implemented. The method has been tested on some specific examples, showing the usefulness of this computational tool for distinguishing 3 digital images.", "paper_title": "Searching high order invariants in computer imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000304117800003"}
