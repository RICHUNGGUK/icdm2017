The key management is the important factor to ensure the security of the encrypted database. But some current schemes of the key management have some security problems and are easy to be attacked. Face to the problems, a new proposed scheme about the key management base on XML is proposed. A XML file that has the tree structure is used to manage the working key that is protected by the primary key. It can not only manage the working key efficiently, but also enhance the security of the encrypted database.", "paper_title": "THE KEY MANAGEMENT OF THE ENCRYPTED DATABASE BASED ON XML", "paper_id": "WOS:000267923200014"}
