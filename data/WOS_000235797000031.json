The main idea is to utilize the selected shrinkage function to the non-negative sparse components to remove noises hidden in art image. This method is evaluated by values of the normalized mean squared error (MSE) and signal to noise ratio (SNR). Compared with other denoising methods, the simulation results show that the NNSC shrinkage technique is indeed effective and efficient. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
