We focus on the creation of both methods by revisiting two results by Bar-Yehuda and Even-the linear time primal-dual approximation algorithm for set cover, and its local ratio interpretation. We also follow the evolution of the two methods by discussing more recent studies.", "paper_title": "A tale of two methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082200009"}
