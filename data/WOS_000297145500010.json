The software engineering literature describes several techniques to choose among architectural alternatives, but it gives no clear guidance on which technique is more suitable than another, and in which circumstances. As such, there is no systematic way for software engineers to choose among decision-making techniques for resolving tradeoffs in architecture design. In this article, we provide a comparison of existing decision-making techniques, aimed to guide architects in their selection. The results show that there is no \"best\" decision-making technique; however, some techniques are more susceptible to specific difficulties. Hence architects should choose a decision-making technique based on the difficulties that they wish to avoid. This article represents a first attempt to reason on meta-decision-making, that is, the issue of deciding how to decide.", "paper_title": "Decision-Making Techniques for Software Architecture Design: A Comparative Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000297145500010"}
