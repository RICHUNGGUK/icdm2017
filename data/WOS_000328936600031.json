To efficiently deal with the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multiattribute decision making problem with partially or completely unknown weight information, we construct several optimization models based on minimizing the distance between each alternative and positive ideal solution to obtain the optimal weight of each attribute. Also by employing the weighted grey relational coefficient of each alternative with respect to the ideal solution, the full ranking of all the alternatives can be obtained and the most desirable one can be selected.", "paper_title": "An enhanced grey relational analysis method for interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multiattribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000328936600031"}
