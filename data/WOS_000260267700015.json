Split local absorbing boundary (SLAB) conditions are obtained by the operator splitting method, then the original problem is reduced to an initial boundary value problem on a bounded computational domain, which can be solved by the finite difference method. Several numerical examples are provided to show the advantages and effectiveness of the given method, and sortie interesting collision behaviors are also observed.
