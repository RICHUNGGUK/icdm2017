Efforts have thus concentrated on personalized search that takes account of user preferences. A new concept is introduced towards this direction; search based on ranking of local set of categories that comprise a user search profile. New algorithms are presented that utilize web page categories to personalize search results. Series of user-based experiments show that the proposed solutions are efficient. Finally, we extend the application of our techniques in the design of topic-focused crawlers, which can be considered an alternative personalized search. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
