By using the frame buffer and Voronoi diagram, we achieve a rapid simplification of large-scale vector maps while keeping their original topological relationships. With the simplified maps, we establish level-of-detail vector map models. In the detailed level, we use the stencil shadow volume approach to render the map accurately, and in the coarse level we use substitute techniques to render the map approximately yet more quickly. The method proposed in this paper is universally applicable to rendering vector maps on various LOD terrain models, and the overlaying performance is independent of the complexity of underlying terrain surfaces. By use of the view frustum culling and sub-region index techniques, the impact of complexity of vector maps is reduced, and the rendering time is restricted to a certain scope. Thereby, we can achieve seamless and rapid rendering of large-scale vector maps on LOD terrain surfaces.", "paper_title": "An efficient rendering method for large vector data on large terrain models", "paper_id": "WOS:000278159000003"}
