The deterministic fluid model serves as an approximation for the corresponding non-Markovian stochastic network of many-server queues with Markovian routing, experiencing periods of overloading at the queues. In this paper we develop a new algorithm for the previous model and generalize the model to include non-exponential service-time distributions. In this paper we report results of implementing the algorithms and studying their computational complexity. We also conduct simulation experiments to confirm that the algorithms are effective in computing the performance functions and that these performance functions provide useful approximations for the corresponding stochastic models.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for Time-Varying Networks of Many-Server Fluid Queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000331086100005"}
