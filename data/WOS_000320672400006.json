A normal curve is a finite set of disjoint normal paths and normal cycles. We describe an algorithm to \"trace\" a normal curve in time, where is the complexity of the surface triangulation and is the number of times the curve crosses edges of the triangulation. In particular, our algorithm runs in polynomial time even when the number of crossings is exponential in . Our tracing algorithm computes a new cellular decomposition of the surface with complexity ; the traced curve appears in the 1-skeleton of the new decomposition as a set of simple disjoint paths and cycles. We apply our abstract tracing strategy to two different classes of normal curves: abstract curves represented by normal coordinates, which record the number of intersections with each edge of the surface triangulation, and simple geodesics, represented by a starting point and direction in the local coordinate system of some triangle. Our normal-coordinate algorithms are competitive with and conceptually simpler than earlier algorithms by Schaefer et al. (Proceedings of 8th International Conference Computing and Combinatorics.
