On the basis of expressing the metric of Bertoluzza et al. [C. Bertoluzza, N. Corral, A. Salas, On a new class of distances between fuzzy numbers, Mathware Soft Comput. 2 (1995) 71-84] in terms of the mid points and spreads of the corresponding intervals we construct new families of metrics on the family of all d-dimensional compact convex sets as well as on the family of all d-dimensional compact convex fuzzy sets. It is shown that these metrics not only fulfill many good properties, but also that they are easy to calculate and easy to manage for statistical purposes, and therefore, useful from the practical point of view.
