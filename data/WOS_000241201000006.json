In order to manage risk and uncertainty, a software project uncertainty management approach based on a generalized stochastic Petri net is proposed. It consists of two main components: model building based on a Petri net and a Markov process algorithm. The technique is presented with an example. Finally, the proposed model is demonstrated with a real-world case.", "paper_title": "Modeling uncertainties involved with software development with a stochastic Petri net", "paper_id": "WOS:000241201000006"}
