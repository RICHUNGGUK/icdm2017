Design/methodology/approach - This study utilizes a questionnaire technique to validate the proposed integrated model. Structural equation modeling also validated the model. Findings - All dimensions in the construct of organizational culture positively impact KCP. However, the formalized organizational structure appears to have a positive impact on KCP, while the autonomous organizational structure did not. This study also finds that KCP has a positive impact on both task outcomes and contextual job performance. Research limitations/implications - The integrated model, which served to examine the impact of KM enablers on KCP, from the standpoints of organizational culture and organizational structure, along with the impact of KCP on job performance, has improved understanding of the relationships among KM enablers, KCP, and job performance. Practical implications - Firms should carefully consider methods for adjusting internal structural designs or institute various mechanisms to promote the use of KM to maintain the organization's long-term competitive advantage. Originality/value - The model contributes to firms' understanding the influence of knowledge enablers on KCP, and provides a KM performance index for assessment of individual performance. Research results can provide enterprises with guidance for implementing initiatives for KM initiatives.", "paper_title": "Enablers and processes for effective knowledge management", "paper_id": "WOS:000341781300004"}
