In this article, we present a least square regression algorithm based on l(p)-coefficient regularization. Comparing with the classical regularized least square regression, the new algorithm is different in the regularization term. Our primary focus is on the error analysis of the algorithm. An explicit learning rate is derived under some ordinary assumptions.", "paper_title": "Least Square Regression with l(p)-Coefficient Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000284003900009"}
