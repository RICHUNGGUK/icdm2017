The problem is formulated as a necessity measure optimization model. It is shown that the problem can be reduced to a semi-infinite programming problem and solved by a combination of a bisection method and a relaxation procedure. An algorithm in which the bisection method and the relaxation procedure converge simultaneously is proposed. A simple numerical example is given to illustrate the solution procedure.
