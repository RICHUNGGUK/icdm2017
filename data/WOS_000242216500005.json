In this paper, we consider step-down closed testing procedures on the basis of pairwise and Helmert contrasts suggested by Tamhane et al. [ Tamhane, A. C., Hochberg, Y., and Dunnett, C. W., 1996, Multiple test procedures for dose finding. Biometrics, 52, 21 - 37.] for the situation where one wishes to make all such MED identifications simultaneously in each of several groups. An example is given to illustrate the proposed tests. The Monte Carlo studies are further implemented to compare the relative error rate and power performances of the proposed tests.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous identifications of the minimum effective dose in each of several groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000242216500005"}
