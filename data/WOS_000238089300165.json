The key technology of digitalized protection for cultural relic and virtual museum construction has been expatiated. The application of stereo photography and virtual reality technology in digitalized protection of cultural relic and virtual museum construction has been shown. The principle of stereo display has been explained in detail. The key technical problem of virtual reality used in digitalized protection of cultural relic has been expounded, including several important aspects such as 3D scanning and modeling for cultural relic, texture mapping of virtual cultural relic, technology of human-machine interaction to the virtual museum scene, etc. The problem about the mode of management, maintenance and working on virtual museum has been also introduced in this paper.", "paper_title": "The technology of stereo photography and virtual reality in research of virtual museum", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300165"}
