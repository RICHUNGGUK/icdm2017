Some studies use non-parametric approaches for splitting a set of time series into clusters by looking at their Euclidean distances in the space of points. A new measure of distance between time series based on the normalized periodogram is proposed. Simulation results comparing this measure with others parametric and non-parametric metrics are provided. In particular, the classification of time series as stationary or as non-stationary is discussed. The use of both hierarchical and non-hierarchical clustering algorithms is considered. An illustrative example with economic time series data is also presented. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
