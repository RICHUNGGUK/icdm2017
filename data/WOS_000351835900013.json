Based on the iterative rule, distributed algorithms are proposed for every agent using its nearest neighbor knowledge, for which the robustness problem is addressed against initial state shifts, disturbances, and switching topologies. These uncertainties are dynamically changing not only along the time axis but also the iteration axis. It is shown that the matrix norm conditions can be developed to achieve the convergence of the considered consensus tracking objectives, for which necessary and sufficient conditions are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities to guarantee their feasibility in the sense of the spectral norm. Furthermore, simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of the obtained consensus tracking results.", "paper_title": "Robust Consensus Tracking Control for Multiagent Systems With Initial State Shifts, Disturbances, and Switching Topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000351835900013"}
