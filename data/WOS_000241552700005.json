There have been proposed a variety of magnification algorithms. However, they are either sensitive to the noise, or non-robust to the blocking artifacts, or of high computational complexity, which hence limits their utility. In this paper, we propose an alternative magnification approach utilizing a filtering-based implementation scheme and novel regularization through coupling bilateral filtering with the digital total variation model. The approach is simple, fast, and robust to both the noise and blocking artifacts. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Fast and robust filtering-based image magnification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700005"}
