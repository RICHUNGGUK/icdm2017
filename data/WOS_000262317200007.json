We also present GPU-SF, a parallel force-based subsystem used by Glimmer. Glimmer organizes input into a hierarchy of levels and recursively applies GPU-SF to combine and refine the levels. The multilevel nature of the algorithm makes local minima less likely, while the GPU parallelism improves the speed of computation. We propose a robust termination condition for GPU-SF based on a filtered approximation of the normalized stress function. We demonstrate the benefits of Glimmer in terms of speed, normalized stress, and visual quality against several previous algorithms for a range of synthetic and real benchmark data sets. We also show that the performance of Glimmer on GPUs is substantially faster than a CPU implementation of the same algorithm.", "paper_title": "Glimmer: Multilevel MDS on the GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000262317200007"}
