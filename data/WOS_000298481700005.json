In such networks, any real-time interactive key agreement protocol does not work due to the intermittent connectivity and long time delay in message round trips. In the context of specific applications, such as single hop authentication, manual public key exchange is the most direct method because single hop authentication can be achieved by holding a small part of node's public key. To evaluate how many public keys should be maintained by each node to achieve a high propagation speed while single hop authentication scheme is used, in this paper, we proposed a security message propagation model for DTNs formed by vehicles where the extended graph theory and rumor spreading terminology in complex networks were harnessed. We find that holding 810 public keys by each node is optimal. And decay rate threshold is 0.16 under which message can be disseminated throughout the whole network.
