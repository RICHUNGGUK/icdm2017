As many potential ADRs cannot be detected though premarketing review, drug safety currently depends heavily on postmarketing surveillance. Particularly, current postmarketing surveillance in the United States primarily relies on the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). However, the effectiveness of such spontaneous reporting systems for ADR detection is not as good as expected because of the extremely high underreporting ratio of ADRs. Moreover, it often takes the FDA years to complete the whole process of collecting reports, investigating cases, and releasing alerts. Given the prosperity of social media, many online health communities are publicly available for health consumers to share and discuss any healthcare experience such as ADRs they are suffering. Such health-consumer-contributed content is timely and informative, but this data source still remains untapped for postmarketing drug safety surveillance. In this study, we propose to use (1) association mining to identify the relations between a drug and an ADR and (2) temporal analysis to detect drug safety signals at the early stage. We collect data from MedHelp and use the FDA's alerts and information of drug labeling revision as the gold standard to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. The experiment results show that health-related social media is a promising source for ADR detection, and our proposed techniques are effective to identify early ADR signals.", "paper_title": "Using Health-Consumer-Contributed Data to Detect Adverse Drug Reactions by Association Mining with Temporal Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000360007500013"}
