The governing equation is discretized spatially with a standard finite element method, and temporally with second-order Runge-Kutta schemes. A strategy of the mesh movement is based on the work by Li et al. [R.Li, T.Tang, P.W. Zhang, A moving mesh finite element algorithm for singular problems in two and three space dimensions, Journal of Computational Physics, 177 (2002) 365-393]. A Beckett and Mackenzie type monitor function is adopted. To obtain high quality meshes around the wetting front, a smoothing method which is based on the diffusive mechanism is used. With the moving mesh technique, high mesh quality and high numerical accuracy are obtained successfully. The numerical convergence and the advantage of the algorithm are demonstrated by a series of numerical experiments. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Inc.
