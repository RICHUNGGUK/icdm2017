Many of these methods are inspired by swarm behaviors in nature. In this paper, a new algorithm for optimization inspired by the gases brownian motion and turbulent rotational motion is introduced, which is called Gases Brownian Motion Optimization (GBMO). The proposed algorithm is created using the features of gas molecules. The proposed algorithm is an efficient approach to search and find an optimum solution in search space. The efficiency of the proposed method has been compared with some well-known heuristic search methods. The obtained results confirm the high performance of the proposed method in solving various functions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
