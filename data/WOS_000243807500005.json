The models were built using expert knowledge and evaluated on data collected in the Province of Overijssel in the Netherlands. Apart from a performance measure for crisp classifiers common in the aquatic ecology domain, the percentage of correctly classified instances (% CCI), two performance measures for fuzzy (ordered) classifiers are introduced in this paper: the percentage of correctly fuzzy classified instances (% CFCI) and the average deviation (AD). Furthermore, results of an interpretability-preserving genetic optimization of the linguistic terms, applying once binary encoding and once real encoding, are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
