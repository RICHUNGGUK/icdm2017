Constitutive assumptions of the FENE-P model are taken into account. The pressure gradient is taken as non-zero. The series solution of the non-linear problem modelled in (Appl. Math. Lett. 2007; 20:1211-1215) is developed by a homotopy analysis method (HAM). Numerical solution of the skin friction coefficient is also computed. Further a comparison between the numerical and HAM solutions is provided.
