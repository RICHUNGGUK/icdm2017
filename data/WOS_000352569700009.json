In a UWSN, an unlocalized sensor node finds its location by utilizing the spatio-temporal relation with the reference nodes. Generally, UWSNs are sparsely deployed because of the high implementation cost, and unfortunately, the network topology experiences partitioning due to the effect of passive node mobility. Consequently, most of the underwater sensor nodes lack the required number of reference nodes for localization in underwater environments. The existing literature is deficient in addressing the problem of node localization in the above mentioned scenario. Antagonistically, however, we promote that even in such sparse UWSN context, it is possible to localize the nodes by exploiting their available opportunities. We formulate a game-theoretic model based on the Single-Leader-Multi-Follower Stackelberg game for topology control of the unlocalized and localized nodes. We also prove that both the players choose strategies to reach a socially optimal Stackelberg-Nash-Cournot Equilibrium. NS-3 based simulation results indicate that the localization coverage of the network increases upto 1.5 times compared to the existing state-of-the-art. The energy-efficiency of OLTC has also been established.", "paper_title": "Game-Theoretic Topology Control for Opportunistic Localization in Sparse Underwater Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352569700009"}
