However, from the viewpoint of data mining, we can find many of these analytical methods are also each-and-every different data mining methods. In this paper, we survey the data mining theory and techniques that have appeared in the course of CGF behavior modeling from the viewpoint of data mining. Further, we redefine and reclassify these theories and techniques according to the research requirements of data mining (the knowledge structure of data mining). We aim to help the CGF investigators to learn the key points and the research methods of the data intelligent processing in the CGF behavior modeling, and thus we can provide the references for the colleagues who are engaged in the research and practice of the CGF behavior modeling by this article. We also introduce our ongoing work on the CGF behavior modeling based on data mining.", "paper_title": "Theory and techniques of data mining in CGF behavior modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000289902100002"}
