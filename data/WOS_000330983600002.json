There are two others in a stochastic setting; they readily extend to the case where the average waiting time is infinite. We investigate conditions for the sample-path version of this case to hold. Published proofs assume (our) Eq. (3) holds. It is only sufficient. We present examples of what may happen when (3) does not hold, including one that may be new where is infinite and is finite. We obtain a sufficient condition called \"weakly FIFO\" that is weaker than (3), and through truncation, a necessary and sufficient condition. We show that (3) is sufficient but not necessary for the departure rate to be equal to the arrival rate.", "paper_title": "Little's law when the average waiting time is infinite", "paper_id": "WOS:000330983600002"}
