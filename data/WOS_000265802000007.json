This paper describes a mechanism for extending these methods to piecewise-quadratic functions defined on triangulations of surfaces. Each triangular patch is tessellated into monotone regions, so that existing algorithms for computing topological representations of piecewise-linear functions may be applied directly to the piecewise-quadratic function. In particular, the tessellation is used for computing the Reeb graph, a topological data structure that provides a succinct representation of level sets of the function.", "paper_title": "TOPOLOGY-GUIDED TESSELLATION OF QUADRATIC ElEMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265802000007"}
