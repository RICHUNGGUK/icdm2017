Most prior literatures study mobile ad hoc wireless networks without considering existing physical infrastructure. By taking them into considerations, we propose a routing protocol in DTNs considering consecutive forwarding quality (CFQ), and conduct extensive simulations with real trace data, so as to evaluate the performance of CFQ. Simulation results show that CFQ outperforms most existing pure probability based forwarding protocols and most existing pure centrality-community based forwarding protocols in that its delay time and replicas are significantly reduced and its delivery ratio is significantly increased. At last, we are able to conclude that CFQ is more buffer-efficient and time-efficient.", "paper_title": "An efficient routing protocol based on consecutive forwarding prediction in delay tolerant networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335648100001"}
