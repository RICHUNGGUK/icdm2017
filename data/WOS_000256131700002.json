Despite amazing advancements, we are still far from having machines that reach human intelligence level. The current paper tries to offer a possible explanation of this situation. For this purpose, we make a review of different learning strategies and context types that are involved in the learning process. We also present the results of a study oil cognitive development applied to the problem of face recognition for social robotics. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
