The new technique basically uses additionally the second-order terms of Volterra series to produce augmented Volterra snapshots, the extension for higher-order case is straightforward. The resolution of the proposed method is high comparing with the standard multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm and the 2q-MUSIC algorithm. Simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "A new DOA estimation approach using Volterra signal model", "paper_id": "WOS:000339724400007"}
