For this kind of events the exact time cannot be determined in a precise way. Instead, one can give a time interval in which an event will probably take place. In addition, in distributed environments, processing inconsistency of knowledge that arisen in the integration process is not only with positive but also negative as well as uncertain knowledge. This is a necessary requirement in the real world because beside a time interval that the event takes place; we need to know which time interval that the event doesn't take place? In this paper, another aspect of knowledge integration using this data model will be investigated by considering positive, negative, and uncertain conflict profiles. In addition, in the integration process, we need to determine proper time intervals (based on consensus method) which properly represent an event for all kinds of conflict profiles. For this aim, some postulates, algorithm for knowledge integration are worked out and analyzed.", "paper_title": "A method for temporal knowledge integration using indeterminate valid time", "paper_id": "WOS:000341191800009"}
