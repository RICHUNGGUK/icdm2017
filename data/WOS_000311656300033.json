Geothermal problems which require very fine grids, of the order of millions of finite volumes, can be simulated using coarse grids, of the order of few to tens of thousands elements. Accordingly, significant reduction of CPU time is gained, rendering the model suitable for utilization in engineering practice. A verification example comparing the computational results with an analytical solution of a benchmark case is given. A validation example comparing computed results with measured results is presented. Furthermore, numerical examples are presented describing the possible utilization of the model for research works and design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
