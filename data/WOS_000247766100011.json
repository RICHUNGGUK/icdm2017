In contrast to previous approaches, we do not assume that the endofunctors are locally contractive, and our results do not depend on Banach's fixed-point theorem. Our approach is particularly suitable for constructing models of systems that feature quantitative data. For instance, using the Kantorovich metric on probability measures we construct a quantitative model for probabilistic transition systems. The metric in our model can reasonably be seen as measuring the behavioural distance between states of the system; it depends exclusively on the transition probabilities and not on an arbitrary discount factor.(C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
