Such BPMs are usually computed through the explicit simulation of thousands of fires using fast and accurate models. However, even adopting the most optimized algorithms, the building of simulation-based BPMs for large areas results in a highly intensive computational process that makes mandatory the use of high performance computing. In this paper, General-Purpose Computation with Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) is applied, in conjunction with a wildfire simulation model based on the Cellular Automata approach, to the process of BPM building. Using three different GPGPU devices, the paper illustrates several implementation strategies to speedup the overall mapping process and discusses some numerical results obtained on a real landscape.
