The aim of this paper is to be an introduction to the field, provide knowledge on the work that has been developed and to be a suitable reference for those who are looking for registration methods for a specific application. The registration methodologies under review are classified into intensity or feature based. The main steps of these methodologies, the common geometric transformations, the similarity measures and accuracy assessment techniques are introduced and described.", "paper_title": "Medical image registration: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000328534900001"}
