We show that under specific planar topology control schemes, recovery from a greedy routing failure is always possible without changing between any adjacent faces. Guaranteed delivery then follows from guaranteed recovery while traversing the very first face. In arbitrary planar graphs, however, a proper face selection mechanism is of importance since recovery from a greedy routing failure may require visiting a sequence of faces before greedy routing can be restarted again. We provide complete and formal proofs that several proposed face routing and combined greedy-face routing schemes guarantee message delivery in specific planar graph classes or even in arbitrary planar graphs. We also discuss the reasons why other methods fail to deliver a message or even end up in a loop. In addition, we investigate the behavior of face routing in arbitrary not necessarily planar networks and show, while delivery guarantees cannot be supported in such a general case, most face and combined greedy-face routing variants support at least loop-free operation. For those variants, we derive worst-case upper bounds on the number of forwarding steps.", "paper_title": "On Delivery Guarantees and Worst-Case Forwarding Bounds of Elementary Face Routing Components in Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280134600007"}
