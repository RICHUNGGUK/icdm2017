First, we give the representation of the joint density of the stock and its volatility. Next, we simulate these formulas on computer and compare them to other existing methods. We conclude from. these experiments that our method has the smallest variance. Finally, we apply the formula to the calculation of Greeks in finance.", "paper_title": "ESTIMATION OF DENSITIES FOR HESTON-TYPE MODELS THROUGH THE MALLIAVIN-THALMAIER METHOD AND ITS APPLICATION TO THE CALCULATION OF GREEKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900017"}
