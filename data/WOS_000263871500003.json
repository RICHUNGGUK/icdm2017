The first part makes a proposal for calculating the stresses and the stress concentration factor of an elastic plate with a circular hole under tension. The remainder describes its application to similar problems, such as an elastic plate with an elliptical hole, an oval hole and semi-circular notches under tension. The stresses at any point in a plate are calculated from the effect of the stresses on the boundaries. General systems theory suggests state object evolves at discrete times. The deformation of the plate is supposed to take a few steps along the time axis, though the real deformation finishes at one step. The results were compared with analytical solutions and/or experimental results.", "paper_title": "Stress analysis of an elastic plate with an opening or notches under tension based on the concept of general systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263871500003"}
