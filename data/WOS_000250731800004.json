War driving was performed along highways; the resulting packet analysis is explained to show how easy some security attacks can be. An elaboration is done on a host of wireless security attacks that leads to the discussion of secure wireless network design, along with some network security simulation. The paper concludes with a list of security recommendations.", "paper_title": "War driving and WLAN security issues-attacks, security design and remedies", "paper_id": "WOS:000250731800004"}
