In addition, since large-capacity NAND flash memory is much more expensive than the same capacity hard disk drive, it is cost wise infeasible to build large-capacity flash drives. To resolve these problems, this paper suggests a new file system called NAFS for large-capacity storage with multiple small-capacity and low-cost NAND flash memories. It adopts a new cache policy, mount scheme, and garbage collection scheme in order to improve read and write performance, to reduce the mount time, and to improve the wear-leveling effectiveness. Our performance results show that NAFS is more suitable for large-capacity storage than conventional NAND file systems such as YAFFS2 and JFFS2 and a disk-based file system for Linux such as HDD-RAID5-EXT3 in terms of the read and write transfer rate using a double cache policy and the mount time using metadata stored on a separate partition. We also demonstrate that the wear-leveling effectiveness of NAFS can be improved by our adaptive garbage collection scheme.", "paper_title": "A high performance NAND array file system based on multiple NAND flash memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000317662700013"}
