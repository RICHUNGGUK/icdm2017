It reduces calculation and storage cost drastically and presents some similarities with the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition, for short POD. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation to improve the convergence of the PGD, toward the numerical solution of a discretized PDE problem, when the associated matrix is Laplacian-like.
