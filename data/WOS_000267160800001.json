The state complexity of ail operation for regular languages is the number of states that are necessary and sufficient in the worst-case for the minimal deterministic finite-state automaton that accepts the language obtained from the operation. We establish the precise state complexity of catenation, Kleene star, reversal and the Boolean operations for suffix-free regular languages. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
