This basic construct underlies \"hardness amplification\" in cryptography, circuit complexity, and probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). Goldreich and Safra [SIAM J. Comput., 29 (2000), pp. 1132-1154] pioneered its local testing and its PCP application. A recent result by Dinur and Goldenberg [Proceedings of the Forty-Ninth Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2008, pp. 613-622] enabled for the first time testing proximity to this important code in the \"list-decoding\" regime. In particular, they give a 2-query test which works for polynomially small success probability 1/k(alpha) and show that no such test works below success probability 1/k. Our main result is a 3-query test which works for exponentially small success probability exp(-k(alpha)). Our techniques (based on recent simplified decoding algorithms for the same code [R. Impagliazzo et al., Proceedings of the Fortieth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2008, pp. 579-588]) also allow us to considerably simplify the analysis of the 2-query test of [Proceedings of the Forty-Ninth Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2008, pp. 613-622]. We then show how to derandomize their test, achieving a code of polynomial rate, independent of k, and success probability 1/k(alpha). Finally, we show the applicability of the new tests to PCPs. Starting with a 2-query PCP with a projection property over an alphabet Sigma and with soundness error 1 - delta, Rao [Proceedings of the Fortieth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2008, pp. 1-10] (building on Raz's (k-fold) parallel repetition theorem [R. Raz, SIAM J. Comput., 27 (1998), pp. 763-803] and Holenstein's proof [T. Holenstein, Proceedings of the Thirty-Ninth Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 2007, pp. 411-419] obtains a new 2-query PCP over the alphabet Sigma(k) with soundness error exp(-delta(2)k). Our techniques yield a 2-query PCP with soundness error exp(-delta root k). Our PCP construction turns out to be essentially the same as the miss-match proof system defined and analyzed by Feige and Kilian [SIAM J. Comput., 30 (2000), pp. 324-346] but with simpler analysis and exponentially better soundness error.", "paper_title": "NEW DIRECT-PRODUCT TESTERS AND 2-QUERY PCPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000312600700017"}
