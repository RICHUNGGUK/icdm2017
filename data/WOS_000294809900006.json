In this paper, a strategy called piecewise function feedback strategy (PFFS) is introduced and applied into an asymmetrical two-route scenario with a speed limit bottleneck in which the dynamic information can be generated and displayed on the information board to guide road users to make a choice. Meanwhile, the velocity-dependent randomization (VDR) mechanism is adopted which can better reflect the dynamic behavior of vehicles in the system than NS mechanism. Simulation results adopting PFFS have demonstrated high efficiency in controlling spatial distribution of traffic patterns compared with the previous strategies.", "paper_title": "PIECEWISE FUNCTION FEEDBACK STRATEGY IN INTELLIGENT TRAFFIC SYSTEMS WITH A SPEED LIMIT BOTTLENECK", "paper_id": "WOS:000294809900006"}
