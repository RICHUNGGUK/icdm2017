Power adjustment, timing offset estimation, and synchronization between a base station (BS) and all users within a cell are done through the ranging process referred to as initial ranging. In this paper, we discuss the details of initial ranging together with some of the proposed algorithms, as well as a novel algorithm to carry out a successful ranging process. Performance curves and computational complexity comparisons are presented. The system performance is evaluated for both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and practical multipath fading channels with multiuser interference. It is shown that the proposed algorithm offers a reduced complexity ranging method that can be employed in practical WiMAX-based BSs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
