We show that these discretizations lead to stability for Cauchy problems. With a careful boundary treatment, we also show that the stability holds for initial-boundary value problems. The analysis is verified by numerical simulations of Burgers' and Navier-Stokes equations in two and three space dimensions. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
