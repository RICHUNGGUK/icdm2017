First, a dynamic pseudorange model is represented as an ARMAX model and a pseudorange state-space innovation model suitable for both parameter identification and state estimation. The Kalman gain in the pseudorange coordinates is directly calculated from the identified parameters without prior knowledge of the noise properties and the receiver parameters. Then, the pseudorange state-space innovation model is transformed into the receiver state-space innovation model for optimal estimation of the receiver position. Hence, the proposed approach overcomes the drawbacks of the classical Kalman filter approach since it does not require prior knowledge of the noise properties, and the receiver's dynamic model to calculate the Kalman gain. In addition, due to its simplicity, it can be easily implemented in any receiver. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, it is utilized to estimate the position of a stationary receiver and its performance is compared against two versions of the classical Kalman filter approach. The results show that the proposed approach yields consistently good estimation of the receiver position and outperforms the other methods.", "paper_title": "An alternative Kalman innovation filter approach for receiver position estimation based on GPS measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000251027700003"}
