The problem under investigation is formulated as a rectangular packing problem and several heuristic approaches are developed for its solution. The performance of the proposed algorithms are evaluated under different scenarios. Extensive experimental tests demonstrate that the defined solution strategies outperform the state-of-art methods.", "paper_title": "Heuristics for the local grid scheduling problem with processing time constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000358197300004"}
