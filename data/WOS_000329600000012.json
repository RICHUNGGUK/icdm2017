The WRC model first applies the wavelet transform and recurrence analysis to calculate the multi-scale dynamic characteristics of network traffic, and then identifies network anomalies through the clustering algorithm with those dynamic characteristics. The evaluation results on DARPA 1999 dataset indicate that the WRC detection model can effectively improve the detection accuracy with a low false alarm", "paper_title": "Network Anomaly Detection based on Multi-scale Dynamic Characteristics of Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000329600000012"}
