This paper compares asymptotic variances of attributable risk estimate using the delta method and the Fisher information matrix for a 2x2 casecontrol study due to the practicality of applications. The expressions of these two asymptotic variance estimates are shown to be equivalent. Because asymptotic variance usually underestimates the standard error, the bootstrap standard error has also been utilized in constructing the interval estimates of attributable risk and compared with those using asymptotic estimates. A simulation study shows that the bootstrap interval estimate performs well in terms of coverage probability and confidence length. An exact test procedure for testing independence between the risk factor and the disease outcome using attributable risk is proposed and is justified for the use with real-life examples for a small-sample situation where inference using asymptotic variance may not be valid.", "paper_title": "Inference using attributable risk for a 2x2 casecontrol study", "paper_id": "WOS:000316055300009"}
