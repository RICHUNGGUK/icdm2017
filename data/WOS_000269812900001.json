We show that if epsilon(3)n -> -infinity, then a.a.s. D(n, p) consists of components which are either isolated vertices or directed cycles, each of size O(p) (|epsilon|(-1)). On the other hand, if epsilon(3)n -> infinity, then a.a.s. the structure of D(n, p) is dominated by the unique complex component of size (4 + o(1))epsilon(2)n, whereas all other components are of size O(p)(epsilon(-1)).
