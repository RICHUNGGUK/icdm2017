In this work, we investigate reversibility in SN P systems, as well as the computing power of reversible SN P systems. Reversible SN P systems are proved to have Turing creativity, that is, they can compute any recursively enumerable set of non-negative integers by simulating universal reversible register machine.", "paper_title": "Reversible spiking neural P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320775200004"}
