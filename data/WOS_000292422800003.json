This work proposes a QoS-aware Service Selection Approach (QSSA) with particle swarm optimisation and fuzzy logic control to support fast and dynamic service selection and assist users in selecting the most suitable services. The core of QSSA is decomposing global QoS constrains to local constraints and then selecting a local optimisation with local selection. Experimental results demonstrate that QSSA can obtain the most suitable composite service with low cost.", "paper_title": "QSSA: A QoS-aware Service Selection Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000292422800003"}
