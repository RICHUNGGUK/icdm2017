In this paper, we present a detection method based on multivariate classification to find out the malicious sensor nodes. It learns the features of a few type-known node, classifies them with dynamical multivariate classification, and then establishes the sample space of all sensor nodes in the network activities to deduce the malicious nodes. The experiment results show that as long as the value of sensor node preferences and the number of active sensor nodes is stable, the false detection rate is stabilized below 0.5%. This proves that the algorithm can be used to the cognitive wireless sensor networks widely.
