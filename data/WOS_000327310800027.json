Color grading is used for a number of reasons, such as accentuating a certain emotion or expressing the signature look of a director. We collect a database of feature film clips and label them with tags such as director, emotion, and genre. We then learn a model that maps from the low-level color and tone properties of film clips to the associated labels. This model allows us to examine a number of common hypotheses on the use of color to achieve goals, such as specific emotions. We also describe a method to apply our learned color styles to new images and videos. Along with our analysis of color grading techniques, we demonstrate a number of images and videos that are automatically filtered to resemble certain film styles.", "paper_title": "Learning and Applying Color Styles From Feature Films", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800027"}
