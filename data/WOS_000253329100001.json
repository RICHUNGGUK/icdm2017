It is based on a wide-spectrum language that can express both specifications and code, and a refinement relation that models the notion of correct implementation. In this paper we extend and generalise earlier work on contextual refinement. Contextual refinement simplifies the refinement process by abstractly capturing the context of a subcomponent of a program, which typically includes information about the values of the free variables. This paper also extends and generalises module refinement. A module is a collection of procedures that operate on a common data type; module refinement between a specification module A and an implementation module C allows calls to the procedures of A to be systematically replaced with calls to the corresponding procedures of C. Based on the conditions for module refinement, we present a method for calculating an implementation module from a specification module. Both contextual and module refinement within the refinement calculus have been generalised from earlier work and the results are presented in a unified framework.", "paper_title": "Calculating modules in contextual logic program refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000253329100001"}
