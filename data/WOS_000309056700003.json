Motivated by the recent success of multitask joint covariate selection, we formulate this problem as a multitask joint sparse representation model to combine the strength of multiple features and/or instances for recognition. A joint sparsity-inducing norm is utilized to enforce class-level joint sparsity patterns among the multiple representation vectors. The proposed model can be efficiently optimized by a proximal gradient method. Furthermore, we extend our method to the setup where features are described in kernel matrices. We then investigate into two applications of our method to visual classification: 1) fusing multiple kernel features for object categorization and 2) robust face recognition in video with an ensemble of query images. Extensive experiments on challenging real-world data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is competitive to the state-of-the-art methods in respective applications.", "paper_title": "Visual Classification With Multitask Joint Sparse Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309056700003"}
