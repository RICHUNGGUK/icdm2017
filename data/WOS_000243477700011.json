The tour length divided by n((d-1)/d) tends to a integral([0,1]d) f(x)((d-1)/d) dx, where,f is the density of the absolutely continuous part of the law of the random variables giving the depots and customers and where the constant alpha depends on the number of depots. If k = o(n), alpha is the constant of the TSP problem. For k = lambda n, lambda > 0, we prove lower and upper bounds on alpha, which decrease as fast as (1 + lambda)(-1/d).
