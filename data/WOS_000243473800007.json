This allows us to move the coordinates at the speed of contact discontinuities, expansion fans, or other wave structures. While recognizing that the Lagrangian coordinates, which can well resolve the sliplines, behave badly for expansion waves, we demonstrate that a coordinate system moving at the characteristic speed of the expansion fan behaves much better for expansion waves. Moreover, the new coordinate system allows one to well capture the shock wave, the slipline and the expansion waves at the same time.
