The underlying assumption is that there is a conservation law like R-parity in supersymmetry which guarantees the stability of the lightest odd particle. The new physics model must be incorporated in the notation of CalcHEP, a package for the automatic generation of squared matrix elements. Once this is done, all annihilation and coannihilation channels are included automatically in any model. Cross-sections at v = 0, relevant for indirect detection of dark matter, are also computed automatically. The package includes three sample models: the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the MSSM with complex phases and the NMSSM. Extension to other models, including non-supersymmetric models, is described.

Phys. Comm. 174 (2006) 577 Does the new version supersede the previous version: yes Nature of physical problem: Calculation of the relic density of the lightest stable particle in a generic new model of particle physics. Method of solution: In numerically solving the evolution equation for the density of dark matter, relativistic formulae for the thermal average are used. All tree-level processes for annihilation and coannihilation of new particles in the model are included. The cross-sections for all processes are calculated exactly with CalcHEP after definition of a model file. Higher-order QCD corrections to Higgs couplings to quark pairs are included. Reasons for the new version: There are many models of new physics that propose a candidate for dark matter besides the much studied minimal supersymmetric standard model. This new version not only incorporates extensions of the MSSM, such as the MSSM with complex phases, or the NSSM which contains an extra singlet superfield but also gives the possibility for the user to incorporate easily a new model. For this the user only needs to redefine appropriately a new model file. Summary of revisions: Possibility to include in the ppackage any particle physics model with a discrete symmetry that guarantees the stability of the cold dark matter candidate (LOP) and to compute the relic density of CDM. Compute automatically the cross-sections for annihilation of the LOP at small velocities into SM final states and provide the energy spectra for gamma, e(+), (p) over bar, nu final states. For the MSSM with input parameters defined at the GUT scale, the interface with any of the spectrum calculator codes reads an input file in the SUSY Les Houches Accord format (SLHA). Implementation of the MSSM with complex parameters (CPV-MSSM) with an interface to CPsuperH to calculate the spectrum. Routine to calculate the electric dipole moment of the electron in the CPV-MSSM. In the NMSSM, new interface compatible with NMHDECAY2.1. Typical running time: 0.2 sec Unusual features of the program: Depending on the parameters of the model, the program generates additional new code, compiles it and loads it dynamically.
