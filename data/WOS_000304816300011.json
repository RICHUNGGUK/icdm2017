Based on the selected combination of reinforcement and material, this system acquaints the user with the size and position of the largest comparative stress, and the greatest nodal displacement in the load-direction. This system operates based on the implemented knowledge of experts in the execution of design, material selection, and numerical analysis based on the finite-element method (FEM), which was written with the help of parameters within the knowledge-base of the CATIA V5 CAD-system. Using this system gives the user an opportunity to reach conclusions that are crucial for designing a plate-press or pressure-loaded die-elements, in general. The results reveal that the system can dramatically shorten design time and improve design quality in comparison to manual design process.
