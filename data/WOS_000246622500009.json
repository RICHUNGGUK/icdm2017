SIAM Journal on Optimization, 16(4), 1110-1136.] presented a new primal-dual infeasible interior-point algorithm that uses full-Newton steps and whose iteration bound coincides with the best-known bound for infeasible interior-point algorithms. Each iteration consists of a step that restores the feasibility for an intermediate problem (the so-called feasibility step) and a few (usual) centering steps. No more than O(n log(n/epsilon)) iterations are required for getting an E-solution of the problem at hand, which coincides with the best-known bound for infeasible interior-point algorithms. In this article, we introduce a different feasibility step and show that the same complexity result can be obtained with a relatively simpler analysis.", "paper_title": "Simplified O(nL) infeasible interior-point algorithm for linear optimization using full-Newton steps", "paper_id": "WOS:000246622500009"}
