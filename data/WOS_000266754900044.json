Feature-based approaches can facilitate efficient pattern recognition. The full potentiality of feature-based approaches can be achieved by using the optimal set of features. In this paper, a set of seven most useful features is selected using a classification and regression tree (CART)-based systematic approach for feature selection. Based on these features, eight most commonly observed CCPs are recognized using heuristic and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques. Extensive performance evaluation of the two types of recognizers reveals that both these recognizers result in higher recognition accuracy than the earlier reported feature-based recognizers. In this work, various features are extracted from the control chart plot of actual process data in such a way that their values become independent of the process mean and standard deviation. Thus, the developed feature-based CCP recognizers can be applicable to any general process. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
