Mathematical models in terms of signed permutations and signed strings proved limited in capturing some of the combinatorial details of the simple gene assembly process. Brijder and Hoogeboom introduced a new model in terms of overlap-inclusion graphs which could describe two of the three operations of the model and their combinatorial properties. To capture the third operation, we extended their framework to directed overlap-inclusion (DOI) graphs in Azimi et al. (2011) [1]. In this paper we introduce DOI graph-based rewriting rules that capture all three operations of the simple gene assembly model and prove that they are equivalent to the string-based formalization of the model.
