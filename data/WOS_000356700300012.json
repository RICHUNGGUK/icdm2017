Traditional works consider only typical single-channel single-interface networks, whereas multichannel multi-interface (MCMI) networks will become mainstream since they provide concurrent transmissions in different channels, which in turn helps each node to obtain better performance. Unlike previous works, this paper investigates the throughput-delay tradeoff for MCMI random networks. Two queuing systems, i.e., the M/M/m queuing system and the m M/M/1 queuing system, are established for MCMI nodes, and a parameter in routing implementation named routing deviation is also considered in the analytical model. This paper studies concurrent transmission capacity (CTC) using the physical interference model and also explores the impact on CTC of different physical parameters. Moreover, the relations between throughput and delay are achieved using two queuing systems in MCMI random networks respectively. The deterministic results obtained with a group of real network configuration parameters demonstrate that the proposed tradeoff model could be applied to the real network scenarios.", "paper_title": "Throughput-Delay Tradeoff for Wireless Multichannel Multi-Interface Random Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356700300012"}
