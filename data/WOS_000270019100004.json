It is well known that in the case of trees the energy is related to the matching polynomial and thus also to the Hosoya index via a certain Coulson integral. Ye and Yuan [On the minimal energy of trees with a given number of pendent vertices, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 57 (2007) 193-201.] and Yu and Lv [Minimum energy on trees with k pendent vertices, Lin. Algebra Appl. 418 (2006) 625-633] independently characterized the trees with the minimal energy among the trees with a given number of pendent vertices (that is, vertices of degree one). Let T(n,t) be the set of trees of order n with at least t vertices of degree two. In the present paper, we characterize the tree with minimal energy or Hosoya index in T(n,t).", "paper_title": "On the minimal energy of trees with a given number of vertices of degree two", "paper_id": "WOS:000270019100004"}
