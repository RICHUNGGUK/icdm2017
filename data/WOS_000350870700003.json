These sensors typically have thicknesses between a few hundred mu m and 1 mm to ensure a high photon detection efficiency. However, for small pixel sizes down to several tens of mu m, an effect called charge sharing reduces a detector's spectroscopic performance. The recently developed Medipix3RX readout chip overcomes this limitation by implementing a charge summing circuit, which allows the reconstruction of the full energy information of a photon interaction in a single pixel. In this work, we present the characterization of the first Medipix3RX detector assembly with a 500 mu m thick high resistivity, chromium compensated gallium arsenide sensor. We analyze its properties and demonstrate the functionality of the charge summing mode by means of energy response functions recorded at a synchrotron. Furthermore, the imaging properties of the detector, in terms of its modulation transfer functions and signal-to-noise ratios, are investigated. After more than one decade of attempts to establish gallium arsenide as a sensor material for photon counting detectors, our results represent a breakthrough in obtaining detector-grade material. The sensor we introduce is therefore suitable for high resolution X-ray imaging applications.", "paper_title": "Performance of a Medipix3RX Spectroscopic Pixel Detector With a High Resistivity Gallium Arsenide Sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000350870700003"}
