An Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is developed to estimate the parameters of the Markov process from the continuous observation of some populations, first with information about which individuals reproduce or die (the distinguishable case), and second without this information (the indistinguishable case). The performance of the EM algorithm is illustrated with some numerical examples. Fits resulting from the distinguishable case are shown not to be significantly better than fits resulting from the indistinguishable case using some goodness of fit measures. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
