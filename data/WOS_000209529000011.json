A differential coherent algorithm is given here to improve the SNR and reduce the performance degradation due to the Squaring-Loss and the navigation-bit effect. The algorithm uses fast navigation-bit correction for Delay-Doppler Maps (DDM) in airborne Global Navigation Satellite Signal Reflectometry (GNSS-R) software receivers. The system model is introduced with an analysis of the statistical properties with simulations to support the theoretical analysis. Field experiments with real airborne receivers then demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm. Comparisons with test results show that this algorithm offers a significant SNR gain over conventional algorithms.", "paper_title": "Differential Coherent Algorithm Based on Fast Navigation-Bit Correction for Airborne GNSS-R Software Receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000209529000011"}
