In order to well describe the real uncertain situation, we utilize fuzzy random variable as a tool to characterize future cash flows, and propose a new real options analysis approach by combing binomial lattice-based model with fuzzy random variable, as named fuzzy random real options analysis (FR-ROA). Then the proposed FR-ROA is applied to an R&D project problem under fuzzy random environment, and the relations of FR-ROA with the classical ROA and the fuzzy ROA are explicitly discussed, respectively.", "paper_title": "REAL OPTIONS ANALYSIS BASED ON FUZZY RANDOM VARIABLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000012"}
