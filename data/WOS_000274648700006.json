It seeks not only to present the author's personal experience and views, but also to shed light on the causes of the confusion for novice qualitative researchers. Design/methodology/approach - A review of literature on GT and the author's practical experience of undertaking an empirical study into the blogging phenomenon in LIS discipline form the approach to addressing the issue. Findings - The paper summarises four common issues that hinder inexperienced qualitative researchers when they undertake GT research: using GT as a methodology or method; how to use literature review; how to use coding strategy; and what is the generated theory. Practical implications - The paper provides practical suggestions of what matters when adopting GT approach. It needs more new researchers to further confirm the suggestions that the author stated in terms of a researcher's unique experience. Originality/value - The paper attempts to bridge the gap of insufficient discussion in the literature, focuses on new researchers' GT adopting experiences and provides them with practical directions.", "paper_title": "Grounded theory in practice: issues and discussion for new qualitative researchers", "paper_id": "WOS:000274648700006"}
