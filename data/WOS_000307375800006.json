Sensor fusion of acoustic emission and load data was carried out through artificial neural networks, to obtain a reliable prediction of residual tensile strength as early as possible in the loading history. The results show that neural network processing offers an effective method for the monitoring of composite specimens based on acoustic emission detection and analysis.", "paper_title": "Residual strength prediction of artificially damaged composite laminates based on neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000307375800006"}
