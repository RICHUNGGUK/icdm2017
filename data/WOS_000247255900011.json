An existing design method for PDBL circuits has so far been lacking an important component, a register. In this paper, we present the design of a speed independent PDBL register and-a timed PDBL register, which can be used in asynchronous or synchronous circuits. Comparisons are presented in terms of speed, size, and power consumption.", "paper_title": "Registers for phase difference based logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000247255900011"}
