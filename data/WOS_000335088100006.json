Multi-agent systems are envisioned to provide autonomic and adaptability features to these systems in order to gain advantage in their current environments. In this article we present a mechanism for providing distributed energy storage systems (DESSs) with intelligent capabilities. In more detail, we propose a self-configurable mechanism that allows a DESS to adapt itself according to the future environmental requirements. This mechanism is aimed at reducing the costs at which energy is purchased from the market.", "paper_title": "AN INTELLIGENT SELF-CONFIGURABLE MECHANISM FOR DISTRIBUTED ENERGY STORAGE SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000335088100006"}
