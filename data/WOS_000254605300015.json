The pDCME algorithm allows elimination of the degree-computation so as to reduce hardware complexity and obtain high-speed processing. A high-speed RS decoder based on the pDCME algorithm has been designed and implemented with 0.13-mu m CMOS standard cell technology in a supply voltage of 1.1 V. The proposed RS decoder operates at a clock frequency of 660 MHz and has a throughput of 5.3 Gb/s. The proposed architecture requires approximately 15% fewer gate counts and a simpler control logic than architectures based on the popular modified Euclidean algorithm.", "paper_title": "A high-speed pipelined degree-computationless modified Euclidean algorithm architecture for Reed-Solomon decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300015"}
