To solve this problem, a multiple access scheme based on block encoding time division multiplexing (TDM) is proposed in this paper. In our scheme, nine LEDs compose one block to reduce the system delay. Meanwhile, in order to reduce intercell interference, an extended binary coded decimal code is used to encode signals transmitted by LEDs. The feasibility and performance of the scheme is demonstrated by simulations. The results show that the proposed TDM scheme provides a better performance than the conventional TDM and is more applicable to the accurate positioning of a moving device.", "paper_title": "Multiple Access Scheme Based on Block Encoding Time Division Multiplexing in an Indoor Positioning System Using Visible Light", "paper_id": "WOS:000355259500010"}
