Here it is shown that once the ranking function is chosen, the FTP is converted into crisp one, which is easily solved by the standard transportation algorithms. The main contribution here is the reduction of the computational complexity of the existing method. By solving two application examples, it is shown that it is possible to find a same optimal solution without solving any FTP. Since the proposed approach is based on classical approach it is very easy to understand and to apply on real life transportation problems for the decision makers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
