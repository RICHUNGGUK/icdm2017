Several sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring global exponential stability of equilibrium point for the neural networks by the idea of vector Lyapunov function, M-matrix theory, and analytic methods. Moreover, the estimation for exponential convergence rate index is proposed. The obtained results not only show that the stability still remains under certain impulsive perturbations for the continuous stable FCGNNs with time-varying delays, but also present an approach to stabilize the unstable FCGNNs with time-varying delays by utilizing impulsive effects. An example with simulations is given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Impulsive effects on stability of fuzzy Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000246641800021"}
