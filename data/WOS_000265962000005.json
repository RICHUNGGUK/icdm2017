The protection of location-privacy has consequently become a key aspect to the Success of LBSs, since users consider their own physical location and movements highly privacy-sensitive, and demand for solutions able to protect such an information in a variety of environments. The idea behind location-privacy protection is that the individual should be able to set the level at which the location information is released to avoid undesired exploitation by a potential attacker: one of the approaches to this problem is given by the application of spatial obfuscation techniques, actuated by a trusted agent, and consisting in artificial perturbations of the location information collected by sensing technologies, before its disclosure to third parties. In many situations. however. landscape/map information can help a third party to perform Bayesian inference over spatially obfuscated data and to refine the user's location estimate up to a violation of the original user's location-privacy requirements. The goal of this paper is to provide a map-dependent obfuscation procedure that enables the release of the maximum possible user's location information, that does not lead to a violation of the original user's location-privacy requirements, even when refined through map-based inference.
