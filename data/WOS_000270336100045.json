Compared with the previous work, the distributed delay is assumed to be time-varying. Moreover, the effects of both variation range and probability distribution of mixed time-delays are taken into consideration in the proposed approach. The distributed time-varying delays and coupling term in complex networks are considered by introducing two Bernoulli stochastic variables. By using some novel analysis techniques and Lyapunov-Krasovskii function, some delay-distribution-dependent conditions are derived to ensure that the discrete-time complex network with randomly coupling term and distributed time-varying delay is synchronized in mean square. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
