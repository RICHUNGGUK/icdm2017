Problems of this type have important applications in several field applied science. By the Green's function method, the inverse problem is reduced to an operator equation of the first kind whit known to be ill-posed. The uniqueness of the solution for the inverse problem is obtained by the contraction mapping princ. A numerical algorithm on the basis of the Landweber iteration is designed to deal with the operator equation and some type numerical experiments are also performed in the paper. The numerical results show that the proposed method is stable and unknown heat source is recovered very well. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
