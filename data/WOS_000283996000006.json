With the rapid development of information technology, massive data collection is relatively easier and cheaper than ever before. The challenge is how to provide database users with reliable and useful data while protecting the privacy of the confidential information. This paper discusses how to prevent disclosing the identity of unique records in a statistical database. The authors' research extends previous work and shows how much protection is necessary to prevent an adversary from discovering confidential data with high probability at small error.", "paper_title": "Disclosure Control of Confidential Data by Applying PAC Learning Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000283996000006"}
