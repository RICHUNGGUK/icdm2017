In the proposed method, multiple encodings are first used to facilitate the flexible server-client interaction. Second, a RD-optimized scheduling strategy is provided to guarantee the optimal view-dependent delivery of multiview video. In the RD-optimized scheduling strategy, a distortion model is proposed to estimate the expected end-to-end distortion by accounting for both coding and packet-loss-induced distortions, as well as rendering-induced distortion. With the end-to-end distortion model, the server can select the optimal encoding combination for transmission. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve a significant end-to-end RD performance improvement over the selective streaming methods with simulcast coding or scalable multiview coding. In addition, it has better error-resilience performance to combat with packet-losses over the Internet protocol (IP) networks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
