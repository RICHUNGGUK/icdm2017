Most of the existing works in the literature focusing on the detection of the process mean and variance are almost based on the assumption that the shifts remain constant over time. The case of the patterned mean and variance changes may not be well discussed. In this research, we propose a new control chart which integrates the exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) procedure with the GLRT statistics to monitor the process with patterned mean and variance shifts. The attractive advantage of our control chart is its reference-free property. Due to the good properties of GLRT and EWMA procedures, our simulation results show that the proposed chart provides quite effective and robust detecting ability for various types of shifts. The implementation of our proposed control chart is illustrated by a real data example from chemical process control. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
