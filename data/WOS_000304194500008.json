By combining an interleaving technique and the inverse Gray mapping, the proposed method transforms the known binary PCS/PZCS sets with odd length of sub-sequences into quaternary PCS/PZCS sets, but the length of new sub-sequences is twice as long as that of the original sub-sequences, which is a drawback of this proposed method. However, the shortcoming that the method proposed by J. W. Jang, et al. is merely fit for even length of sub-sequences is overcome. As a consequence, the union of our and J. W. Jang, et al.'s methods allows us to construct quaternary PCS/PZCS sets from binary PCS/PZCS sets with sub-sequences of arbitrary length.", "paper_title": "QUATERNARY PERIODIC COMPLEMENTARY/Z-COMPLEMENTARY SEQUENCE SETS BASED ON INTERLEAVING TECHNIQUE AND GRAY MAPPING", "paper_id": "WOS:000304194500008"}
