The structure of the proposed gain scheduled fuzzy PID (GS_FPID) controller consists of both fuzzy PI-like controller and fuzzy PD-like controller. Both of fuzzy PI-like and PD-like controllers are weighted through adaptive gain scheduling, which are also determined by fuzzy logic inference. A modified genetic algorithm. called accumulated genetic algorithm, is designed to learn the parameters of fuzzy inference system. In order to learn the number Of fuzzy Miles required for the TSK model, the fuzzy miles are learned in an accumulated way. In other words, the parameters learned in the previous rules are accumulated and updated along with the parameters in the current rule. It will be shown that the proposed GS_FPID controllers learned by the accumulated CA perform, well for,not only the regular linear systems but also the higher order and time-delayed systems.", "paper_title": "ON A GENETIC ALGORITHM BASED SCHEDULED FUZZY PID CONTROLLER", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100029"}
