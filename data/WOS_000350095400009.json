A rigid body motion method (RBMM) for the FMBEM is proposed based on special displacement boundary conditions to deal with strongly singular integration and free term coefficients. The numerical example results show that our parallel algorithms obviously accelerates the FMBEM and can be used in large scale engineering problems with wide applications in the future.
