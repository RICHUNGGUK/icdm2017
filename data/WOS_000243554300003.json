Analytical models of the delay sensitivity with respect to supply variations are derived by following a simplified circuit analysis, and the resulting expressions are simple enough to afford a deeper insight into the impact of supply voltage variations on each topology. The models are shown to be sufficiently accurate through simulations with CMOS technologies having a minimum feature size ranging from 90 nm to 0.35 mu m. Several interesting properties and design considerations are derived from these models, and the effect of the supply voltage scaling, technology scaling, transistor sizing, and input transition time is discussed. Strategies to evaluate the delay sensitivity since the early design phases (e.g., from ring oscillator measurements) are also introduced. As a fundamental result, it is shown that the delay sensitivity to supply variations will increase in the next technology nodes, thus, it is expected that controlling the supply variations will be an increasingly important issue in the design of the next generation VLSI circuits. The proposed methodology is also analyzed in the case of more general digital circuits, and is used to estimate the impact of the inter-die threshold voltage variations on the delay of the considered full adder topologies.", "paper_title": "Impact of supply voltage variations on full adder delay: Analysis and comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000243554300003"}
