This paper proposes a posteriori decision approach for community detection. The approach includes two phases: in the search phase, a special multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is designed to search for a set of tradeoff partitions that reveal the community structure at different scales in one run; in the decision phase, three model selection criteria and the Possibility Matrix method are proposed to aid decision makers to select the preferable solutions through differentiating the set of optimal solutions according to their qualities. The experiments in five synthetic and real social networks illustrate that, in one run, our method is able to obtain many candidate solutions, which effectively avoids the resolution limit existing in priori decision approaches. In addition, our method can discover more authentic and comprehensive community structures than those priori decision approaches.", "paper_title": "A Posteriori Approach for Community Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000297212300005"}
