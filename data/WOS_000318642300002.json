As cloud offerings mature, service-based applications need to dynamically recompose themselves to self-adapt to changing QoS requirements. In this paper, we present a decentralized mechanism for such self-adaptation, using market-based heuristics. We use a continuous double-auction to allow applications to decide which services to choose, among the many on offer. We view an application as a multi-agent system and the cloud as a marketplace where many such applications self-adapt. We show through a simulation study that our mechanism is effective for the individual application as well as from the collective perspective of all applications adapting at the same time.", "paper_title": "A Decentralized Self-Adaptation Mechanism for Service-Based Applications in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000318642300002"}
