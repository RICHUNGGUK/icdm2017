Such a traditional procedure is followed, even if the goal of the investigation is to find a limited quantity of digital objects to support or refute an investigative hypothesis related to a precise case category. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new methodology to deal with data leak cases, by applying an intelligent collection paradigm, a fast analysis approach that reduces investigation time.
