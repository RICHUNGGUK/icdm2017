Additionally, it has been successfully implemented in biometrics, features selection, object tracking, document image preprocessing and classification. This paper specifically, clusters, summarize, interpret and evaluate neural networks in document Image preprocessing. The importance of the learning algorithms in neural networks training and testing for preprocessing is also highlighted. Finally, a critical analysis on the reviewed approaches and the future research guidelines in the field are suggested.", "paper_title": "Neural networks for document image preprocessing: state of the art", "paper_id": "WOS:000339104100005"}
