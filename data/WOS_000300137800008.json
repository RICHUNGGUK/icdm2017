It is shown that given the public key of the knapsack cipher 0/255, one can recover the corresponding modular multiplier by using the continued fraction algorithm. Hence, the secret key is reconstructed from the recovered multiplier and the public key. So the knapsack cipher 0/255 is totally breakable.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of the Knapsack Cipher 0/255", "paper_id": "WOS:000300137800008"}
