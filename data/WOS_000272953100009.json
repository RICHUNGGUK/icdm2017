However, physical prototyping is expensive and time consuming, which often leads to insufficient opportunities for testing early during the development cycle. Our objective is to improve this situation by providing a method to develop realistic prototypes using virtual reality technology that can be applied during earlier development stages. Our approach combines a virtual reality engine capable of enacting the laws of rigid body physics with a new hybrid software modelling language to control the simulated hardware using virtual sensors and actuators as they would be present in a physical prototype. The new modelling language is called Geometry-driven Petri nets (GPN) and combines a class of timed, high-level Petri nets with data structures used in state-of-the-art VR environments. This article describes the new GPN approach, applies it to a case study of an automated manufacturing line, and compares it with related approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
