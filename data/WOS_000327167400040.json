It overcomes both the misassociations and the ill-conditioning due to the interactions between Bounded-Variables Least Squares (BVLS) and Least Median of Squares (LMS). Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of this new registration method.", "paper_title": "Robust Sensor Registration with the Presence of Misassociations and Ill Conditioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400040"}
