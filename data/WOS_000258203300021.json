Knaster, Un theoreme sur les forictions d'ensembles, Annales de la Societe Polonaise de Mathematique 6 (1928) 133-134; A. Tarski, A lattice theoretical fixpoint theorem and its applications, Pacific journal of Mathematics 5 (1955) 285-309]. In this paper, we investigate several algorithmic and complexity-theoretic topics regarding Tarski's fixed point theorem. In particular, we design an algorithm that finds a fixed point of f when it is given (L, <=) as input and f as an oracle. Our algorithm makes O(log vertical bar L vertical bar) queries to f when <= is a total order on L. We also prove that when both f and (L, <=) are given as oracles, any deterministic or randomized algorithm for finding a fixed point off makes an expected Omega(vertical bar L vertical bar) queries for some (L, <=) and f.
