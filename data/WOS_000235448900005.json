Due to its NP-hardness, many heuristics have been studied. However, the heuristics in the literature suffer from coarse performance ratio. It is important to have knowledge of the optimal solution structure in order to develop more efficient heuristics and algorithms. We present one IP formulation and two iterative algorithms which make use of relaxed IP's to solve subproblems. The computational results show that our approaches outperform other techniques in the literature.", "paper_title": "Optimal solutions to minimum total energy broadcasting problem in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235448900005"}
