Typically, these processors employ core-level backup to improve yield. However, when defective cores are replaced by backup ones, the NoC topology changes. Consequently, a fine-tuned application based on timing parameters given by one topology may not meet the expected timing behavior under the new one. We first develop a metric to measure timing similarity of an application on different NoC topologies and then propose mixed binary quadratic programming and greedy algorithms to reconfigure a defect-tolerant many-core NoC.", "paper_title": "Maintaining Real-Time Application Timing Similarity for Defect-Tolerant NoC-Based Many-Core Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330905800009"}
