Considering such uncertainties, finding a good situation-dependent dispatching rule is more suitable than solving an RCPSP under uncertainties. In this paper we apply machine learning approaches to acquiring situation-dependent dispatching rule. We compare obtained rules and examine their effectiveness and usefulness in problems with unpredictable wafer testing errors.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Knowledge Acquisition Methods for Dynamic Scheduling of Wafer Test Processes with Unpredictable Testing Errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000370188200008"}
