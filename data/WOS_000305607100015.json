Since there are complex changing interface topology and interactions among air, solid, and different fluids, few papers have devoted to simulate the multiple fluids phenomena with solidliquid phase transition. In this paper, the thermal fluid model for phase transition combined with free surface tracking is used to describe the interaction between air and fluids. Then a new model based on hierarchical lattice is proposed to process the solidliquid interaction and the phase transition in the solidliquid interface. Further, with the use of hybrid interaction with multidistribution functions, different realistic multiple fluids phenomena are rendered with different lattice sizes.
