The proposed method is constructed based on the harmony search (HS) algorithm as well as a novel adaptive modification method to solve the problem effectively. The proposed modification method consists of three sub-modifications to provide the algorithm with powerful tool to escape from the local optima of the problem with fast convergence. The feasibility and satisfying performance of the proposed method is examined on a typical MG including different types of renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic, fuel-cell, micro-turbine, wind turbine and battery as the storage device. Comparative studies demonstrate the consistent superiority of the proposed method over the other well-known algorithms in the area.", "paper_title": "Optimal unit commitment of renewable energy sources in the micro-grids with storage devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900005"}
