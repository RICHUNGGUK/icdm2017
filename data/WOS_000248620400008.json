However, most of the conventional approaches either restrict comparative analysis to special structures, such as pathways, or adopt heuristic algorithms due to computational burden. Results: In this article, to find the conserved substructures, we develop an efficient algorithm for aligning molecular networks based on both molecule similarity and architecture similarity, by using integer quadratic programming (IQP). Such an IQP can be relaxed into the corresponding quadratic programming (QP) which almost always ensures an integer solution, thereby making molecular network alignment tractable without any approximation. The proposed framework is very flexible and can be applied to many kinds of molecular networks including weighted and unweighted, directed and undirected networks with or without loops.", "paper_title": "Alignment of molecular networks by integer quadratic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400008"}
