It assumes that the text and non-text or graphics regions of a given document are considered to have different textural properties. The M-band wavelet packet analysis and rough-fuzzy-possibilistic c-means are used for text-graphics segmentation problem. The M-band wavelet packet is used to extract the scale-space features, which offers a huge range of possibilities of scale-space features for document image and is able to zoom it onto narrow band high frequency components. A scale-space feature vector is thus derived, taken at different scales for each pixel in an image. However, the decomposition scheme employing M-band wavelet packet leads to a large number of redundant features. In this regard, an unsupervised feature selection method is introduced to select a set of relevant and non-redundant features for text-graphics segmentation problem. Finally, the rough-fuzzy-possibilistic c-means algorithm is used to address the uncertainty problem of document segmentation. The whole approach is invariant under the font size, line orientation, and script of the text. The performance of the proposed technique, along with a comparison with related approaches, is demonstrated on a set of real life document images. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
