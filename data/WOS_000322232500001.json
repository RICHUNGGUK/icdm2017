The design consists of a capacitively loaded patch antenna for nowadays smartphone platforms. The antenna is narrowband and can be fine tuned over the range (700 MHz-960 MHz). Measurements at 700 MHz with fixed capacitors raise the challenge of the component insertion loss. Distribution of the tuning capacitance is investigated and shows 1 dB improvement in the antenna radiation efficiency.", "paper_title": "On the Efficiency of Capacitively Loaded Frequency Reconfigurable Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000322232500001"}
