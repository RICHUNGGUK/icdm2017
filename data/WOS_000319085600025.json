In this letter, the average partial Hamming correlation (APHC) properties of FHSs are discussed. Firstly, the theoretical bound on the average partial Hamming correlation of FHSs is established. It works for any correlation window with length 1 <= omega <= upsilon, where upsilon is the sequence period, and generalizes the bound developed by Peng et al which is valid only when omega = upsilon. A sufficient and necessary condition for a set of FHSs having optimal APHC for any correlation window is then given. Finally, sets of FHSs with optimal APHC are presented.", "paper_title": "On The Average Partial Hamming Correlation of Frequency-Hopping Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600025"}
