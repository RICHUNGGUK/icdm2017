In the past few years, there have been major improvements in advanced manufacturing concepts and their utilisation in terms of truly integrated systems. Although the successful implementation of advance manufacturing technologies offers manufacturing organisations numerous benefits, the assessment and preference of these technologies is a very versatile task due to the many parameters involved. In the present study, the multi-attribute decision-making approach is presented to assess and rank the advance manufacturing technologies in practice for a given manufacturing industry in Saudi Arabia. The model presented takes into consideration the objective criterion of the manufacturing industry. The objective here is to help decision makers to ensure that the selected manufacturing technologies comply with the objective of the manufacturing company. The obtained results are compared against existing results.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of advance manufacturing technologies using concord and discord indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000288666800004"}
