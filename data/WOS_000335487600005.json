Prototypes of the initial distributor as well as the optimized one are designed. Fluid distribution and hydraulic characteristics of these distributors are investigated numerically. Results show that the pressure drop of the optimized distributor is between 15.9% and 25.1% lower than that of the initial reference while keeping a uniform flow distribution, demonstrating the process intensification in fluid distributor, and suggesting the significance of the proposed optimization algorithm in engineering optimal design.
