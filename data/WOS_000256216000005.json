However, some sensitive patterns with security considerations may compromise privacy. In this paper, we aim to determine appropriate balance between need for privacy and information discovery in frequent patterns. A novel method to modify databases for hiding sensitive patterns is proposed in this paper. Multiplying the original database by a sanitization matrix yields a sanitized database with private content. In addition, two probabilities are introduced to oppose against the recovery of sensitive patterns and to reduce the degree of hiding non-sensitive patterns in the sanitized database. The complexity analysis and the security discussion of the proposed sanitization process are provided. The results from a series of experiments performed to show the efficiency and effectiveness of this approach are described. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
