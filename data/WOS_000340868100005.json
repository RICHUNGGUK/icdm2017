The cold start time can be shortened by a proper strategy of a selection of the satellites to be searched for. The cold start simulator was developed and used for optimization of the sequence of the satellites search, for development and testing of an advanced satellite selection algorithm that utilizes information on the satellites already detected and for optimization of a frequency search range. The best performance was achieved by using an advanced selection strategy. The strategy is based on the selection of the satellites nearest to the detected satellite, using the average angle between the Earth center (apex) and the satellites. Furthermore, the simulation shows that it is not practical to investigate all frequencies within the range of the maximum possible Doppler frequency shift of the carrier wave of the navigation signal, but investigate approximately +/- 35 kHz range and, if not successful, switch to the next satellite. The simulations proved that a simple GPS receiver with the sequential search algorithms can operate in the LEO orbit.", "paper_title": "Cold Start Strategy of the CubeSat GPS Receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000340868100005"}
