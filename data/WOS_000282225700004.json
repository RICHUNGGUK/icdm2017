Additionally, node-disjoint paths support high-throughput communication via the concurrent transmission of parts of a message. We characterize maximum-sized families of parallel paths between any two nodes of alternating group networks. More specifically, we establish that in a given alternating group network AN (n) , there exist n-1 parallel paths (the maximum possible, given the node degree of n-1) between any pair of nodes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these parallel paths are optimal or near-optimal, in the sense of their lengths exceeding the internode distance by no more than four. We also show that the wide diameter of AN (n) is at most one unit greater than the known lower bound D+1, where D is the network diameter.", "paper_title": "Construction of vertex-disjoint paths in alternating group networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000282225700004"}
