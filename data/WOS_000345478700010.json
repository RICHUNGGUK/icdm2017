For a secret predicate, given as a subset of runs, and a function describing the view of an external observer, the value of interest for opacity is a measure of the set of runs disclosing the secret. We extend this definition to the richer framework of Markov decision processes, where nondeterministic choice is combined with probabilistic transitions, and we study related decidability problems with partial or complete observation hypotheses for the schedulers. We prove that all questions are decidable with complete observation and omega-regular secrets. With partial observation, we prove that all quantitative questions are undecidable but the question whether a system is almost surely non-opaque becomes decidable for a restricted class of omega-regular secrets, as well as for all omega-regular secrets under finitememory schedulers.
