The wall moves at the inlet velocity and the Reynolds number ranges from 300 to 500. The influence of the moving wall on the flow patterns is demonstrated and the corresponding mechanism is illustrated by using instability theory. The correlations among flow features based on gap ratio are interpreted. Force coefficients, velocity profile and vortex structure are analyzed to determine the critical gap ratio.
