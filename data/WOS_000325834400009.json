A surface modeled by the current skinning techniques nevertheless may be far from being developable, which is an important property desired in the manufacturing industry such as ship-hull, wing and body of aircraft, garment, etc. In this paper, a novel approach to skinning surface modeling is proposed. The proposed method interpolates the given curves with a collection of G(1) continuous self-defined triangular patches, and these patches are assembled together by globally minimizing the integral Gaussian curvature, i.e., the degree of developability. The proposed algorithm has been tested on a set of examples and the test results have demonstrated its promising use in a variety of applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
