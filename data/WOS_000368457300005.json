Efficient data management techniques promote an efficient way of sharing data. This paper describes existing approaches to data interoperability (platform independency) for exchanging and synchronizing data between heterogeneous data sources or various platforms. We also illustrate an update query execution protocol, which can reduce query execution cost and query response time. We further perform different experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Synchronizing Data through Update Queries in Interoperable E-Health and Technology Enhanced Learning Data Sharing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000368457300005"}
