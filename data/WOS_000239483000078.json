Once the noises are detected, a filtering action based on regularization can be taken to restore the image. Experimental results show that the proposed SVM-based approach provides excellent performance with respect to various percentages of impulse noise.", "paper_title": "Image filtering using support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000078"}
