Inspired by this work, we address the problem of practical code design for general multiterminal lossless networks where multiple memoryless correlated binary sources are separately compressed and sent; each decoder receives a set of compressed sources and attempts to jointly reconstruct them. First, we propose a near-lossless practical code design for the Slepian-Wolf system with multiple sources. For two uniform sources, if the code approaches the capacity of the channel that models the correlation between the sources, then the system will approach the theoretical limit. Thus, the great advantage of this design method is its possibility to approach the theoretical limits with a single channel code for any rate allocation among the encoders. Based on Slepian-Wolf code constructions, we continue with providing practical designs for the general lossless multiterminal network which consists of an arbitrary number of encoders and decoders. Using irregular repeat-accumulate and turbo codes in our designs, we obtain the best results reported so far and almost reach the theoretical bounds.", "paper_title": "On code design for the Slepian-Wolf problem and lossless multiterminal networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236714000014"}
