This article presents a semi-automatic, enhanced texture segmentation approach to detect and classify surface damage on infrastructure elements and successfully applies them to a range of images of surface damage. The approach involves statistical analysis of spatially neighboring pixels in various color spaces by defining a feature vector that includes measures related to pixel intensity values over a specified color range and statistics derived from the Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix calculated on a quantized grey-level scale. Parameter optimized non-linear Support Vector Machines are used to classify the feature vector. A Custom-Weighted Iterative model and a 4-Dimensional Input Space model are introduced. Receiver Operating Characteristics are employed to assess and enhance the detection efficiency under various damage conditions.", "paper_title": "Texture Analysis Based Damage Detection of Ageing Infrastructural Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000314757000002"}
