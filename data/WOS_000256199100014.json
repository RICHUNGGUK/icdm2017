In this paper, we study the dual power assignment problem for 2-edge connectivity and 2-vertex connectivity in the symmetric graphical model. The problem has arisen from the following practical origin. In a wireless ad hoc network where each node can switch its transmission power between high-level and low-level, how can we establish a fault-tolerant connected network topology in the most energy-efficient way? Specifically, the objective is to minimize the number of nodes assigned with high power and yet achieve 2-edge connectivity or 2-vertex connectivity. Note that to achieve a minimum number of high-power nodes is harder than an optimization problem in the same model whose objective is to minimize the total power cost. We first address these two optimization problems (2-edge connectivity and 2-vertex connectivity version) under the general graph model. Due to the NP-hardness, we propose an approximation algorithm, called prioritized edge selection algorithm, which achieves a 4-ratio approximation for 2-edge connectivity. After that, we modify the algorithm to solve the problem for 2-vertex connectivity and also achieve the same approximation ratio. We also show that the 4-ratio is tight for our algorithms in both cases. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
