Excessive reassurance-seeking is a common interpersonal behavior characteristic of depression and often leads to negative interaction between caregivers and depressed individuals, who seek excessive assurance from the caregivers at inappropriate times, such as when caregivers are busy. Such negative interaction results in elevated feelings of burden for both caregivers and care receivers. However, maintaining a good relationship between depressed individuals and caregivers is crucial to overcoming difficult times during depression. Therefore, we propose a mobile care mediation system that enables depressed individuals and caregivers to share mood and availability information, thus improving communication in caregiving and care-receiving and reducing the caregiving burden.", "paper_title": "A mobile mediation tool for improving interaction between depressed individuals and caregivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000295087500003"}
