The multiplicative structure (tensor product and its adjoint) can be defined in any locally cartesian closed category, but the additive (product and coproduct) and exponential (circle times-comonoid comonad) structures require additional properties and are only developed in the category Set, where the objects and morphisms have natural interpretations in terms of games, simulation and strategies.", "paper_title": "A linear category of polynomial diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000348597100002"}
