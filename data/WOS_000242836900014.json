That is, a classifier is trained based on some labeled texture features as the training set to classify unlabeled texture features of images into some pre-defined classes. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it investigates the classification performance of using Gabor filters, wavelet transform, and their combination respectively, as the texture feature representation of scenery images (such as mountain, castle, etc.). A k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier and support vector machine (SVM) are also compared. Second, three k-NN classifiers and three SVMs are combined respectively, in which each of the combined three classifiers uses one of the above three texture feature representations respectively., to see whether combining multiple classifiers can outperform the single classifier in terms of scenery image classification. The result shows that a single SVM using Gabor filters provides the highest classification accuracy than the other two spectral features and the combined three k-NN classifiers and three SVMs. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
