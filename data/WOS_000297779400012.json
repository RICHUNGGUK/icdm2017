Design/methodology/approach - A volume integral method, also known as the mutually coupled circuits method, is implemented in MatLab (R) environment to solve axial-symmetrical induction systems. It is completed with an optimization procedure based on Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm, with the goal of obtaining a specified distribution of the induced power in the load. In this way, it is possible to predict current amplitudes for implementing the so-called \"zone controlled induction heating\" (ZCIH) process. Findings - Some examples of calculation results are given, both for disc and billet loads. By the excitation of the inductor coils with a set of currents of appropriate amplitude and phase values, it is possible to achieve an optimized profile of induced power distributions. Originality/value - This paper validates a method to predict currents and phases in a load-inductor ZCIH system, confirming the possibility of obtaining specified induced power density distributions, according to the process requirements, e.g. for compensation of the load edge-effect", "paper_title": "Compensation of induction heating load edge-effect by space control", "paper_id": "WOS:000297779400012"}
