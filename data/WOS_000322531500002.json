In the first stage, a window of size is taken from image and some other features of this window are used as input to neural network. This scheme has distinction of having very low missed detection (MD) and false positives rates. In the second stage, decision tree-based algorithm (J48) is applied on some well-known statistical parameters to generate rules for noise detection. These noise detection methods give promising results for identification of noise from highly corrupted images. A modified version of switching median filter (directional weighted switching median filter) is proposed for noise removal. Performance of noise detector is measured using MD and false alarm FA. Filtering results are compared with state-of-the-art noise removal techniques in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index measure. Extensive experiments are performed to show that the proposed technique gives better results than state-of-the-art noise detection and filtering methods.", "paper_title": "Machine learning and directional switching median-based filter for highly corrupted images", "paper_id": "WOS:000322531500002"}
