In recent years, wireless sensor network (WSN) has been explored for adoption to improve the centralized cable-based SHM system performances. This paper presents a multi-agent design method and system evaluation for wireless sensor network based structural health monitoring to validate the efficiency of the multi-agent technology. Through the cooperation of six different agents for SHM applications, the distributed wireless sensor network can automatically allocate SHM tasks, self-organize the sensor network and aggregate different sensor information. In the evaluation work, the strain gauge and PZT sensors are used to monitor strain distribution change and joint failure of an experimental aluminum plate structure. A dedicated sensor network platform including the wireless strain node, wireless PZT node and wireless USB station is designed for the evaluation system. Based on the hardware platform, the multi-agents software architecture is defined. The multi-agent monitoring principle and implementation in the validation work for two typical kinds of structure states are presented. This paper shows the efficiency of the multi-agent technology for WSN based the SHM applications on the large aircraft structures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
