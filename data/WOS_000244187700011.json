Computer mediated communication offers enhanced possibilities for synchronous collaboration by allowing seamless capture of meetings, thus relieving participants from time-consuming documentation tasks. However, in order for meeting systems to be truly effective, they must allow users to efficiently navigate and retrieve information of interest from recorded meetings. In this article, we review the state of the art in multimedia segmentation, indexing and browsing techniques and show how existing meeting browser systems build on these techniques and integrate various modalities to meet their users' information needs.", "paper_title": "Meeting browsing - State-of-the-art review", "paper_id": "WOS:000244187700011"}
