We show how to preprocess a static dag in linear time such that subsequent LSCA-queries can be answered in constant time. The size is linear in the number of nodes. We also consider a \"fuzzy\" variant of LSCA that allows to compute a node that is only an LSCA of a given percentage of the query nodes. The space and construction time of our scheme for fuzzy LSCAs is linear, whereas the query time has a sub-logarithmic slow-down. This \"fuzzy\" algorithm is also applicable to LCAs in trees, with the same complexities. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
