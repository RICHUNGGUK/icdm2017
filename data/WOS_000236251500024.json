The strengths of AMiGA include (1) a more accessible and up-to-date database containing a more comprehensive set of mitochondrial genomes for this phylum, (2) the provision of flexible search options for retrieving detailed information such as bibliographical data, genomic graphics, FASTA sequences and taxonomical status, (3) the possibility of enhanced comparative analyses by multiple alignment of single or concatenated sets of genes, (4) more accurate and updated information resulting from a specific curation process called AMiGA Notes and (5) the possibility of including unpublished sequences in a password-restricted area for comparative analysis with the other sequences stored in the database.", "paper_title": "AMiGA: the arthropodan mitochondrial genomes accessible database", "paper_id": "WOS:000236251500024"}
