The method follows the overproduce and choose paradigm. It first produces a large number of individual networks, and then clusters these networks according to their diversity. Networks with the highest classification accuracies in each Cluster are selected for the final integration. Experiments on ten UCI data sets showed the superiority of the proposed algorithm to the other two similiar ensemble learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "Selective neural network ensemble based on clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000081"}
