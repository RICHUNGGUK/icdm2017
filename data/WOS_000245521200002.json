Converting other kinds of models as parametric surfaces to splat-based representations will allow to mix surface and splat-based models and to take advantage of the existing point-based rendering methods. In this work, we present an approach to convert a parametric surface into a splat-based representation. It works in parametric space, performs an adaptive sampling based on the surface curvature and a given error tolerance and uses power Voronoi diagrams. The goal is to approximate the surface with an optimized set of elliptical splats.", "paper_title": "Splat representation of parametric surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000245521200002"}
