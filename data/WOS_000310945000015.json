In this paper we present a visual authoring tool for game designers that supports behaviour reuse. We describe a visual editor, capable of storing, indexing, retrieving and reusing behaviours previously designed by AI programmers. One of the most notable features of our editor is its capability for sketch-based retrieval: searching in a repository for behaviours that are similar to the one the user is drawing, and making suggestions about how to complete it. As this process relies on graph behaviour comparison, in this paper, we describe different algorithms for graph comparison, and demonstrate, through empirical evaluation in a particular test domain, that we can provide structure-based similarity for graphs that preserves behaviour similarity and can be computed at reasonable cost.
