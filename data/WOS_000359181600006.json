Our proposed method selects peak point as the reference point, then uses the two neighboring points of the peak point to achieve secret data embedding based on histogram shifting and the peak point keeps unchanged. In the extraction end, we no longer need the key information about the peak point, we can directly find the peak point from the histogram to extract the secret data. We also exploit the localization to make the histogram of embedded cover image become almost the same as the histogram of the original cover image. The embedding capacity is also increased rapidly by the localization with multilayer embedding. Experimental results show that our proposed method is effective and superior. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
