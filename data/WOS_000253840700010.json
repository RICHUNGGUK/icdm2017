The proposed IE (called the Greedy-B&B-IE) developed first a greedy procedure for reordering d-MP/d-MC to speed up the procedure in detecting & deleting dominated terms. Then, a Branch-and-Bound (B&B)-based technique is proposed to implement the IE to reduce the number of intersections, and decrease the number of multiplications required for calculating the probability value of each term.", "paper_title": "A greedy branch-and-bound inclusion-exclusion algorithm for calculating the exact multi-state network reliability", "paper_id": "WOS:000253840700010"}
