A delay-dependent stability criterion is first presented, and a H-infinity control synthesis approach is then developed. Both the stability criterion and the H-infinity controller synthesis are based on the solutions of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the approaches proposed in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
