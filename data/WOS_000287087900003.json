Due to the plethora of MIMO interpretations in terrestrial systems and the particularities of satellite communications, this review is built on two pillars, namely fixed satellite and mobile satellite. Special attention is given to the characteristics of the satellite channel, which will ultimately determine the viability of MIMO over satellite. Finally, some future research directions are identified.", "paper_title": "MIMO over Satellite: A Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000287087900003"}
