Electroencephalogram (EEG) has been widely used for monitoring the brain's functional activities. Based on our previous research of 3DTV fatigue, one more objective and effective 3DTV fatigue evaluation model is proposed on gravity frequency of power spectrum and power spectral entropy. As the fatigue changes, the gravity frequency reflects the transition of EEG power spectrum and the power spectral entropy describes the level of chaos of EEG. 16 channels of EEG data of twenty-five subjects watching 2DTV and 3DTV were collected, and gravity frequency of power spectrum and power spectral entropy were then calculated and analyzed. These two parameters of the 3D group changed more significantly comparing with that of the 2D group on several electrodes. There are significant decreases in gravity frequency and power spectral entropy in several brain regions after long time of watching 3DTV, which indicates the decline of subjects' alertness level. Based on the subjective evaluation and two significant parameters, gravity frequency and power spectral entropy, an accurate evaluation model for 3DTV fatigue was established using the regression equation.
