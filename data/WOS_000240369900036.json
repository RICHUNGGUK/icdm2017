The porous media are numerically formed for different inner structure with given porosity. The porous structure similar to the real sample, Ni-Cr metal, can be obtained, where the pressure fields in both cases are almost the same. In the simulation of soot accumulation, the velocity field is changed when the soot is attached to the porous wall. The pressure drop is largely increased. Interestingly, the friction factor is smaller than experimentally predicted value by Ergun equation. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
