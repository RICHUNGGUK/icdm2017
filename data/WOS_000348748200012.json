To improve the solution efficiency for diagnosability, this paper proposes novel techniques to solve the problems of testing and optimizing for diagnosability. We propose a new concept, reverse twin plant, which is generated backwards from the final states of the DESs so there is no need to generate a complete copy of the DES model to determine the diagnosability. Such a design makes our testing algorithm much faster than existing methods. An efficient optimizing algorithm, which makes a non-diagnosable system diagnosable, is also proposed in the paper by expanding the minimal-observable space with operation on just a part of the DES model. Examples and theoretical studies demonstrate the performance of the proposed designs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
