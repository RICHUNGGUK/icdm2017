The relevant contributions are: (i) a sound and complete set of sequent calculi for quantified modal logics is devised; (ii) the approach is extended to the quantified temporal logic of linear, discrete time and a framework for doing automated reasoning via Proof Planning in it is developed; (iii) a set of promising experimental results is shown, obtained by applying the framework to the problem of Feature Interactions in telecommunication systems.", "paper_title": "Automated reasoning in quantified modal and temporal logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238257300006"}
