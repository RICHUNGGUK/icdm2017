Results: fast_protein_cluster is an optimized and extensible toolkit that supports Root Mean Square Deviation after optimal superposition (RMSD) and Template Modeling score (TM-score) as metrics. RMSD calculations using a laptop CPU are 60x faster than qcprot and 3x faster than current graphics processing unit (GPU) implementations. New GPU code further increases the speed of RMSD and TM-score calculations. fast_protein_cluster provides novel k-means and hierarchical clustering methods that are up to 250x and 2000x faster, respectively, than Clusco, and identify significantly more accurate models than Spicker and Clusco.", "paper_title": "fast_protein_cluster: parallel and optimized clustering of large-scale protein modeling data", "paper_id": "WOS:000338109200060"}
