It is a widely used statistical tool for describing the accuracy of a diagnostic test. In this paper we propose a new nonparametric ROC curve estimator based on the smoothed empirical distribution functions. We prove its strong consistency and perform a simulation study to compare it with some other popular nonparametric estimators of the ROC curve. We also apply the proposed method to a real data set.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric estimation of the ROC curve based on smoothed empirical distribution functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000324138300003"}
