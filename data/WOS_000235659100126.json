Intelligent agents can play an important role in solving these problems. In this paper we formulated this problem as a multi-agent game with the players being agents purchasing service from a common server. We strive to highlight major challenges in managing resources in a Grid computing environment and present some of our recent works on multi-agent negotiation strategies for resource management and scheduling in grid environment. The proposed approach is to realize multiple negotiation models/protocols/strategies that can be selected by the system automatically to adapt to computation needs as well as changing computing resource environment.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent negotiation model for resource allocation in Grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100126"}
