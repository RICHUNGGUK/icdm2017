Increased density and the need to test for new types of defects in nanometer technologies have resulted in a tremendous increase in test application time (TAT). This article presents a test synthesis method to reduce test application time for testing the datapath of a design. The test application time is reduced by applying a test-time-aware resource sharing algorithm on a scheduled control data flow graph (CDFG) of a design.", "paper_title": "Low test application time resource binding for behavioral synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000246693300008"}
