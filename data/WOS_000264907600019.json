We apply the classical formulation of FAST in which Fourier sine coefficients are utilized as sensitivity measures. Contrary to marginal sensitivity, profile-based and FAST approaches provide sensitivity measures that account for model nonlinearity and are pertinent to linear and nonlinear regression models. However, the primary difference between FAST and profile-based sensitivity is that traditional FAST fails to account for parameter dependencies in the model system while these dependencies are considered in the analysis procedure of profile-based sensitivity through the re-estimation of the remaining model parameters conditional on the values of the parameter of interest. An example is discussed to illustrate the comparisons by applying the three sensitivity methods to a model described by set of non-linear differential equations. Some computational aspects are also explored. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Parametric sensitivity: A case study comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000264907600019"}
