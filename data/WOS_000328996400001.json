Recently, some approaches have been proposed that use multiple blocks in a frame. These approaches simply drop the block that contains the error and the error-free blocks are transmitted to other nodes. This paper proposes an enhanced FEC scheme, called M-FEC, which reduces the overhead and the total number of transmissions. M-FEC fragments bulk data into many small blocks and these blocks are encoded using rateless codes. Only the erroneous blocks that are detected in a frame are dropped and a relay node waits for other incoming blocks in order to construct a full-sized frame. This simple approach can improve the performance of the FEC scheme over WSNs. Our experiments show that M-FEC reduces the number of received frames at the sink node by almost half compared to the previous approach. We compared our results for different degrees of Wi-Fi interference by choosing particular IEEE 802.15.4 channels and running our experiments for three different types of Wi-Fi interference.", "paper_title": "An Enhanced Approach for Reliable Bulk Data Transmission Based on Erasure-Resilient Codes in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328996400001"}
