First, we compute the potential matching between each pair of the image fragments based on their geometry and color. After that, a novel multi-piece matching algorithm is proposed to reassemble the overall image fragments. Finally, the reassembly result is refined by applying the graph optimization algorithm. We perform experiments to evaluate our algorithm on multiple torn real-world images, and demonstrate the robustness of this new assembly framework outperforms the existing algorithms in both reassembly accuracy (in handling accumulated pairwise matching error) and robustness (in handling small image fragments).
