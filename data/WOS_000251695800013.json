This problem is motivated by practical applications and has not been studied previously. In this paper, we present a heuristic to solve the above problem, which is based on the heuristic to generate a triangular mesh with less number of non-standard bars and shorter maximal edge length, and a process to make the length of each edge lower bounded. Our procedure is simple and easily implemented for this problem, and we prove that it has good performance guaranteed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
