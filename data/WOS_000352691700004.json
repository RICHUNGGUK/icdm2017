Our objective is to improve the throughput of Primary Users (PUs) while increase the opportunity that Secondary Users (SUs) can access the licensed spectrum. We combine the multi-hop routing selection problem with the graph-based cooperative game and bipartite graph model. A novel effective multi-hop routing selection algorithm called GBRA is proposed for CCRNs. The effect of relays to the routing path on throughput is considered. A novel method is introduced to divide coalition. A fair allocation rule to allocate the total profits of one coalition to its members is also introduced. Finally, based on the proposed coalition division method and the proposed profits allocation scheme in one coalition, the stability of the multi-hop routing path selected by GBRA is proved. Theoretical analysis and performance evaluation show that both PUs and SUs can improve their communication performance when they cooperate with each other.", "paper_title": "Coalition Graph Game for Robust Routing in Cooperative Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352691700004"}
