The mostly-digital controller functionally implements a non-PWM zone-wise control law through asynchronous circuitry, thus exhibiting self-timed minimum latency and ultra low power operation due to gate switching activity. Experimental results on a 0.35 mu m CMOS technology demonstrate an efficiency up to 80 % with a switching frequency of 2.86 MHz.", "paper_title": "An asynchronous finite-state-machine-based buck-boost converter for on-chip adaptive power supply", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900023"}
