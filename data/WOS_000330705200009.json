Previously, we proposed a force asynchronous diffusion model (FADM) for soft tissue warping simulation. The FADM works well if a lesion or an anatomical object has a convex shape. However, in some cases, this convex assumption is invalid. In order to remove this significant limitation, this paper presents an energy-based free boundary asynchronous diffusion model (EBFBADM) with three unique features. First, we utilize hexahedral voxels to represent the physical model of the surface triangular mesh and a regional proliferation algorithm to remove invalid voxels, simplify computation and improve realness in warping simulation. Second, we adopt the concept of free boundary to simulate soft tissue geometric characteristics more precisely during the warping process. Finally, we optimize the process of asynchronous diffusion by using the mechanical energy of mass point to achieve realistic soft tissue warping effects. Experimental results have shown that the EBFBADM improves performance in both computation and realness in surgical simulation.", "paper_title": "An energy-based free boundary asynchronous diffusion model for 3D warping of tissue dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000330705200009"}
