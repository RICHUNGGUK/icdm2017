This new interpretation allows one to describe all mesh modifications within the arbitrary Lagrangian Euler framework, thus removing the need to interpolate the solution across computation meshes with different connectivity. The resulting scheme is by construction conservation, and it is applied here to the solution of the Euler equations for compressible flow two spatial dimensions. Preliminary two dimensional numerical simulations are present to demonstrate the soundness of the approach. Numerical experiments show that method allows for large time steps without causing element invalidation or tangling at the same time guarantees high quality of the mesh elements without resorting to g re-meshing techniques, resulting in a very efficient solver for the analysis of e.g. f structure interaction problems, even for those cases that require large mesh deformation or changes in the domain topology.
