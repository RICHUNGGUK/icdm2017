Proposed method consists of structurally diverse classifiers with a new QRS complex geometrical feature extraction technique. Toward this objective, first, the events of the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal are detected and delineated using a robust wavelet-based algorithm. Then, each QRS region and also its corresponding discrete wavelet transform (DWT) are supposed as virtual images and each of them is divided into eight polar sectors. Next, the curve length of each excerpted segment is calculated and is used as the element of the feature space. Discrimination power of proposed classifier in isolation of different Gold standard beats was assessed with accuracy 98.20%. Also, proposed learning machine was applied to 7 arrhythmias belonging to 15 different records and accuracy 98.06% was achieved. Comparisons with peer-reviewed studies prove a marginal progress in computerized heart arrhythmia recognition technologies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
