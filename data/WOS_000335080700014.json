Secondly, alpha-group quasi-lock semantic resolution in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued propositional logic Lv(nx2)P(X) based on linguistic truth-valued lattice implication algebra L-v(nx2) is equivalently transformed into another alpha-group quasi-lock semantic resolution with different resolution level alpha in lattice-valued propositional logic Lv(n)P(X) by two cases.", "paper_title": "alpha-Group Quasi-Lock Semantic Resolution Method Based on Lattice-Valued Propositional Logic LP(X)", "paper_id": "WOS:000335080700014"}
