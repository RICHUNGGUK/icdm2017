In this study, two artificial intelligence techniques namely, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) were utilized to estimate the volume and length of flushing half-cone based on influential variables, i.e., mean flow velocity through bottom outlet (u), water depth in reservoir (H-w), mean grain diameter of deposited sediments (d(50)), thickness of deposited sediment (H-s) and bottom outlet diameter (D). Experimental data in both dimensional and non-dimensional forms were used to train and test ANN and ANFIS models. The results of the intelligence-based models were also compared with those of existing studies. The outcomes indicated that both ANN and ANFIS models predict the volume and length of flushing half-cone more accurately than existing studies. Also, it was found that the ANN model provides a better estimation of the geometry of flushing half-cone compared to the ANFIS model. Finally, sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the most and the least influential variables affecting the flushing half-cone geometry. It was found that the sediment characteristics (H-s,H- and d(50)) and fluids properties (H-w, and u) have respectively the most and the least effect on flushing half-cone volume and length.
