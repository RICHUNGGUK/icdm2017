Macro block-based physical design implementation needs to find a well-balanced solution among chip area, on-chip communication energy, and critical communication path delay. We present in this paper an automated way to implement an energy optimal netlist interconnecting the hard macro blocks using a heavily segmented communication architecture. We explore the entire tradeoff curve among the network energy, chip area, and critical communication path delay at the floorplanning stage based on two real-life application drivers. Large energy gains with small area overheads are illustrated during the floorplanning stage. This tradeoff profile is a good guideline for the SOC designers to choose the optimal solution for their specific systems.", "paper_title": "Energy/Area/Delay tradeoffs in the physical design of on-chip segmented bus architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314500009"}
