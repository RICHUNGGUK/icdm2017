Specifically, the Least Squares version of the algorithm (LS-SVM) is employed in recognition of the Greek phonemes in the framework of telephone-driven voice-enabled information service. The N-best candidate phonemes are identified and consequently feed to the speech and language recognition components. In a comparative evaluation of various classification methods, the SVM-based phoneme recognizer demonstrated a superior performance. Recognition rate of 74.2% was achieved from the N-best list, for N=5, prior to applying the language model.", "paper_title": "Recognition of Greek phonemes using support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100028"}
