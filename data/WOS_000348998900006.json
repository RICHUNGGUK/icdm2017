Adaptive PICs are attractive due to its low implementation complexities and good performance. In this paper, we propose a general framework for analyzing the bit error rate (BER) and convergence performance of the normalized LMS (NLMS) based PIC. To further improve the convergence speed of the PIC system, a novel switch-mode noise-constrained NLMS (SNC-NLMS) algorithm for the adaptive multistage PIC (AMPIC) is also proposed. Simulation results show that the analytical results are reasonably accurate and the SNC-NLMS AMPIC outperforms the NLMS-based one, if the algorithm parameters are properly chosen.", "paper_title": "Performance of NLMS-based Parallel Interference Cancellation (PIC) For Up-Link CDMA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000348998900006"}
