Recently it was shown that a simple mathematical function describes the relation between HMM parameters and an output probability of interest; this result was established by representing the HMM as a (dynamic) Bayesian network. To determine this sensitivity function, it was suggested to employ existing Bayesian network algorithms. Up till now, however, no special purpose algorithms for establishing sensitivity functions for HMMs existed. In this paper we discuss the drawbacks of computing HMM sensitivity functions, building only upon existing algorithms. We then present a new and efficient algorithm, which is specially tailored for determining sensitivity functions in HMMs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
