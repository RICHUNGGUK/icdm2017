When the dimension d is unbounded, the problem is equivalent to graph isomorphism and is conjectured to be in FPT. When /A/ = m < /B/ = n, the problem becomes that of deciding whether A is congruent to a subset of B and is known to be NP-complete. We show that point subset congruence, with d as a parameter, is W[l]-hard, and that it cannot be solved in O(mn(o(d)))-time, unless SNP subset of DTIME(2(o(n))). This shows that, unless FPT = W[1], the problem of finding an isometry of A that minimizes its directed Hausdorff distance, or its Earth Mover's Distance, to B, is not in FPT.", "paper_title": "On the parameterized complexity of d-dimensional point set pattern matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800016"}
