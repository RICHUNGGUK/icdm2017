Therefore, two signal processing oriented cluster management strategies, the proactive and the reactive cluster management, are proposed to efficiently deal with these constraints. The former strategy is designed for heterogeneous WSNs, where sensors are organized in a static clustering architecture. A non-myopic cluster activation rule is realized to reduce the number of hand-off operations between clusters, while maintaining desired estimation accuracy. The proactive strategy minimizes the hardware expenditure and the total energy consumption. On the other hand, the main concern of the reactive strategy is to maximize the network longevity of homogeneous WSNs. A Dijkstra-like algorithm is proposed to dynamically form active cluster based on the relation between the predictive target distribution and the candidate sensors, considering both the energy efficiency and the data relevance. By evenly distributing the energy expenditure over the whole network, the objective of maximizing the network longevity is achieved. The simulations evaluate and compare the two proposed strategies in terms of tracking accuracy, energy consumption and execution time.
