The principle of perceptual prominence captures the key aspects of mise-en-scene required for interpreting a video scene. We present a novel approach for applying perceptual grouping principles to the spatio-temporal domain of video. Our spatio-temporal perceptual grouping scheme, applied on blob tracks, makes use of a specified spatio-temporal coherence model. A high level semantic interpretation of scenes is done using the mise-en-scene features and the perceptual prominence computed for the perceptual clusters.", "paper_title": "Video scene interpretation using perceptual prominence and mise-en-scene features", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200057"}
