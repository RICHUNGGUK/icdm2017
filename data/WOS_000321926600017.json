In this paper, we propose a new spatio-temporal saliency detection framework on the basis of regularized feature reconstruction. Specifically, for video saliency detection, both the temporal and spatial saliency detection are considered. For temporal saliency, we model the movement of the target patch as a reconstruction process using the patches in neighboring frames. A Laplacian smoothing term is introduced to model the coherent motion trajectories. With psychological findings that abrupt stimulus could cause a rapid and involuntary deployment of attention, our temporal model combines the reconstruction error, regularizer, and local trajectory contrast to measure the temporal saliency. For spatial saliency, a similar sparse reconstruction process is adopted to capture the regions with high center-surround contrast. Finally, the temporal saliency and spatial saliency are combined together to favor salient regions with high confidence for video saliency detection. We also apply the spatial saliency part of the spatio-temporal model to image saliency detection. Experimental results on a human fixation video dataset and an image saliency detection dataset show that our method achieves the best performance over several state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Regularized Feature Reconstruction for Spatio-temporal Saliency Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000321926600017"}
