A first polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing binet matrices appeared in the author's doctoral thesis. In this paper, we present some key ideas and results involved in the design of this algorithm. We show how we can find a Camion basis of the input matrix, whenever this one is binet, and then reduce the recognition problem to that of special billet matrices called bicyclic and cyclic.", "paper_title": "Recognizing binet matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000280154400018"}
