It is believed that the small private exponent attack on the MPRSA is less effective than that on RSA (see Hinek et al's work at SAC 2003), which means smaller private exponents can be used in the MPRSA to speed up the decryption process. Our work shows that even if a private exponent is significantly beyond Hinek et al.'s bound, it still may be insecure if the prime difference Delta (Delta = p(r) - p(1) = N-gamma. supposing p(1) < P-2 < ... < p(r)) is small, i.e. 0 < gamma < 1/r. Specifically, by taking full advantage of prime properties, our small private exponent attack reveals that the MPRSA is insecure when delta < 1 - root 1 + 2 gamma - 3/r (if gamma >= 3/2r - 1+delta/4) or delta <= 3/r - 1/4 -2 gamma (if gamma < 3/2r - 1+delta/4), where delta is the exponential of the private exponent d with base N, i.e., d = N delta. In addition, we present a Fermat-like factoring attack which factors N efficiently when Delta < N1/r(2). These proposed attacks surpass previous works (e.g. Bahig et al.'s at ICICS 2012), and are proved effective in practice.", "paper_title": "Improved Attacks on Multi-Prime RSA with Small Prime Difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700012"}
