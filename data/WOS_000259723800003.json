This paper conducts Monte Carlo simulations to examine the sizes and powers of several commonly used stochastic dominance tests when the underlying distributions are correlated or heteroskedastic. Our Monte Carlo study shows that the test developed by Davidson and Duclos [R. Davidson, J.Y. Duclos, Statistical inference for stochastic dominance and for the measurement of poverty and inequality, Econometrica 68 (6) (2000) 1435-1464] has better size and power performances than two alternative tests developed by Kaur et al. [A. Kaur, B.L.S.P. Rao, H. Singh, Testing for second order stochastic dominance of two distributions, Econ. Theory 10 (1994) 849-866] and Anderson [G. Anderson, Nonparametric tests of stochastic dominance in income distributions, Econometrica 64 (1996) 1183-1193]. In addition, we find that when the underlying distributions are heteroskedastic, both the size and power of the test developed by Davidson and Duclos [R. Davidson, J.Y. Duclos, Statistical inference for stochastic dominance and for the measurement of poverty and inequality, Econometrica 68 (6) (2000) 1435-1464] are superior to those of the two alternative tests.
