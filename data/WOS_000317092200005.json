The human expertise identifies good design patterns, and local optimization fine-tunes these designs so that they reach their potential at early stages of the evolutionary process. At the same time, the feedback on local optimal designs confirms and refines the human assessment. The advantages of the IHC process are demonstrated with micromachined resonator test cases. Guidelines on how to set parameters for the IHC algorithm are also made based on experimental observations and results. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
