We present our spoken dialog system design and its evaluation. We developed our dialog system based on Markov decision processes framework and optimized it by using reinforcement learning algorithms with data we collected from real user interactions. The system begins to learn optimal dialog strategies for initiative selection and for the type of confirmations that it uses during the interaction. We compared the unoptimized system with the optimized system in terms of objective measures (e.g. task completion) and subjective measures (e.g. ease of use, future intention to use the system) and obtained positive results.", "paper_title": "Let's talk! speaking virtual counselor offers you a brief intervention", "paper_id": "WOS:000343714200004"}
