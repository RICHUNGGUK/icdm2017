For fixed f and n, measuring the points x is an element of I (according to Lebesgue measure) that generate the order pattern sigma gives a probability distribution mu(n)(f) on the set of length n permutations. We study the distributions that arise this way for various classes of functions f. Our main results treat the class of measure-preserving functions. We obtain an exact description of the set of realizable distributions in this case: for each n this set is a union of open faces of the polytope of flows on a certain digraph, and a simple combinatorial criterion determines which faces are included. We also show that for general f, apart from an obvious compatibility condition, there is no restriction on the sequence {mu(n)(f)}(n = 1,2,...). In addition, we give a necessary condition for f to have finite exclusion type, that is, for there to be finitely many order patterns that generate all order patterns not realized by f. Using entropy we show that if f is piecewise continuous, piecewise monotone, and either ergodic or with points of arbitrarily high period, then f cannot have finite exclusion type. This generalizes results of S. Elizalde.", "paper_title": "Distributions of Order Patterns of Interval Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000317130400001"}
