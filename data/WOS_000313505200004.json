When a (1) over bar encounters a 1, both particles annihilate. We derive asymptotic distribution of appearence of particles at a given site when the CA is initialized with the Bernoulli measure with the probabilities of both particles equal to 1/2.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic distribution of entry times in a cellular automaton with annihilating particles", "paper_id": "WOS:000313505200004"}
