Newtonian fluids are considered in this study. The continuity of traction is ensured at the interface, and the axial velocity is assumed to be uniform across each film layer separately. The effects of inertia, gravity, fluid parameters and processing conditions on the steady-state flow and its stability are studied. The results indicate that the fluid properties and the processing conditions have significant influence on the flow. The flow stability is strongly dependent on the layer layout with respect to the take-up rolling process. The frequency of the (unstable) disturbance is insensitive to flow and processing parameters.
