Here, we investigate how the performance of this network on pattern recognition task is altered when neurons are removed and the weights of the synapses corresponding to these deleted neurons are divided among the remaining synapses. Five distinct ways of distributing such weights are evaluated. We speculate how this numerical work about synaptic compensation may help to guide experimental studies on memory rehabilitation interventions.", "paper_title": "Synaptic compensation on Hopfield network: implications for memory rehabilitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291484000011"}
