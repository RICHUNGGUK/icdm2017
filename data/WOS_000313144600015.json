In particular, we are interested in asymmetric power assignments so that the induced broadcast communication graph is both, energy efficient and has a short collision-free broadcast schedule. We consider both random and deterministic node layouts and develop four different broadcast schemes with provable performance guarantees on three optimization objectives simultaneously: total energy consumption, network lifetime and collision-free schedule length. We also show extensive numerical results which support our findings. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
