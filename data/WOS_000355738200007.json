We propose a novel analytical model to approximately calculate the maximum per-flow TCP congestion window limit that prevents packet losses at the access point buffer and therefore provides fair TCP access both in the downlink and uplink. The proposed analysis is unique in considering the effects of varying number of uplink and downlink TCP flows, differing round trip times among TCP connections and the use of delayed TCP acknowledgment (ACK) mechanism. Motivated by the findings of this theoretical analysis and simulations, we design a link layer access control block to be employed only at the access point in order to resolve the unfair access problem. The proposed link layer access control block uses congestion control and ACK filtering approach by prioritizing the access of TCP data packets of downlink flows over TCP ACK packets of uplink flows. Via simulations, we show that the proposed algorithm can provide both short-term and long-term fair accesses while improving channel utilization and access delay.
