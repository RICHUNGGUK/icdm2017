One of the critical challenges faced by such decisions is the potential risk of leaking confidential information through shared suppliers and partners. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to decompose a product into several sub-components for mitigating the risk of Intellectual Property (IP) leakage caused by inferences in supply chains. A design structure matrix is employed to study the potential risk of IP leakage considering different types of interactions between product components. Based on such a matrix, a clustering algorithm is developed to decompose and allocate the product components regarding IP protection issue. This methodology can be considered as a decision support tool to help the manufacturer select a set of optimal suppliers while minimizing the information leakage risk and the manufacturing cost.
