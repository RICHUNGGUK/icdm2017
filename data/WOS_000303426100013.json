First, the initial incomplete model (with holes) is decomposed into a base model and a high-frequency component, which represents global rough shape and geometric details, respectively. We then repair the base model via smooth hole-filling, and compute the geometry detail image using high frequency information. One novel element of our approach is that we allow users to interactively sketch a few structural curves that span across hole regions, with a goal to repair both local geometric details and global structure. With the help of local parameterization, we convert detailed geometry into gradient-domain images which can propagate along user-specified sketches. By integrating recovered gradient-domain images and base shape, we can generate a complete model that faithfully recovers both global structure and local details. The salient contribution of this paper is the unified approach for user interaction, global structure, and geometry details towards high-fidelity model completion. We demonstrate our new approach using a number of examples that exhibit salient global structure as well as local geometry details.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous structure and geometry detail completion based on interactive user sketches", "paper_id": "WOS:000303426100013"}
