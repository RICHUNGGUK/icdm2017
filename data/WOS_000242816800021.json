Two exact artificial boundary conditions are introduced to reduce the original problem into an initial boundary value problem with a finite computational domain. The artificial boundary conditions involve the 1/2 order fractional derivative in t. Then, a fully discrete explicit three-level difference scheme is derived. The truncation errors are analyzed in detail. The stability and convergence with the convergence order of O(h(3/2) + tau h(-1/2)) are proved under the condition tau/h(2) < 1/2 by the energy method. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. Two open problems are brought forward at the end of the article. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
