Some mathematical properties of the proposed distribution are investigated. We derive four explicit expressions for the generalized ordinary moments and a general formula for the incomplete moments based on infinite sums of Meijer'sGfunctions. We also obtain explicit expressions for the generating function and mean deviations. We estimate the model parameters by maximum likelihood and determine the observed information matrix. Some simulations are run to assess the performance of the maximum likelihood estimators. The flexibility of the new distribution is illustrated by means of an application to real data.", "paper_title": "The exponential-Weibull lifetime distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000340874500005"}
