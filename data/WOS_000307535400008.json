We propose a two component system, introducing Lattice Independent Component Analysis (LICA) for feature extraction and Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) for classification. In previous works we have proposed LICA for a variety of image processing tasks. The first step of LICA is to identify strong lattice independent components from the data. In the second step, the set of strong lattice independent vector are used for linear unmixing of the data, obtaining a vector of abundance coefficients. The resulting abundance values are used as features for classification, specifically for face recognition. Extreme Learning Machines are accurate and fast-learning innovative classification methods based on the random generation of the input-to-hidden-units weights followed by the resolution of the linear equations to obtain the hidden-to-output weights. The LICA-ELM system has been tested against state-of-the-art feature extraction methods and classifiers, outperforming them when performing cross-validation on four large unbalanced face databases.", "paper_title": "Face recognition with lattice independent component analysis and extreme learning machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000307535400008"}
