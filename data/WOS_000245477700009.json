Interestingly, each of the proposed empirical formula yields good results for a particular data set. Hence, in this study, alternative approaches, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), Lire proposed to estimate the equilibrium and time-dependent scour depth with numerous reliable data base. Two ANN models, multi-layer perception using back-propagation algorithm (MLP/BP) and radial basis using orthogonal least-squares algorithm (RBF/OLS), were used. The equilibrium Scour depth was modeled as a function of five variables; flow depth, mean velocity, critical flow velocity, mean grain diameter and pier diameter. The time variation of scour depth was also modeled in terms of equilibrium scour depth, equilibrium scour time, scour time, mean flow velocity and critical flow velocity. The training and testing data are selected from the experimental data of several valuable references. Numerical tests indicate that MLP/BP model provide a better prediction of scour depth than RBF/OLS and ANFIS models as well as the previous empirical approaches. Finally, sensitivity analysis shows that pier diameter has a greater influence oil equilibrium scour depth than the other independent parameters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
