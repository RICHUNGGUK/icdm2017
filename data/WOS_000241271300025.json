The database integrates results from multiple, independent microarray studies comparing male and female gene expression in Drosophila melanogaster, Drosophila simulans and Anopheles gambiae. Sebida uses standard nomenclature, which allows individual genes to be compared across different microarray platforms and to be queried by gene name, symbol, or annotation number. In addition to ratios of male/female expression for each gene, Sebida also contains information useful for evolutionary studies, such as local recombination rate, degree of codon bias and interspecific divergence at synonymous and non-synonymous sites.", "paper_title": "Sebida: a database for the functional and evolutionary analysis of genes with sex-biased expression", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271300025"}
