Perfect nonlinear monomials were employed to construct optimal ternary cyclic codes with parameters [3(m) - 1, 3(m) - 1 - 2m, 4] by Carlet, Ding, and Yuan in 2005. In this paper, almost perfect nonlinear monomials, and a number of other monomials over GF (3(m)) are used to construct optimal ternary cyclic codes with the same parameters. Nine open problems on such codes are also presented.", "paper_title": "Optimal Ternary Cyclic Codes From Monomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000323455800044"}
