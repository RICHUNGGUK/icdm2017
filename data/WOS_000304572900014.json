It iterates frequency estimation and phase calculation based on the DFT phase-based methods, which maximizes the signal-to-noise floor ratio at the frequency estimation position. We apply it to three methods, the phase difference estimation, the derivative estimation, and the arctan estimation, which are known to be among the best DFT phase-based methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method shows meaningful reductions of the frequency estimation error compared to the conventional methods especially at low signal-to-noise ratio.", "paper_title": "Iterative Frequency Estimation For Accuracy Improvement of Three DFT Phase-Based Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900014"}
