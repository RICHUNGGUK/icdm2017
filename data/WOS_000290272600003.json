It imitates the music improvisation process where musicians improvise their instruments' pitch by searching for a perfect state of harmony. Since the emergence of this algorithm in 2001, it attracted many researchers from various fields especially those working on solving optimization problems. Consequently, this algorithm guided researchers to improve on its performance to be in line with the requirements of the applications being developed. These improvements primarily cover two aspects: (1) improvements in terms of parameters setting, and (2) improvements in terms of hybridizing HS components with other metaheuristic algorithms. This paper presents an overview of these aspects, with a goal of providing useful references to fundamental concepts accessible to the broad community of optimization practitioners.", "paper_title": "The variants of the harmony search algorithm: an overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000290272600003"}
