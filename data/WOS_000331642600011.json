The matrix embedding constructed by [8,3], [8,4] [8,5] [8,6] and [8,7] linear codes is taken as the basic embedding strategy. Each block with 2 x 4 pixels is used as a cover unit and its block complexity is computed by neighboring pixel difference. The embedding strategy sets are defined for seven kinds of blocks with different complexity. The corresponding embedding strategies are determined by resolving the embedding risk minimization problem. The adaption manners guarantee that message bits are mainly embedded into the regions with higher complexity values. Experiments are performed and the results show that the proposed method can provide a moderate capacity with lower distortion and have higher resistance ability against the chosen steganalytic algorithms.", "paper_title": "Adaptive steganography based on block complexity and matrix embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000331642600011"}
