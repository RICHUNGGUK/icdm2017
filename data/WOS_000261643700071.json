In this paper, we present a system for controlling avatars by natural body movement via a single web-camera. A pose database and a set of color markers are utilized to make ill-posed vision problem tractable for real game applications. Based on the proposed algorithms for indexing pose samples and estimating human pose, we build a prototype system that is responsive, easy to manipulate and runs automatically in real time. User study shows that the system is user-friendly and provides immersive experiences. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
