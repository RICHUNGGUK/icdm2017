On the other hand, the Next Generation Mobile Network (NGMN) combines multiple radio access technologies (RATs) to optimize overall network performance. Handover performance is becoming a vital indicator of the quality experience of mobile user equipment (UE). In contrast to the conventional vertical handover issue, the problem we are facing is how to seamlessly transmit broadcast/multicast sessions among heterogeneous networks. In this paper, we propose a new network entity, media independent broadcast multicast service center (MIBM-SC), to provide seamless handover for broadcast/multicast sessions over heterogeneous networks, by extensions and enhancements of MBMS and media independent information service (MIIS) architectures. Additionally, a network selection scheme and a cell transmission mode selection scheme are proposed for selecting the best target network and best transmission mode. Both schemes are based on a load-aware network capacity estimation algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach has the capability to provide MBMS over heterogeneous networks, with improved handover performance in terms of packet loss rate, throughput, handover delay, cell load, bandwidth usage, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR).", "paper_title": "An enhanced framework for providing multimedia broadcast/multicast service over heterogeneous networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000329833400006"}
