We show the model for a non-monotonic version of Soft CCP (SCCP), that is an extension of CCP where the constraints have a preference level associated with them. Crisp constraints can be modeled in the same framework as well. In the considered non-monotonic soft version (NmSCCP), it is also possible to remove constraints from the store. The language can be used for coordinating agents on a common store of information that represents the set of shared resources. In such scenarios, it is clearly important to enforce the integrity and confidentiality rights on the resources, in order, for instance, to hide part of the information to some agents, or to prevent an agent to consume too many resources. Finally, we present a bisimulation relation to check equivalence between two programs written in this language.", "paper_title": "A Secure Non-monotonic Soft Concurrent Constraint Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000345457500003"}
