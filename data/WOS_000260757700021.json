This paper is based on an earlier work by Hwang for finding an optimal economic order quantity solution for items subject to amelioration in a Weibull distribution. Hwang solved the problem with a graphical procedure. In this paper, a rigorous analytical solution approach is derived for cases with different shape parameters. A detailed numerical example is also presented to illustrate the optimality of the derived solution. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
