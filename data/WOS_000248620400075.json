Yet, to our knowledge, no proposals focusing on extracting such information have been proposed in the text mining literature. Results: In this work, we present an analysis of the types of negative information that is reported, and a heuristic-based system using a full dependency parser to extract such information. We performed a preliminary evaluation study that shows encouraging results of our system. Finally, we have obtained an initial corpus of negative protein-protein interactions as basis for the construction of larger ones.", "paper_title": "Negation of protein-protein interactions: analysis and extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400075"}
