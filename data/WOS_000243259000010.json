Enterprise information portals ( EIPs) hold promise in this regard, offering each user a gateway to customized and personalized content. However, in large organizations EIP implementers face the complexity of tailoring portals for potentially thousands of users. A conceptual framework based on marketing fundamentals is developed to inform EIP implementation in this respect. It is argued that EIP implementers should view their user community as a number of distinct segments in order to address divergent needs more specifically ( as opposed to a 'one size fits all' approach). For each identified segment, a 'mix' of content ( product), distribution ( place), promotion and price ( cost) should be considered. The framework is applied to two cases of EIP implementation in large organizations. It is proposed that segmentation enables better planning of the overall EIP implementation effort. Considerations such as the number of user segments, customization, and personalization of content, and the funding of EIP development in large organizations are also discussed. The concepts elaborated here also hold theoretical relevance for other IS implementation contexts that involve very large user communities with diverse information requirements.", "paper_title": "A conceptual framework for the implementation of enterprise information portals in large organizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000243259000010"}
