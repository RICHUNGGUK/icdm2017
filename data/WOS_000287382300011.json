This is achieved by using both strictly locally testable languages and morphisms. The representation is in a similar way to the Chomsky-Schutzenberger representation of context-free languages. Specifically, each recursively enumerable language L can be represented in the form L = h(L(gamma) boolean AND R), where gamma is an insertion system of weight (3, 3), R is a strictly 2-testable language, and h is a projection. A similar representation can be obtained for context-free languages, using insertion systems of weight (2, 0) and strictly 2-testable languages, as well as for regular languages, using insertion systems of weight (1, 0) and strictly 2-testable languages.
