{"auto_keywords": [], "paper_keywords": [""], "paper_abstract": "A 3-graph is said to contain a generalized 4-cycle if it contains 4 edges A, B, C, D such that A boolean AND B = C boolean AND D = empty set and A boolean OR B = C boolean OR D. We show that a 3-graph in which every pair of vertices is contained in at least 4 edges must contain a generalized 4-cycle. When the number of vertices, n, is equivalent to 1 or 5 modulo 20, this result is optimum, in the sense that for such n there are 3-graphs where every pair of vertices is contained in 3 edges but which do not contain a generalized 4-cycle.", "paper_title": "The Largest Minimum Codegree of a 3-Graph Without a Generalized 4-Cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000312036300007"}
