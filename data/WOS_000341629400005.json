In particular, these topics are challenging in MWSN applications to be compliant with the green wireless media paradigm. In this article, we review the current state of the art in green QoE MWSNs, with reference to mobile users and remote applications. At first, the most relevant aspects regarding the fusion, storage, transmission, and retrieval of multimedia data are reviewed and critically discussed. Afterward, we present some recent paradigms and trends in power-efficient QoE multimedia data fusion and clustering, and collaborative context-aware real-time in-network processing that may serve as guidelines for future green media applications.", "paper_title": "GREEN MULTIMEDIA WIRELESS SENSOR NETWORKS: DISTRIBUTED INTELLIGENT DATA FUSION, IN-NETWORK PROCESSING, AND OPTIMIZED RESOURCE MANAGEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629400005"}
