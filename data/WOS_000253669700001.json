They are both based on a factorial analysis method called spline principal component analysis with respect to instrumental variables (spline PCAIV). The first method is a straightforward application of spline PCAIV while the second one is an adaptation of spline PCAIV In the modified version, the used criteria according to the unknown value that need to be predicted are differentiated. Those two forecasting methods are shown to be well adapted to time series.
