In the new deregulated framework, producers and consumers require short-term price forecasting to derive their bidding strategies to the electricity market. Accurate forecasting tools are required for producers to maximize their profits and for consumers to maximize their utilities. A three-layered feedforward artificial neural network, trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, is used for forecasting the next 168 hour electricity prices. We evaluate the accuracy of the price forecasting attained with the proposed approach, reporting the numerical results from a real-world case study based on an electricity market.", "paper_title": "An artificial neural network approach for short-term electricity prices forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000253607500002"}
