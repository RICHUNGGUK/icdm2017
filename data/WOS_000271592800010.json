In this paper, we present an intelligent and reliable data transmission protocol (IRDT) to collect and transmit sensory data timely, reliably and energy-efficiently. IRDT consists of three important mechanisms: (1) reliability calculation mechanism, (2) information classification mechanism, and (3) intelligent balancing mechanism. With these three mechanisms, IRDT can reduce redundant messages, enhance the transmission performance, and compensate the deficient messages for reliability intelligently. The simulation results show that IRDT can outperform both LEACH and ECDG and significantly improve the speed of sensory data collection and the reliability of the whole DWSN.", "paper_title": "An Intelligent and Reliable Data Transmission Protocol for Highly Destructible Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271592800010"}
