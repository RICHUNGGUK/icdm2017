Such a decision-making problem is addressed with consideration of the competitors and the learning curve effect within the three hypothetical stages of a product life cycle (PLC). Accordingly, a Bayesian decision model that incorporates expert opinions with available information is proposed to determine the optimal CIFA ratio for a MY product. Finally, a numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and sensitivity analyses are also performed in light of the numerical example. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
