It includes some earlier constructions of codebooks meeting the Levenstein bound as special cases. With this construction, two new families of codebooks achieving the Levenstein bound are obtained. The codebooks constructed in this paper could have a very small alphabet size.", "paper_title": "New Families of Codebooks Achieving the Levenstein Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100046"}
