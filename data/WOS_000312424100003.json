This paper presents a novel structure to enhance magnetic force and velocity in a TLRM. The new structure is accomplished through some changes in a TLRM, which results in a step winding structure. Comparing the proposed motor and the typical motor performances, it is proven that the proposed motor has better performance. For dynamic modeling of the proposed TLRM and to obtain the motor output characteristics, the method used for inductance profile calculation is described. The performance improvements in the proposed motor are evaluated using experimental results and finite element method analysis. At the end, the simulation results are compared with the experimental ones. Good agreement between the experimental and simulation results is observed.", "paper_title": "A novel structure to enhance magnetic force and velocity in tubular linear reluctance motor", "paper_id": "WOS:000312424100003"}
