Such institutions are especially interested in minimizing the cost of purchase which consists of the prices at which particular products are bought as well as of the cost of their transportation. We present the formal mathematical model of the problem and the lower bound for the criterion value. We propose a genetic algorithm and the specialized list heuristic approach solving the case, which we prove is strongly NP-hard. The efficiency of implemented methods was checked in extensive computational experiments. The proposed algorithms have been integrated with the software system designed with a view of supporting charitable organizations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
