In this context, multigranular OXCs (MG-OXCs) have been suggested as a means of reducing the amount of equipment required. Here we expand the concept of MG-OXCs to include optical packet granularity and review the key building blocks for the advent of MG-OXCs. A single-layer MG-OXC is suggested that offers enhanced flexibility with respect to other single-layer concepts, conversion capability, and good physical performance. Concatenation performance is analytically investigated.
