The beta-Ginibre is a repulsive point process in which repulsion is controlled by the beta parameter. When beta tends to zero, the point process converges in law towards a Poisson point process. If beta equals to one it becomes a Ginibre point process. Simulations on real data collected in Paris, France, show that base station locations can be fitted with a beta-Ginibre point process. Moreover, we prove that their superposition tends to a Poisson point process as it can be seen from real data. Qualitative interpretations on deployment strategies are derived from the model fitting of the raw data.", "paper_title": "A Case Study on Regularity in Cellular Network Deployment", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900020"}
