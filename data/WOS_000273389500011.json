The method couples time parallel (TP) and CWM methods operating at different spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach on two examples: a chemical reaction kinetic system and a non-linear predator-prey system. Our results indicate that the tpCWM technique is capable of accelerating time-to-solution by 2-3-orders of magnitude and is amenable to efficient parallel implementation. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
