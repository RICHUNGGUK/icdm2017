A parameterized cost model is first developed by combining energy and reliability with a weight parameter that defines the optimization priority. Using this model, the overall mapping cost could be evaluated. Subsequently, a mapping method using branch and bound with a partial cost ratio is employed to find the best mapping by enumerating all the possible patterns organized in a search tree. To improve the search efficiency, nonoptimal mappings are discarded at early stages using the partial cost ratio. Using the proposed approach, applications can be mapped onto most NoC topologies and running with various routing algorithms when considering both energy and reliability. Other state-of-the-art works have also done substantial research for the same topic but only limited to a specific topology or routing algorithm. Even for the same topology and routing algorithm, the proposed approach still shows considerable advantages in many aspects. Experiments show that this approach gains not only significant reduction in energy but also improvement in reliability. It also outperforms other approaches in throughput and latency with competitive run time.", "paper_title": "A Flexible Energy- and Reliability-Aware Application Mapping for NoC-Based Reconfigurable Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000019"}
