Natural products or their derivatives have provided more than 50% of all existing drugs, offering a chemically diverse space for discovery of novel drugs. Description: BioPhytMol has been designed to systematically curate and analyze the anti-mycobacterial natural product chemical space. BioPhytMol is developed as a drug-discovery community resource with anti-mycobacterial phytomolecules and plant extracts. Currently, it holds 2582 entries including 188 plant families (692 genera and 808 species) from global flora, manually curated from literature. In total, there are 633 phytomolecules (with structures) curated against 25 target mycobacteria. Multiple analysis approaches have been used to prioritize the library for drug-like compounds, for both whole cell screening and target-based approaches. In order to represent the multidimensional data on chemical diversity, physiochemical properties and biological activity data of the compound library, novel approaches such as the use of circular graphs have been employed. Conclusion: BioPhytMol has been designed to systematically represent and search for anti-mycobacterial phytochemical information. Extensive compound analyses can also be performed through web-application for prioritizing drug-like compounds.", "paper_title": "BioPhytMol: a drug discovery community resource on anti-mycobacterial phytomolecules and plant extracts", "paper_id": "WOS:000346446100001"}
