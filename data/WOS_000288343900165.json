Although SQL is widely used, its syntax is not very comprehensive to a typical user. In this paper we present a tool capable of transforming simple queries formatted in natural language into their equivalent SQL queries. The purpose of this study is to provide a query syntax method closer to natural language. We currently support three languages: English, German and Greek and we show how our tool can be extended easily from a user so as to support any other language. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
