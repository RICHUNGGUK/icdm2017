The basic ingredients of this framework is a set of arguments and a Boolean abstract (i.e., its origin is not known) binary defeat relation. Preference-based argumentation frameworks are instantiations of Dung's framework in which the defeat relation is derived from an attack relation and a preference relation over the arguments. Recently, Dung's framework has been extended in order to consider the strength of the defeat relation, i.e., to quantify the degree to which an argument defeats another argument. In this paper, we instantiate this extended framework by a preference-based argumentation framework with a valued preference relation. As particular cases, the latter can be derived from a weight function over the arguments or a Boolean preference relation. We show under some reasonable conditions that there are \"less situations\" in which a defense between arguments holds with a valued preference relation compared to a Boolean preference relation. Finally, we provide some conditions that the valued preference relation shall satisfy when it is derived from a weight function. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
