PFMAP is inspired from systematic resampling algorithm for particle filters, in which all particles can run parallel and independently from each other. Based upon the experimental results from applying PFMAP for various real life and synthetic applications onto the different topologies and architectures, the performance of the 2-D mesh architectures in terms of communication cost increased by up to 51% for irregular topologies, and by up to 31% for custom architectures. Similarly, total travel distance obtained by PFMAP is reduced by up to 45% for custom 2-D mesh architectures. In addition to these, average clock cycles per flit and total network power are reduced by up to 17% and 15% for regular 2-D mesh architectures, respectively. Finally, communication cost is diminished by up to 34% for 3-D regular NoC architectures.", "paper_title": "PFMAP: Exploitation of Particle Filters for Network-on-Chip Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500013"}
