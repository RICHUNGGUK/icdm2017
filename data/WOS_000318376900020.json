In addition, the development of computers promises new methods and means for quantitative analysis of the palaeocontinental reconstructions. Therefore, the Palaeocontinental Reconstructions Simulation System (PRSS) was independently developed using a set of methods based on paleomagnetism, computer models of plate tectonics, motion characteristics on a spherical surface and relevant mathematical algorithms to analyse quantitatively and simulate dynamically plate motions during geologic history. Also, we concluded that the method of reconstructions, especially for small terranes from Mesozoic, could be summarized into four steps: (1) reconstruct the absolute positions at several different geological ages on the basis of paleomagnetic data which constrain palaeolatitude; (2) use a variety of information (e.g., palaeontology, lithofacies, paleoclimate etc.) to constrain palaeolongitude; (3) construct Euler poles to describe relative motion for each pair of continents; and (4) calculate Euler poles by concatenating Euler poles of relative motion to determine continents motion history. Practical application effect proves that this method and the software can accurately simulate and intuitively show the state and the trajectories of plate's motion at different stages in the geologic history, which provides a solid foundation for research on geologic history and geodynamics. The paper gives a detailed description of the functions and relevant algorithms of PRSS. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
