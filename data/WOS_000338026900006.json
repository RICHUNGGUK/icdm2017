Following the identification and removal of thin-sheet regions from an arbitrary solid using the thick/thin decomposition approach developed by Robinson et al. [1], the technique here employs shape metrics generated using local sizing measures to identify long-slender regions within the thick body. A series of algorithms automatically partition the thick region into a non-manifold assembly of long-slender and complex sub-regions. A structured anisotropic mesh is applied to the thin-sheet and long-slender bodies, and the remaining complex bodies are filled with unstructured isotropic tetrahedra. The resulting semi-structured mesh possesses significantly fewer degrees of freedom than the equivalent unstructured mesh, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The accuracy of the efficient meshes generated for a complex geometry is verified via a study that compares the results of a modal analysis with the results of an equivalent analysis on a dense tetrahedral mesh.", "paper_title": "Automatic decomposition and efficient semi-structured meshing of complex solids", "paper_id": "WOS:000338026900006"}
