Unfortunately, despite vast improvements in the quality of RFID technology, a significant amount of erroneous data is still captured in the system. Currently, the problems associated with RFID have been addressed by cleaning algorithms to enhance the data quality. In this paper, we present X-CleLo, a means to intelligently clean and transform the dirty data into high-level events using Clausal Defeasible Logic. The extensive experimental study we have conducted has shown that the X-CleLo method has several advantages over currently utilised cleaning techniques and achieves a higher cleaning and event discovery rate.", "paper_title": "X-CleLo: intelligent deterministic RFID data and event transformer", "paper_id": "WOS:000300664900005"}
