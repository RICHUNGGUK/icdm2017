Design: A retrospective review was conducted of patients hospitalized from Jan 2004 to Jun 2006 with suspected pneumonia who received vancomycin, tobramycin, or gentamicin via PTD (study) or routine provider order entry (control). Measurements: The primary endpoint was time to pharmacist completion of PTD request. Secondary data points included medication turn-around times for first doses of vancomycin or aminoglycosides and for first doses of any antibiotic, dose adjustment for renal dysfunction, medication errors, and time of order entry. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify predictors of total time to pharmacist verification and time to administration of first doses of vancomycin or aminoglycosides. Results: Median time for pharmacist completion of PTD requests was 29 minutes. Delays were noted in the study group (n = 49) by comparison with the control group (n = 48) for median time to first dose of vancomycin or aminoglycoside (185 vs. 138 min, p = 0.45) and for any antibiotic (134 vs. 118 min, p = 0.42), respectively. Fewer medication errors were reported in the study group (5 vs. 18 errors, p = 0.002). In a multivariate model, PTD was not significantly predictive of time to pharmacy verification or medication turn-around time. Conclusions: Pharmacists completed pharmacist-to-close consultations for dosing guidance of vancomycin and aminoglycosides within a median of 30 minutes. Implementation of a computerized request for clinical pharmacists to provide medication-related clinical decision support increased medication turn-around time of vancomycin and aminoglycosides and reduced medication errors. Consultation of clinical pharmacists by computerized request for initial antibiotic dosing of medications with narrow therapeutic windows is an option for medication-related clinical decision support but providers should be aware that consultation may delay medication turn-around time.", "paper_title": "Effects of a Pharmacist-to-Dose Computerized Request on Promptness of Antimicrobial Therapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000262615600009"}
