One cylinder has been shown to bind in the major groove of DNA and to induce dramatic coiling of the DNA; the second is a derivative of the first, with additional methyl groups attached so as to give a larger cylinder-radius. The simulations show that both cylinders bind strongly to the major groove of the DNA, and induce complex structural changes in A-T rich regions. Whereas the parent cylinder tends to bind along the major groove, the derivatised cylinder tends to twist so that only one end remains within the major groove. Both G-C rich and A-T rich binding sites for the derivatised cylinder are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
