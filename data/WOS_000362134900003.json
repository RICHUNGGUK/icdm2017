As an important application of the present method, shuttles and spaceships, turbine blades and discs are usually subjected to the creep effects. So, analysis of the creep phenomenon is necessary and important in various industries. The nature of the stress distributions is investigated using the equilibrium and constitutive equations, compatibility relations, and incompressibility condition with various boundary conditions, and geometric relations. Analytical and finite element methods are used to predict the stress distributions in the steady state creep of the short fiber composites. Also, the creep analysis (nodal solution) is done by FEM to predict the possible creep rupture, in which, debonding at the interface of the matrix and fiber may happen due to the maximum tensile axial stress values at the interface. In addition to similarities of the present method and experimental results [34], a good agreement of the stress distributions between the present analytical solutions and the FEM results is found. As a result, the short fiber composites with large non-reinforced regions in the axial direction are proper because it increases the factor of safety for design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
