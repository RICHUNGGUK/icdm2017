In this paper, how to classify inventory items which are correlated each other is discussed by using the concept of 'cross-selling effect'. In history, the ABC classification is usually used for inventory items aggregation because the number of inventory items is so large that it is not computationally feasible to set stock and service control guidelines for each individual item. A fundamental principle in ABC classification is that ranking all inventory items with respect to a notion of profit based on historical transactions. The difficulty is that the profit of one item not only comes from its own sales, but also from its influence on the sales of other items or reverse, i.e., the 'cross-selling effect'. We had previously developed a classification approach for inventory items by using the association rules to deal with the 'cross-selling effect' and found that a very different classification can be obtained when comparing with traditional ABC classification. However, the 'cross-selling effect' may be considered in different ways. In this paper, a new consideration of inventory classification based on loss rule is presented. The lost profit of item/itemset with 'cross-selling effect' is discussed and defined as criterion for evaluating of importance of item, based on which new algorithms on classifying inventory items, also on discovering maximum profit item selection, are presented. A simple example is used to explain the new algorithm, and large amount of empirical experiments, both on real database collected from Japanese convenient store and on downloaded benchmark database, are implemented to evaluate the performances on effectiveness and utility. The results show that the proposed approach in this paper can gain a well insight into the cross-selling effect among items and is applicable for large-sized transaction database.
