In this paper, a fuzzy rough set method for prototype selection, focused on optimizing the behavior of this classifier, is presented. The hybridization with an evolutionary feature selection method is considered to further improve its performance, obtaining a competent data reduction algorithm for the 1-nearest neighbors classifier. This hybridization is performed in the training phase, by using the solution of each preprocessing technique as the starting condition of the other one, within a cycle. The results of the experimental study, which have been contrasted through nonparametric statistical tests, show that the new hybrid approach obtains very promising results with respect to classification accuracy and reduction of the size of the training set.", "paper_title": "On the use of evolutionary feature selection for improving fuzzy rough set based prototype selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000313969400004"}
