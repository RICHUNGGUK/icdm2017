In leading the agents to blink orderly with a blinking period commensurate with the characteristic time of the dynamical oscillator, the presented blinking adaptation strategy works effectively in guaranteeing the synchronous motion of the considered network when the power density is large. In addition, the influence of the controlling parameter and moving velocity on network evolution is studied by assessing the convergence time.", "paper_title": "Blinking adaptation for synchronizing a mobile agent network", "paper_id": "WOS:000294084100005"}
