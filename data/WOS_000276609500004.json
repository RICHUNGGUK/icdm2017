Spatial distributions of argon and chromium atoms and iron ions in ICP were visualized successfully. The excitation temperature profiles of argon, chromium, and iron in ICP were also successfully constructed on the basis of the two-line method. The excitation temperature profiles obtained with a monochromator and the spectrovideo camera were in fairly good agreement.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional observation of excited atoms and ions and excitation temperature in inductively coupled plasma using newly developed four channel spectrovideo camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000276609500004"}
