We present two techniques for simplified visualization of such data sets using edge bundles. The first technique uses an efficient image-based bundling method to create smoothly changing bundles from streaming graphs. The second technique adds edge-correspondence data atop of any static bundling algorithm, and is best suited for graph sequences. We show how these techniques can produce simplified visualizations of streaming and sequence graphs. Next, we show how several temporal attributes can be added atop of our dynamic graphs. We illustrate our techniques with data sets from aircraft monitoring, software engineering, and eye-tracking of static and dynamic scenes.", "paper_title": "Bundled Visualization of Dynamic Graph and Trail Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000340193900007"}
