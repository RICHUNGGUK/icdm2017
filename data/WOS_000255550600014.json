This paper proposes a visualization solution, where a video stream is depicted as a series of snapshots at a relatively sparse interval, and detected actions are highlighted with continuous abstract illustrations. The combined imagery and illustrative visualization conveys multifield information in a manner similar to electrocardiograms ( ECGs) and seismographs. We thus name this type of video visualization as VideoPerpetuoGram ( VPG). In this paper, we describe a system that handles the raw and processed information of the video stream in a multifield visualization pipeline. As examples, we consider the needs for highlighting several types of processed information, including detected actions in video streams, and estimated relationship between recognized objects. We examine the effective means for depicting multifield information in VPG and support our choice of visual mappings through a survey. Our GPU implementation facilitates the VPG- specific viewing specification through a sheared object space, as well as volume bricking and combinational rendering of volume data and glyphs.", "paper_title": "Action-based multifield video visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000255550600014"}
