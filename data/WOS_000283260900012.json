We introduce hybrid digital analog forms of the Costa and Wyner-Ziv coding schemes. We present the random coding counterpart of schemes based on lattices proposed by Kochman and Zamir. Then, we discuss applications of the hybrid digital analog schemes in the case of channel signal-to-noise ratio mismatch and for lossy multicasting of a common source with bandwidth compression.", "paper_title": "Joint Source Channel Coding With Side Information Using Hybrid Digital Analog Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000283260900012"}
