With the multi-agent multi-state reinforcement learning, cognitive radios can decide the best channels to use in order to maximize spectral efficiency in a distributed way. However, we argue that the performance of spectrum management, including both dynamic spectrum access and dynamic spectrum sharing, will largely depend on different reinforcement learning exploration schemes, and we believe that the traditional multi-agent multi-state reinforcement learning exploration schemes may not be adequate in the context of spectrum management. We then propose a novel reinforcement learning exploration scheme and show that we can improve the performance of multi-agent multi-state reinforcement learning based spectrum management by using the proposed reinforcement learning exploration scheme. We also investigate various real-world scenarios, and confirm the validity of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
