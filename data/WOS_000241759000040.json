It recently draws attention upon Internet users and information providers. Collaborative filtering is one of the widely used methods for recommendation. It recommends an item to a user based on the reference users' preferences for the target item or the target user's preferences for the reference items. In this paper, we propose a neural network based collaborative filtering method. Our method builds a model by learning correlation between users or items using a multi-layer perceptron. We also investigate integration of diverse information to solve the sparsity problem and selecting the reference users or items based on similarity to improve performance. We finally demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods through experiments using the EachMovie data.", "paper_title": "Performance improvement in collaborative recommendation using multi-layer perceptron", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000040"}
