The most successful methods to verify such protocols are based on rewriting techniques and automated deduction in order to implement or mimic the process calculus describing the execution of a protocol. We are interested in the intruder deduction problem, that is vulnerability to passive attacks in presence of equational theories which model the protocol specification and properties of the cryptographic operators. In the present paper, we consider the case where the encryption distributes over the operator of an Abelian group or over an exclusive-or operator. We prove decidability of the intruder deduction problem in both cases. We obtain a PTIME decision procedure in a restricted case, the so-called binary case. These decision procedures are based on a careful analysis of the proof system modeling the deductive power of the intruder, taking into account the algebraic properties of the equational theories under consideration. The analysis of the deduction rules interacting with the equational theory relies on the manipulation of Z-modules in the general case, and on results from prefix rewriting in the binary case.
