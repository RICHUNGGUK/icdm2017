It is proved that the validity degree vectors of formulae can preserve the logical relation between formulae. Moreover, a consistency theorem is obtained which says that the n-validity degree (n)(A) of the quantifierfree first-order formula A without any repeated predicate symbols or terms is independent of the natural number n, and is a constant equal to the validity degree (A(0)) of the corresponding proposition A0 in classical propositional logic.", "paper_title": "The validity degree vectors of formulae in two-valued predicate logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000356567200004"}
