In both sled configurations, THUMS contacted a flat rigid surface (either a wall or beam) at 6.7m/s. Sled A maximum simulated wall forces for the thorax, abdomen and pelvis were 7.1, 5.0 and 10.0kN versus 5.7 +/- 0.8, 3.4 +/- 1.2 and 6.2 +/- 2.7kN experimentally. Sled B maximum simulated beam forces for the torso and pelvis were 8.0 and 7.6kN versus 8.5 +/- 0.2 and 7.9 +/- 2.5kN experimentally. Quantitatively, force magnitude contributed more to variation between simulated and experimental forces than phase shift. Acceleration-based injury metrics were within one standard deviation of experimental means except for the lower spine in the rigid wall sled test. These validated metrics will be useful for quantifying occupant loading conditions and calculating injury risks in various loading configurations.", "paper_title": "Implementation and validation of thoracic side impact injury prediction metrics in a human body model", "paper_id": "WOS:000346066300002"}
