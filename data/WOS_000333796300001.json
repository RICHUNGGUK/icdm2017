To minimise jerky control movements, many servo controllers include velocity and acceleration control which operate using a defined velocity profile resulting in the Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) control value being changed over time. On power-up the initial position of the servo arm is unknown to external controller-resulting in the arm moving to the starting value at maximum speed (which may be mechanically hazardous). In this paper two different techniques for performing a soft-start for servos are described and evaluated, namely: voltage profiling and intermittent drive. The different techniques are implemented and evaluated using four different servos based on measured velocity profiles, current consumption, and peak torque. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
