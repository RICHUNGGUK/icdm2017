To this purpose, a general fuzzy case based reasoning (CBR) system is developed. Our system benefits from a fuzzy clustering model for fuzzy data to facilitate case retrieval and reduce the time complexity. The inherent analogical nature of a case-based reasoning (CBR) model and its integration with fuzzy theory would facilitate access to more precise and systematically classified information during a VE workshop. In order to test the performance of the proposed system, it is applied to suburban highway design data extracted from National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) Report 282.
