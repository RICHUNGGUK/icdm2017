First, a basic heuristic block-loading algorithm is introduced. This algorithm loads one block, determined by a block selecting algorithm, in one packing phase, according to a fixed strategy, until no blocks are available. Second, the concept of composite block is introduced, the difference between traditional block and composite block being that composite block can contain multiple types of boxes in one block under some restrictions. Third, based on the depth-first search algorithm, a multi-layer search algorithm is developed for determining the selected block in each packing phase, and making this result closer to the optimal solution. Computational results on a classic data set show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the best known algorithm in almost all the test data. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
