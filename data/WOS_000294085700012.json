Although the topic has been studied for decades, it is still an evolving research field with many open problems. In this work, focusing on periodic real-time tasks with quantum-based computation requirements and implicit deadlines, we propose a novel optimal scheduling algorithm, namely boundary fair (Bfair), which can achieve full system utilization as the well-known Pfair scheduling algorithms. However, different from Pfair algorithms that make scheduling decisions and enforce proportional progress (i.e., fairness) for all tasks at each and every time unit, Bfair makes scheduling decisions and enforces fairness to tasks only at tasks' period boundaries (i.e., deadlines of periodic tasks). The correctness of the Bfair algorithm to meet the deadlines of all tasks' instances is formally proved and its performance is evaluated through extensive simulations. The results show that, compared to that of Pfair algorithms, Bfair can significantly reduce the number of scheduling points (by up to 94%) and the overhead of Bfair at each scheduling point is comparable to that of the most efficient Plait algorithm (i.e., PD2). Moreover, by aggregating the time allocation of tasks for the time interval between consecutive period boundaries, the resulting Bfair schedule can dramatically reduce the number of required context switches and task migrations (as much as 82% and 85%, respectively) when compared to those of Pfair schedules, which in turn reduces the run-time overhead of the system.
