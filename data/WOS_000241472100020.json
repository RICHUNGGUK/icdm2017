For complex data with multimodal distributions this transformation is difficult to learn. Projection on k >= 2 line segments is the simplest extension of linear separability, defining much easier goal for the learning process. The difficulty of learning non-linear data distributions is shifted to separation of line intervals, making the main part of the transformation much simpler. For classification of difficult Boolean problems, such as the parity problem, linear projection combined with k-separability is sufficient.", "paper_title": "K-separability", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100020"}
