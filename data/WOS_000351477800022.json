The solution NMR of the parent helical sequence, sans its protein context, showed no inherent tendency to adopt a particular secondary structure in pure water but showed alpha-helical propensity in TFE/water and SDS micelles. In this study we investigate the conformational preference of the 'parent' and 'duplicate' sequences, sans the protein context, in pure water and an apolar TFE/water solution. Apolar TFE/water solution is a model for non-polar protein context. We performed MD simulations of the two peptides, in explicit water and 80 % (v/v) TFE/water, using GROMOS 53a6 force field, at 300 K and 1 bar (under NPT conditions). We show that in TFE/water mixture, salt bridges are stabilized by apolar TFE molecules and main chain-main chain hydrogen bonds promote the alpha-helical conformation, particularly in the duplicate peptide. Solvent exposure, in pure water, resulted in an alpha ->beta transition to form a triple stranded beta-sheet structure in the 'duplicate' sequence, with a rare psi-loop topology, while a mixture of turn/bend conformations were adopted by the 'parent' sequence. Thus the differences in conformational preference of the parent and duplicate sequence sans protein context, in pure water and TFE/water, implicate the importance of the environment polarity in dictating the peptide conformation. Mechanism of folding of the observed psi-loop in the duplicate sequence gives insights into folding of this rare beta-sheet topology.", "paper_title": "Environmental polarity induces conformational transitions in a helical peptide sequence from bacteriophage T4 lysozyme and its tandem duplicate: a molecular dynamics simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000351477800022"}
