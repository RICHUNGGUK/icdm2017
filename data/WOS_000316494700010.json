The mixed time-delays consist of both discrete and distributed delays. This paper aims to design a memoryless state feedback controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically exponentially stable in the mean square sense. By introducing a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional that accounts for the mode-dependent mixed delays, stochastic analysis is conducted in order to derive delay-dependent criteria for the exponential stabilization problem. Three numerical examples are carried out to demonstrate the feasibility of our delay-dependent stabilization criteria.", "paper_title": "On Stabilization of Stochastic Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks With Mode-Dependent Mixed Time-Delays and Markovian Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000316494700010"}
