It is shown by simulation results that the PAPRs of the Fourier-based MCM system are lower than those of all wavelet-based MCM (WMCM) systems. A novel threshold-based PAPR reduction method is then proposed to reduce the PAPRs in WMCM systems. Both numerical and simulation results indicate that the proposed PAPR reduction method works very effectively in WMCM systems.
