In a communications ecosystem, human interaction takes place alongside technological, contextual, and business domains, thus producing a holistic view on QoE formation. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between human perceived QoE and \"context\" for burgeoning 3-dimensional (3D) audio teleconferencing services. 3D audio teleconferencing applications are customizable by generating different virtual acoustic environments (VAE), where parameters such as virtual room size and competing talker conditions can be adjusted for a particular application. The impact of different VAE characteristics on perceived QoE, however, is still unknown. In this study, four QoE factors were investigated across different VAE scenarios. It was found that a) medium-size virtual rooms produce optimal perceived QoE, b) competing talkers of mixed gender could be easily located in the virtual space, and c) competing speaker gender had no significant effect on perceived audio quality.", "paper_title": "An Investigation into the Relationship Between Perceived Quality-of-Experience and Virtual Acoustic Environments: the Case of 3D Audio Telephony", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375200003"}
