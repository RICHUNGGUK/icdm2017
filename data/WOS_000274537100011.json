The parasitics of the pad can be modeled from the L-2L through-line. Measurement results of the transmission lines and transistors can be de-embedded by subtracting the parasitic matrix of the pad. Therefore, the de-embedding patterns. which is used for modeling active and passive devices, decrease greatly and the chip area also decreases. A one-stage amplifier is firstly implemented for helping verifying the de-embedding results. After that a four-stage 60GHz amplifier has been fabricated in CMOS 65 nm process. Experimental results show that the four-stage amplifier realizes an input matching better than - 10.5 dB and an output matching better than - 13 dB at 61 GHz. A small signal power gain of 16.4 dB and a 1dB output compression point of 4.6 dBm are obtained with a DC current consumption of 128 mA from a 1.2 V power supply. The chip size is 1.5 mm x 0.85 mm.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of a Multi-Line De-Embedding Technique up to 110 GHz for Millimeter-Wave CMOS Circuit Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100011"}
