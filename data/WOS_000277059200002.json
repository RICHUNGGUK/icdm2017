In our model, languages are formed by interactions of a finite number of grammars each of them generating just a finite language. We consider languages as infinite objects which emerge from interactions of 'smaller' finite language generators. The approach we introduce here can build a bridge between two opposite views in present-day linguistics-one that regards natural languages as infinite objects, and the second one that regards them as finite objects. The basic notion we used here is called a colony. Colonies as well-formalized language generating devices were proposed in [33]. Components of a colony are regular grammars generating finite languages and operating on a shared string of symbols. The aim of this contribution is to connect both colonies and the philosophy behind them with the opposition between two conceptions of natural language: the work in theoretical linguistics, where many scholars agree that the set of sentences in a human language must be denumerably infinite, and the work in corpus-based computational linguistics, where the focus is often on language as a finite set. We intend to show that it is possible to formally reconcile these two so apparently different conceptions of natural language.", "paper_title": "Using Finite-State Methods for Getting Infinite Languages: A Preview", "paper_id": "WOS:000277059200002"}
