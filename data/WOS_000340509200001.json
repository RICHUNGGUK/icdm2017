The method is designed to operate on three-dimensional unstructured grids composed of tetrahedral cells. A node-centered finite element formulation avoids mesh stiffness, and an approximate Riemann solver in the fluid reference frame ensures a stable, upwind formulation. This choice leads to a non-zero mass flux between control volumes, even though the mesh moves at the fluid velocity, but eliminates volume errors that arise due to the difference between the fluid velocity and the contact wave speed. A monotone piecewise linear reconstruction of primitive variables is used to compute interface unknowns and recover second-order accuracy. The scheme has been tested on a variety of standard test problems and exhibits first-order accuracy on shock problems and second-order accuracy on smooth flows using meshes of up to O(10(6)) tetrahedra.
