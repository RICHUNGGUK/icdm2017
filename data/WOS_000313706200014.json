The proposed ADC adopts a robust VCO and a sixth-order delta-sigma modulation to attenuate the phase noise and output ripples. The delta-sigma modulation is realized using a cascade of a second-order high-pass filter and a fourth-order band-stop noise shaping filter. Chopper modulation is further employed to reduce the effect of 1/f noise. These have significantly increased the signal-to-noise+distortion ratio (SNDR) and lead to high linearity. The proposed ADC was designed and fabricated using CMOS 0.18 mu m process. From measurement, the differential and integral nonlinearities of the ADC are determined to be +/- 0.5 LSB and +/- 0.65 LSB, respectively. The SNDR of the ADC is 49 dB up to 500 kHz, which gives an ENOB of 8 bits and quantization step of 2 mV. The ADC also features a low power consumption of 120 mu A and a small IC area of 0.18 mm(2).", "paper_title": "HIGH LINEARITY 8-BIT VCO-BASED CASCADED Sigma Delta ADC FOR DIGITAL DC-DC CONVERTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706200014"}
