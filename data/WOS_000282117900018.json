The LESSON system employs a metasearch engine for lecture notes searching from Web and a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay network for lecture notes sharing among the users. A metasearch engine provides an unified access to multiple existing component search engines and has better performance than general-purpose search engines. With the help of a P2P overlay network, all computers used by instructors and students can be connected into a virtual society over the Internet and communicate directly with each other for lecture notes sharing, without any centralized server and manipulation. In order to merge results from multiple component search engines into a single ranked list, we design the RSF strategy that takes rank, similarity and features of lecture notes into account. To implement query routing decision for effectively supporting lecture notes sharing, we propose a novel query routing mechanism. Experimental results indicate that the LESSON system has better performance in lecture notes searching from Web than some popular general-purpose search engines and some existing metasearch schemes; while processing queries within the system, it outperforms some typical routing methods. Concretely, it can achieve relatively high query hit rate with low bandwidth consumption in different types of network topologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
