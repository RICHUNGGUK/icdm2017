One is how to solve the uncertainty of attributes. The other is how to solve the operation between qualitative and quantitative. So, the paper uses cloud model, and proposes a fuzzy multi-attribute cloud decision method. By simulation experiment, it can effectively solve the uncertainty of attributes evaluated, especially coexistence of randomness and fuzzyness, and the operation between linguistic evaluation value and evaluation data. It can easily be used to solve the multi-attribute decision-making or evaluation problem with uncertainty in various fields.", "paper_title": "Application of Multi-attribute Cloud Decision Method in Congestion Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000369384200004"}
