This is a prevalent notion, although the mechanisms are not yet understood. A way by which neural assemblies compute is proposed in this paper. It is shown how neural coalitions represent things (and world states), memorize them, and control their hierarchical relations in order to perform algorithms. It is described how neural groups perform statistic logic functions as they form assemblies. Neural coalitions can reverberate, becoming bistable loops. Such bistable neural assemblies become short-or long-term memories that represent the event that triggers them. In addition, assemblies can branch and dismantle other neural groups generating new events that trigger other coalitions. Hence, such capabilities and the interaction among assemblies allow neural networks to create and control hierarchical cascades of causal activities, giving rise to parallel algorithms. Computing and algorithms are used here as in a nonstandard computation approach. In this sense, neural assembly computing (NAC) can be seen as a new class of spiking neural network machines. NAC can explain the following points: 1) how neuron groups represent things and states; 2) how they retain binary states in memories that do not require any plasticity mechanism; and 3) how branching, disbanding, and interaction among assemblies may result in algorithms and behavioral responses. Simulations were carried out and the results are in agreement with the hypothesis presented. A MATLAB code is available as a supplementary material.", "paper_title": "Neural Assembly Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000306522200006"}
