This new technology will enable many challenging applications, and more personalized and interactive services are expected to be available with resource-limited mobile terminals. Fortunately, mobile cloud computing (MCC) emerging in the context of 5G has the potential to overcome this bottleneck, which enables many resource-intensive services for mobile users with the support of mobile big data delivery and cloud-assisted computing. In this article we propose a novel framework named EMC in the context of 5G, which offers personalized emotion-aware services by MCC and affective computing. With the proposed framework, the traditional MCC architecture is modified to achieve the required Quality of Experience in emotion-aware applications. Furthermore, we design a partitioning solution corresponding to the fundamental trade-off between the communication and computation in EMC. The framework would be helpful to provide personalized, human-centric, intelligent emotion-aware services in 5G.", "paper_title": "EMC: Emotion-Aware Mobile Cloud Computing in 5G", "paper_id": "WOS:000352106500005"}
