It is crucial to reduce such errors to improve the performance of speech recognition systems. This paper proposes an approach using normalized speech/non-speech likelihoods calculated using adaptive speech and non-speech GMMs to weight the scores of recognition hypotheses produced by the decoder. To achieve good decoding performance, the GMMs are adapted to the variations of acoustic characteristics of input utterances and environmental noise, using either of the two modern on-line unsupervised adaptation methods, switching Kalman filter (SKF) or maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. Experimental results on real-world in-car speech, the Drivers' Japanese Speech Corpus in a Car Environment (DJSC), and the AURORA-2 database show that the proposed method significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to a conventional approach using front-end voice activity detection (VAD). Results also confirm that our method significantly improves recognition accuracy under various noise and task conditions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
