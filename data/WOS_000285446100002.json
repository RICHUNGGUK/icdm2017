The link between the frameworks and different supply chain integration applications such as ERP, CRM and VMI are pictured. Finally the state-of-the-art, future state and challenges of the supply chain integration applications are discussed. It is concluded that the main challenge with respect to frameworks supporting business systems integration is to extend them with implementation functionality to better support business system application development. An example of this is customer requirement fulfillment processes such as product development and order fulfillment. Not only do they cross the borders of the company's departments (sales, logistics, purchasing, etc) but also various companies in the supply chain. In spite of this development, business integration across systems and borders are still not matured and to a large extend based on human interaction. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
