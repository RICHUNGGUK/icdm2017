This is because erroneous or falsified bitstreams can cause fatal damage to FPGAs. In this paper, we present a high-speed and area-efficient bitstream protection scheme for DPR systems using the Advanced Encryption Standard with Galois/ Counter Mode (AES-GCM), which is an authenticated encryption algorithm. Unlike many previous studies, our bitstream protection scheme also provides a mechanism for error recovery and tamper resistance against configuration block deletion, insertion, and disorder. The implementation and evaluation results show that our DPR scheme achieves a higher performance, in terms of speed and area, than previous methods.", "paper_title": "Bitstream Protection in Dynamic Partial Reconfiguration Systems Using Authenticated Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000327168600004"}
