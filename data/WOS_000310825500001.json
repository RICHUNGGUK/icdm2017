The type of queries considered involves two parts: a first one which expresses a (possibly flexible) constraint, and a second one that corresponds to a (possibly flexible) wish. The framework considered is that of bipolar fuzzy relations where each tuple is associated with a pair of satisfaction degrees. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
