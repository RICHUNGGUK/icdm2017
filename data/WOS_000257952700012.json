In order to effectively support delay-sensitive applications such as video streaming and interactive gaming in a WMN, it is crucial to develop feasible methodologies and techniques for accurately analyzing, predicting and guaranteeing end-to-end delay performance over multi-hop wireless communication paths. In this paper, we extend the link-layer effective capacity model and derive a lower bound of delay-bound violation probability, or complementary cumulative distribution function, over multi-hop wireless connections. A fluid traffic model with cross traffic and a Rayleigh fading channel with additive Gaussian noise and Doppler spectrum are considered in our study. The average multi-hop delay and jitter performance bounds are also obtained. Analytical results are verified by extensive computer simulations under different traffic load and wireless channel conditions. We find that multi-hop delay performance is much more sensitive to traffic load and maximum Doppler rate than traffic correlation.", "paper_title": "Multi-hop delay performance in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000257952700012"}
