We derive bounds on the diversity order of the NAF protocol that are achieved by a distributed space-time bit-interleaved coded modulation (D-ST-BICM) scheme under iterative APP detection and decoding. These bounds lead to the design of space-time precoders that ensure maximum diversity order and high coding gains. The word error rate performance of D-ST-BICM are also compared to outage probability limits.", "paper_title": "Coding for the Nonorthogonal Amplify-and-Forward Cooperative Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200009"}
