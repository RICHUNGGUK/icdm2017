The benefit of node clustering in optical networks, regarding routing with physical layer impairment awareness, is investigated under the CANON network architecture where regenerators are conveniently placed and routing is confined among a small subset of nodes. The CANON architecture exhibits enhanced blocking performance, high resource utilisation and adequate physical performance; hence, it can serve Quality of Service.", "paper_title": "Cross-layer routing in clustered optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000313162500001"}
