Design/methodology/approach - The finite integration technique is used in different engineering domains as well as to compute the electromagnetic phenomena. This technique is efficient and generates a linear system with regular structure, this system can be implemented and solved in parallel with a direct solver. In fact, in reordering the unknowns by the nested dissection method, the lower triangular matrix of the Cholesky factorization can be constructed with many processors without assembling the matrix system. Findings - This paper deals with the parallelization of the finite integration technique which is performed by data partitioning and leads to a high-performance. Originality/value - The paper presents a parallel implementation of the finite integration technique associated to a direct solver which is practical and efficient.", "paper_title": "Parallel direct solver for the finite integration technique in electromagnetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700005"}
