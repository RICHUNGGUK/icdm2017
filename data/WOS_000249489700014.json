We compared the correct classification rate (CCR) for each of the classifiers based on the 2D features of cell nuclei (diameter, area, perimeter, and circularity) and the 3D features of cell nuclei (volume, surface area, and spherical shape factor). The results showed that the classifier using the 3D features provided better results for grading. Our method could overcome the limitations inherent in 2D analysis and could improve the accuracy and reproducibility of quantification of cell nuclei. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
