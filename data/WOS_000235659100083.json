Besides, based on the special requirement, characteristic of die design and the analysis, a new approach for integrating CAD/CAE/CAM/PDM by adopting Web Service is presented. Furthermore, a service-oriented architecture of generalized Die CAD system is given based on Web Service. The advantage of the architecture is finally expatiated.", "paper_title": "Research on a generalized die CAD system architecture based on SOA and Web Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100083"}
