This array antenna is proposed and designed with a standard printed circuit board process to be suitable for integration with radio frequency/microwave circuitry. The proposed structure employs four circular-shaped DD patch radiator antenna elements fed by a 1-to-4 Wilkinson power divider. To improve the array radiation characteristics, a ground structure based on a compact uniplanar electromagnetic bandgap unit cell has been used. The DD patch shows better radiation and total efficiencies compared with the metallic patch radiator. For further gain improvement, a dielectric layer of a superstrate is applied above the array antenna. The measured impedance bandwidth of the proposed array antenna ranges from 27 to beyond 32 GHz for a reflection coefficient (S11) of less than -10 dB. The proposed design exhibits stable radiation patterns over the whole frequency band of interest, with a total realized gain more than 16 dBi. Due to the remarkable performance of the proposed array, it can be considered as a good candidate for 5G communication applications.", "paper_title": "Dense Dielectric Patch Array Antenna With Improved Radiation Characteristics Using EBG Ground Structure and Dielectric Superstrate for Future 5G Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800062"}
