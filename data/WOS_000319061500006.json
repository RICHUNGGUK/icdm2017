The key idea is to depict the boundaries of visible regions using piecewise linear functions, and convert the shading computation into double product integrals-the integral of the product of lighting and BRDF on visible regions. By representing lighting and BRDF with spherical Gaussians and approximating their product using Legendre polynomials locally in visible regions, we show that such double product integrals can be evaluated in an analytic form. Given the precomputed visibility, our technique computes the visibility boundaries on the fly at each shading point, and performs the analytic integral to evaluate the shading color. The result is a real-time all-frequency relighting technique for static scenes with dynamic, spatially varying BRDFs, which can generate more accurate shadows than the state-of-the-art real-time PRT methods.", "paper_title": "Analytic Double Product Integrals for All-Frequency Relighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000319061500006"}
