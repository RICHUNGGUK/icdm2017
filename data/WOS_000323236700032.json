In multi-label scenarios, taking into account correlations among multiple labels can boost the classification accuracy. However, this makes classifier training more challenging because handling multiple labels induces a high-dimensional optimization problem. In this paper, we propose a scalable multi-label method based on the least-squares probabilistic classifier. Through experiments, we show the usefulness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Computationally Efficient Multi-Label Classification by Least-Squares Probabilistic Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000323236700032"}
