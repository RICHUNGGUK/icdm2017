We strengthen this result by showing, if Pi(P)(2) not equal Sigma(P)(2), that there exist length-preserving total functions that are one-way by circuit size and that are computable in uniform polynomial time. We also prove, if Pi(P)(2) not equal Sigma(P)(2), that there exist polynomially balanced total surjective functions that are one-way by circuit size; here non-uniformity is used.", "paper_title": "ON THE CIRCUIT-SIZE OF INVERSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000299094200012"}
