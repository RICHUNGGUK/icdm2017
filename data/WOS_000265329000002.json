Forty-eight participants participated in a character-search task in the experiment. The results showed that search speed depends on the illuminance but not light source. Search speed increased as illumination increased from 300 lx (45.6 sec), 700 lx (44.18 sec) to 1500 lx (43.24 sec). The effect of medium display and polarity on accuracy was also significant. Accuracy was greater for electrophoretic display and positive polarity. However, the effect of illuminance and light source on visual fatigue was not statistically significant. Based on the results of this study, it seems that E-paper displays may need greater illumination (700 lx or higher). (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
