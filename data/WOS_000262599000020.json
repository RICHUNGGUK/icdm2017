This recently proposed discretization method leads to a lower bound to the minimization problem. Analysis shows that this method always guarantees convergence to the optimal solution. We also illustrate that the traditional method that gives feasible solutions does not always provide such a guarantee. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
