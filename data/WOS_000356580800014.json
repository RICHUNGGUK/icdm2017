Therefore, it is essential that legitimate user authentication as well as user anonymity for privacy is ensured between those entities (service providers and consumers). As compared to stationary devices, due to high network latency and low computing performance of mobile network/devices, the authentication scheme in wireless and mobile networks requires a mechanism to achieve low communication and computation costs. Thus, in this paper we propose a lightweight authentication scheme. Also, the scheme ensures user's anonymity and provides secure password update, session key agreement, and mutual authentication between entities to resist to possible attacks in ubiquitous networks. And we present security and performance analysis of our proposed scheme, and experimental results to show the efficiency of the scheme as well.", "paper_title": "An efficient secure authentication scheme with user anonymity for roaming user in ubiquitous networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356580800014"}
