Due to the uncertainty of wildcards, not only is the number of all matches exponential with respect to the maximal gap flexibility and the pattern length, but the matching positions in PMW are also hard to choose. The objective to count the maximal number of matches one by one is computationally infeasible. Therefore, rather than solving the generic PMW problem, many research efforts have further defined new problems within PMW according to different application backgrounds. To break through the limitations of either fixing the number or allowing an unbounded number of wildcards, pattern matching with flexible wildcards (PMFW) allows the users to control the ranges of wildcards. In this paper, we provide a survey on the state-of-the-art algorithms for PMFW, with detailed analyses and comparisons, and discuss challenges and opportunities in PMFW research and applications.", "paper_title": "Pattern Matching with Flexible Wildcards", "paper_id": "WOS:000342412700002"}
