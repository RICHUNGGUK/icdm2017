Direct adaptive control technique is used to achieve self-repair control for aircrafts with abrupt actuator failures, in order to assure its flight safety. When civil aviation aircraft returns, probability statistic approach based on double hypothesis/multiple hypothesis is used to cumulate summation experiment according to the related data provided by Flight data recorder (FDR), so as to identify whether the civil aviation aircraft has failures or not, and to determine the \"failure type\", 'failure location\" and 'failure degree\" of the civil aviation aircraft. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in this paper.", "paper_title": "DIRECT SELF-REPAIR CONTROL AND ACTUATOR FAILURES RE-PRESENT TECHNIQUES FOR CIVIL AVIATION AIRCRAFT", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500024"}
