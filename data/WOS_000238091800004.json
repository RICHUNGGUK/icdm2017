The first of these papers proves that every NP-complete set is many-one autoreducible. The second paper proves that every many-one autoreducible set is many-one mitotic. It follows immediately that every NP-complete set is many-one mitotic. Hence, we have the compelling result that every NP-complete set A splits into two NP-complete sets A(1) and A(2).", "paper_title": "Mitosis in computational complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800004"}
