Our greedy coloring and MIS algorithms improve the state-of-the-art algorithms running in O(Delta+log* n) for a large class of graphs, i.e., graphs of (moderate) neighborhood growth with h >= 36. We also state and analyze a randomized coloring algorithm in terms of the chromatic number, the run time and the used colors. Our algorithm runs in time O(log x + log* n) for Delta epsilon Omega(log(1+1-1/log* n) n) and chi epsilon O(Delta/log(1+1/log* n) n). For graphs of polylogarithmic chromatic number the analysis reveals an exponential gap compared to the fastest Delta + 1 coloring algorithm running in time O(log Delta + root log n). The algorithm works without knowledge of x and uses less than A colors, i.e., (1-1/O(chi))Delta with high probability. To the best of our knowledge this is the first distributed algorithm for (such) general graphs taking the chromatic number chi into account. We also improve on the state of the art deterministic computation of (2, c)-ruling sets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
