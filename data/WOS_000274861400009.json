Feature extraction of the metal detector signals is conducted using a wavelet transform technique. The FAM neural network is then employed to classify the extracted features into different target groups. A series of experiments using individual FAM networks and a voting FAM network is conducted. Promising classification accuracy rates are obtained from using individual and voting FAM networks, respectively. The experimental outcomes positively demonstrate the effectiveness of the generated features, and of the FAM network in classifying metal detector signals for automated target discrimination tasks.", "paper_title": "Feature extraction and classification of metal detector signals using the wavelet transform and the fuzzy ARTMAP neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000274861400009"}
