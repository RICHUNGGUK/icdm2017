Bafna, Istrail, Lancia, and Rizzi proposed an algorithm of time O(2(2k)m(2)n + 2(3k)m(3)) for the problem, where m is the number of fragments, n is the number of SNP sites, and k is the maximum number of holes in a fragment. When there are mate-pairs in the input data, the parameter k can be as large as 100, which would make the Bafna-Istrail-Lancia-Rizzi algorithm impracticable. The current paper introduces a new algorithm PM-MFR of running time O(nk(2)3(k2) + m logm + mk(1)), where k(1) is the maximum number of SNP sites that a fragment covers (k(1) is smaller than n), and k(2) is the maximum number of fragments that cover a SNP site (k(2) is usually about 10). Since the time complexity of the algorithm PM-MFR is not directly related to the parameter k, the algorithm solves the Individual Haplotyping MFR problem with mate-pairs more efficiently and is more practical in real biological applications.", "paper_title": "An improved (and practical) parameterized algorithm for the individual haplotyping problem MFR with mate-pairs", "paper_id": "WOS:000258717200009"}
