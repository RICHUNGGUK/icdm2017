The proposed attack utilizes the linear weakness of the resynchronization mechanism, the partial linearity of M-M functions, and applies the linear consistency test method to recover the secret key. It is shown that an M-M function should not be implemented by itself but rather in combination with other nonlinear components in stream ciphers using linear mechanisms to prevent the proposed attack. It is also shown that the use of linear resynchronization mechanisms should be avoided despite their high efficiency in stream ciphers filtered by M-M functions.", "paper_title": "A resynchronization attack on stream ciphers filtered by Maiorana-McFarland functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000292506500003"}
