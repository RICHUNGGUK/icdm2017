In a Sybil attack, the WSN is subverted by a malicious node which forges a large number of fake identities in order to disrupt the network's protocols. In attempting to protect WSNs against such an attack, this paper develops a scheme in which the node identities are verified simply by analyzing the neighboring node information of each node. The analytical results confirm the efficacy of the approach given a sufficient node density within the network. The simulation results demonstrate that for a network in which each node has an average of 9 neighbors, the scheme detects 99% of the Sybil nodes with no more than a 4% false detection rate. The experiment result shows that the Sybil nodes can still be identified when the links are not symmetric. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
