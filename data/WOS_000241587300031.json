However, we show that when the input belongs to a proper minor closed class, a FPP becomes a CSP. This result can also be rephrased in terms of expressiveness of the logic MMSNP, introduced by Feder and Vardi in relation with CSPs. Our proof generalises that of a recent paper by Nesetril and Ossona de Mendez. Note that our result holds in the general setting of problems over arbitrary relational structures (not just for graphs).", "paper_title": "Universal structures and the logic of Forbidden Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000241587300031"}
