The established model shows not only significant statistical quality, but also predictive ability, with the square of adjusted correlation coefficient (R-A(2) = 0.813) and the square of the cross-validation coefficient (q(2) = 0.748). We find that the anticancer activity expressed as pIC(50), which is defined as the negative value of the logarithm of necessary molar concentration of this series of compounds to cause 50% growth inhibition against the human A549 lung cancer cell line, closely relates with the energy (E-HOMO) of the Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital (HOMO), the net charge of the terminal H atom of substituent R-2 (Q(HR2)), the hydrophobic coefficient of substituent R-2 (109 PR,), and the net charges of the first atom of substituent R-2 (Q(FR1)). The same model was further applied to predict the pIC(50) for six recently reported congeneric compounds as external test set, and the predicted pIC(50) values are close to the experimental ones, and thus it further confirms that this QSAR model has high predictive ability ne theoretical results can offer some useful references for understanding the action mechanism and designing new compounds with anticancer activity. Based on this QSAR equation, ten new compounds with higher anticancer activity have been theoretically designed and are expecting the experimental confirmation.", "paper_title": "QSAR studies and molecular design of phenanthrene-based tylophorine derivatives with anticancer activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000254868200002"}
