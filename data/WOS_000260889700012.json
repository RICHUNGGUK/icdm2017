We rely on AM-FM texture models and, specifically, on the Dominant Component Analysis (DCA) paradigm for feature extraction. This method provides a low-dimensional, dense, and smooth descriptor, capturing the essential aspects of texture, namely, scale, orientation, and contrast. Our contributions are at three levels of the texture analysis and segmentation problems: First, at the feature extraction stage, we propose a Regularized Demodulation Algorithm that provides more robust texture features and we explore the merits of modifying the channel selection criterion of DCA. Second, we propose a probabilistic interpretation of DCA and Gabor filtering in general, in terms of Local Generative Models. Extending this point of view to edge detection facilitates the estimation of posterior probabilities for the edge and texture classes. Third, we propose the Weighted Curve Evolution scheme that enhances curve evolution-based segmentation methods by allowing for the locally adaptive combination of heterogeneous cues. Our segmentation results are evaluated on the Berkeley Segmentation Benchmark and compare favorably to current state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Texture Analysis and Segmentation Using Modulation Features, Generative Models, and Weighted Curve Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889700012"}
