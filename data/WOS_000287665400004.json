To address this issue, we examine the use of three abstract levels of representation, namely Signal, Object and Semantic. At the Signal Level, we propose a framework mapping the extracted low-level features to symbolic signal descriptors. The Object Level features a statistical model considering the joint distribution of object concepts (such as mountains, skyaEuro broken vertical bar) and the symbolic signal descriptors. At the Semantic Level, signal and object characterizations are coupled within a logic-based framework. The latter is instantiated by a knowledge representation formalism allowing to define an expressive query language consisting of several boolean and quantification operators. Our architecture therefore makes it possible to process topic-based queries. Experimentally, we evaluate our theoretical proposition on a corpus of real-world photographs and the TRECVid corpus.", "paper_title": "A three-level architecture for bridging the image semantic gap", "paper_id": "WOS:000287665400004"}
