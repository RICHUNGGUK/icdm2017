We present the design of the cooperative object, and then begin our basic research on UAV autonomous landing on a ship by using Computer vision and affine moment invariants. We analyze the infrared radiation images in our experiments by extracting the target from the background and then recognizing it. Also, we calculate the angle of yaw. We study the basic research concerning automatic UAV navigation and landing on the deck. Based on Our experiments, the average recognition time is 17.2 ms which is obtained through the use Of affine moment invariants. This type of speed is expected to improve the reliability and real-time performance of autonomous UAV landing. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
