Accurate forecasts of maximum demand are a crucial component of this process, with future weather conditions having a large impact on forecast accuracy. This article presents an improved methodology for the consideration of weather uncertainty in electricity demand forecasts. Case studies based on the Australian national electricity market are used to validate the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Incorporating weather uncertainty in demand forecasts for electricity market planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000304361900009"}
