The proposed method, called tabu search attribute reduction (TSAR), is a high-level TS with long-term memory. Therefore, TSAR invokes diversification and intensification search schemes besides the TS neighborhood search methodology. TSAR shows promising and competitive performance compared with some other CI tools in terms of solution qualities. Moreover, TSAR shows a superior performance in saving the computational costs.", "paper_title": "Tabu search for attribute reduction in rough set theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000255034600007"}
