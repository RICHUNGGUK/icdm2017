The goal of this agent is to find a reliable helper (tutor or other learner) to assist a learner in solving his task. Despite the growing number of Internet users, the ability to find helpers is still a challenging and important problem. Although helpers could have much useful information about courses to be taught, many learners fail to understand their presentations. For that, the agent must be able to deal autonomously with the following challenges: Do helpers have information that the learners need? Will helpers present information that learners can understand? And can we guarantee that these helpers will collaborate effectively with learners? We have developed a new filtering framework, called a pyramid collaborative filtering model, to whittle the number of helpers down to just one. We have proposed four levels for the pyramid. Moving from one level to another depends on three filtering techniques: domain model filtering, user model filtering, and credibility model filtering. A new technique is filtering according to helpers' credibilities. Our experiments show that this method greatly improves filtering effectiveness.
