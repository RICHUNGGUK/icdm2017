We adopt the profit split transfer pricing method which is dictated by OECD guidelines and may be accepted by fiscal authorities. The proposed model is particularly suited for the offshoring context. In addition to transfer pricing, the model integrates several relevant decisions such as the location of tangible and intangible activities. Intangible activities refer to R&D and supplier management. Experimental analyses are conducted in order to prove the feasibility and the solvability of the model and to show the impacts of transfer pricing on supply chain decisions and profits.
