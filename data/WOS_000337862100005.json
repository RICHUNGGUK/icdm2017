When a system uses DRAM, the restricted data retention time necessitates a refresh operation because each bit of the DRAM is stored as an amount of electrical charge in a storage capacitor. Power consumption for the refresh operation increases in proportion to memory capacity. A new method is proposed to reduce the refresh power consumption dynamically, when full memory capacity is not required, by effectively extending the memory cell retention time. Conversion from 1 cell/bit to 2(N) cells/bit reduces the variation of retention times among memory cells. The proposed method reduces the frequency of disturbance and power consumption by two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the conversion itself can be realized very simply from the structure of the DRAM array circuit, while maintaining all conventional functions and operations in the full array access mode.
