In this paper, we propose a novel method to encrypt an image by multiorders of FRFT. In the image encryption, the encrypted image is obtained by the summation of different orders inverse discrete FRFT of the interpolated subimages. And the original image can be perfectly recovered using the linear system constructed by the fractional Fourier domain analysis of the interpolation. The proposed method can be applied to the double or more image encryptions. Applying the transform orders of the utilized FRFT as secret keys, the proposed method is with a larger key space than the existing security systems based on the FRFT. Additionally, the encryption scheme can be realized by the fast-Fourier-transform-based algorithm and the computation burden shows a linear increase with the extension of the key space. It is verified by the experimental results that the image decryption is highly sensitive to the deviations in the transform orders.", "paper_title": "Image Encryption With Multiorders of Fractional Fourier Transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000284360000011"}
