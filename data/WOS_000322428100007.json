Universal integrals provide a useful tool in many problems in engineering and non-linear systems where the aggregation of data is required. We discuss several inequalities including Hardy, Berwald, Barnes-Godunova-Levin, Markov and Chebyshev for a monotone measure-based universal integral. Some recent results are obtained as corollaries. Finally, we provide some applications of our results in intelligent decision support systems, estimation and information fusion. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
