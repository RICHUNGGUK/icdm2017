The novel hybrid system combines rule based system and Artificial Neural Networks. With the rule based system, it is modeled the existing knowledge of the PID controller tuning in open loop and, with Artificial Neural Network, it is completed the rule based model that allow to choose the optimal parameters for the controller. This hybrid model is tested with a long dataset to obtain the best fitness. Finally, the novel research is validated on a real steeling roll process applying the hybrid model to tune a PID controller which set the input speed in each of the gearboxes of the process.
