However, in a real investigation, we must assume that innocuous images from unknown devices will be recovered, which we would like to remove from the pool of evidence. In pattern recognition, this corresponds to what is known as the open set recognition problem. This article introduces new algorithms for open set modes of image source attribution (identifying whether or not an image was captured by a specific digital camera) and device linking (identifying whether or not a pair of images was acquired from the same digital camera without the need for physical access to the device). Both algorithms rely on a new multi-region feature generation strategy, which serves as a projection space for the class of interest and emphasizes its properties, and on decision boundary carving, a novel method that models the decision space of a trained SVM classifier by taking advantage of a few known cameras to adjust the decision boundaries to decrease false matches from unknown classes. Experiments including thousands of unconstrained images collected from the web show a significant advantage for our approaches over the most competitive prior work. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
