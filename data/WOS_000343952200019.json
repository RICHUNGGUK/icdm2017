The classification rule is defined in terms of an open d-ball. A bag is labeled positive if it meets the ball and labeled negative otherwise. Determining the center and radius of the ball is modeled as a SVM-like margin optimization problem. Necessary optimality conditions are derived leading to a polynomial algorithm in fixed dimension. A VNS type heuristic is developed and experimentally tested. The methodology is extended to classification by several balls and to more than two classes. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
