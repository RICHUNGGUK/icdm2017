In our previous study, 3-[(biphenyl-4-ylcarbonyl)carbamothioyl] amino benzoic acid (compound 1) was discovered as a potent inhibitor of MIF by docking-based virtual screening and bioassays. Here, a series of analogues of compound 1 derived from similarity search and chemical synthesis were evaluated for their MIF tautomerase activities, and their structure activity relationships were then analyzed. The most potent inhibitor (compound 5) with an IC50 of 370 nM strongly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in a dose-dependent manner and significantly enhanced the survival rate of mice with LPS-induced endotoxic shock from 0 to 35% at 0.5 mg/kg and to 45% at 1 mg/kg, highlighting the therapeutic potential of the MIF tautomerase inhibition in inflammatory diseases.", "paper_title": "Structure-Activity Relationships and Anti-inflammatory Activities of N-Carbamothioylformamide Analogues as MIF Tautomerase Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000362056900019"}
