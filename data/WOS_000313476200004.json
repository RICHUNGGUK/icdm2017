This contribution will focus on dyadic cognitive and triadic semiotic perspectives on the issue of interpretation and construction of shared representations. We propose a typology of external representations as a basis for further study of shared representations. As illustrated by examples from an existing corpus, the framework allows describing co-occurrence and superimpositions of different types, as well as transitions from one type to another. In the final section, we anticipate the exploitation of the framework in the light of the design of collaborative systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
