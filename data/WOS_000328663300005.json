Methods: Retrospective cohort study involving 2944 adult medical and surgical intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving fluid resuscitation. Within this cohort there were two disease-based groups, 802 patients with a diagnosis of pneumonia, and 143 patients with a diagnosis of pancreatitis. Fluid resuscitation either progressing to subsequent vasopressor administration or not was used as the primary outcome variable to compare general and disease-based modeling. Results: Patients with pancreatitis, pneumonia and the general group all shared three common predictive features as core variables, arterial base excess, lactic acid and platelets. Patients with pneumonia also had non-invasive systolic blood pressure and 1 white blood cells added to the core model, and pancreatitis patients additionally had temperature. Disease-based models had significantly higher values of AUC (p <0.05) than the general group (0.82 +/- 0.02 for pneumonia and 0.83 +/- 0.03 for pancreatitis vs. 0.79 +/- 0.02 for general patients). Conclusions: Disease-based predictive modeling reveals a different set of predictive variables compared to general modeling and improved performance. Our findings add support to the growing body of evidence advantaging disease specific predictive modeling.", "paper_title": "Disease-based Modeling to Predict Fluid Response in Intensive Care Units", "paper_id": "WOS:000328663300005"}
