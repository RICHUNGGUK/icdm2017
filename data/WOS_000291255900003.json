First, the definition of uniformly ultimate boundedness for linear differential inclusion is given. Then, a feedback law is constructed by using the convex hull Lyapunov function. The sufficient condition is given to guarantee the tracking error system uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a numerical example is simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of this control design.", "paper_title": "Tracking control of the linear differential inclusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000291255900003"}
