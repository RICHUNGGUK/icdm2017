We obtain the following main results. We give efficient reductions for each of the above problems to a new problem, which we call substring range reporting. Hence, we unify the previous work by showing that we may restrict our attention to a single problem rather than studying each of the above problems individually. We show how to solve substring range reporting with optimal query time and little space. Combined with our reductions this leads to significantly improved time-space trade-offs for the above problems. In particular, for each problem we obtain the first solutions with optimal time query and O(n log (O(1)) n) space, where n is the length of the indexed string. We show that our techniques for substring range reporting generalize to substring range counting and substring range emptiness variants. We also obtain non-trivial time-space trade-offs for these problems.", "paper_title": "Substring Range Reporting", "paper_id": "WOS:000334062500006"}
