In this context, we present a performance analysis of direct-sequence (DS) UWB communication in the presence of multiband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MB-OFDM) UWB interfering transmissions. The channel fading is modeled according to Nakagami-m distribution, and multi-user interference is taken into account. The DS-UWB system performance is evaluated in terms of bit error rate (BER). Specifically, using the characteristic function approach, an analytical expression for the average BER is derived conditioned on the channel impulse response. Numerical and simulation results are provided and compared for different coexistence scenarios.
