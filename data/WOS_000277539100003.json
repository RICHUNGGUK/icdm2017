Design/methodology/approach - The paper is developed on the available theoretical knowledge from a wide range of areas, such as kinematics, fluid mechanics, vector analysis, quantitative representations of solenoidal rotations, geometry in curvature spaces, etc. and empirical facts from areas like quantum mechanics, astronomy, particle physics, meteorology, etc. The spirit of this work is truly systemic, where conclusions are drawn using cross-disciplinary syntheses of conclusions and observations. Findings - The paper develops a plausible and convincing series of evidence for the validity of the general systemic yoyo model and presents the relevant highlights of the dishpan experiment in order to pave the way for a follow-up and detailed study of this yoyo model and its applications in natural and social sciences. Originality/value - After the systemic yoyo model is initially proposed, this work is the first to develop the foundation of this useful model of systems research.", "paper_title": "Systemic yoyo structures and dishpan experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000277539100003"}
