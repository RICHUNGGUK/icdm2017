Towards this goal, a simulation method of random aggregate structure (RAS) based on elliptical particles and a procedure of finite element analysis (FEA) at meso-scale are firstly developed to perform the analysis. Next, the chloride diffusion coefficient ratio between concrete and cement paste D-app/D-cp is chosen as the index to represent the effect of aggregates on the chloride diffusion process. Identification of the random distribution of this index demonstrates that it can be viewed as actually having a normal distribution. After that, the effect of aggregates on D-app/D-cp is comprehensively studied, showing that the appropriate properties of aggregates should be decided by both of the average and the deviation of D-app/D-cp. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the application of this mesoscopic method in predicting the initiation time of steel corrosion in reinforced concrete (RC) structures. The mesoscopic probabilistic method developed in this paper can not only provide more reliable evidences on the proper grading and shape of aggregates, but also play an important role in the probability-based design method.", "paper_title": "Chloride diffusivity of concrete: probabilistic characteristics at meso-scale", "paper_id": "WOS:000332339300003"}
