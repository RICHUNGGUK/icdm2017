Intersection theory provides a theoretical tool for relating the equivalence of a smooth variety in an intersection product to the degrees of the Chern classes of the variety. A combination of these tools leads to a numerical method for computing the degrees of Chern classes of smooth projective varieties in P(n). We illustrate the approach through several worked examples.
