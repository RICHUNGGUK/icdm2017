Generally, there are a large number N of experimental data, and the use of smoothing splines leads to resolution of linear systems of size N + d, where d depends on the degree of the splines used. The computational effort could be reduced by decomposing the original problem into subproblems and using an appropriate method to combine the corresponding solutions. We adopt this idea, considering for simplicity the decomposition into two subsets and using a boolean sum based method for combining the intermediate spline approximants. (C) 2013 IMACS.
