The proposed method can capture the directional image structure arbitrarily by exploiting a suitable parameterization fusion model and additional structural information. Its fusion patterns are controlled by a heuristic fusion model based on image phase and coherence features. It can explore and keep the structural information efficiently and consistently. A performance analysis of the proposed method applied to real-world images demonstrates that it is competitive with the state-of-art fusion methods, especially in combining structural information.", "paper_title": "Multi-modality image fusion via generalized Riesz-wavelet transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900027"}
