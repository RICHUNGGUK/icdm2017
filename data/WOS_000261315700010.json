Urban construction investment should be optimized. The situation of the investment funds operation should be controlled, and the biggest total benefit in the whole town construction activity will be produced. Since some valid measure is taken, the amount of the plan value will be controlled. Design/methodology/approach - Against the problem of low efficiency, wasting and losing control of urban construction investment, research by the method of mathematics on the investment of urban construction is done. The standpoint is putting forward of the investment control of the whole process of urban construction. The Gray system GM(1, 1) wrap model is adopted to seek the feasible scale of the investment. Findings - The Gray system GM(1, 1) wrap model is adopted to seek the feasible scale of the investment. The crisis management is taken in the process, and the three-step theory of sequential control is put forward. Research limitations/implications - Accessibility and availability of more history and actual data are the main limitation. Practical implications - A very useful advice for the investment decision of scale and structure. Originality/value - The urban construction should be developing, with the investment speed of the appropriate investment scale, adequacy and excellent structure to carry out healthy and sustainable development, and should have the initiative to develop small town.", "paper_title": "Study on investment scale control of urban construction process by the method of grey systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000261315700010"}
