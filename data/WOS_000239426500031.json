By so doing we establish links between graph theory, cryptography, coding theory, and quantum entanglement. We establish the form of the interlace polynomial for certain functions, provide new one and two-variable interlace polynomials, and propose a generalisation of the interlace polynomial to hypergraphs. We also prove conjectures from [15] and equate certain spectral metrics with various evaluations of the interlace polynomial.", "paper_title": "One and two-variable interlace polynomials: A spectral interpretation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239426500031"}
