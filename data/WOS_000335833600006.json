The resulting mates arise from the conversion of quadriphase periodic CS mates, and the period of the former is twice as long as that of the latter. In addition, based on the existing binary periodic CS mates, a table on the existence of the proposed 16-QAM periodic CS mates is given. Furthermore, the proposed method can also transform a mutually orthogonal (MO) quadriphase CS set into an MO 16-QAM CS set. Finally, three examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "16-QAM Periodic Complementary Sequence Mates Based on Interleaving Technique and Quadriphase Periodic Complementary Sequence Mates", "paper_id": "WOS:000335833600006"}
