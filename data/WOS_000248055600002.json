This paper describes several local search-based hybrid algorithms to find optimal or near-optimal Golomb rulers. These algorithms are based on both stochastic methods and systematic techniques. More specifically, the algorithms combine ideas from greedy randomized adaptive search procedures (GRASP), scatter search (SS), tabu search (TS), clustering techniques, and constraint programming (CP). Each new algorithm is, in essence, born from the conclusions extracted after the observation of the previous one. With these algorithms we are capable of solving large rulers with a reasonable efficiency. In particular, we can now find optimal Golomb rulers for up to 16 marks. In addition, the paper also provides an empirical study of the fitness landscape of the problem with the aim of shedding some light about the question of what makes the Golomb ruler problem hard for certain classes of algorithm.", "paper_title": "Local search-based hybrid algorithms for finding Golomb rulers", "paper_id": "WOS:000248055600002"}
