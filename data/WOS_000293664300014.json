To accomplish this, the total system delay of the repeater should be minimized as much as possible without distorting signal quality. Conventionally, the finite impulse response (FIR) type of filter is deployed as a channelization filter, but due to the necessity of large numbers of coefficients to fulfill a prerequisite filter response with a sharp transition band characteristic, an unwanted excessive time delay intrinsically occurs. To make the processing delay as low as possible, this paper proposes a method employing a minimum-phase characterized infinite impulse response (IIR) filter whose magnitude response is almost identical to that of the original FIR filter. Furthermore, in order to linearize the phase response of the designed HR filter, this paper also introduces an all-pass filter cascaded with the IIR filter for digital down-conversion as well as up-conversion. To achieve further simplicity, this paper introduces polyphase-style IIR filters transformed from conventional single IIR filters that have their own all-pass filters in order to linearize the phase response. The computer simulation results verify that the proposed integrated IIR filter exhibits a relatively short processing delay with a minor deterioration in signal quality-like error vector magnitude (EVM) performance.", "paper_title": "Low-Latency Digital-IF Scheme Using an IIR Polyphase Filter Structure for Delay-Sensitive Repeater Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300014"}
