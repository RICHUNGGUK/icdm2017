Two different noise models are considered, one with measurement noise and one with additional state noise. The contribution of this article is twofold. First, we transfer the real-time iteration approach, developed in Diehl et al. (2002) for nonlinear model predictive control, to the MHE approach to render it real-time feasible. The scheme reduces the computational burden to one iteration per measurement sample and separates each iteration into a preparation and an estimation phase. This drastically reduces the time between measurements and computed estimates. Secondly, we derive a numerically efficient arrival cost update scheme based on one single QR-factorization. The MHE algorithm is demonstrated on two chemical engineering problems, a thermally coupled distillation column and the Tennessee Eastman benchmark problem, and compared against an Extended Kalman Filter. The CPU times demonstrate the real-time applicability of the suggested approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
