First, the localization ambiguity area is obtained in terms of the angles-of-arrival errors. Then, using this area, the normalized localization precision is defined to obtain the target localization accuracy in different positions with respect to the two reference nodes. In addition, for a given normalized localization precision threshold, the region in which a target can be localized with better localization accuracy than that threshold is characterized and the area of the region is obtained.", "paper_title": "Accuracy Analysis of the Two-Reference-Node Angle-of-Arrival Localization System", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800026"}
