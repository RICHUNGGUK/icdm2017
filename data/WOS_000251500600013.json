The paper presents two spatio-temporal biologically inspired methods for the preprocessing and learning of speech signal based on self-organization map (SOM). The experimental results are very encouraging and provide a framework that could be more studied to enhance speech perception and recognition technology. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
