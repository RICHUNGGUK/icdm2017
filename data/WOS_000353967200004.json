We establish a series of structural theorems about these proof systems, the main one stating that P-c(F) proofs can be balanced: if a polynomial identity of syntactic degree d and depth k has a P-c(F) proof of size s, then it also has a P-c(F) proof of size poly(s, d) in which every circuit has depth O(k + log(2) d + log d.log s). As a corollary, we obtain a quasi-polynomial simulation of P-c(F) by P-f(F). Using these results we obtain the following: consider the identities det(XY) = det(X) . det(Y) and det(Z) = z(11)...z(nn), where X, Y, and Z are n x n square matrices and Z is a triangular matrix with z(11),..., z(nn) on the diagonal (and det is the determinant polynomial). Then we can construct a polynomial-size arithmetic circuit det such that the above identities have P-c(F) proofs of polynomial size using circuits of O(log(2)n) depth. Moreover, there exists an arithmetic formula det of size n(O(log n)) such that the above identities have P-f(F) proofs of size n(O(log n)). This yields a solution to a basic open problem in propositional proof complexity, namely, whether there are polynomial-size NC2-Frege proofs for the determinant identities and the hard matrix identities, as considered, e.g., in Soltys and Cook [Ann. Pure Appl. Logic, 130 (2004), pp. 277-323] (cf. Beame and Pitassi [Bull. Eur. Assoc. Theor. Comput. Sci. EATCS, 65 (1998), pp. 66-89]). We show that matrix identities like AB = I -> BA = I (for matrices over the two element field) as well as basic properties of the determinant have polynomial-size NC2-Frege proofs and quasi-polynomial-size Frege proofs.", "paper_title": "SHORT PROOFS FOR THE DETERMINANT IDENTITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000353967200004"}
