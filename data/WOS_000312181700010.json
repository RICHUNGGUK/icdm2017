In this scheme, subcarrier modulation technique is adopted at the optical line terminal. Here un-modulated double-sideband subcarriers and optical carriers operating in different wavelength bands are used for downstream and video broadcast signal transmission, respectively. The use of differential-phase-shift-keying (DPSK) modulation for downstream transmission enables effective upstream transmission by direct re-modulation. The simulation results demonstrated with 2.5-Gb/s up/downstream signals and video broadcasting signal show this approach could work very well. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
