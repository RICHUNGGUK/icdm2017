This paper proposes a framework using a systematic approach to improving the iterative key performance indicators (KPIs) accomplishment in a supply chain context. The proposed framework quantitatively analyzes the interdependent relationships among a set of KPIs. It can identify crucial KPI accomplishment costs and propose performance improvement strategies for decision-makers in a supply chain. A scenario of a large retail company is also discussed to explain the application of this framework. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
