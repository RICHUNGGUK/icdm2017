Prediction of concrete compressive strength, prior to real experimentation, can be a very useful tool for a first mix screening. Given the fact that lower limitations in strength have been set in standards, to attain a minimum of service life, a strength approach is a necessity. Furthermore, considering the number of theoretical attempts on strength predictions so far, it can be seen that although they lack widespread accepted validity, certain empirical expressions are still widely used. The method elaborated in this study, it offers a simple and accurate, compressive strength estimation, in very good agreement with experimental results. A modified version of the Feret's formula is used, since it contains only one adjustable parameter, predicted by knowing the cement strength class. The approach presented in this study can be applied on any cement type, including active additions (fly ash, silica fume) and age.", "paper_title": "Predictive modeling of concrete compressive strength based on cement strength class", "paper_id": "WOS:000324810100006"}
