The filters to be designed are assumed to be with additive norm-bounded coefficient variations which reflect the imprecision in filter implementation. The complicated filter design problem is successfully tackled by using the slack variable technique and imposing a structural restriction on the slack matrix. Explicit expressions of the non-fragile H (2) and H (a) filters are given in terms of solutions to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Non-fragile H (2) and H (a) filter designs for polytopic two-dimensional systems in Roesser model", "paper_id": "WOS:000278470200004"}
