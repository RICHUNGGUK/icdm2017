In this paper, the authors present an integrated simulation environment for surface wildfire spread and containment called DEVS-FIRE. DEVS-FIRE is based on the discrete event system specification (DEVS) and uses a cellular space model for simulating wildfire spread and agent models for simulating wildfire containment. The cellular space model incorporates real spatial fuels data, terrain data and temporal weather data into the prediction of wildfire behavior across both time and space. DEVS-FIRE is designed to be integrated with stochastic optimization models that use the scenario results from the simulation to determine an optimal mix of firefighting resources to dispatch to a wildfire. Preliminary computational experiments with fuel, terrain and weather data for a real forest demonstrate the viability of the integrated simulation environment for wildfire spread and containment.", "paper_title": "DEVS-FIRE: Towards an integrated simulation environment for surface wildfire spread and containment", "paper_id": "WOS:000259274100002"}
