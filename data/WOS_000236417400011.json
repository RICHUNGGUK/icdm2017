Two exact artificial boundary conditions are introduced to reduce the original problem into an initial boundary value problem with computational domain. Then, a fully discrete difference scheme is derived. The truncation errors are analyzed in detail. The unique solvability, stability and convergence with the convergence order of O(h(3/2) + tau(3/2)h(-1/2)) are proved by the energy method. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. As a special case, the stability and convergence of the difference scheme proposed by Baskakov and Popov in 1991 is obtained. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
