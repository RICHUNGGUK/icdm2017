We use a graph-based language to specify in a uniform way both client/server interaction schemes and manipulation of directories that contain the access rights of individual clients. Graph transformations model the dynamics of a given protocol. Universally quantified conditions defined on the labels of edges incident to a given node are used to model inspection of directories, invalidation loops and integrity conditions. Our verification procedure computes an approximated backward reachability analysis by using a symbolic representation of sets of configurations. Termination is ensured by using the theory of well-quasi orderings.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC VERIFICATION OF DIRECTORY-BASED CONSISTENCY PROTOCOLS WITH GRAPH CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291552600002"}
