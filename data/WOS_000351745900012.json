This class of codes includes as special cases quadratic residue codes, generalized quadratic residue codes, -residue codes and -codes. Furthermore, they partially overlap with the families of duadic, triadic and polyadic codes. Expressions for idempotent generators are derived in terms of the size of cyclotomic cosets mod and coefficients of the irreducible polynomials over dividing . As an auxiliary tool an orthonormal matrix is introduced whose columns correspond to these idempotents. Concrete examples are presented for and , where is an arbitrary odd prime. When or the codes all belong to the subclass of 2-residue codes. Using this technique, we determine the idempotents of the codes , and recover those of the generalized quadratic codes and of the codes . In the final section the idempotents of the cubic residue codes are constructed.", "paper_title": "Generalized residue and t-residue codes and their idempotent generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000351745900012"}
