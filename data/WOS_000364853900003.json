In this paper, we propose a soft real-time fault-tolerant task allocation algorithm (FTAOA) for WSNs in using primary/backup (P/B) technique to support fault tolerance mechanism. In the proposed algorithm, the construction process of discrete particle swarm optimization (DPSO) is achieved through adopting a binary matrix encoding form, minimizing tasks execution time, saving node energy cost, balancing network load, and defining a fitness function for improving scheduling effectiveness and system reliability. Furthermore, FTAOA employs passive backup copies overlapping technology and is capable to determinate the mode of backup copies adaptively through scheduling primary copies as early as possible and backup copies as late as possible. To improve resource utilization, we allocate tasks to the nodes with high performance in terms of load, energy consumption, and failure ratio. Analysis and simulation results show the feasibility and effectiveness of FTAOA. FTAOA can strike a good balance between local solution and global exploration and achieve a satisfactory result within a short period of time.", "paper_title": "A PSO-Optimized Real-Time Fault-Tolerant Task Allocation Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364853900003"}
