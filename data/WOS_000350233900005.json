The proposed approach overcomes the existing methods in the sense that the TI-ADC mismatch identification can be performed without allocating a region where only the TI-ADC mismatch spurs are present. This is accomplished via mapping the TI-ADC problem into an I/Q mismatch problem which allows deploying complex statistical signal processing. As proof of concept, the compensation architecture is demonstrated and tested on a 16-bit TI-ADC measured hardware data.", "paper_title": "Digital correction of frequency response mismatches in 2-channel time-interleaved ADCs using adaptive I/Q signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000350233900005"}
