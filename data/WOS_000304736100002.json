The goal of the source is to maximize the average number of successfully delivered packets per time slot. The source is able to choose whether to transmit a packet or defer the transmission in each time slot. The decision which is chosen by the source depends on the channel information available and the length of the energy queue. We formulate the problem of finding the optimal policy as a Markovian decision problem. We show some properties of the value function that represents the discounted number of successfully delivered packets per time slot. We prove that the optimal policy is a threshold type policy depending on the state of the channel and the length of the energy queue. We also derive an upper bound for the average number of packets per time slots successfully received by the destination. We show using numerical results that this bound is a tight bound on the performance of the optimal policy. And we consider the case of time varying channel but without channel state information (CSI). Then, we study the impact of channel time varying nature and the availability of CSI. In this case, we show that the optimal policy is a greedy policy. The performance of this greedy policy is also calculated.", "paper_title": "Optimal Packet Scheduling for Energy Harvesting Sources on Time Varying Wireless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000304736100002"}
