Most existing techniques have difficulty dealing with situations involving highly non-homogeneous image contrast and a small initial overlapping region between the images. This paper presents a robust multi-resolution method for registering multimodal images using local phase-coherence representations. The proposed method finds the transformation that minimizes the error residual between the local phase-coherence representations of the two multimodal images. The error residual can be minimized using a combination of efficient globally exhaustive optimization techniques and subpixel-level local optimization techniques to further improve robustness in situations with small initial overlap. The proposed method has been tested on various medical images acquired using different modalities and evaluated based on its registration accuracy. The results show that the proposed method is capable of achieving better accuracy than existing multimodal registration techniques when handling situations where image non-homogeneity and small overlapping regions exist.", "paper_title": "Robust Multimodal Registration Using Local Phase-Coherence Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000265085600009"}
