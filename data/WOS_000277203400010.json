A promising solution to this problem is the use of packet level Forward Error Correction (FEC) mechanisms. However, the adjustment of the FEC rate is not a trivial issue due to the dynamic wireless environment. This decision becomes more complicated if we consider the multi-rate capability of the existing wireless LAN technology. In this paper, we propose a novel method which dynamically adapts the transmission rate and FEC for video multicast over multi-rate wireless networks. In order to evaluate the system experimentally, we implemented a prototype using open source drivers and socket programming. Our experimental results show that the proposed system significantly improves the multicast system performance.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Rate and FEC Adaptation for Video Multicast in Multi-rate Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277203400010"}
