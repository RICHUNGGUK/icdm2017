Femoral neck modularity has been proposed as a solution to this problem by allowing the surgeon to alter either the neck-shaft or version angle of the prosthetic femoral component intra-operatively. A single replicate full factorial design was used to evaluate how effective a modular femoral neck cementless stem was in restoring a healthy prosthetic range of motion in comparison with a leading fixed-neck cementless stem with the standard modular parameters. It was found that, if altered to a large enough degree, femoral neck modularity can increase the amount of prosthetic motion as well as alter its position to where it is required physiologically. However, there is a functional limit to the amount that can be corrected and there is a risk with regard to the surgeon having to select the optimum modular neck before any benefit is realised.", "paper_title": "Effect of femoral neck modularity upon the prosthetic range of motion in total hip arthroplasty", "paper_id": "WOS:000339885700006"}
