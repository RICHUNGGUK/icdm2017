The established 3D-QSAR model exhibits a satisfying statistical quality and prediction ability. Docking results show somewhat lower average values of the flexible and rigid energy scores in the chosen binding sites. The docking analysis offers appropriate orientations and conformations of these compounds at the binding sites to both AP-1 and NF-kappa B in good agreement with the 3D-QSAR model from CoMFA. The combined CoMFA and docking study suggests the following substituent selections: substituent R(2) should be a kind of H-N-thienyl or CH(3)-N-thienyl group; substituent R(5) should be a kind of COO-tBu or COOEt group; and substituent R(4) should be a CH(2)CH(3) or 2-thienyl group. The docking analysis also shows that the binding sites fall just at the joint regions between AP-1 (or NF-kappa B) and DNA, where these compounds can effectively prevent free AP-1 and NF-kappa B from binding to DNA, and this may be the reason that derivatives with pyrimidine substituents have an inhibition function. In addition, a very interesting finding was that the binding sites of both AP-1 and NF-kappa B have a common structural characteristic, thereby providing a reasonable explanation for the dual inhibition functions of these compounds towards both AP-1 and NF-kappa B. These theoretical results help to deepen our understanding of the inhibition mechanism of these pyrimidine substituent derivatives, and will aid in directing further drug-molecular design.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on pyrimidine substituent derivatives as dual inhibitors of AP-1 and NF-kappa B", "paper_id": "WOS:000277202700008"}
