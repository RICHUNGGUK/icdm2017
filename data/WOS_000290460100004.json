Unpredictable workloads, however, aggravate the semantic gap between the virtual machine monitor and guest operating systems, leading to inefficient resource management. In particular, CPU management for virtual machines has a critical impact on I/O performance in cases where the virtual machine monitor is agnostic about the internal workloads of each virtual machine. This paper presents virtual machine scheduling techniques for transparently bridging the semantic gap that is a result of consolidated workloads. To enable us to achieve this goal, we ensure that the virtual machine monitor is aware of task-level I/O-boundedness inside a virtual machine using inference techniques, thereby improving I/O performance without compromising CPU fairness. In addition, we address performance anomalies arising from the indirect use of I/O devices via a driver virtual machine at the scheduling level. The proposed techniques are implemented on the Xen virtual machine monitor and evaluated with micro-benchmarks and real workloads on Linux and Windows guest operating systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
