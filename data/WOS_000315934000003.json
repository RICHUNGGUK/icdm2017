The development of some international standards such as STEP and STEP-NC presents a vision for intelligent CNC machining. Implementation of STEP-NC enabled Machine Condition Monitoring (MCM) is presented in this paper. The system allows optimisation during machining in order to shorten machining time and increase product quality. In the system, an optiSTEP-NC, an AECopt controller and a Knowledge-Based Evaluation (KBE) module have been developed. The aim of the optiSTEP-NC system is to perform initial feed-rate optimisation based on STEP-NC data to assist process planners in assigning appropriate machining parameters. AECopt acts as a connector between the process planner and machining environment with the intention to provide adaptive and automatic in-process machining optimisation. KBE based-MTConnect is responsible for obtaining machining know-how. Optimisation is performed before, during or after machining operations, based on the data collected and monitored such as machining vibration, acceleration and jerk, cutting power and feed-rate.
