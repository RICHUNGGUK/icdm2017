However, outliers in the data can result in bad global misclassification percentages. In this paper, we propose a method to identify such outliers in the SVM framework. A specific robust classification algorithm is proposed adjusting the least squares SVM (LS-SVM). This yields better classification performance for heavily tailed data and data containing outliers.
