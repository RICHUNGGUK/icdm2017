This problem is NP-hard; several heuristics have been proposed to find near-optimal solutions to it in reasonable times. A decentralized learning automata-based algorithm creates spanning trees that honor the diameter constraint. The algorithm rewards a tree if it has the smallest weight found so far and penalizes it otherwise. As the algorithm proceeds, the choice probability of the tree converges to one; and the algorithm halts when this probability exceeds a predefined value. Experiments confirm the superiority of the algorithm over other heuristics in terms of both speed and solution quality.", "paper_title": "An adaptive heuristic to the bounded-diameter minimum spanning tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000309879200015"}
