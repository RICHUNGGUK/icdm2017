We search criteria for \"the best\" (minimal one which guaranties watermark detectability) embedding strength for watermark robust against expected attack. These criteria we find for AWGN watermarks, which are embedded in spatial or in transform domains; for one bit message or for a longer message; into whole image or into some of its coefficients. This paper peculiarity is that we do not propose new watermarking algorithm; for well known, robust algorithm we find the best embedding strength for robust watermark.", "paper_title": "EMBEDDING STRENGTH CRITERIA FOR AWGN WATERMARK, ROBUST AGAINST EXPECTED DISTORTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000281993100002"}
