A lot of noise is contained in basic monitoring data (azimuth, vertical angle, distance) because of various factors. Thus, the accuracy of basic monitoring data is greatly reduced, and this issue has become a limitation in landslide warning. In this paper, multi-cycle monitoring data from multiple open pits are used as data source and de-noised using different filtering methods. At the same time, filtering effect is evaluated using the image and accuracy of filtered basic data. Best filtering methods of different monitoring basic data are proposed, laying the foundation for automated processing of monitoring data based on a surveying robot.", "paper_title": "De-noise of Online Monitoring Basic Data Collected by Surveying Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994600010"}
