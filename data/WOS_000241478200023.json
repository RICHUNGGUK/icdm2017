The correctness of our algorithm is riot based on the ratio-cut interpretation of the second eigenvector, but exploits instead the stability of the eigenvector subspace. As a result, we get an improved cluster separation bound in terms of dependence on the maximum variance. We also extend our results for a clustering problem in the case of sparse graphs.", "paper_title": "Spectral clustering by recursive partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200023"}
