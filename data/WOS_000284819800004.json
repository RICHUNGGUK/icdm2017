It explores the social challenges experienced by individuals with ASDs and outlines an intervention aimed at revealing the hidden code that underpins social interactions to them. It focuses on how technology can facilitate the implementation of this intervention by utilising multimedia-authoring tools. Findings from a case study, involving seven carers over a five-month period, are encouraging revealing that the participants quickly learned the basics of the intervention and either adapted or created social stories. They found the framework easy to use and sufficiently flexible to cater for children with social interaction, communication and behaviour problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
