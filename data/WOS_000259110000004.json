In this paper, we present a localized CBIR system, ACCIO!, that uses labeled images in conjunction with a multiple-instance learning algorithm to first identify the desired object and weight the features accordingly, and then to rank images in the database using a similarity measure that is based upon only the relevant portions of the image. A challenge for localized CBIR is how to represent the image to capture the content. We present and compare two novel image representations, which extend traditional segmentation-based and salient point-based techniques, respectively, to capture content in a localized CBIR setting.", "paper_title": "Localized content-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000259110000004"}
