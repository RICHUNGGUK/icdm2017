This initial model-engineering platform named sNets (for Semantic Networks) included several functional blocks like the sMachine, the sBrowser, the sQuery, the sAction system, etc. Several parts of these tools are still in use today. At a time when we are defining the main architectural style of the new platform, it may be helpful to come back on the initial learning of this project. This paper describes the sNets project and summarizes some lessons learnt in the course of the design and utilization of this first generation modeling framework.", "paper_title": "sNets: A first generation model engineering platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000018"}
