However, as far as we know, few papers on secure routing protocols have addressed both the anonymity and authenticated key exchange. Therefore, in this paper, we present a new secure anonymous routing protocol with authenticated key exchange for ad hoc networks. In comparison with other previous secure routing protocols, our proposed protocol not only provides the anonymity to the route from the source to the destination, but also integrates the authenticated key exchange into the routing algorithm.
