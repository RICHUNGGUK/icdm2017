An aggregated model previously developed by authors for the efficient optimisation of biogas processes has been upgraded with LCA, using the novel concept of eco-profit. Eco-profit is defined as the difference between burdening (eco-cost) and unburdening (eco-benefit) the environment, where eco-cost and eco-benefit calculations are based on LCA. The advantage of eco-profit is that it is expressed as a monetary value. Therefore. eco-profit and economic profit can be merged together and the preferred solutions are those with maximal total profit. The single-and multi-objective optimisations were performed on a model of the biogas production processes. Within the former, economic, eco- and total profit were maximised separately and, within the latter, maximisation of economic profit vs. eco-profit was introduced. All the results obtained from single- and multi-criteria optimisation show that biogas production is a sustainable alternative that provides an important eco-profit. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
