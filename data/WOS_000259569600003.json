This paper proposes a dynamic PERT/CPM approach using a compound number, and discusses its applications to dynamic enterprise process scheduling for Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW). By using the compound number, activity's duration, the earliest start time, and the latest start time of activities in a process model can be defined and calculated effectively to facilitate the enterprise process flexible scheduling and process forecast during process enactment. A framework to role-oriented process-driven enterprise cooperative work is proposed, some schedule strategies and the algorithm implementation are discussed, as well as the process-driven enterprise application integration.", "paper_title": "Role-oriented process-driven enterprise cooperative work using the combined rule scheduling strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000259569600003"}
