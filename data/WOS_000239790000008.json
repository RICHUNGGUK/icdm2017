(1998)] and inspired by Rubinfeld and Sudan in [ Rubinfeld and Sudan 1996], deals with the relaxation of decision problems. Given a property P the aim is to decide whether a given input satisfies the property P or is far from having the property. A property P can be described as a language, i.e., a nonempty family of binary words. The associated property to a family of boolean functions f = (f(n)) is the set of 1-inputs of f. By an attempt to correlate the notion of testing to other notions of low complexity property testing has been considered in the context of formal languages. Here, a brief summary of results on testing properties defined by formal languages and by languages implicitly represented by small restricted branching programs is provided.", "paper_title": "Testing membership in formal languages implicitly represented by boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790000008"}
