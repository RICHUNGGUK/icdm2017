How to reflect the spatial characteristics of environmental impacts have become a significant problem, which is urgently needed to be solved to improve the transparency and the reliability of LCIA, especially for the distinct diversity of environments in China. Based on the multi-environmental spatial dimension, this paper proposes a new LCIA method under the framework of ISO14040. First, pollutants released or materials consumed in the life cycle of a product are related to spatial characteristics in order to reflect the diversity of the regional environment. The calculation method of the space characteristic coefficient is presented by analysing the endurance capacity of the regional environment and environmental standards. Second, midpoint and endpoint categories are combined and their relationships are discussed according to the environmental mechanism. Third, normalisation references are proposed that can reflect the latest and most detailed knowledge of environmental science. Also, the distance-to-target method is selected as the weighting method and a single index could be obtained after the weighting. Finally, this LCIA method is employed to study electro-motors in China.", "paper_title": "A life cycle impact assessment method based on the multi-environmental spatial dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000331864000001"}
