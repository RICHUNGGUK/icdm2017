An inevitable consequence, however, is that it generates huge numbers of events. To exploit these large amounts of data, the Supply Chain Visualizer increases supply-chain visibility by analyzing RFID data, using a mix of automated analysis techniques and human effort. The tool's core concepts include rule-based analysis techniques and a map-based representation interface. With these features, it lets users visualize the supply-chain structure, together with performance metrics, and detect problematic hot spots.", "paper_title": "Increasing Supply-Chain Visibility with Rule-Based RFID Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000262501000007"}
