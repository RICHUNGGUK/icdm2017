We propose a cluster-based adaptive multispectrum sensing and access strategy, in which the secondary users seeking to access the channel can select a set of channels to sense and access with adaptive sensing time. Specifically, the spectrum sensing and access problem is formulated into an optimization problem, which maximizes the utility of the secondary users and ensures sufficient protection of the primary users and the transmitting secondary users from unacceptable interference. Moreover, we explicitly calculate the expected number of channels that are detected to be idle, or being occupied by the primary users, or being occupied by the transmitting secondary users. Spectrum sharing with the primary and transmitting secondary users is accomplished by adapting the transmission power to keep the interference to an acceptable level. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed sensing and access strategy as well as its advantage over conventional sensing and access methods in terms of improving the achieved throughput and keeping the sensing overhead low.
