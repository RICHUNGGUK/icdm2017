This family has optimal correlation properties and its correlation distribution is well known. Two related families of quaternary sequences are the families B and C. These are families of sequences over Z(4) of period 2(2(n) - 1). In recent years, new families of quaternary sequences of period 2(2(n) - 1) have been constructed by modifying the sequence fandlies B and C in a nonlinear way. This has resulted in a new family D of sequences of period 2(2(n) - 1) which has optimal correlation properties, but until now the correlation distribution of this family has not been known. In this paper, we completely determine the correlation distribution of family D by making use of properties of exponential sums.", "paper_title": "The correlation distribution of quaternary sequences of period 2(2(n)-1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500019"}
