This year marked a change in the venue format from a conference hall to a hotel, which changed how the robot event was run. As a result, the robots were much more visible to the attendees of the AAAI conference than in previous years. This allowed teams that focused on human-robot interaction to have many more opportunities to interact with people. This article describes the events that were held at the conference, including the Scavenger Hunt, Open Interaction, Robot Challenge, and Robot Exhibition.", "paper_title": "The AAAI 2005 Mobile Robot Competition and Exhibition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240933700008"}
