In consequence, the creation, evaluation and maintenance of ontologies has become an engineering process that needs to be managed and measured using sound and reliable methods. As part of any ontology engineering or revision process, metrics can play a role helping in identifying possible problems or incorrect use of ontology elements, along with providing a kind of quality assessment that complements reviews requiring expert inspection. However, in spite of the fact that there are a number of ontology metric proposals described in the literature, there is a lack of empirical studies that provide a basis for their interpretation. This paper reports a systematic exploration of existing ontology metrics from a large set of ontologies extracted from the Swoogle search engine. The OntoRank value used inside the Swoogle to rank search results is used as a contrast for some existing metrics. The results show that the existing proposed metrics evaluated in general do not seem to be indicators of that ranking, but they can be helpful to identify particular kinds of ontologies.
