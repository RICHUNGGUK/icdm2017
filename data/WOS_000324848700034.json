Any k or more shadow images can be collaborated together to reveal the secret image. Most of the previous SIS schemes don't distinguish the importance of shadows. However, in some application environments, some participants are accorded special privileges due to their status or importance. Thus, some shadows may be more important than others. In this paper, we consider the (t, s, k, n) essential SIS (ESIS) scheme. All n shadows are classified into s essential shadows and (n-s) non-essential shadows. When reconstructing the secret image, the (t, s, k, n)-ESIS scheme needs k shadows, which should include at least t essential shadows. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
