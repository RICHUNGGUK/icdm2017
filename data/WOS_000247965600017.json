In comparison to the standard method that involves using spherical harmonics, this method is conceptually simpler and computationally less complex and intensive, especially when used to address problems in which data is sparse or nonuniform.", "paper_title": "A simple method for fitting sphere-like surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000247965600017"}
