The goal is to develop routines which automatically adapt to the conditions of the computational system in such a way that efficient executions are obtained independently of the end-user experience. This paper aims to explore programming routines that can be automatically adapted to the computational system conditions, making possible to use auto-tuning to represent landform attributes on multicores and multi-GPU systems using high- performance computing techniques for efficient solution of two-dimensional polynomial regression models that allow large problem instances to be addressed.", "paper_title": "Automatic routine tuning to represent landform attributes on multicore and multi-GPU systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400020"}
