The membership functions of the T-S fuzzy systems are modeled in a space that is defined by the Cartesian product of simplexes called a multisimplex. If the time derivatives of the membership functions are bounded, the bounds are used to construct a polytope that models the space of the time derivatives of the membership functions. Linear matrix inequality (LMI) relaxations that are based on polynomial matrices are provided for stability analysis and controller design. Extensions for the design of control laws that minimize upper bounds to H-2 and H-infinity norms are also given. The main novelty of this method is that it allows one to synthesize control gains, which depends only on some premise variables that are selected by the designer. Numerical experiments illustrate the flexibility and advantages of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Selective H-2 and H-infinity Stabilization of Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295586600008"}
