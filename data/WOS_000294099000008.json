KPE was used by engineering students in a practically oriented undergraduate engineering course. The study concentrated on students' usage and selfreported experiences of the tool, and student-adopted strategies for spatially arranging items in KPE's main knowledge space. According to the results, students used KPE mainly to share and organize project documentation. KPE appears to offer an advantage over traditional folder-based learning environments by providing a structured visual overview of the process and materials in the content view, thus facilitating pragmatic and epistemic dimensions of knowledge creation at the same time.
