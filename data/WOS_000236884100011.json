That is, we abstractly model dynamic properties of the key language constructs through the construction of a BPEL abstract machine. Specifically, we present the process execution model and the underlying execution lifecycle of BPEL activities. The goal of our work is to provide a precise and well defined semantic framework for establishing the key language attributes. To this end, the BPEL abstract machine forms a comprehensive and robust formalization closely reflecting the view of the informal language definition.", "paper_title": "An abstract machine architecture for web service based business process management", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100011"}
