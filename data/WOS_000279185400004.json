We define a concise representation, called right distance sequences to describe such trees. A coding tree helps us to systematically investigate the structural representation of non-regular trees. Consequently, we present a loopless algorithm to generate Gray-codes of non-regular trees using right distance sequences.", "paper_title": "Loopless Generation of Non-regular Trees with a Prescribed Branching Sequence(1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000279185400004"}
