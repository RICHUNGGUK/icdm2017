By using the GP model, the complicated network bandwidth allocation problem is transformed into the kinematics and dynamics of numerous particles in two reciprocal dual force-fields. The proposed model and algorithm are featured by the powerful processing ability under a complex environment that involves the various interactions among network entities, the market mechanism between the demands and service, and other phenomena common in networks, such as congestion, metabolism, and breakdown of network entities. The GP approach also has the advantages in terms of the higher parallelism, lower computation complexities, and the easiness for hardware implementation. The properties of the approach, including the correctness, convergency and stability, are discussed in details. Simulation results attest to the effectiveness and suitability of the proposed approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
