The theoretical basis of the proposed method is Information Theory and Nonparametric Statistics. Normalized mutual information is used as the measure of correlation between parameters, and statistical conclusions are based on ranking. The fluorescence polarization (FP) parameter is considered as the principal diagnostic characteristic. The FP was measured in fluorescein diacetate (FDA)-stained individual peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), derived from healthy subjects and breast cancer (BC) patients, under different stimulation conditions: by tumor tissue, the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PHA) or without the stimulants. The FP parameters were grouped according to their correlation with breast cancer. It was established that the greatest difference between cells of BC patients and healthy subjects is found in the PHA test (parameter Pi). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
