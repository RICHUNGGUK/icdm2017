Systems which are able to measure without artificial targets use the texture on the surface of the object to find 'interesting points'. However, well-trained 'measurement experts' are required to operate such a measurement system. In order to make such systems easy to use even for non-experts, we extend it by a knowledge-based component which supports the operator. We report on the architecture and functionality of the respective knowledge-based system, its development stage and the promising results obtained in experimentation.
