The participants were two classes of 11th graders taking the website design class in a vocational high school. The participants were assigned randomly to either an experimental group (n = 40) learning with a WBPAS or a control group (n = 41) learning with a paper-based portfolio. The study results revealed the following: a) the quality of goal-setting mechanisms may facilitate SRL. b) Students setting learning goals with the WBPAS demonstrated significantly better SRL than students setting learning goals with the paper-based portfolio.
