Such a rate-switching algorithm embedded in a video player is designed to improve video quality-of-experience (QoE) by selecting an appropriate resolution based on the analysis of network conditions while the video is playing. However, a bad viewing experience is often caused by the video player having difficulty estimating transit or client-side network conditions accurately. In order to analyze the ABR streaming performance, we developed YouSlow, a web browser plug-in that can detect and report live buffer stalling events to our analysis tool. Currently, YouSlow has collected more than 20,000 of You Tube video stalling events over 40 countries.", "paper_title": "YouSlow: A Performance Analysis Tool for Adaptive Bitrate Video Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600015"}
