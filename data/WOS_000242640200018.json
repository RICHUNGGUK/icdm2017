These indicate that an ad hoc network is difficult to provide on-line access to a trusted authority server. Therefore, applying traditional Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) security framework to mobile ad hoc networks will cause insecurities. This study proposes a scalable and elastic key management scheme integrated into Cluster Based Secure Routing Protocol (CBSRP) to enhance security and non-repudiation of routing authentication, and introduces an ID-Based internal routing authentication scheme to enhance the routing performance in an internal cluster. Additionally, a method of performing routing authentication between internal and external clusters, as well as inter-cluster routing authentication, is developed. The proposed cluster-based key management scheme distributes trust to an aggregation of cluster heads using a threshold scheme faculty, provides Certificate Authority (CA) with a fault tolerance mechanism to prevent a single point of compromise or failure, and saves CA large repositories from maintaining member certificates, making ad hoc networks robust to malicious behaviors and suitable for numerous mobile devices.", "paper_title": "Inter-cluster routing authentication for ad hoc networks by a hierarchical key scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000242640200018"}
