A series of accurate parameters of the biopresthetic heart value, such as radius of the sutural ring, height of the supporting stent and inclination of the supporting dent care determined. The finite element analysis results show that the stress distribution of cylindrical and paraboloidal valve leaflets is quite different during the diastole period. The stress distribution of cylindrical and paraboloidal valve leaflets under the same load is analyzed as the leaflets are closed. Both the maximal primary stress of the two curved surface sorts appear on the bind area. Paraboloidal valve leaflets have the following advantages over cylindrical valves leaflets: the peak stress area of paraboloidal valve leaflets is comparatively far from seam position, the maximal primary stress of paraboloidal valve leaflets is lower titan that of cylindrical valve leaflets. The unfolded algorithm on the paraboloidal valve leaflets is discussed in detail. The applied programs of the unfolded paraboloidal valve leaflets are designed based on finite element analysis. This work is very helpful to manufacture reasonable shaped valvular leaflets and to prolong the lifetime of the bioprosthetic heart valve.", "paper_title": "STRESS ANALYSIS AND UNFOLDED ALGORITHM OF THE BIOPROSTHETIC HEART VALVE", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800011"}
