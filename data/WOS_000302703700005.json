However, despite its simplicity and wide applicability, the linear Granger causality is an insufficient tool for analyzing exotic stochastic processes such as processes involving non-linear dynamics or processes involving causality in higher order statistics. In order to analyze such processes more reliably, a different approach toward Granger causality has become increasingly popular. This new approach employs conditional independence as a tool to discover Granger non-causality without any assumption on the underlying stochastic process. This paper discusses the concept of discovering Granger non-causality using measures of conditional independence, and proposes a novel measure of conditional independence. In brief, the proposed approach estimates the conditional distribution function through a kernel based least square regression approach. This paper also explores the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed method compared to other available methods, and provides a detailed comparison of these methods using a variety of synthetic data sets.", "paper_title": "Assessing Granger Non-Causality Using Nonparametric Measure of Conditional Independence", "paper_id": "WOS:000302703700005"}
