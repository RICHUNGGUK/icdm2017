Due to the overcomplete nature of the wavelet packet decomposition, feature selection is usually applied for a better classification accuracy and a compact feature representation. The majority of wavelet feature selection algorithms conduct feature selection based oil the evaluation of each subband separately, which implicitly assumes that the wavelet features from different subbands are independent. In this paper, the dependence between features from different subbands is investigated theoretically and simulated for a given image model. Based on the analysis and simulation, a wavelet feature selection algorithm based on statistical dependence is proposed. This algorithm is further improved by combining the dependence between wavelet feature and the evaluation of individual feature component. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in incorporating dependence into wavelet feature selection.", "paper_title": "Wavelet feature selection for image classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000258618100020"}
