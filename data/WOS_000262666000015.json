The former which is C(1) continuous as same as the modified Butterfly scheme has better effect in some complex models. The latter can be used to solve the \"popping effect\" problem when switching between meshes at different levels of resolution. The scheme generates surfaces coincident with the Loop subdivision scheme in the limit condition having the coefficient k equal 0. When k equal 1, it will be changed into a new interpolatory subdivision scheme. Eigen-structure analysis demonstrates that subdivision surfaces generated using the new scheme are C1 continuous. All these are achieved only by changing the value of a parameter k. The method is a completely simple one without constructing and solving equations. It can achieve local interpolation and solve the \"popping effect\" problem which are the method's advantages over the modified Butterfly scheme.", "paper_title": "Interpolatory and Mixed Loop Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000262666000015"}
