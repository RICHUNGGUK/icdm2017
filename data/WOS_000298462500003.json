This paper presents application of geometric procedures for investigating the characteristics of human visual capabilities which are particularly important in the context mentioned above. Using the cone of unrestricted directions through the pupil on a tessellated head model as the geometric interpretation of the clinical field-of-view (FoV), the results obtained are experimentally validated. Estimating the pupil movement for a given gaze direction using Listing's Law, FoVs are re-computed. Significant variation of the FoV is observed with the variation in gaze direction. A novel cube-grid representation, which integrated the unit-cube representation of directions and the enhanced slice representation has been introduced for fast and exact point classification for point visibility analysis for a given FoV. Computation of containment frequency of every grid-cell for a given set of FoVs enabled determination of percentile-based FoV contours for estimating the visual performance of a given population. This is a new concept which makes visibility analysis more meaningful from ergonomics point-of-view. The algorithms are fast enough to support interactive analysis of reasonably complex scenes on a typical desktop computer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
