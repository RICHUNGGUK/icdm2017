Then, the concepts and formal definitions of self, nonself, antibody, antigen and agent in the grid security domain are given. Furthermore, the mathematical models of self, mature MoA (mature monitoring agent) and dynamic memory MoA (memory monitoring agent) survival are established. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the model is a good solution to grid intrusion detection.", "paper_title": "Immunity and mobile agent based grid intrusion detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400069"}
