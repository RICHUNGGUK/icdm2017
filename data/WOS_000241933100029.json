Unlike most kernel classification methods, which restrict kernel means to the training input data and use a fixed common variance for all the kernel terms, the proposed technique can tune both the mean vector and diagonal covariance matrix of individual kernel by incrementally maximizing Fisher ratio for class separability measure. An efficient weighted optimization method is developed based on boosting to append kernels one by one in an orthogonal forward selection procedure. Experimental results obtained using this construction technique demonstrate that it offers a viable alternative to the existing state-of-the-art kernel modeling methods for constructing sparse Gaussian radial basis function network classifiers. that generalize well.", "paper_title": "Kernel classifier construction using orthogonal forward selection and boosting with Fisher ratio class separability measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000241933100029"}
