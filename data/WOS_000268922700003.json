Implementing time warp using a connection-oriented communication approach is proposed in the literature as a way to improve nine warp performance because it allows for the use of more efficient event queue implementations. However, no empirical performance studies have been reported for connection-oriented nine warp. In this paper, we present an enhanced version of the connection-oriented nine warp algorithm along with its associated data structures. An empirical performance study, of the connection-oriented nine warp is conducted on a network of workstations using a standard synthetic benchmark simulation model. Experimental results show that this algorithm is capable of achieving better performance than that of traditional connectionless time warp,for several performance measures.", "paper_title": "An Empirical Performance Study of Connection Oriented Time Warp Parallel Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268922700003"}
