This model takes into account the uncertainties associated with the number of axles, axle weights, axle spacing and transversal position of vehicles. Combined with the traffic load model, a probabilistic finite element analysis approach is proposed to evaluate the time-dependent fatigue reliability levels of steel bridge details. The calculated results are in agreement with those obtained from monitored data. The proposed methodology can be used as a tool accompanying a monitoring program to obtain the fatigue reliability levels associated with the fatigue sensitive bridge details that are not monitored.
