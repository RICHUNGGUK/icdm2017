It often needs to process real-time streaming data and coordinate the related enterprise business systems to make low-latency, intelligent decisions on the changes of heating network in time. Therefore, the automatic collection, on-demand dissemination and fusion of real-time sensing data play an increasingly important role in district heating systems. This article proposed an event-driven SOA based district heating system architecture with complex event processing capability, which can easily support the on-demand dissemination and aggregation of monitoring information and realize the event-driven service coordination cross different service domains. Finally, a deployed District Heating Control and Information Service System (DHCISS) in Beijing validates the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Event-Driven SOA Based District Heating Service System with Complex Event Processing Capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000343387100001"}
