A total of 1067 research articles were published in 363 domestic and international journals. We highlight important growth during the mentioned period in the published research papers, particularly in China and Brazil over the last 5 years. Papers have been published in numerous journals in a number of subject areas, such as Revista Brasileira de Fruticultura and Pesquisa Agropecuaria Brasileira, which are the most productive among the BRIC countries. A social network analysis of collaboration between each of the four BRIC countries was also performed.", "paper_title": "Global trends in scientific production in enology and viticulture in selected emerging economies (BRIC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000352995000017"}
