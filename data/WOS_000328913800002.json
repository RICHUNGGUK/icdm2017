The new model for Qualitative Colour Description (QCD) distinguishes rainbow colours, pale, light, dark colours and colours in the grey scale. For comparing the qualitative colours described, a similarity measure based on interval distances (SimQCDInt) is introduced. HSL intervals for each colour label have been defined experimentally using data obtained in a user survey. Preliminary experiments have also been conducted in order to check that the proposed approach is consistent with human appreciations of colour similarity and complementarity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
