Our test flight results indicate that we can accurately model and control our aerial vehicle when both moving the manipulators and interacting with target objects. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, the controller is proven to be stable. The simulation results showed how the MRAC is capable of stabilizing the oscillations produced from the unstable PI-D attitude control loop. Finally a high level control system based on a switching automaton is proposed in order to ensure the saftey of the aerial manipulation missions.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Adaptive Control for Aerial Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400045"}
