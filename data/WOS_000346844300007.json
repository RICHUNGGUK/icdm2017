The objective of this study was to show the effect of the overall geometry of dental implants on their biomechanics after implantation. In this study, 12 dental implants, with the same length, diameter and screw design, were simulated from different implant systems. Numerical model of right mandibular incisor bone segment was generated from CT data. The von-Mises stress distributions and the total deformation distributions under vertical/lateral load were compared for each implant by scores ranking method. The implants with cylindrical shapes had highest scores. Results indicated that cylindrical shape represented better geometry over taper implant. This study is helpful in choosing the optimal dental implant for clinical application and also contributes to individual implant design. Our study could also provide reference for choice and modification of dental implant in any other insertion sites and bone qualities.", "paper_title": "Biomechanical analysis and comparison of 12 dental implant systems using 3D finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000346844300007"}
