However location based services in the ubiquitous computing environment bring several security issues such as location privacy and forgery. While the privacy of the location based service is considered as the important security issue, security against location forgery is less considered. In this paper, we propose improved Han et al.'s protocol [1] that provides more lightweight computation. Our proposed model also improves the credibility of LBS by deploying multiple location sensing technologies.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Credibility of Location Based Service Using Multiple Sensing Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480800010"}
