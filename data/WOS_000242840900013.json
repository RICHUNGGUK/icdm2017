Using this method the delay function is expanded by the general Legendre wavelets. The property of the general operational matrix of integration is given and the direct algorithm for a product of a matrix function and a vector function is proposed. Furthermore the time-varying generalized delay systems are solved by the general Legendre wavelets. It is shown that the results can be applied to optimal control problem.", "paper_title": "Numerical solutions of time-varying generalized delay systems via General Legendre wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000242840900013"}
