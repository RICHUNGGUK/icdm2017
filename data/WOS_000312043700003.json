However, its provisioning using mobile technologies raises a new security challenge. Security services such as authentication and key establishment are critical in M2M, especially for healthcare systems. We proposed a simple architecture M2M service to apply any hospital which considers mobility of doctors and patients. An efficient security scheme with dynamic ID-Based authentication using pairwise key distribution is applied in M2M system. It can be assured high security through security analysis under shared key attack and sybil attack.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic ID-Based Authentication Scheme for M2M Communication of Healthcare Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312043700003"}
