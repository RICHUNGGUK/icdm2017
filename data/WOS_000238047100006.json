The problem is ignored in the existing solutions all along, because these solutions maintain a separate queue for each stream and perstream state information. In this paper, we extend the work made in [Ji Ming Chen, Zhi Wang, Ye Qiong Song, and You Xian Sun. A scalable approach for streams with (m,k)-firm deadline. In Proceedings of IEEE Workshop on Quality of Service for Application Servers (2004 October)] and propose loss-rate balance (static) and stream number balance (dynamic) Class Selection Algorithm (CSA) for real-time media streams with (m,k)-firm, which is scalable while offering dynamic performance close to that of existing solutions. The effectiveness of static CSA (S-CSA) that captures the trade-off between scalability and QoS granularity is evaluated through extensive simulation studies. It is also shown that the S-CSA is as effective to guarantee QoS in terms of dynamic failure rate as the dynamic one. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
