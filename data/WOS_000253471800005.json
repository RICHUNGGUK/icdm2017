Recently, ad hoe networking in the vehicular environment was investigated intensively. This paper proposes a new clustering technique for large multihop vehicular ad hoc networks. The cluster structure is determined by the geographic position of nodes and the priorities associated with the vehicle traffic information. Each cluster elects one node as its cluster head. The cluster size is controlled by a predefined maximum distance between a cluster head and its members. Clusters are independently controlled and dynamically reconfigured as nodes move. This paper presents the stability of the proposed cluster structure, and communication overhead for maintaining the structure and connectivity in an application context. The simulation is performed with comparative studies using CORSIM and NS-2 simulators.", "paper_title": "A position-based clustering technique for ad hoc intervehicle communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000253471800005"}
