Our research examined how data models organized in a columnar fashion compared to equivalent data models which did not, by improving novice designer's performance in error detection, comprehension, and query construction. Experimental results showed that the columnar organized data model improved performance in error detection and querying, but not in comprehension. Also, the columnar organized data model was perceived as being more useful. The results of our research have important implications for data model design, especially for novices who must interpret and use them. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
