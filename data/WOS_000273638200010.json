Ternary simulation, introduced by Eichelberger in 1965, consists of two algorithms, called A and B, and its results are well understood. Ternary simulation has been generalized by Brzozowski and Esik in 2003 to an infinite algebra C and finite algebras C-k, k >= 2, where C-2 is ternary algebra. Simulation in C has been studied extensively for feedback-free circuits, for which Algorithm A always terminates and Algorithm B is unnecessary. We Study the simulation of gate circuits with feedback in finite algebras C-k, in which Algorithms A and B always terminate. The Boolean functions of the gates are restricted to a set G, where G = H U (H) over tilde, H = {OR, XOR}, and (H) over tilde is the set of functions obtained by complementing any number of inputs and/or the output of functions from H. This set g includes all the nontrivial 1- and 2-variable functions and multi-input AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR functions. We introduce a simple graph-theoretic model of a circuit. We derive new properties of extensions of Boolean functions to Algebra C. We prove that Algorithm B in Algebra C-k, for k > 2, provides no more information than Algorithm B in ternary algebra. Thus, for any gate in any circuit, the final result of Algorithm B is always one of the binary values, 0 or 1, which are considered \"certain\", or the third \"uncertain\" value; the remaining values of C-k. never appear. This permits us to replace Algorithm B in C-k by the same algorithm in ternary algebra, and to reduce the simulation time.", "paper_title": "Gate Circuits with Feedback in Finite Multivalued Algebras of Transients", "paper_id": "WOS:000273638200010"}
