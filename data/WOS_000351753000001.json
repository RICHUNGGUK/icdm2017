A key property in distinguishing a live, valid access from printed media or replayed videos is by exploiting the information dynamics of the video content, such as blinking eyes, moving lips, and facial dynamics. We advance the state of the art in facial antispoofing by applying a recently developed algorithm called dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) as a general purpose, entirely data-driven approach to capture the above liveness cues. We propose a classification pipeline consisting of DMD, local binary patterns (LBPs), and support vector machines (SVMs) with a histogram intersection kernel. A unique property of DMD is its ability to conveniently represent the temporal information of the entire video as a single image with the same dimensions as those images contained in the video. The pipeline of DMD + LBP + SVM proves to be efficient, convenient to use, and effective. In fact only the spatial configuration for LBP needs to be tuned. The effectiveness of the methodology was demonstrated using three publicly available databases: 1) print-attack; 2) replay-attack; and 3) CASIA-FASD, attaining comparable results with the state of the art, following the respective published experimental protocols.", "paper_title": "Detection of Face Spoofing Using Visual Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000351753000001"}
