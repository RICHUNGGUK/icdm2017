We found that decision transparency and decision making satisfaction played key roles providing a higher sense of empowerment to the public, including their having a greater perceived power relationship with the government agency and a better feeling of being in control. This approach has improved citizens' positive perceptions of the government agencies as service providers. These findings make a strong case for the investment in the ISS and have provided useful information for government agencies who wish to develop or improve their online advisory services.
