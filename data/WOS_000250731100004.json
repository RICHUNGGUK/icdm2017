Although many approaches have been proposed to check inconsistencies in multi-resolution databases, there is still a lack of effective approaches working for complex objects, especially for regions with broad boundaries which is a general model for representing various types of uncertainties. This paper presents approaches for evaluating structural and topological consistency among multiple representations of complex regions with broad boundaries (CBBRs) based on map generalization operators: merging, dropping, and hybrid of these two. For evaluation of structural consistency, all possible multiple representations of a CBBR are generated automatically and organized into a structured neighborhood graph, and then correspondences and equivalences among the multiple representations are defined to determine whether two representations at different levels of detail are structurally consistent. For evaluation of topological consistency, the topological relations between all pairs of regions in two CBBRs are considered, and their variation with change of spatial scale is analyzed. Since the approaches in this paper are built on a hiearchical representation of CBBRs with arbitrarily complex structure, they will also work well for evaluating consistency among multiple representations of complex objects.
