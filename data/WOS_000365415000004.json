It is important to understand how to facilitate virtual knowledge sharing in online communities. Existing studies generally focus on system design factors or motivations behind knowledge sharing behavior. In this study we aim to investigate the knowledge sharing processes in online communities and identify process patterns that are indicative of effective knowledge sharing processes. We propose a computational framework to examine individual knowledge sharing processes in online communities from a process perspective. Our empirical evaluations show that effective knowledge sharing processes have distinct structural characteristics and communication network patterns compared to unhelpful knowledge sharing processes. Our research findings have practical implications for online community practitioners.", "paper_title": "Examining micro-level knowledge sharing discussions in online communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000365415000004"}
