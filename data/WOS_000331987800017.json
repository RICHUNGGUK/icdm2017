Nowadays, because of the time-critical tasks of several WSN applications, one of the new challenges faced by WSNs is handling real-time storage and querying the data they process. This is the real-time database management on WSN and it deals with time-constrained data, time-constrained transactions, and limited resources of wireless sensors. Developing, testing, and debugging this kind of complex system are time-consuming and hard work. The deployment is also generally very costly in both time and money. Therefore in this context, the use of a simulator for a validation phase before implementation and deploying is proved to be very useful. The aim of this paper is to describe the different specificities of real-time databases on WSN and to present a model for a simulation framework of the real-time databases management on WSN that uses a distributed approach. Then, the model of the simulator is described and developed in Java and a case study with some results demonstrates the validity of the structural model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
