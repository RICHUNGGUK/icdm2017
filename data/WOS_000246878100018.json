The algorithm performs several stages, each one intended for searching potentially nondominated solutions in a different part of the Pareto front. Pre-defined weight vectors act as pivots to define the weighted-Tchebycheff scalarizing functions used in each stage. Therefore, each stage focuses the search on a specific region, leading to an iterative approximation of the entire nondominated set. This algorithm, called MOTGA (Multiple objective Tchebycheff based Genetic Algorithm) has been designed to the multiobjective multidimensional 0/1 knapsack problem, for which a dedicated routine to repair infeasible solutions was implemented. Computational results are presented and compared with the outcomes of other evolutionary algorithms. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
