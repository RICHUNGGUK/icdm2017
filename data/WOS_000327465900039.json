Our design uses a single antenna for simultaneous TX/RX (i.e., the same resources as a standard half duplex system). We also propose novel analog and digital cancellation techniques that cancel the self interference to the receiver noise floor, and therefore ensure that there is no degradation to the received signal. We prototype our design by building our own analog circuit boards and integrating them with a fully WiFi-PHY compatible software radio implementation. We show experimentally that our design works robustly in noisy indoor environments, and provides close to the expected theoretical doubling of throughput in practice.", "paper_title": "Full Duplex Radios", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900039"}
