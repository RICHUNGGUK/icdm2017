Therefore, we need to analyze the properties of those distribution functions and critical value functions so as to design more precise algorithms to solve such optimization problems. In this paper, we deal with the analytical properties of distributions functions of fuzzy random variables and discuss its applications to critical value functions. We first establish some continuity theorems for distribution functions of fuzzy random variables, which characterize the properties of right continuity, left continuity and continuity, respectively. Then, applying those continuity theorems, we study the properties of critical value functions of fuzzy random variables. The results obtained in this paper are useful in fuzzy random programming models.", "paper_title": "STUDYING DISTRIBUTION FUNCTIONS OF FUZZY RANDOM VARIABLES AND ITS APPLICATIONS TO CRITICAL VALUE FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500004"}
