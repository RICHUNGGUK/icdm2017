In this paper, we introduce an autostereoscopic display that uses a scalable array of digital light projectors and a projection screen augmented with microlenses to simulate a light field for a given three-dimensional scene. Physical objects emit or reflect light in all directions to create a light field that can be approximated by the light field display. The display can simultaneously provide many viewers from different viewpoints a stereoscopic effect without head tracking or special viewing glasses. This work focuses on two important technical problems related to the light field display: calibration and rendering. We present a solution to automatically calibrate the light field display using a camera and introduce two efficient algorithms to render the special multiview images by exploiting their spatial coherence. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with a four-projector prototype that can display dynamic imagery with full parallax.", "paper_title": "Toward the light field display: Autostereoscopic rendering via a cluster of projectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000250787500008"}
