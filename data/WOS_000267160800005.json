We show that some interesting questions in problem domains such as distributed secret sharing and routing in packet filtered networks are basically questions about the existence of L-hyperpaths in directed hypergraphs. We study the computational complexity of problems related to L-hyperpaths and the L-cyclomatic number of directed hypergraphs (the minimum number of hyperedges that need to be deleted to make a directed hypergraph free of L-hypercycles). We prove that the L-hyperpath existence problem, the L-cyclomatic number problem, the minimum L-cyclomatic set problem, and the minimal L-cyclomatic set problem are each complete for the complexity class NP, Sigma(p)(2), Pi(p)(2), and DP, respectively.
