Because of the increased use of images in industrial operations, it is necessary to protect the secret data of the image against unauthorized access. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for image encryption based on employing a cyclic shift and the 2-D chaotic Baker map in different transform domains. The Integer Wavelet Transform (IWT), the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), and the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) are exploited in the proposed encryption approach. The characteristics of the transform domains are studied and used to carry out the chaotic encryption. A comparison study between the transform-domain encryption approaches in the presence of attacks shows the superiority of encryption in the DWT domain. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
