Two important aspects of this problem are the representation of information provided by the sources and the formulation of the instructions on how to fuse the information provided, which we refer to as the fusion imperative. We investigate the use of a monotonic set measure as a means of representing the fusion imperative. We look at the fusion of various different types of information, precise data, uncertain information such as probabilistic and possibilistic. We also consider the case of imprecise uncertain information such as that represented by a Dempster-Shafer belief structure.", "paper_title": "Set Measure Directed Multi-Source Information Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000297586000004"}
