The application under consideration consists of several non-preemptive tasks and interrupt service routines that can be synchronized by events. A model checking tool is used to verify time and logical properties of the proposed model. Use of this methodology is demonstrated on an automated gearbox case study and the result of the worst-case response time verification is compared with the classical method based on the time-demand analysis. It is shown that the model-checking approach provides less pessimistic results due to a more detailed model and exhaustive state-space exploration.", "paper_title": "Formal verification of multitasking applications based on timed automata model", "paper_id": "WOS:000251900900002"}
