The interconnections between nodes have a great impact on the radio interference level present in such a network and may create a serious electromagnetic compatibility issue in some cases. It can be proved that the total interference incurred by a statistical node can be diminished in two ways: either by using directional antennas or by setting an upper limit on the duty cycle of each network node.
