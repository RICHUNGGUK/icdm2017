However, due to mobility and cloudlet capacity, the connections between a mobile user and mobile cloudlets can be intermittent. As a result, offloading actions taken by the mobile user may fail (e.g., the user moves out of communication range of cloudlets). In this paper, we develop an optimal offloading algorithm for the mobile user in such an intermittently connected cloudlet system, considering the users' local load and availability of cloudlets. We examine users' mobility patterns and cloudlets' admission control, and derive the probability of successful offloading actions analytically. We formulate and solve a Markov decision process (MDP) model to obtain an optimal policy for the mobile user with the objective to minimize the computation and offloading costs. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal policy of the MDP has a threshold structure. Subsequently, we introduce a fast algorithm for energy-constrained users to make offloading decisions. The numerical results show that the analytical form of the successful offloading probability is a good estimation in various mobility cases. Furthermore, the proposed MDP offloading algorithm for mobile users outperforms conventional baseline schemes.", "paper_title": "Offloading in Mobile Cloudlet Systems with Intermittent Connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000364856900009"}
