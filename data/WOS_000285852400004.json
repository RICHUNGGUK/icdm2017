The results of an experiment involving a group of OSS users inspecting an open source project called dotproject demonstrate that this method outperforms traditional heuristics based inspection The paper also considers the applicability of the usability method and tool developed to usability improvement in the context of traditional proprietary development Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "paper_title": "Exploratory inspection-a user-based learning method for improving open source software usability", "paper_id": "WOS:000285852400004"}
