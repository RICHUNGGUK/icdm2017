The purpose of the paper is to investigate the accuracy issue of the two alternative methods, the direct method and the subtraction method for the modeling of current dipoles. Design/methodology/approach - Finite element modeling of current dipoles using the direct method and the alternative implementations of the subtraction method. Findings - The accuracy and the performance of different methods are compared through a four-layer spherical head model with available analytical solution. Results show that the subtraction method involving only the surface integrals provides the best accuracy. Originality/value - The subtraction method removes the difficulty of modeling the singularity of current dipoles but the accuracy depends on the implementation.", "paper_title": "Finite element modeling of current dipoles using direct and subtraction methods for EEG forward problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500021"}
