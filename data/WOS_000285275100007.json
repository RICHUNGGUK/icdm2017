Although some initial crankback studies have been done, there is still significant latitude for improving multi-domain crankback performance. Along these lines, this paper studies realistic IP/MPLS multi-domain networks and proposes a novel solution for joint intra/interdomain signaling crankback. Namely, dynamic intra-domain link-state routing information is coupled with available inter-domain path/distance vector routing state to improve the overall search process. Mechanisms are also introduced to limit crankback overheads and delays. The performance of the proposed solution is then analyzed using simulation and compared against hierarchical inter-domain routing strategies as well as another crankback scheme.
