A methodology for building a Timed Hybrid Petri Net (THPN) model is proposed; the model is derived from a set of equations describing conservation of mass and energy that specify the behaviour of a water distribution network. A simulation technique for the execution of a THPN in which the transitions firing velocities are established from the linearised conservation of energy equations is presented; it shows both transient and steady state for the analysis of hydraulic networks. Based on this technique, a simulator in Matlab has been developed.", "paper_title": "Modeling and simulation of water distribution systems using timed hybrid Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000299996100005"}
