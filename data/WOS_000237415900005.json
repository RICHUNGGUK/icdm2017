After having selected an appropriate protection scheme, the first aim is achieved primarily by means of sharing backup resources, and the second aim calls for well conceived restrictions on backup resource sharing rules. We investigate the trade-offs that are behind the choice of protection schemes and sharing rule restrictions with respect to blocking probability and connection availability. Results of simulations carried out in European and Italian network topologies are used to draw conclusions. Sensitivity analysis of availability parameters is also carried out.
