EDM is rarely linked with systems theory, although it needs requisite holism. We report on research that considers the application of Dialectical Systems Theory (DST) to EDM. We first briefly describe DST and then turn our attention to employee diversity (ED). We include its elements, such as various types of personality, values, and attitudes of employees; family issues; and demografic trends, which managers should know in order to successfully manage ED in their organizations. We find that successful ED management depends on holism, which in turn depends on systems thinking. The DST approach is what we find most suitable among various approaches: It supports well the interdisciplinary cooperation that is needed in EDM.", "paper_title": "Employee diversity management in the context of dialectial systems theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000242159100002"}
