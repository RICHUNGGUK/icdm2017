Since a comprehensive structural analysis of the MocR regulators is still missing, a comparisons of Firmicutes MocR sequences was undertook to contribute to the understanding of the structural characteristics of the C-terminal domain of these proteins, and to shed light on the structural and functional relationship with fold type-I PLP enzymes. Results of this work suggest the presence of at least three subgroups within the MocR sequences and provide a guide for rational site-directed mutagenesis studies aimed at deciphering the structure-function relationships in this new protein family.
