This article introduces haptic rendering of dynamic volumetric data to provide a means for haptic exploration of dynamic behavior in volumetric data. We show how haptic feedback can be produced that is consistent with volumetric data moving within the virtual environment and with data that, in itself, evolves over time. Haptic interaction with time-varying data is demonstrated by allowing palpation of a computerized tomography sequence of a beating human heart.", "paper_title": "Haptic rendering of dynamic volumetric data", "paper_id": "WOS:000252254200003"}
