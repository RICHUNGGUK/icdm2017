The characteristics of common passive filters, such as single-tuned, second-order, third-order, and C-type damped filters are introduced. In addition, several objective functions and constraints for PPF design problems are constructed. A new multi-objective optimization based on the modified bat algorithm and Pareto front is developed for solving PPF design problems. A case study is also presented to demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
