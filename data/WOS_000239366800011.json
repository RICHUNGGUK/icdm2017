These lines are modeled as RC and RLC distributed lines, and the two models are compared to define the effects caused by neglecting inductance. The goal of this study is, based upon the discrepancy between RC and RLC models, to define when inductance must be included in the modeling of interconnects. A simple rule permits the choice of the simplest model (RC or RLC) for a given accuracy. The length range concerned by the inductive effect is calculated from the complex propagation factor value. The theoretical limits are illustrated on several interconnection configurations, on a 0.18-mu m technology.", "paper_title": "DSM interconnects: Importance of inductance effects and corresponding range of length", "paper_id": "WOS:000239366800011"}
