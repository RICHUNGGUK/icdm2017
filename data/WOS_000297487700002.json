Cubic Hermite meshes provide a smooth representation of anatomy that is well-suited for simulating large deformation mechanics. Models of organ mechanics and deformation have demonstrated significant potential for clinical application. However, the production of a personalised mesh from patient's anatomy using medical images remains a major bottleneck in simulation workflows. To address this issue, we have developed an accurate, fast and automatic method for deriving patient-specific cubic Hermite meshes. The proposed solution customises a predefined template with a fast binary image registration step and a novel cubic Hermite mesh warping constructed using a variational technique. Image registration is used to retrieve the mapping field between the template mesh and the patient images. The variational warping technique then finds a smooth and accurate projection of this field into the basis functions of the mesh. Applying this methodology, cubic Hermite meshes are fitted to the binary description of shape with sub-voxel accuracy and within a few minutes, which is a significant advance over the existing state of the art methods. To demonstrate its clinical utility, a generic cubic Hermite heart biventricular model is personalised to the anatomy of four patients, and the resulting mechanical stability of these customised meshes is successfully demonstrated.
