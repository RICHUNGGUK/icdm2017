The problem to be solved is to balance the network and keep the fairness for all nodes. For this purpose, this paper focuses on verifying the fairness of mobile sink routing based on both state and action, which is realized mainly by composing Labeled Kripke Transition Systems (LKTS). First, an approach is presented by LKTS to model node behaviors. Second, a notion of Fair Computational Tree Logic (CTL) is introduced to describe the fairness formulae in branching time transitions, and four kinds of fairness assumptions are defined for fairness verification. Moreover, in order to avoid the problem of state-space explosion, Bounded model Checking to explore states and transitions on-the-fly until a witness is found, while Strong Connected Components algorithm is used to pick up fair paths under fairness constraints of Fair CTL. The experimental results show the superiority of our method by the savings in memory and time consumptions during the mobile sink routing process.", "paper_title": "An algorithm on fairness verification of mobile sink routing in wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000323520500008"}
