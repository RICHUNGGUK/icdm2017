However, the outsourced data in the cloud and the computation results are not always trustworthy because of the lack of physical possession and control over the data for data owners as a result of using to virtualization, replication and migration techniques. Since that the security protection the threats to outsourced data have become a very challenging and potentially formidable task in cloud computing, many researchers have focused on ameliorating this problem and enabling public auditability for cloud data storage security using remote data auditing (RDA) techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on the remote data storage auditing in single cloud server domain and presents taxonomy of RDA approaches. The objective of this paper is to highlight issues and challenges to current RDA protocols in the cloud and the mobile cloud computing. We discuss the thematic taxonomy of RDA based on significant parameters such as security requirements, security metrics, security level, auditing mode, and update mode. The state-of-the-art RDA approaches that have not received much coverage in the literature are also critically analyzed and classified into three groups of provable data possession, proof of retrievability, and proof of ownership to present a taxonomy. It also investigates similarities and differences in such framework and discusses open research issues as the future directions in RDA research. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
