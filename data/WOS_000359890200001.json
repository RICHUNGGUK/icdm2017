However, current bandwidth estimation methods face great challenges with clouds. One important reason is that traffic shapers such as token bucket shapers are widely used as a building block for rate limiting in clouds. In this paper, we propose two methods called NarrowLinkCapacity and NarrowTokenRate to actively estimate the capacity and token rate, respectively, of a path in a network with potentially multiple token bucket shapers. The capacity of a path is the slowest link capacity among all links on the path, and the token rate of a path is the slowest token rate among all token bucket shapers in the path. They are two important path properties determining the average rate of a train of packets on a path. Our evaluation results show that our methods work well under a variety of network conditions.
