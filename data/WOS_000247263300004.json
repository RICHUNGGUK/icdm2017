We formulate discrete versions of these models as second-order cone programs (SOCPs) which can be solved efficiently by interior-point methods. Our experiments with these models on ID oscillating signals and 2D images reveal their differences: the Meyer model tends to extract oscillation patterns in the input, the TV-L-1 model performs a strict multiscale decomposition, and the Vese-Osher model has properties falling in between the other two models.
