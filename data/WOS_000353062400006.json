To this purpose, parametric models for interval-valued variables are used which consider configurations for the variance-covariance matrix that take the nature of the interval data directly into account. Results, both on synthetic and empirical data, clearly show the well-founding of the proposed approach. The method succeeds in finding parsimonious heterocedastic models which is a critical feature in many applications. Furthermore, the analysis of the different data sets made clear the need to explicitly consider the intrinsic variability present in interval data.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic clustering of interval data", "paper_id": "WOS:000353062400006"}
