This paper focuses on the problem of inferring and validating skills and competencies over time. In particular, it explores how the quality of often inaccurate, insufficient, and invalid skill and competency information provided by people can be improved. At the core of this work is the development of an ontology for representing and evaluating skills and competencies and capturing information about sources of skill and competency information.", "paper_title": "Inferring and validating skills and competencies over time", "paper_id": "WOS:000327261200001"}
