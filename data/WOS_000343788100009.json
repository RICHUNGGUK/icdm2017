Artificial balanced samples are generated according to a smoothed bootstrap approach and allow for aiding both the phases of estimation and accuracy evaluation of a binary classifier in the presence of a rare class. Functions that implement more traditional remedies for the class imbalance and different metrics to evaluate accuracy are also provided. These are estimated by holdout, bootstrap, or cross-validation methods.", "paper_title": "ROSE: A Package for Binary Imbalanced Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000343788100009"}
