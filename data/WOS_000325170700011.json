A social graph, for example, containing hundreds of millions of actors and tens of billions of relationships is not uncommon. Analyzing these large data sets, even to answer simple analytic queries, often pushes the limits of algorithms and machine architectures. We present GraphCT, a scalable framework for graph analysis using parallel and multithreaded algorithms on shared memory platforms. Utilizing the unique characteristics of the Cray XMT, GraphCT enables fast network analysis at unprecedented scales on a variety of input data sets. On a synthetic power law graph with 2 billion vertices and 17 billion edges, we can find the connected components in 2 minutes. We can estimate the betweenness centrality of a similar graph with 537 million vertices and over 8 billion edges in under 1 hour. GraphCT is built for portability and performance.", "paper_title": "GraphCT: Multithreaded Algorithms for Massive Graph Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000325170700011"}
