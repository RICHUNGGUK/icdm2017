Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell. 31:539-555, 2009), for unsupervised trajectory analysis and semantic region modeling in surveillance settings. In our approach, trajectories are treated as documents and observations of an object on a trajectory are treated as words in a document. Trajectories are clustered into different activities. Abnormal trajectories are detected as samples with low likelihoods. The semantic regions, which are subsets of paths commonly taken by objects and are related to activities in the scene, are also modeled. Under Dual-HDP, both the number of activity categories and the number of semantic regions are automatically learnt from data. In this paper, we further extend Dual-HDP to a Dynamic Dual-HDP model which allows dynamic update of activity models and online detection of normal/abnormal activities. Experiments are evaluated on a simulated data set and two real data sets, which include 8, 478 radar tracks collected from a maritime port and 40,453 visual tracks collected from a parking lot.", "paper_title": "Trajectory Analysis and Semantic Region Modeling Using Nonparametric Hierarchical Bayesian Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000301842800004"}
