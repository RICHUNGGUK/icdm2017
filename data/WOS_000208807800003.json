The use of very high resolution meshes containing large numbers of nodes results in a high computational cost, both in terms of CPU hours and memory footprint. In this paper an anisotropic mesh adaptivity technique is implemented in the Chaste physiological simulation library in order to reduce the mesh resolution away from the depolarization front. Adapting the mesh results in a reduction in the number of degrees of freedom of the system to be solved by an order of magnitude during propagation and 2-3 orders of magnitude in the subsequent plateau phase. As a result, a computational speedup by a factor of between 5 and 12 has been obtained with no loss of accuracy, both in a slab-like geometry and for a realistic heart mesh with a spatial resolution of 0.125 mm.
