In this paper, we study gang scheduling performance in the presence of critical sporadic jobs. A simulation model is used to address performance issues associated with gang scheduling on distributed processors for various workloads. Simulated results indicate that the relative performance of the gang scheduling policies depends on the arrival rates of gangs and critical sporadic jobs and also on the variability in the critical sporadic jobs inter-arrival times.", "paper_title": "The impact of critical sporadic jobs on gang scheduling performance in distributed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256134400004"}
