For better correspondence, we need to determine the occlusion. Recently dynamic programming on a minimal span tree (rust) structure is used to search for correspondence. We have extended this idea. First, mst is generated directly based on the color information in the image instead of converting the color image into a gray scale. Second, have treated this rust as a Bayesian Network. Novelty is attained by considering local variances of the disparity and intensity differences in the conditional Gaussians as unobserved random parameters. These parameters are iteratively inferenced by alternate estimation along the tree given a current disparity map. It is followed by dynamic programming estimation of the map given the current variance estimates thus reducing the overall occlusion. We evaluate our algorithm on the benchmark Middlebury database. The results are promising for modeling occlusion in early vision problems.", "paper_title": "Refine stereo correspondence using Bayesian network and dynamic programming on a color based minimal span tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100056"}
