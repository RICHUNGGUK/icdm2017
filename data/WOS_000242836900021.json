The decoupled method provides a simple way to achieve asymptotic stability for a class of fourth-order nonlinear system. Moreover, heuristic sliding factors are implemented as fuzzy inference. Therefore, the proposed method eliminates the trial-and-error process for finding appropriate the sliding factor and fuzzy rules in decoupled self-tuning signed-distance fuzzy sliding mode controller implementation. The simulation of translational oscillations by a rotational actuator (TORA) system is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the method. Using this approach, the response of system will converge faster than that of previous reports. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
