A fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is described. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP)-based decision-making method can provide decision makers or buyer a valuable reference for evaluating software quality. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Importantly, the proposed scheme can assist decision makers in assessing the feasibility of digital video recorder system to management public space, making it highly applicable for academic and commercial purposes.
