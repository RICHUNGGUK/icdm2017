Interactive maps can be combined with analytical tools to explore various settings of multi-criteria evaluation parameters that define different decision-making strategies. In a case study, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to calculate composite measures of urban quality of life (QoL) for neighbourhoods in Toronto. The AHP allows for an interactive exploration of decision-making strategies, while offering a view on spatial patterns in the evaluation results. In particular, an interactive blending between a classical and a contemporary QoL model is supported. This feature is used in a pilot study to assess the usefulness of geographic visualization in urban QoL evaluation. Three user interviews provide positive feedback on the utility and usability of the tool that was operated by the investigator.", "paper_title": "A geographic visualization approach to multi-criteria evaluation of urban quality of life", "paper_id": "WOS:000248857500005"}
