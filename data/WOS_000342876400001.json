In this paper, a method for Learning an Inductive Riemannian Manifold in Abstract form (LIRMA) is presented in which the structure of patterns is determined by solving the embedded dynamical system of the patterns.In order to model corresponding system, the true sequence of patterns is estimated using a topology preserving method.LIRMA has the advantage of being an inductive method with low complexity. Additionally, it is a topology preserving method with respect to quantitative measures.", "paper_title": "Learning Inductive Riemannian Manifold in Abstract Form by Modeling Embedded Dynamical System", "paper_id": "WOS:000342876400001"}
