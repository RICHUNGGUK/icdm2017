In order to overcome the cross-modulation of signals from water content and EC sensors, two filters with specific pass-bands were connected in each circuitry. Both laboratory calibration and field test were conducted, and the experimental results showed that the improved technique could provide more informative data to interpret soil physical conditions at fieldscale.
