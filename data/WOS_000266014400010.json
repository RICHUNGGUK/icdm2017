We present a new systematic method for selecting, under area and performance design constraints, the most suitable for gating subset of scan cells as well as the proper gating value for each one of them, aiming at the reduction of the average switching activity during testing. We show that the proposed method outperforms the corresponding already known methods, with respect to average dynamic power dissipation reduction.", "paper_title": "Efficient Partial Scan Cell Gating for Low-Power Scan-Based Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000266014400010"}
