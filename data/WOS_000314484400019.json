Design/methodology/approach - Implementation and laboratory test of a DWIG prototype. Analysis and simulation of the developed DWIG model. Findings - The proposed DWIG makes a better use of energy than a squirrel cage induction generator (SCIG) in variable speed applications. The performance of DWIG with a bidirectional converter is very similar to those described in other studies with brushless doubly-fed induction generators. Research limitations/implications - The results can be used to test different control techniques and to analyse the dynamic performance of DWIG-converter system in variable load and speed conditions. Originality/value - The stator winding design does not involve a significant increase in the complexity of the machine assembly and cost of this induction machine.", "paper_title": "Implementation, modelling and performance analysis of a dual stator-winding induction generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000314484400019"}
