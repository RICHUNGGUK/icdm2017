This problem remains challenging because head motion changes eye appearance significantly, and thus, training images captured for an original head pose cannot handle test images captured for other head poses. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a novel gaze estimation method that handles free head motion via eye image synthesis based on a single camera. Compared with conventional fixed head pose methods with original training images, our method only captures four additional eye images under four reference head poses, and then, precisely synthesizes new training images for other unseen head poses in estimation. To this end, we propose a single-directional (SD) flow model to efficiently handle eye image variations due to head motion. We show how to estimate SD flows for reference head poses first, and then use them to produce new SD flows for training image synthesis. Finally, with synthetic training images, joint optimization is applied that simultaneously solves an eye image alignment and a gaze estimation. Evaluation of the method was conducted through experiments to assess its performance and demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Gaze Estimation From Eye Appearance: A Head Pose-Free Method via Eye Image Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000358615500001"}
