A two-dimensional coupled map lattices (2D CML) with parameters leading to the largest Lyapunov exponent is employed. The state of the 2D CML is dynamically determined by its previous state and the message bit at the corresponding positions. The hash value is obtained by a linear transform on the final state of the 2D CML. Theoretical analysis and computer simulation indicate that our algorithm has good statistical properties, strong collision resistance and high flexibility. It is practical and reliable, with high potential to be adopted as a strong hash function for providing data integrity. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
