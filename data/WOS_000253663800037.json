It incorporates the advantages of both decision tree and neural network. An NNTree is a decision tree, where each non-terminal node contains a neural network. The idea of the proposed method is to use the framework of multilayer perceptron to design tree-structured pattern classifier. At each non-terminal node, the multilayer perceptron partitions the dataset into m subsets, m being the number of classes in the dataset present at that node. The NNTree is designed by splitting the non-terminal nodes of the tree by maximizing classification accuracy of the multilayer perceptron. In effect, it produces a reduced height m-ary tree. The versatility of the proposed scheme is illustrated through its application in diverse fields. The effectiveness of the hybrid algorithm, along with a comparison with other related algorithms, has been demonstrated on a set of benchmark datasets. Simulation results show that the NNTree achieves excellent performance in terms of classification accuracy, size of the tree, and classification time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
