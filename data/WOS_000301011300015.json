Each Monte Carlo step is composed by two or more sub-steps efficiently coupling coarse and finer state spaces. The method can be designed to sample the exact or controlled-error approximations of the target distribution, providing information on levels of different resolutions, as well as at the microscopic level. In both strategies the method achieves significant reduction of the computational cost compared to conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Applications in phase transition and pattern formation problems confirm the efficiency of the proposed methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
