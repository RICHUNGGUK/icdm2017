Several techniques have been introduced to determine the boundary nodes of a network, but the correctness of these techniques is often ill-defined. We present a technique for obtaining boundary node ground truth from region adjacency analysis of a model-based image created from a network graph. The resulting ground truth baseline is then used for quantitative comparison of several boundary detection methods including a local application of the image region adjacency analysis and the computation of the local convex hull with the addition of a perturbation value to overcome small boundary concavities in the node location point set. Given our proposed metrics of the techniques evaluated, the perturbed convex hull technique demonstrates a high success rate for boundary node identification, particularly when the convex hull is formed using two-hop neighborhoods. This technique was successfully implemented on a physical 25-node network, and the performance of this network implementation is evaluated. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
