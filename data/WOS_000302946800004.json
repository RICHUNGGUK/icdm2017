In this framework, the documents are projected into a low-dimensional semantic space in which the correlations between the documents in the local patches are maximized while the correlations between the documents outside these patches are minimized simultaneously. Since the intrinsic geometrical structure of the document space is often embedded in the similarities between the documents, correlation as a similarity measure is more suitable for detecting the intrinsic geometrical structure of the document space than euclidean distance. Consequently, the proposed CPI method can effectively discover the intrinsic structures embedded in high-dimensional document space. The effectiveness of the new method is demonstrated by extensive experiments conducted on various data sets and by comparison with existing document clustering methods.", "paper_title": "Document Clustering in Correlation Similarity Measure Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000302946800004"}
