In reality, some uncertain factors always restrict the scheduling optimisation problem. In this paper, taking uncertain processing time as an example, we use generalised rough sets theory to transform the rough flow shop scheduling model into the precise scheduling model. We adopt a cooperative co-evolutionary particle swarm optimisation algorithm based on a niche sharing scheme (NCPSO) to minimise the makespan in comparison with the particle swarm optimiser (PSO) and co-evolution particle swarm optimiser (CPSO) algorithms. The new algorithm is characterised by a strengthening of the ability to reserve excellent particles and searching the optimal solution. Experimental results show that the new algorithm is more effective and efficient than the others.", "paper_title": "A cooperative co-evolutionary particle swarm optimiser based on a niche sharing scheme for the flow shop scheduling problem under uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000343644100002"}
