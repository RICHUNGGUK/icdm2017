The software component Suitability presented herein implements several published approaches for computing crop suitability, based on available climate, soil and crop information. Users can access the Suitability software component via two application programming interfaces for single- and multi-cell estimations, the latter based on multiple regression methods. The component, extensible by third parties, is released as .NET 3.5 DLL, thus targeting the development of .NET clients. A case study on wheat suitability in Morocco is also presented.
