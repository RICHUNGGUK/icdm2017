We propose a novel method for missing data reconstruction based on three main steps: (1) computing a fuzzy similarity measure between a segment of the time series containing the missing data and segments of reference time series; (2) assigning a weight to each reference segment; (3) reconstructing the missing values as a weighted average of the reference segments. The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of an Auto Associative Kernel Regression (AAKR) method on an artificial case study and a real industrial application regarding shutdown transients of a Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) turbine.
