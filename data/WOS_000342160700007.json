We consider numerical data for two light flavors, based on simulations with dynamical chiral lattice fermions. We test properties and predictions that were put forward in the recent literature for models with Sigma = 0, which include IR conformal theories. In particular, we probe the decorrelation of low lying Dirac eigenvalues, and we discuss the mass anomalous dimension and its IR extrapolation. Here, we encounter subtleties, which may urge caution with analogous efforts in other models, such as multi-flavor QCD.", "paper_title": "Features of a 2d gauge theory with vanishing chiral condensate", "paper_id": "WOS:000342160700007"}
