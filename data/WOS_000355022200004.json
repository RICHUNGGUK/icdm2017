Specifically, a function space formalism, that unifies the representation of geometry and physical attributes, is proposed along with an algebra that operates on elements in those spaces. A declarative programming language is provided, which accepts a subset of mathematical semantics specified using the Mathematical Markup Language (MathML) as well as a fortran-like syntax. The language enables a high-level definition of the geometric model using continuous affine transformation and boolean operators leading to a mixed-dimensional representation. Thus, it is possible to construct analytically defined shapes as well as spline representation of complex geometry. The framework is demonstrated by constructing complex engineered solids and isogeometrically solving boundary value problems on the constructed solid. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
