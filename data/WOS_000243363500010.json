Integration of US to MRI-based segmentation and 3D display of tumours can help physicians deal with instabilities such as respiratory motion and soft tissue shift that are inherent in abdominal interventions. In addition to the 3D display of the needle and tumours, we adapted the system for the abdominal applications and incorporated a process to correct the mismatch in needle path between MRI and US. The preliminary results of phantom and animal experiments indicated that the proposed method could combine the advantages of both MRI and US. The time required to determine the optimal needle insertion path by using this system was significantly less than that required when either US or MRI guidance alone was employed. The developed system was applied in two patients who underwent PEIT therapy, and its clinical feasibility was partially confirmed.", "paper_title": "Interventional navigation for abdominal therapy based on simultaneous use of MRI and ultrasound", "paper_id": "WOS:000243363500010"}
