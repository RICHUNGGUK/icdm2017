This research is a correlation study where a field survey was employed for data collection. The unit of analysis is Iranian individuals who are ERP user in organizations using ERP systems. The questionnaires were sent to the selected organizations. Using a structural equation modeling analysis we tested the hypothesized relationship using AMOS version 16.0. The results indicate that all three absorptive capacity measures to be good predictors of intention to use. Absorptive capacity for applying was the strongest predictor followed by absorptive capacity for understanding and absorptive capacity for assimilating. When implementing complex information systems, managers must also look at the absorptive capacity of the users in order to successful implementation of the system and to ensure continued usage. Previous researchers have not looked at the role of absorptive capacity in system usage at the same rate as those related to technology acceptance research which only focuses on the ease of use and usefulness. Thus this research adds on to the existing literature where future researchers may want to expand on the factors that may influence absorptive capacity for further policy implications.", "paper_title": "The Role of Absorptive Capacity in the Usage of a Complex Information System: The Case of the Enterprise Information System", "paper_id": "WOS:000344576000002"}
