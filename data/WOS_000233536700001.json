The discussion centres on three quality issues that are considered as critical in recent content analysis approaches: (1) the accuracy of the research methodology applied to gather data in CSCL-settings, (2) the low reliability of the research instruments and procedures, and (3) questions about the validity of the research instruments. Finally, the four contributions in the special are positioned in relation to these three critical topics. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
