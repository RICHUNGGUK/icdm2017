The motivation behind such approach is that to evaluate moves rearranging the configuration of a subset of nodes may require to solve a smaller-sized MLCMST instance. We thus use heuristic rules to define, in both the construction and the local search phases, subproblems which are in turn solved exactly by employing an integer programming model. We report numerical results obtained on benchmark instances from the literature, showing the approach to be competitive in terms of solution quality. The proposed GRASP have in fact improved the best known upper bounds for almost all of the considered instances.", "paper_title": "GRASP with hybrid heuristic-subproblem optimization for the multi-level capacitated minimum spanning tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000265020400003"}
