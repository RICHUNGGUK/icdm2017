Specifically, it transforms a key encapsulation mechanism having OW-CCCA security and reproducibility into that of IND-CCA secure in the random oracle model whose ciphertext is shorter. Various existing chosen-ciphertext secure key encapsulation mechanisms (in the standard model) are reproducible, and thus their ciphertext can be shortened by the proposed transformation. The transformed scheme requires only one additional hashing for encryption. This property enables us to implement both the original scheme and the transformed scheme into a single chip simultaneously with small gate-size overhead. Using this chip, a sender can flexibly switch schemes to encrypt a message in a message-by-message manner. Such a use of schemes is also analyzed.", "paper_title": "How to Shorten a Ciphertext of Reproducible Key Encapsulation Mechanisms in the Random Oracle Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480700011"}
