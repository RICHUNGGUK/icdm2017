This article investigates the impact of music and seeks to explain e-behavioral intentions through two underlying processes: immersion and experience. A total of 250 persons were surveyed for their intentions to re-visit and recommend a virtual art gallery. The results reveal that music fosters e-behavioral intentions. They also emphasize that immersion and aesthetic experience (emotions and contemplation) mediate this effect. The findings, confirming the impact of music on immersion, could thus help managers design more effective Websites. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
