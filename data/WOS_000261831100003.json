In this paper we propose a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) based classifier in comparison with Bayesian classifiers and Artificial Neural Networks for the prognosis and diagnosis of breast cancer disease. The paper provides the implementation details along with the corresponding results for all the assessed classifiers. Several comparative studies have been carried out concerning both the prognosis and diagnosis problem demonstrating the superiority of the proposed SVM algorithm in terms of sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.", "paper_title": "An intelligent system for automated breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis using SVM based classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000261831100003"}
