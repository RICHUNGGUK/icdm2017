Given a triangulated 2-manifold T of n faces and a set of m point sites S = {s(1), s(2), ... , s(m)} is an element of T, we prove that the complexity of Voronoi diagram V-T(S) of S on T is O(mn) if the genus of T is zero. For a genus-g manifold T in which the samples in S are dense enough and the resulting Voronoi diagram satisfies the closed ball property, we prove that the complexity of Voronoi diagram V-T(S) is O((M + g)n).
