Our model allows us to consider a certain kind of structural information: tags that represent a logical structure (e.g., title, section, paragraph, etc.) as well as other tags (e.g., bold, italic, center, etc.). We take into account the influence of a tag by estimating the probability for this tag to distinguish relevant terms from the others. Then, these weights are integrated in a term-weighting function. Experiments on a large collection from the INEX 2008 XML IR evaluation campaign showed improvements on focused XML retrieval.", "paper_title": "BM25t: a BM25 extension for focused information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000305692000009"}
