The main condition given in this paper is dependent oil the size of the measure of the space, which is usually less conservative than space-independent ones. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Global asymptotical stability in neutral-type delayed neural networks with reaction-diffusion terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000023"}
