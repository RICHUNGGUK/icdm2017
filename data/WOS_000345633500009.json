The proposed E-voting system, referred to as Enhanced Name and vOte separaTed E-voting system, is improved with a new protocol design and a watchdog hardware device added to ensure voter confidentiality and voting accuracy. In our improved scheme, rather than Election Committee and Vote Counting Committee, an impartial third party, Ballot Distribution Center, is proposed to take the responsibility of distributing ballots. The votes and the candidates' names are separated into two parts while voters cast their votes. The watchdog device records all voting transactions during the election to prevent voting disputes and other malicious behaviors from voter frauds. Our proposed procedure addresses issues related to voter confidentiality and candidate privacy, voting frauds and voting accuracy, and will thus help to create a fair election.
