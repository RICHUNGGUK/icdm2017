PRM has both a proactive and a reactive components; in this paper we describe how PRM can be used to improve the performance of application-layer multicast protocols especially when there are high packet losses and host failures. Through detailed analysis in this paper, we show that this loss recovery technique has efficient scaling properties-the overheads at each overlay node asymptotically decrease to zero with increasing group sires. As a detailed case study, we show how PRM can be applied to the NICE application-layer multicast protocol. We present detailed simulations of the PRM-enhanced NICE protocol for 10 000 node Internet-like topologies. Simulations show that PRM achieves a high delivery ratio (>97%) with a low latency bound (600 ms) for environments with high end-to-end network losses (1%-5%) and high topology change rates (5 changes per second) while incurring very low overheads (<5%).", "paper_title": "Resilient multicast using overlays", "paper_id": "WOS:000237033500001"}
