Distance and similarity measures play great roles in many areas, such as decision making, pattern recognition, etc. In this paper, we introduce some distance and similarity measures for DHFSs based on Hamming distance, Euclidean distance and Hausdorff distance. Two examples are used to illustrate these distance and similarity measures and their applications in pattern recognition. Finally, the comparisons among DHFSs and the corresponding IVIFSs and HFSs are made in detail by utilizing the developed distance measures.", "paper_title": "Distance and similarity measures for dual hesitant fuzzy sets and their applications in pattern recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100025"}
