This approach is based on rigid movements which separate the image set from the negative of the ordering cone. We study conditions on the existence of such translations in terms of the boundedness of the scalar problems produced by the weighting method. Finally, using recession cones, we obtain the main result of our work: a sufficient condition under which weighting vectors yield solvable scalar problems.", "paper_title": "On the choice of parameters for the weighting method in vector optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000247429500009"}
