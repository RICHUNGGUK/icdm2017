Raw materials (RMs) are sent by suppliers to a distribution center (DC) and then transported to a unique plant where they can be stored. The inventory capacity is limited in the plant as well as in the DC. The transportation capacity between the DC and the plant is also limited. The objective is to determine the flows between suppliers and the DC, and from the DC to the plant in order to satisfy the demand during the planning horizon while minimizing the global cost. A mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation is presented and a Lagrangean relaxation solution procedure is proposed. Computational experiments are carried out.", "paper_title": "A Lagrangean heuristic for a two-echelon storage capacitated lot-sizing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600037"}
