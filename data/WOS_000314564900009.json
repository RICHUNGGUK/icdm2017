The aim is to find the most reliable measurements to characterise the growth of heart and lungs from CT data. Standard measurements available on chest radiographies are compared with original measurements only available on CT scans. These measurements should characterise the growth of organs as well as the changes in their position relative to the thorax. Measurements were considered as functions of age. Quadratic regression models were fitted to the data. Goodness of fit of the models was then evaluated. Positions of organs relative to the thorax have a high variability compared with their changes with age. The length and volume of the heart and lungs as well as the diameter of the thorax fit well to the models of growth. It could be interesting to study these measurements with a larger sample size in order to define growth standards.", "paper_title": "Growth characterisation of intra-thoracic organs of children on CT scans", "paper_id": "WOS:000314564900009"}
