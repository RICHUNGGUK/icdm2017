With the advance of high-resolution 3D imaging, the extension of multiscale analysis to higher dimensions is necessary. This paper extends an existing 2D scale selection method, known as the minimum reliable scale, to 3D volumetric images. The method is applied to 3D boundary detection and is illustrated in examples from biomedical imaging. The experimental results show that the 3D scale selection improves the detection of edges over single scale operators using as few as three different scales.", "paper_title": "Minimum reliable scale selection in 3D", "paper_id": "WOS:000234517900014"}
