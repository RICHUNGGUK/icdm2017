However, when we investigate the emerging teleimmersive environments closer, we realize that their overall session management, including end-to-end session setup, establishment and run-time management are not appropriate for the new demands that these environments present. These environments are cyber-physical rooms that demand (a) large scale of multi-sensory devices across geographically-distributed locations and (b) interaction with each other in synchronous and real-time manner. To deal with the new teleimmersive demands, we present a new session management design with (a) session initiation protocol(s) that understand media correlations, (b) view-based multi-stream topology establishment among multiple parties, (c) efficient, light-weight and distributed session monitoring with querying and debugging capabilities, (d) flexible view-based session adaptation with efficient topology adjustments, and (e) light-weighted and consistent session tear-down protocols. The presented design of the next generation session management protocols, services, algorithms and data structures is based on our extensive experiences with building 3D teleimmersive interactive systems, experimenting with high impact teleimmersive applications and deploying such environments at various venues.", "paper_title": "Next generation session management for 3D teleimmersive interactive environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000286472300008"}
