In this paper, firstly, we give several definitions on uncertain preference ordinal, Then, to process uncertain preference ordinals, a decision matrix in the form of probabilities is constructed. Based on the decision matrix, a collective probability matrix on alternatives with regard to ranking positions is constructed. Furthermore, an optimization model is built based on the collective probability matrix, and the ranking of alternatives can be obtained by solving the model. Finally, two examples are used to illustrate the use of the proposed approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
