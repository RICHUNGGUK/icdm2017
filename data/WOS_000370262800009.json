How to effectively integrate service resources to meet customer demands becomes a key problem to service-oriented software development. Most of existing works are in the early research stage. The scope of process management consists of process design, process execution, process mining, and process intelligence. However, it requires process modeling, which is a crucial precondition in the lifecycle of service process management. In this paper, it reviews workflow verifications of Petri Nets based service process management. First, the workflow and description supporting tools are introduced. Then, considering the composite service is an effective way to organize third-party business functions seamlessly, the Petri Nets based service workflow employed to formalizing composition behaviors is discussed. Third, components encapsulated in the composite service may be encountered functional and non-functional problems since services are offered by different organizations. The functional verification includes the correctness, reachability and safety. The non-functional verification is to evaluate the performance of Petri Nets based workflow model ranging over timed constraints and probabilistic behaviors. Therefore, it summarizes Petri Nets based workflow verification techniques to guarantee the quality of services composition. In conclusion, this survey provides academic references to researchers and developers in service computing and process management.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Workflow Verifications of Petri Nets based Service Process Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000370262800009"}
