The proposed approach has been developed from fuzzy assessment methods in the literature and applied to the MP3 player. Highly subjective judgments and ambiguity regarding the presence of values and the product type of the appearance resulting from these values suggest the usefulness the fuzzy approach. Where the uncertainty arises from the inability to perform adequate measurements, fuzzy sets provide a mathematical method for representing such uncertainties. Applying the fuzzy approach, product appearance values which are common, and should be common in the MP3 player, are identified and these values are organized into six generic value types: (1) communication of aesthetic, (2) symbolic, (3) functional, (4) ergonomic information, (5) attention drawing, and (6) categorization. Finally the uncertainties of the appearance value sets are quantified by the measure of fuzzy entropy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
