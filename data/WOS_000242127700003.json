This paper deals with an actual traffic accident widely known as \"Shigaraki Kougen Railway accident\" caused by a fatal decision based upon certain incorrect knowledge, as an example of systems involving human factor. In order to represent and analyze this accident, the formal system @-calculus is generalized into the \"labeled\" @-calculus so as to describe time-concerned recognition, knowledge, belief and decision of humans besides external physical or logical phenomena, while the word 'time-concerned' is used to express the property not only time-dependent mathematically but also distinctively featured by subtle and sophisticated sensitivity, interest or concern in exact time.", "paper_title": "Labeled @-calculus: Formalism for time-concerned human factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000242127700003"}
