The key idea of the new design is to use short FHSs with good Hamming correlation together with certain appropriate shift sequences to construct a set of long FHSs with LHZ. By the new design, new sets of FHSs meeting the Peng-Fan-Lee bound are obtained. It is shown that all the sequences in the proposed FHS sets are shift distinct. The proposed FHS sets are suitable for quasi-synchronous frequency hopping code division multiple access systems to eliminate multiple-access interference.", "paper_title": "NEW CLASSES OF OPTIMAL FREQUENCY HOPPING SEQUENCES WITH LOW HIT ZONE", "paper_id": "WOS:000322821000006"}
