The circuit mainly includes four pairs of switches and four sampling capacitors. Two operation modes (normal/charge-averaging) are achieved by switching on/off. SpectreVerilog simulation results show the proposed scheme can strongly reduce the energy of spurs, and could be applied to high performance frequency synthesizers.", "paper_title": "An improved charge-averaging charge-pump scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000246764800007"}
