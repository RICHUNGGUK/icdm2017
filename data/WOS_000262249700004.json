A more reasonable initial condition for the consolidation of a composite foundation is derived from the equilibrium equation and the equal strain assumption. Then, the general analytical solutions for excess pore water pressures in the column and in the surrounding soil are obtained using this new initial condition under the influence of several important factors. These factors include: the gradual variation of horizontal permeability in the disturbed soil, the change in the total average stress in a composite foundation with depth, and the effect of time-dependent external loads. The general expressions for the overall average degree of consolidation of a composite foundation, both in terms of stress and in terms of deformation, are then derived. On the basis of the above theory, the explicit solutions for a particular case, which considers ramp loading and a linear change of total stress with depth, are given in detailed forms. Finally. a parametric study and a comparison of some available solutions are made. The results show that the average degree of consolidation obtained in terms of stress and in terms of deformation is the same; the increase in construction time, the disturbance intensity during column construction and the size of the disturbed zone reduce the consolidation rate of a composite foundation. For the case of PTIB (pervious top surface and impervious bottom surface), the increase in the ratio of top total stress to bottom total stress in the composite foundation accelerates consolidation.
