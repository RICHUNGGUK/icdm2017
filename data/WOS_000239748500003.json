In their simplest form, probabilistic choice is localised to cells, where conflict arises; in which case probabilistic independence coincides with causal independence. An event structure is associated with a domain-that of its configurations ordered by inclusion. In domain theory, probabilistic processes are denoted by continuous valuations on a domain. A key result of this paper is a representation theorem showing how continuous valuations on the domain of a confusion-free event structure correspond to the probabilistic event structures it supports. We explore how to extend probability to event structures which are not confusion-free via two notions of probabilistic runs of a general event structure. Finally, we show how probabilistic correlation and probabilistic event structures with confusion can arise from event structures which are originally confusion-free by using morphisms to rename and hide events.
