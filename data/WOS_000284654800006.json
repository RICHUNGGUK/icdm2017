In such system, user must be involved throughout the decision-making process. In consequence we propose the integration of a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) model into the development of DSS process based on KDD. The approach we propose is based on two systems development methods-the Unified Process (UP) from Software Engineering and the U model from HCI. In this article, we describe our combined approach (UP/U) and the way we used it to develop a DSS in a medical field. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
