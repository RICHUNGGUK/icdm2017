Examples include papers within a research domain. blog postings dealing with a certain topic, and information records within a company. We present a structured analysis to identify influential building blocks and linkages in a general IRN and show that our approach can be used for large networks of information nodes. Our method compensates for biases that can emerge at the edges of such time-dependent networks. Importantly, our focus is on the information elements and not on the authors of such information. We illustrate this process using one example of a resource network - research papers in a given domain. Our method can be implemented in any domain that can be represented as time-ordered, interrelated components of information sets. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
