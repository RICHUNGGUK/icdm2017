According to the property of the FS/SS sequence, the definition of a fuzzy membership function for a complexity metric is presented and a basic theorem for FuzzyEn complexity is proved. Simulation and analytical results show that the proposed FuzzyEn works and can effectively discern the changing complexities of the FH/SS sequences, which are compared with a complexity metric based on approximate entropy (ApEn). The FuzzyEn scheme has obvious advantages in robustness to resolution parameters and sensitivity to vector dimensions.", "paper_title": "A new complexity metric for FH/SS sequences using fuzzy entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000292269700015"}
