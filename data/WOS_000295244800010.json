The exposure of sensitive data can potentially lead to breach of individual privacy. Therefore, many privacy preserving techniques have been proposed recently. In this paper we present a framework that uses a few novel noise addition techniques for protecting individual privacy while maintaining a high data quality. We add noise to all attributes, both numerical and categorical. We present a novel technique for clustering categorical values and use it for noise addition purpose. A security analysis is also presented for measuring the security level of a data set. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
