However, automated or semi-automated computer aided modular fixture systems based on CAD packages still are not well accepted by the manufacturing industry due to the lack of intuitive interaction and immediate feedback compared with traditional models such as paper and physical models. In this paper, a novel Virtual Reality-based system for interactive modular fixture configuration design is presented. We use a multi-view based modular fixture assembly model to assist information representation and management. In addition, the suggested strategy is compatible with the principles of virtual environment and it is easy to reutilize the element model. Based on geometric constraints, we propose a precise 3D manipulation approach to improve intuitive interaction and accurate 3D positioning of fixture components in virtual space. Thus, the modular fixture configuration design task can precisely be performed in virtual space. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
