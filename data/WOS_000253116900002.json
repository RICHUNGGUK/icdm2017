Due to the sequential nature of the product development processes, some constraints or conflicts may emerge in a later stage and require modifications to the decisions made in earlier stages. The iterations between stages are hence unavoidable and must be managed carefully to maintain the consistency, integrity and validity of product information models. Due to the inter- or intra-stage relations, a chain of changes is very likely to occur as the consequence of an initial change. Modeling and maintaining these relations are important in collaborative engineering to evolve the state of the whole product model in a consistent manner. This paper introduces a new method of modeling associative engineering relations in a unified feature modeling scheme and elaborates a change propagation algorithm for the information consistency control among multiple applications of product lifecycle stages. The algorithm is established on a JTMS-based dependency network. Two case studies are used to illustrate the proposed dependency network and change propagation algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
