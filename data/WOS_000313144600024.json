The peers share the live streaming over MANET via multi-hop wireless link, so an efficient data delivery scheme must be required. However, the high churn rate and the frequent mobility baffle the P2P membership management and overlay maintenance. The unreliable wireless connection of MANET leads to the difficulties of large-scale and real-time streaming distribution, and a lack of overlay proximity leads to the inefficient streaming delivery. We present a cross-layer design for P2P over MANET to manage and maintain the overlay, and select efficient routing path to multicast media streams. Our proposed scheme (COME-P2P) integrates both P2P DHT-based lookup and IPv6 routing header to improve the delivery efficiency. Through the cross-layer design, the low layer detects mobility for informing high layer to refine the finger table, and high layer maintains the efficient multicast path for informing low layer to refine the routing table. How to keep stable routing paths for live streaming via IPv6 routing is the main contribution of this paper. The overlay proximity can shorten routing propagation delay, and the hop-by-hop routing can avoid the traffic bottleneck. Through the mathematical analysis and simulation results, COME-P2P can be demonstrated to achieve high smoothness and reduce signaling overhead for live streaming. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
