This investigation would be used for content-based image retrieval from the view of mirroring human perception for images. Depending on variability in human perception for trademark images, the proposed method finds grouping areas by calculating Mahalanobis distance with the features to every combination of two components in images. The features are extracted from every combination of two components in images, and the features represent proximity, shape similarity, and closure between two components. In addition, changing combination of the features, plural grouping patterns are output. Besides, this paper shows the efficiency and limits of the proposed method from experimental results. In the experiments, 104 participants have perceived grouping patterns to 74 trademark images and the human perceptions have been compared with outputs by the proposed method for the 74 images.", "paper_title": "Recognition of plural grouping patterns in trademarks for CBIR according to the gestalt psychology", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233300005"}
