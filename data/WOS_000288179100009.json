Two approaches using P-shaped and T-shaped open-stub configurations are investigated. Because of the stopband effect of the open-stubs, the harmonic passband responses are suppressed effectively. A compact-size balun is realized because both kinds of structures have slow wave characteristics. To validate theoretical predictions, two prototype baluns operating at f(0) = 1 GHz, showing size reduction up to 75% and no spurious passband up to 4f(0) compared with the conventional design are fabricated in microstrip form.
