In the method, global minima are searched by using three operators, interior, surface, and orientation operators. The first operator gives a perturbation on a cluster configuration by moving molecules near the center of mass of a cluster, and the second one modifies a cluster configuration by moving molecules to the most stable positions on the surface of a cluster. The moved molecules are selected by employing a contribution of the molecules to the potential energy of a cluster. The third operator randomly changes the orientations of all molecules. The proposed method was applied to benzene clusters. It was possible to find new global minima for (C6H6)(11), (C6H6)(14), and (C6H6)(15). Global minima for (C6H6)(16) to (C6H6)(30) are first reported in this article.", "paper_title": "Novel method for geometry optimization of molecular clusters: Application to benzene clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000243577400013"}
