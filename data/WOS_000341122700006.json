Applications of TAS range from online self-optimization of in-production applications to the automatic generation of QoS/cost-driven elastic scaling policies, as well as to support for what-if analysis on the scalability of transactional applications. In this article, we present the key innovation at the core of TAS, namely, a novel performance forecasting methodology that relies on the joint usage of analytical modeling and machine learning. By exploiting these two classically competing approaches in a synergic fashion, TAS achieves the best of the two worlds, namely, high extrapolation power and good accuracy, even when faced with complex workloads deployed over public cloud infrastructures. We demonstrate the accuracy and feasibility of TAS's performance forecasting methodology via an extensive experimental study based on a fully fledged prototype implementation integrated with a popular open-source in-memory transactional data grid (Red Hat's Infinispan) and industry-standard benchmarks generating a breadth of heterogeneous workloads.", "paper_title": "Transactional Auto Scaler: Elastic Scaling of Replicated In-Memory Transactional Data Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000341122700006"}
