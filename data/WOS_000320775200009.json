Profiling has long been proved to be an effective approach to performance analysis; however, existing approaches confront new challenges that emerge in cloud computing systems. First, the efficiency of the profiling becomes of critical concern; second, service-oriented profiling should be considered to support separation-of-concerns performance analysis. To address the above issues, in this paper, we present P-Tracer, an online performance profiling tool specifically tailored for cloud computing systems. P-Tracer constructs a specific search engine that proactively processes performance logs and generates a particular index for fast queries; second, for each service, P-Tracer retrieves a statistical insight of performance characteristics from multi-dimensions and provides operators with a suite of web-based interfaces to query the critical information. We evaluate P-Tracer in the aspects of tracing overheads, data preprocessing scalability and querying efficiency. Three real-world case studies that happened in Alibaba cloud computing platform demonstrate that P-Tracer can help operators understand software behaviors and localize the primary causes of performance anomalies effectively and efficiently.", "paper_title": "An online service-oriented performance profiling tool for cloud computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000320775200009"}
