Due to technology scaling, the leakage power is rising so quickly that it largely elevates the die temperature. In this paper, we deeply investigate the impact of leakage power on thermal profile in both 2D and 3D floorplanning. Our results show that chip temperature can increase by about 11 degrees C in 2D design and 68 degrees C for 3D case with leakage power considered. Then we propose a thermal-driven floorplanning flow integrated with an iterative leakage-aware thermal analysis process to optimize chip temperature and save leakage power consumption. Experimental results show that for 2D design, the max chip temperature can be reduced by about 8 degrees C and the proportion of leakage power to total power can be reduced from 19.17% to 11.12%. The corresponding results for 3D are 60 degrees C temperature reduction and 16.3% less leakage power proportion.", "paper_title": "THERMAL IMPACTS OF LEAKAGE POWER IN 2D/3D FLOORPLANNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100007"}
