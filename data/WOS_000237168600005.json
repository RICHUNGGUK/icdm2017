Three special cases of the approach are investigated, which are the weighted least deviation norm (WLDN), the weighted least-square deviation norm (WLSDN) and the weighted minimax deviation norm (WMDN) approaches. The extension of the general approach to group decision-making and the choice of decision parameters are also discussed. A numerical example is examined to show the applications of the proposed MADM approaches. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
