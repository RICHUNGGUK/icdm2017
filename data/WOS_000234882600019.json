A feedback control gain matrix is derived to achieve the exponential synchronization of the drive-response structure of neural networks by using the Lyapunov stability theory, and its exponential synchronization condition can be verified if a certain Hamiltonian matrix with no eigenvalues on the imaginary axis. This condition can avoid solving an algebraic Riccati equation. Both the cellular neural networks and Hopfield neural networks with time-varying delays are given as examples for illustration.", "paper_title": "Exponential synchronization of a class of neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000234882600019"}
