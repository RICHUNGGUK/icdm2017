Partial models address this by being able to precisely represent uncertainty about model content. In previous work, we developed a general approach for defining partial models and using them to reason about design models containing uncertainty. In this paper, we show how to apply our approach to managing uncertainty in requirements by providing support for uncertainty capture, elaboration, and change. In particular, we address the problem of specifying uncertainty within a requirements model, refining a model as uncertainty reduces, providing meaning to traceability relations between models containing uncertainty, and propagating uncertainty-reducing changes between related models. We describe the implementation of uncertainty management within the Model Management Tool Framework and illustrate our approach using two examples.", "paper_title": "Managing requirements uncertainty with partial models", "paper_id": "WOS:000320445600002"}
