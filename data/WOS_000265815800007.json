Effective solutions to counter the threat represented by such programs are therefore required. In this work, we present MosaHIP, a Mosaic-based Human Interactive Proof (HIP), which is able to prevent massive automated access to web resources. Properties of the proposed solution grant an improved security over usual text-based and image-based HIPS, whereas the user-friendliness of the system alleviates the user from the discomfort of typing any text before accessing to a web content. Experimental evidence of the effectiveness of the proposed technique is given by submitting our system to a series of tests simulating possible bot attacks. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
