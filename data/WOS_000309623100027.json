Based on the boundary simulation method and trie-tree data structure, this paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm to solve constrained multi-objective optimization problems (CMOPs). To validate our approach, a series of constrained multi-objective optimization problems are examined, and we compare the test results with those of the well-known NSGA-II algorithm, which is representative of the state of the art in this area. The numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method can clearly simulate the Pareto front for the problems under consideration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
