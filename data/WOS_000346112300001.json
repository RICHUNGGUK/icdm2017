Design/methodology/approach - This study introduces and defines the construct of ELBS, provides an empirical validation of the construct and its underlying dimensionality, develops a generic ELBS instrument with desirable psychometric properties, and investigates the instrument's theoretical and practical applications. Findings - After analyzing data from a calibration sample (n = 238) and a validation sample (n = 226), this study proposes a five-factor, 20-item ELBS instrument. Practical implications - This empirically validated instrument will be useful to researchers in terms of developing and testing blog-based learning theories, as well as to educators in terms of understanding students' ELBS and promoting the use of blog-based learning systems. Originality/value - This study is a pioneering effort to develop and validate a multi-dimensional instrument to measure ELBS.", "paper_title": "The measurement and dimensionality of e-learning blog satisfaction Two-stage development and validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000346112300001"}
