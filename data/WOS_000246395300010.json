The upper level consists of a number of folds which will generate the high contrast ( ridge) areas with a dictionary of shading primitives ( for 2D images) and fold primitives (for 3D depth maps). These primitives are represented in parametric forms and are learned in a supervised learning phase using 3D surfaces of clothes acquired through photometric stereo. The lower level consists of the remaining flat areas which fill between the folds with a smoothness prior ( Markov random field). We show that the classical ill-posed problem - shape from shading (SFS) can be much improved by this two-level model for its reduced dimensionality and incorporation of middle-level visual knowledge, i.e., the dictionary of primitives. Given an input image, we first infer the folds and compute a sketch graph using a sketch pursuit algorithm as in the primal sketch [ 10], [ 11]. The 3D folds are estimated by parameter fitting using the fold dictionary and they form the \"skeleton\" of the drapery/ cloth surfaces. Then, the lower level is computed by conventional SFS method using the fold areas as boundary conditions. The two levels interact at the final stage by optimizing a joint Bayesian posterior probability on the depth map. We show a number of experiments which demonstrate more robust results in comparison with state-of-the-art work. In a broader scope, our representation can be viewed as a two-level inhomogeneous MRF model which is applicable to general shape-from- X problems. Our study is an attempt to revisit Marr's idea [23] of computing the 2 1/2 D sketch from primal sketch. In a companion paper [ 2], we study shape from stereo based on a similar two-level generative sketch representation.", "paper_title": "A two-level generative model for cloth representation and shape from shading", "paper_id": "WOS:000246395300010"}
