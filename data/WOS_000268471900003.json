We present the first formulation to beat this bound, one that uses O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2)) variables and O(vertical bar V vertical bar(3)) constraints. An immediate consequence of our result is a compact linear relaxation with O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2)) constraints and O(vertical bar V vertical bar(3)) variables for enforcing global connectivity constraints. This relaxation is as strong as standard cut-based relaxations and has applications in solving traveling salesman problems by integer programming as well as finding approximate solutions for survivable network design problems using Jain's iterative rounding method. Another application is a polynomial-time verifiable certificate of size n for for the NP-complete problem of l(1)-embeddability of a rational metric on an n-set (as opposed to a certificate of size n(2) known previously).", "paper_title": "Compacting Cuts: A New Linear Formulation for Minimum Cut", "paper_id": "WOS:000268471900003"}
