A penalty-based edge assembly memetic algorithm for the vehicle routing problem with time windows, Computers & Operations Research 2010;37(4): 724-37 yields incorrect results. We derive the corrected proposition and use numerical studies to show that a significant proportion of the evaluations performed by a Tabu Search for VRPTW falls under the two incorrect cases. Moreover, we demonstrate that the incorrect time window handling has a significant negative impact on the solution quality of the Tabu Search. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
