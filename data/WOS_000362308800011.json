The model is empirically tested with system record data collected from a large telecommunications company. Testing results illustrate that social capital factors have significant impacts on continued reading behavior but that part of their influence is subject to the moderation effects of workgroup characteristics. The findings of this study contribute to the literature on intra-organizational social networking and contain helpful managerial implications for related practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
