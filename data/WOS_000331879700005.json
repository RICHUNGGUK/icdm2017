The methodology attempts to enhance communication and collaboration between different disciplines through introducing the universal notion of satisfaction and expressing the holistic behavior of multidisciplinary systems using the notion of energy. Throughout the design process, it uses fuzzy logic to formalize subjective aspects of design including the impact of the designer's attitude, resulting in the simplification of the multi-objective constrained optimization process. In the final phase, the methodology adjusts the designer's subjective attitude based on a holistic system performance by utilizing an energy-based model of multidisciplinary systems. The efficiency of the resulting design framework is illustrated by improving the design of a 5-degree-of-freedom industrial robot manipulator.", "paper_title": "A holistic approach to concurrent engineering and its application to robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000331879700005"}
