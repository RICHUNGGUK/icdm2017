Polynomial complexity bounds under both the real and the binary computation models are derived when the dimension of the polytope is fixed and the given LP algorithm is polynomial.", "paper_title": "The use of edge-directions and linear programming to enumerate vertices", "paper_id": "WOS:000248864800006"}
