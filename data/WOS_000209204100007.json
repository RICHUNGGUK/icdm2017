An approach for ranking all objects in this system is constructed consequently, and decision makers can find objects with better property to make an useful and effective decision. In addition, the rough set approach to lattice-valued information systems based on dominance relation is established. And evidence theories in this system are formulated for the analysis of lattice-valued information systems based on dominance relation. What is more, in order to acquire concise knowledge representation and extract much simpler decision rules, the methods of attribute reductions based on discernibility matrix and evidence theory are investigated carefully. These results will be helpful for decision-making analysis in lattice-valued information systems based on dominance relation.", "paper_title": "Lattice-valued information systems based on dominance relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204100007"}
