However, because users often deploy social network platforms in a public network setting, a common concern remains about how to guarantee privacy for photo sharing. Although most platforms aim to protect such privacy, few are able to reach the goal. This work focuses on an interesting potential privacy risk, called the deletion delay of photo sharing, by pinpointing and investigating the risk's existence in some well-known social network platforms.", "paper_title": "Privacy Concerns for Photo Sharing in Online Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351774200008"}
