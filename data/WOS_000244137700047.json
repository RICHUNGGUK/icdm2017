Conventional image classification methods use flat image features with fixed dimensions, which are extracted from a whole image. Such features are computationally effective but are crude representation of the image content. This paper proposes a new image classification approach through a tree-structured feature set. In this approach, the image content is organized in a two-level tree, where the root node at the top level represents the whole image and the child nodes at the bottom level represent the homogeneous regions of the image. The tree-structured representation combines both the global and the local features through the root and the child nodes. The tree-structured feature data are then processed by a two-level self-organizing map (SOM), which consists of an unsupervised SOM for processing image regions and a supervising concurrent SOM (CSOM) classifier for the overall classification of images. The proposed method incorporates both global image features and local region-based features to improve the performance of image classification. Experimental results show that this approach performs better than conventional approaches. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
