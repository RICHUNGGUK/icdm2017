Rather than using the traditional portmanteau tests based on the sample autocorrelation function, we propose a test based on the Cauchy estimator of correlation. A goodness-of-fit statistic for fitted autoregressive moving average models is also derived and the asymptotic distribution of this statistic is quantified. The test can be employed using either this asymptotic distribution or by using Monte-Carlo quantiles. The small sample behaviour is studied via simulation and the Monte-Carlo-based test seems to be more precise. The method is demonstrated on monthly asset returns for Facebook, Incorporated.", "paper_title": "A Cauchy estimator test for autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347703300012"}
