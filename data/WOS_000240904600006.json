We present an approach for robot's action selection in the robot soccer domain using Case-Based Reasoning techniques. A case represents a snapshot of the game at time t and the actions the robot should perform in that situation. We basically focus our work on the retrieval and reuse steps of the system, presenting the similarity functions and a planning process to adapt the current problem to a case. We present first results of the performance of the system under simulation and the analysis of the parameters used in the approach.", "paper_title": "Retrieving and reusing game plays for robot soccer", "paper_id": "WOS:000240904600006"}
