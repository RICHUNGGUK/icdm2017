Rule mining, however, becomes interesting in large databases, where the problem of boundary cases is less apparent and can be further suppressed by using sensible partitioning methods. A data-driven approach is used to investigate if there is a significant difference between quantitative and fuzzy association rules in large databases. The influence of the choice of a particular triangular norm in this respect is also examined.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy versus quantitative association rules: A fair data-driven comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000238069200017"}
