The classifier, known as pSOM-kMER (probabilistic SOM-kMER), is able to operate in a probabilistic environment and to implement the principles of statistical decision theory in undertaking classification problems. A distinctive feature of pSOM-kMER is its ability in revealing the underlying structure of data. In addition, the Receptive Field (RF) regions generated can be used for variable kernel and non-parametric density estimation. Empirical evaluation using benchmark datasets shows that pSOM-kMER is able to achieve good performance as compared with those from a number of machine learning systems. The applicability of the proposed model as a useful data classifier is also demonstrated with a real-world medical data classification problem.", "paper_title": "An artificial neural network classifier design based-on variable kernel and non-parametric density estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253529100004"}
