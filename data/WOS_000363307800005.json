We established an implemental system in this study, using Wikipedia's Wiki platform, Radio Aporee, and Panoramio, with which users can participate in life archiving and getting knowledge through a data-sharing-and-collecting platform. Users contribute and interact with the data, enabling conceptualisation of the production of knowledge as a relative process involving interdependent correlations of human knowledge. The scope is opened up for live archiving, integration with wide data sources, and the breaking down of the barriers of knowledge, and a new sense of materiality, meaning, audienceship, and authorship is provoked. We demonstrate our system with a case study presentation of Tai-Pin Old Street in Taiwan.", "paper_title": "Media mediocracy: live archiving as an intervention in preserving cultural heritage", "paper_id": "WOS:000363307800005"}
