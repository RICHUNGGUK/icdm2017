To show the application of the proposed approach, the selection of a proper strategy for an information technology project within a service company is presented. A set of decision parameters is defined, by considering both internal and external environments of the organization. The necessary qualitative and judgmental data from different sub-systems of the organization is collected. Next, using the TOPSIS multiple attribute decision-making method and the Entropy weighting technique, a resistance factor for each recommended strategy is quantified and used next to a set of performance criteria to choose a proper strategy. It is shown that such decision cases, with multiple performance criteria and a behavioral resistance criterion, may be resolved by different decision scenarios. Comparing outcomes of these scenarios can facilitate a better evaluation of the effect of the resistance criterion before making a final decision. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
