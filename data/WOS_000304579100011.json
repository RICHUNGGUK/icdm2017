The interference constraint corresponds to the upper limit of the received power that can be tolerated at the licensed users' due to transmissions from unlicensed users. The QoS guarantees stem from the requirements imposed by the applications running at the users' terminals. A cross-layer design it adopted that maps the user's requirements into delay related QoS guarantees at the data link layer and error probability QoS guarantees at the physical layer. The obtained numerical results provide important insights regarding the impact of the considered constraint and guarantees on the achievable spectral efficiency of cognitive radio networks.
