This model builds upon our previous work on probabilistic event structures. We use the notion of a branching cell for event structures, and show that the latter provides an adequate conception of local state for nets. We prove a Law of Large Numbers (LLN) for Markov nets, which constitutes the main contribution of the paper. This LLN allows for the characterization, in a quantitative way, of the asymptotic behavior of Markov nets. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
