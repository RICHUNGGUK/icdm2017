Assuming an initial three-qubit entangled state that would be decoherence-free for identical qubit positions, allows us to focus on non-Markovian effects of the inevitable spatial qubit separation. It turns out that the coherence is most affected when the qubits are regularly spaced. Moreover, we find that up to a constant scaling factor, two-qubit entanglement is not influenced by the presence of the third qubit, even though all qubits interact via the phonon field.", "paper_title": "Fidelity and entanglement of a spatially extended linear three-qubit register", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400018"}
