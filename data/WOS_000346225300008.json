In this model, an agent's cost consists of its resource's load (which increases with congestion) and its share in the resource's activation cost (which decreases with congestion). The current work studies the convergence rate of best-response dynamics (BRD) in the case of homogeneous agents. Even within this simple setting, interesting phenomena arise. We show that, in contrast to standard congestion games with identical jobs and resources, the convergence rate of BRD under conflicting congestion effects might be super-linear in the number of jobs. Nevertheless, a specific form of BRD is proposed, which is guaranteed to converge in linear time. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
