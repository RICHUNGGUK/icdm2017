In this brief, we drop this constraint and show that their result extends to general Levy noise models. We achieve this by showing that \"large jump\" discontinuities in the noise can be controlled so as to allow the stochastic model to tend to a deterministic one as the noise dissipates to zero. SR then follows by a \"forbidden intervals\" theorem as in Patel and Kosko's paper.", "paper_title": "Extending Stochastic Resonance for Neuron Models to General Levy Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000272484200012"}
