Therefore, this paper proposes a knowledge-based framework for the creative conceptual design of multi-disciplinary systems through reusing and synthesizing known principle solutions in various disciplines together. It comprises a formal constraints-based approach for representing the desired functions, a domain-independent approach for modeling functional knowledge of known principle solutions, and a heterogeneous-object-state-search-based approach for synthesizing known principle solutions together for achieving the desired functions. A design case illustrates that the proposed framework can successfully achieve creative conceptual design of multi-disciplinary systems. A prototype system, called the Intelligent Creative Conceptual Design Platform, is implemented based on this framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
