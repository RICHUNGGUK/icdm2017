The starting point is to impose a curvilinear coordinate system, named the Darcyan coordinate system, on facial surfaces; it is based on the level curves of the surface distance function measured from the tip of the nose. Each facial surface is now represented as an indexed collection of these level curves. The task of finding optimal deformations, or geodesic paths, between facial surfaces reduces to that of finding geodesics between level curves, which is accomplished using the theory of elastic shape analysis of 3D curves. The elastic framework allows for nonlinear matching between curves and between points across curves. The resulting geodesics between facial surfaces provide optimal elastic deformations between faces and an elastic metric for comparing facial shapes. We demonstrate this idea using examples from FSU face database.", "paper_title": "Elastic Shape Models for Face Analysis Using Curvilinear Coordinates", "paper_id": "WOS:000263146200011"}
