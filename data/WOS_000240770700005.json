Phishing scams have been receiving extensive press coverage because such attacks have been escalating in number and sophistication. According to a study by Gartner, 57 million US Internet users have identified the receipt of email linked to phishing scams and similar to 2 million of them are estimated to have been tricked into giving away sensitive information. This paper presents a novel browser extension, AntiPhish, that aims to protect users against spoofed web site-based phishing attacks. To this end, AntiPhish tracks the sensitive information of a user and generates warnings whenever the user attempts to give away this information to a web site that is considered untrusted.", "paper_title": "Protecting users against phishing attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240770700005"}
