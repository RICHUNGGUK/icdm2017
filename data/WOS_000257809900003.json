We consider XML views defined in terms of mappings directed by possibly recursive DTDs compressed into DAGs and stored in relations. We provide new techniques to efficiently support XML view updates specified in terms of XPath expressions with recursion and complex filters. The interaction between XPath recursion and DAG compression of XML views makes the analysis of the XML view update problem rather intriguing. Furthermore, many issues are still open even for relational view updates, and need to be explored. In response to these, on the XML side, we revise the notion of side effects and update semantics based on the semantics of XML views, and present efficient algorithms to translate XML updates to relational view updates. On the relational side, we propose a mild condition on SPJ views, and show that under this condition the analysis of deletions on relational views becomes PTIME while the insertion analysis is NP-complete. We develop an efficient algorithm to process relational view deletions, and a heuristic algorithm to handle view insertions. Finally, we present an experimental study to verify the effectiveness of our techniques.", "paper_title": "Updating recursive XML views of relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000257809900003"}
