Each job is processed through the two production stages in series, each of which has multiple identical parallel machines. The problem is to determine the allocation of jobs to the parallel machines as well as the sequence of the jobs assigned to each machine. To solve the problem, a branch and bound algorithm, which incorporates the methods to obtain the lower and upper bounds as well as the dominance properties to reduce the search space, is suggested that gives the optimal solutions. In addition, two-phase heuristic algorithms are suggested to obtain good solutions for large-size problems within a reasonable amount of computation time. To show the performances of the optimal and heuristic algorithms suggested in this paper, computational experiments are done on a number of randomly generated test problems, and the test results are reported.
