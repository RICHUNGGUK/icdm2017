Recently, the advantages of in-network caching in Internet have been widely investigated, for example, speeding up content distribution and improving network resource utilization. In this paper, we analyze the energy-delay tradeoff problem in the context of single base station (BS), which has a cache capacity to buffer the contents through it. Although additional power is consumed by the cache, work load of BS and network delay will be improved, which makes a tradeoff between network power consumption and delay. Simulation results reveal that, by introducing the cache in a BS, the network power and delay can be obviously reduced in different network conditions compared to the scenario without a cache. In addition, we find that a large cache size does not always mean a less network cost because of the more cache power consumption.", "paper_title": "Modeling Energy-Delay Tradeoffs in Single Base Station with Cache", "paper_id": "WOS:000363576800001"}
