Special attention is paid to investigate the effect of the spacing between the five cylinders on the wake structure and vortex shedding mechanism. The simulations are performed for the separation ratios (spacing to size ratio) of 1.2, 2,3 and 4. Depending on the separation ratio the following flow patterns are observed: a flip-flopping pattern, in-phase and anti-phase synchronized pattern and non-synchronized pattern. These flow patterns are supposed to be a consequence of the interaction between two types of frequencies viz. the vortex shedding (primary) and the cylinder interaction (secondary) frequencies. At small separation ratio the flow is predominantly characterized by the jet in the gaps between successive cylinders and the secondary frequencies play a role in the resulting chaotic flow. On the contrary, at higher separation ratio the secondary frequencies almost disappear and the resulting flow becomes more synchronized dominated by the primary frequency. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
