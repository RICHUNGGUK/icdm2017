The purpose of this paper is to develop a new approach to give a best estimation of these forces. Design/methodology/approach - A model is developed to calculate the distribution of local forces using the virtual work principle in finite element context including ferromagnetic hysteresis. The forces are calculated using a formulation based on the energy derivation. The nonlinear behaviour of ferromagnetic material is considered by combining a Jiles-Atherton model and finite element method through the fixed-point iterative technique. Findings - The effects of accurate behaviour of magnetic material are not always taken into account when calculating the local forces in electromagnetic devices. The introduction of hysteresis phenomenon in the analysed device gives a good prediction of niagnetic induction. The expression used to compute the force includes an integral which is estimated numerically and not a constant term. Originality/value - The developed approach is more accurate than the classical methods using constant magnetic permeability or a first magnetization curve.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of magnetic forces in an induction machine with dual stator winding taking 172 into account hysteresis model", "paper_id": "WOS:000288567800012"}
