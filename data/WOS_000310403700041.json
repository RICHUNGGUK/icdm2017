The most conventional measurement error models are based on either linear mixed models (LMMs) or GLMMs. Even without the measurement error, the frequentist analysis of LMM, and particularly of GLMM, is computationally difficult. On the other hand, Bayesian analysis of LMM and GLMM is computationally convenient in both cases without and with the measurement error. Recent introduction of the method of data cloning has made frequentist analysis of mixed models also equally computationally convenient. As an application of data cloning, we conduct a frequentist analysis of GLMM with covariates subject to the measurement error model. The performance of the proposed approach which yields the maximum likelihood estimation is evaluated by two important real data types, Normal and logistic linear mixed measurement error models, and also through simulation studies.
