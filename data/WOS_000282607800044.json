To seek the optimal parameters of Wg-SVM, modified genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to optimize parameters of Wg-SVM. The results of application in load forecasts show that the forecasting approach based on the Wg-SVM model is effective and feasible, the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given, which proves this method is better than other SVM methods.
