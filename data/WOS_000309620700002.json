So far multiple output bent functions F : GF(2)(n) -> GF(2)(m) (where is is even and m <= n/2), for any particular class of Boolean bent functions, has been generated using a suitable collection of m Boolean bent functions so that any nonzero linear combination of these functions is again bent. Here, we take a different approach by deriving these functions directly from the known classes of so-called monomial trace bent functions. We derive a sufficient condition for a bent Boolean function of the form f (x) = Tr-n(1) (lambda x(d)) so that the associated mapping F(x) = Tr-m(n) (lambda x(d)), where F : GF(2)(n) -> GF(2)(m), is a multiple output bent function. We consider all the main cases of monomial trace bent functions and specify the restrictions on lambda and m that yield multiple output bent functions F (x) = Tr-n(m) (lambda x(d)). Interestingly enough, in one particular case when n = 4r, d = (2(r) + 1)(2), a multiple bent function F (x) = Tr-2r(n)(ax(d)) could not be obtained by considering a collection of 2r Boolean bent functions of the form fi(x) = Tr-1(n)(lambda(i)x(d)) for some suitable coefficients lambda(i) epsilon GF(2(n)).
