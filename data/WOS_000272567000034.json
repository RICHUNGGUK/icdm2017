The It value with Sharpe ratio (HVSR) and Sharpe index are separately adopted to choose stocks. The PSO and CA are applied to these stocks in search for the optimal capital allocation for constructing equity portfolios. Comparing with the results of annual return in all periods, our research model(HVSR) is better than Sharpe ratio. The research also compares the returns of the Equity Portfolios with that of Taiwan Weighted Stock Index (TWSI) and that of the best return of equity fund (the Best Equity Fund). The results show that, the portfolio performance constructed by PSO is better than that of GA. In fact, the performance is superior to that of the existing best stock fund rate of return in Taiwan Funds Market and TWSI.", "paper_title": "A PERFORMANCE COMPARISON BETWEEN GENETIC ALGORITHMS AND PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION APPLIED IN CONSTRUCTING EQUITY PORTFOLIOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000034"}
