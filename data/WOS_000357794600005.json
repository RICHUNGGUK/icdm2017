However, key aspects of OSS such as the determinants of project success and motivations of developers in joining these projects are not well understood. Based on organizational theory, we propose that OSS activities of patch development and feature request can be classified as exploitation (implementation-oriented) and exploration (innovation-oriented) activities, respectively. We empirically examine how the structure of social network affects the success of patch-development and feature-request networks in OSS projects, using a data set collected from the SourceForge database. Our results provide empirical support for the view that patch development and feature request are exploitation and exploration activities, respectively. Network structures differ due to team formation differences and have a differential impact on development success based on the type of activity. The concepts of ambidextrous developers and ambidexterity are explored in the context of OSS projects. Collectively, our results indicate that studying OSS projects at the artifact level could improve our understanding of OSS project success and team formation. This, in turn, could lead to better management of OSS projects.", "paper_title": "Exploitation and Exploration Networks in Open Source Software Development: An Artifact-Level Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000357794600005"}
