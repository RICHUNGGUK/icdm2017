The path planning task is first transformed into an optimal curve matching problem. The objective in the optimisation is represented as a weighted sum of the errors induced by overcut and undercut, respectively. Particle swarm optimisation algorithms are then applied to search for the optimal solutions and the corresponding tool paths. Running the algorithms multiple times generates a multi-pass tool path that progressively reduces machining errors. Different optimised results can be obtained for each pass by properly adjusting the weights in the objective. Numerical results indicate that the proposed method produces smaller machining errors compared to traditional planning of a single tool path. It offers a planning flexibility that has never been realised by previous studies.", "paper_title": "Multi-pass progressive tool path planning in five-axis flank milling by particle swarm optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000326352600008"}
