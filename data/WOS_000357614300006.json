Our technique is based on a local nonlinear fusion of several image estimates, all obtained by applying a chosen reconstruction algorithm with different values of its control parameters. Usually such output images have different bias/variance trade-off. The fusion of the images is performed by feed-forward neural network trained on a set of known examples. Numerical experiments show an improvement in reconstruction quality relatively to existing direct and iterative reconstruction methods.", "paper_title": "Spatially-Adaptive Reconstruction in Computed Tomography Using Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000357614300006"}
