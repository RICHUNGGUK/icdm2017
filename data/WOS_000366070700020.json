Derivation of smooth path is one of important subjects for vehicle navigation system. Bezier curve is a smooth parametric curve, but adequate assignment of its control points that determine the shape of Bezier curve is not a simple problem. In the proposed method, first nth-order base Bezier curve in N-dimension is derived with the end point constraints (location and velocity). As a next step, path modification is done by using constrained optimization with designated via-points. The presented method is tested by several calculation experiments in case of 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional path. The results are shown and discussed in this paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
