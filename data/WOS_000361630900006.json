In order to process spatial queries using the cloud, it has to be able to store and process the large amount of geographical data. After that, the Geographic Information System (GIS) provides such ability to manage large volume of geographical data. Then for two common spatial queries, kNN and range queries, both of them are used for finding the interesting objects around a given location. The same point between them is that they both highly rely on their locations provided by the location services. However, according to the existing technology of location services, it fails to provide the location information with 100 % accuracy. Hence, we propose Range- kNN queries in order to solve this problem. For our algorithm, it enables user to input an irregular shape as the query range. Then the query result is retrieved based on the distances between the objects and the query range. In the evaluation part, our algorithm is proved to be increase the result accuracy without significantly increasing the extra computational cost.", "paper_title": "Enhanced range search with objects outside query range", "paper_id": "WOS:000361630900006"}
