This article deals with transition system-like system models and controllers that base their decisions on the observables of the actions performed so far. We present a framework for the compositional construction of controllers for conjunctive sequences of linear-time objectives in an online manner. For this approach, it is crucial that the controllers enforce the objectives in a most general manner, being as permissive as possible. We then present game-based algorithms for the construction of such most general controllers for invariance, reachability and omega-regular objectives.", "paper_title": "Compositional construction of most general controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000357447700006"}
