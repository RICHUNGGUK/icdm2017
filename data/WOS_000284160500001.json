This parameter is the most important character of a cable robot since the main application of this kind of robots is their high load carrying capacity. First of all the dynamic equations required for control approach are represented and then the formulation of control approach is driven based on feedback linearization method which is the most suitable control algorithm for nonlinear dynamic systems like robots. This method provides a perfect accuracy and also satisfies the Lyapunov stability since any desired pole placement can be achieved by using suitable gain for controller. Flexible joint cable robot is also analyzed in this paper and its stability is ensured by implementing robust control for the designed control system. DLCC of the robot is calculated considering motor torque constrain and accuracy constrain. Finally a simulation study is done for two samples of rigid cable robot, a planar complete constrained sample with three cables and 2 degrees of freedom and a spatial unconstrained case with six cables and 6 degrees of freedom. Simulation studies continue with the same spatial robot but flexible joint characteristics. Not only the DLCC of the mentioned robots are calculated but also required motors torque and desired angular velocity of the motors are calculated in the closed loop condition for a predefined trajectory. The effectiveness of the designed controller is shown by the aid of simulation results as well as comparison between rigid and flexible systems.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Load Carrying Capacity of Flexible Cable Suspended Robot: Robust Feedback Linearization Control Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000284160500001"}
