The theory behind this approach was based on empirical data produced from a prototype version of these units, which illustrated high stability. The implementation of this system into the Pavlovian learning model, is one example and possibly a first step in illustrating, and at the same time discovering its potential as a computing processor.", "paper_title": "Biological computing using perfusion anodophile biofilm electrodes (PABE)", "paper_id": "WOS:000258954300004"}
