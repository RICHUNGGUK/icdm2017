Most of the previous works on plantar lesion identification employed the analysis of biomechanical microenvironment variables like pressure and thermal fields. This paper focuses on foot kinematics and applies kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) for nonlinear dimensionality reduction of features, followed by Fisher's linear discriminant analysis for the classification of patients with different types of foot lesions, in order to establish an association between foot motion and lesion formation. Performance comparisons are made using leave-one-out cross-validation. Results show that the proposed method can lead to similar to 94% correct classification rates, with a reduction of feature dimensionality from 2100 to 46, without any manual preprocessing or elaborate feature extraction methods. The results imply that foot kinematics contain information that is highly relevant to pathology classification and also that the nonlinear KPCA approach has considerable power in unraveling abstract biomechanical features into a relatively low-dimensional pathology-relevant space.", "paper_title": "Automated Nonlinear Feature Generation and Classification of Foot Pressure Lesions", "paper_id": "WOS:000275666100029"}
