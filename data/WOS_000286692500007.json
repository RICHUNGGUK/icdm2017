The applications of wireless sensor networks are widely used today in battlefield guard, circumstance monitor, and traffic analysis. Sensor network often carries on mission-critical tasks. Thus, security in sensor network is vital. Wormhole attack may threat the availability of networks by dropping data randomly or disturbing routing path. In this paper, a group-based deployment is proposed to prevent wormhole attack. Sensors are deployed by groups and are aware of their own group location where the group of sensors will be located and no exact location is known in advance. Group location will be exchanged among sensors during routing path establishment and a link between two sensors will be built only when the distance of two sensor's group location is close enough. The proposed approach to prevent wormhole is novel and efficient, using only the group location information and no any special hardware is needed.", "paper_title": "A Group-Based Deployment for Wormhole Prevention in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286692500007"}
