They do not fully benefit from the dependency between modalities. Exploiting this dependency at the early stage is more effective than the later stage. Early fusion data contains richer information about the input biometric than the compressed features or matching scores. We propose an image recombination for face recognition that explores the dependency between modalities at the image level. Facial cues from the 2D and 3D images are recombined into a more independent and discriminating data by finding transformation axes that account for the maximal amount of variances in the images. We also introduce a complete framework of multimodal 2D + 3D face recognition that utilizes the 2D and 3D facial information at the enrollment, image and score levels. Experimental results based on NTU-CSP and Bosphorus 3D face databases show that our face recognition system using image recombination outperforms other face recognition systems based on the pixel- or score-level fusion.
