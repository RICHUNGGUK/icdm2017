Using this method, each particle is discretized into a finite element mesh. The potential fracture paths are represented by pre-inserted cohesive interface elements (CIEs) with a progressive damage model. The Mohr-Coulomb model with a tension cut-off is employed as the damage initiation criterion to rupture the predominant failure mode occurs at the particle scale. Two series of biaxial tests were simulated for both the breakable and unbreakable particle assemblies. The two assemblies have identical configurations, with the exception that the former is inserted with CIEs and is breakable. The simulated stress-strain-dilation responses obtained for both assemblies are in agreement with experimental observations. We present a comprehensive study of the role of particle breakage on the mechanical behavior of rockfill materials at both the macroscopic and microscopic scales. The underlying mechanism of particle breakage can be explained by the force chain in the assemblies. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
