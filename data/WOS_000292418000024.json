Validation is carried out by comparison between the computed prediction and experimental data of water waves generated by a two dimensional triangular rigid body and by a deformable granular mass sliding into water. The calculated results show that the simulations agree well with experimental observation illustrating the potential of the proposed scheme. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
