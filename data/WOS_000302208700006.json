SPMs represent Surgical Processes (SPs) which are formalized as symbolic structured descriptions of surgical interventions using a pre-defined level of granularity and a dedicated terminology. In this context, one major challenge is the creation of new metrics for the comparison and the evaluation of SPs. Thus, correlations between these metrics and pre-operative data are used to classify surgeries and highlight specific information on the surgery itself and on the surgeon, such as his/her level of expertise. In this paper, we explore the automatic classification of a set of SPs based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm. DTW is used to compute a similarity measure between two SPs that focuses on the different types of activities performed during surgery and their sequencing, by minimizing time differences. Indeed, it turns out to be a complementary approach to the classical methods that only focus on differences in the time and the number of activities. Experiments were carried out on 24 lumbar disk herniation surgeries to discriminate the surgeons level of expertise according to a prior classification of SPs. Supervised and unsupervised classification experiments have shown that this approach was able to automatically identify groups of surgeons according to their level of expertise (senior and junior), and opens many perspectives for the creation of new metrics for comparing and evaluating surgeries.
