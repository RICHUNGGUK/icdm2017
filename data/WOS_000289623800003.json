In this paper we enrich this calculus with a type discipline which preserves some biological properties depending on the minimum and the maximum number of elements of some type requested by the present elements. The type system enforces these properties and typed reductions guarantee that evolution preserves them. As an example, we model the hemoglobin structure and the equilibrium between cell death and division: typed reductions prevent undesirable behaviors.", "paper_title": "ENUMERATED TYPE SEMANTICS FOR THE CALCULUS OF LOOPING SEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000289623800003"}
