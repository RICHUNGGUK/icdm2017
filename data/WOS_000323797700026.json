Their biological activity as antiandrogens in the context of the development of treatments for castration resistant prostate cancer was evaluated using in vitro time resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence polarization on target assays. Additionally, a theoretical study combining docking and molecular dynamics methods was performed to provide insight into their mechanism of action as a basis for further lead optimization studies.", "paper_title": "Structure-Activity Relationships in Non-Ligand Binding Pocket (Non-LBP) Diarylhydrazide Antiandrogens", "paper_id": "WOS:000323797700026"}
