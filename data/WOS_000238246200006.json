To this aim, a transformation of the search space that preserves APIs vectorial moves is introduced. Experiments are conducted with various temporal series extracted from images.", "paper_title": "An exponential representation in the API algorithm for hidden Markov models training", "paper_id": "WOS:000238246200006"}
