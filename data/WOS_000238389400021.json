In recent years, however, we have moved away from this towards project based approaches. In this paper we discuss our attempts to structure a course in parallel systems around a group project that required the students design, build and evaluate their own message passing environment.", "paper_title": "A project based approach to teaching parallel systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400021"}
