The prediction of the compressor operating range is thus a key parameter for the design of gas turbines. This paper investigates the ability of an unsteady flow solver to simulate the rotating stall phenomenon in the full annulus of an axial compressor stage. A comparison with experimental data indicates that the simulation correctly estimates the stability limit. However the rotating stall flow patterns are different. While measurements show only one full span rotating stall cell (40 Hz), the simulation shows first a part span stall with 10 cells (790 Hz) that evolves then towards a full span stall with three cells (170 Hz). A spectral analysis based on numerical results underlines the role of rotor-stator interactions in the development of rotating stall. The effects of downstream volumes and inlet distortions are also discussed, showing the necessity to consider the whole geometry to correctly predict the rotating stall frequency.
