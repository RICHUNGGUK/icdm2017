The DkS problem is NP-hard even for special graph classes including bipartite, planar, comparability and chordal graphs, while no constant approximation algorithm is known for any of these classes. In this paper we present a 3-approximation algorithm for the class of chordal graphs. The analysis of our algorithm is based on a graph theoretic lemma of independent interest. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.
