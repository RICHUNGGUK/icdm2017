While existing technologies have harvested power from ambient RF sources (e.g.. TV broadcasts), they require a dedicated gateway (like an RFID reader) for Internet connectivity. We present Wi-Fi Backscatter, a novel communication system that bridges RE-powered devices with the Internet. Specifically, we show that it is possible to reuse existing Wi-Fi infrastructure to provide Internet connectivity to RF-powered devices. To show Wi-Fi Backscatter's feasibility, we build a hardware prototype and demonstrate the first communication link between an RE-powered device and commodity Wi-Fi devices. We use off-the-shelf Wi-Fi devices including Intel Wi-Fi cards, Linksys Routers, and our organization's Wi-Fi infrastructure, and achieve communication rates of up to 1 kbps and ranges of up to 2.1 meters. We believe that this new capability can pave the way for the rapid deployment and adoption of RE-powered devices and achieve ubiquitous connectivity via nearby mobile devices that are Wi-Fi enabled.", "paper_title": "Wi-Fi Backscatter: Internet Connectivity for RF-Powered Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600099"}
