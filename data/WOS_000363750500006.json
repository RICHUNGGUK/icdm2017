Nevertheless, our understanding of one of the model's key variables - social influence - remains limited. Drawing upon earlier studies that address the role of referent individuals to technology acceptance, this paper introduces the notion of coalition' as a social group that can affect the opinion of other members within an organisation. Our empirical study centres on an organisation that has recently decided to introduce Big Data into its formal operations. Through a unique empirical approach that analyses sentiments expressed by individuals about this technology on the organisation's online forum, we demonstrate the emergence of a central referent, and in turn the dynamics of a coalition that builds around this referent as the attitudes of individuals converge upon the Big Data issue. Our paper contributes to existing TAM frameworks by elaborating the social influence variable and providing a dynamic lens to the technology acceptance process. We concurrently offer a methodological tool for organisations to understand social dynamics that form about a newly introduced technology and accelerate its acceptance by employees.", "paper_title": "Coalition formation during technology adoption", "paper_id": "WOS:000363750500006"}
