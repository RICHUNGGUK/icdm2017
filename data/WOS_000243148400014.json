The process-planning model (PP model) construct a feature framework that makes a mapping from geometric features into machining operations. A semantic net named the Precedence-Relations-Net is established to reflect the precedence relationships among the machining operations. The vectors and the matrixes are employed to construct a mathematical sequencing model. A part is decomposed into several basic geometrical units, namely, U-1, U-2,..., U-N. For each unit U-i, two vectors, named F-i and P-i, represent the features and machining operations of U-i. Finally, a matrix named PP is used to memorize the process plan, and a matrix-PO (performing objects) - represents the object of machining operations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
