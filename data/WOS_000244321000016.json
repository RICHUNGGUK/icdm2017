The applicability of such simulations is often limited by the time required for calculation, but the use of massive parallelism to accelerate these computations is typically limited by inter-processor communication requirements. Recently, Snir [M. Snir, A note on N-body computations with cutoffs, Theor. Comput. Syst. 37 (2004) 295-318] and Shaw [D.E. Shaw, A fast, scalable method for the parallel evaluation of distance-limited pairwise particle interactions, J. Comput. Chem. 26 (2005) 1318-1328] independently introduced two distinct methods that offer asymptotic reductions in the amount of data transferred between processors. In the present paper, we show that these schemes represent special cases of a more general class of methods, and introduce several new algorithms in this class that offer practical advantages over all previously described methods for a wide range of problem parameters. We also show that several of these algorithms approach an approximate lower bound on inter-processor data transfer. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
