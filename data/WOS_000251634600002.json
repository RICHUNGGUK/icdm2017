This problem is also called the (Delta,D)-problem or the degree/diameter problem for vertex symmetric digraphs. It consists of finding vertex symmetric digraphs with the order as large as possible for a given degree and diameter. This paper proposes a new general family of large vertex symmetric digraphs. This new family has order N=(Delta + [D-1]/2)!/Delta - [D+1]/2)!) and provides the best values for asymptotic values of the degree and diameter in general. Moreover, the presented family also provides a large number of new values in the table of the largest known vertex symmetric (A, D)digraphs. Furthermore, the new family is used to obtain new large vertex symmetric digraphs by means of known compounding techniques. Finally, the table of the largest known vertex symmetric digraphs is provided, where most of the entries correspond to the work presented in this article.
