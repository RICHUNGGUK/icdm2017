In particular, we focus on the weighted maximum cut (WMAXCUT) problem and compare different communication strategies between teams of GES algorithms running in parallel. The results obtained by teams encourage the development of team algorithms. They were significantly better than the algorithmic portfolio (no communication) approach and suggest that the communication between algorithms running in parallel is a promising research direction.", "paper_title": "TEAMS OF GLOBAL EQUILIBRIUM SEARCH ALGORITHMS FOR SOLVING THE WEIGHTED MAXIMUM CUT PROBLEM IN PARALLEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000366801700003"}
