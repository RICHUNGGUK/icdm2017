By using the variational methods, we give some new criteria to guarantee that the impulsive Hamiltonian systems have infinitely many solutions under the assumptions that the nonlinear term satisfies superquadratics, asymptotically quadratic and subquadratics, respectively. Finally, some examples are presented to illustrate our main results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
