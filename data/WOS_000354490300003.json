Most mobile robot tracking techniques that depend on reference RF beacons rely on approximating line-of-sight (LOS) distances between these beacons and the robot. The approximation of LOS is mostly performed using Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements of signals propagating between the robot and RF beacons. However, an accurate mapping between RSS measurements and LOS distance remains a significant challenge and is almost impossible to achieve in an indoor reverberant environment. This paper contributes to the development of a neighboring optimal control strategy where the two major control tasks, trajectory tracking and point stabilization, are solved and treated as a unified manner using RSS measurements emitted from Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) tags. The proposed control scheme is divided into two cascaded phases. The first phase provides the robot's nominal control inputs (speeds) and its trajectory using full-state feedback. In the second phase, we design the neighboring optimal controller, where RSS measurements are used to better estimate the robot's pose by employing an optimal filter. Simulation and experimental results are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed optimal feedback controller for solving the stabilization and trajectory tracking problems using a DDMR.", "paper_title": "RFID-Based Mobile Robot Trajectory Tracking and Point Stabilization Through On-line Neighboring Optimal Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000354490300003"}
