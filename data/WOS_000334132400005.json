P systems have been used to solve computation hard problems, where the execution of each rule is completed in unit time (a global clock is assumed for timing and synchronizing the execution of rules). The assumption that the execution of each rule takes exactly one time unit plays an vital role to make a system working synchronously, and it has also been used to characterize the computational efficiency and time complexity of a system. In this work, we investigate the computation power of P systems without such time assumption. Specifically, we give a time-free solution to SAT problem using P systems with active membranes in the sense that the correctness of the solution does not depend on the precise timing of the involved rules.
