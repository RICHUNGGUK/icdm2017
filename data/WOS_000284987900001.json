In addition, the incorporation of the latest and powerful technologies, based on distributed infrastructure, is also explored for the enhancement of these applications, resulting in complex and entangled systems that pose new issues and challenges, in terms of efficiency, security, mobility, and so on. The goal is to respond to the need for methods and tools for performance analysis and evaluation of current complex collaborative and networking systems and applications. To this direction, this special issue provides latest research on modeling and performance analysis of networking and collaborative systems from different perspectives. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
