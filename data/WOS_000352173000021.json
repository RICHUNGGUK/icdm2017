The critical challenge is to maximize the bandwidth utilization in data gathering and forwarding from sensor nodes to the sink. The main design objective is to utilize the-available bandwidth efficiently. The proposed Bandwidth Efficient Cluster-based Data Aggregation (BECDA) algorithm presents the solution for the effective data gathering with in-network aggregation. It considers the network with heterogeneous nodes in terms of energy and mobile sink to aggregate the data packets. The optimal approach-is achieved by intra and inter-cluster aggregation on the randomly distributed nodes with the variable data generation rate. The proposed algorithm uses the correlation of data within the packet for applying the aggregation function on the data generated by nodes. BECDA shows significant improvement in PDR (67.44% and 26.79%) and throughput (41.25% and 26.16%) as compared to the state-of-the-art solutions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
