This paper studies semi-supervised dimensionality reduction using pairwise constraints. In this setting, domain knowledge is given in the form of pairwise constraint, which specifies whether a pair of instances belongs to the same class (must-link constraint) or different classes (cannot-link constraint). In this paper, a novel semi-supervised dimensionality reduction method called LGS3DR is proposed, which can integrate both local and global topological structures of the data as well as pairwise constraints. The LGS3DR method is effective and has a closed form solution. Experiments on data visualization and face recognition show that LGS3DR is superior to many existing dimensionality reduction methods.", "paper_title": "Integrating local and global topological structures for semi-supervised dimensionality reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000336270600012"}
