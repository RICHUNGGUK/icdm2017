It is based on grammatical inference on strings representing chemical compounds and string edit distance between a chemical compound and a formal grammar generalizing an activity class. In the late 1980s Weininger published a chemical language with a very simple and natural grammar. Recently, the algorithms suitable to process this language have been developed. From modeling of chemical activity with formal grammars and chemical compounds as words, a functionality is derivable to search for \"structural alerts\", that is, molecular substructures and their combinatorial patterns that cause a molecule to have properties of interest. A biodegradability prediction system has been constructed to serve as an example throughout the paper.
