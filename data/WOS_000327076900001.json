As an effective problem-solving method, CBR has been widely applied in various areas. However, the question of whether CBR normally generates creative solutions has not been answered properly according to recent research and thus deserves attention. Consequently, an extensive literature review on CBR applications has been provided in this paper. The results of this literature review are expected to emphasise the importance of creativity in CBR.", "paper_title": "Literature review on the creativity of CBR applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000327076900001"}
