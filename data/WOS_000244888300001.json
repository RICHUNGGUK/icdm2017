Let n = m + r + b. A ham-sandwich geodesic is a shortest path in P between two points on the boundary of P that simultaneously bisects the red points and the blue points. We present an O(n log k)-time algorithm for finding a ham-sandwich geodesic. We also show that this algorithm is optimal in the algebraic computation tree model when parameterizing the running time with respect to n and k.", "paper_title": "Geodesic ham-sandwich cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000244888300001"}
