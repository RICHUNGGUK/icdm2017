These are the basic Radiative Transfer Equation method and the P1 model which are compared with respect to the modeling methodology and their predictive capabilities. For each of these two models, two distinct implementations, the present code and the commercial package Fluent, are compared to a classical analytical solution. A more demanding evaluation using a configuration exhibiting typical complex circuit breaker characteristics is presented with a critical assessment. (c) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
