Semantic technologies are about to play a crucial role in this integrative process. However, cross-company data exchange requires mechanisms to enable fine-grained access control definition and enforcement, preventing unauthorized leakage of confidential data across company borders. Currently available semantic repositories are not sufficiently equipped to satisfy this important requirement. This paper presents an infrastructure for controlled sharing of semantic data between cooperating business partners. First, we motivate the need for access control in semantic data federations by a case study in the industrial service sector. Furthermore, we present an architecture for controlling access to semantic repositories that is based on our newly developed SemForce security service. Finally, we show the practical feasibility of this architecture by an implementation and several performance experiments.
