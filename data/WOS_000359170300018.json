Our privacy security is facing a new round of test. The multimedia big data especially images often carry many secrets or privacy information. How to ensure safety and the authorization of accessing to confidential data becomes a hot problem of urgency in image information processing and transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel symmetrical image encryption algorithm based on skew tent map. Utilizing a new chaos based Line map, the proposed algorithm is suitable for encryption of any size of image. In order to disrupt the correlations between the R, G, B components of the true color image, these three components are encrypted at bit level and operated at the same time. The proposed algorithm realizes fast encryption and decryption of both gray-scale image and color image. In addition, the algorithm can be implemented parallelly because there is no complex sub-block processing operation. Results of various analyses and numerical simulations show that the new algorithm has high security and is suitable for practical image encryption. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
