This class of processes can be characterized by pseudodifferential operators driven by the Wiener process. We refer to these processes as pseudostationary processes and define a concept of space-varying spectral density function using the symbol of the underlying operators. We then derive an analytic filtered-backprojection- and backprojection-filtering-type formulas based on the minimum mean square error criterion for synthetic aperture image reconstruction. The inversion formulas depend on the space-varying spectral density function of target and clutter. We present an algorithm for the simultaneous estimation of target a priori information and reconstruction of SAR images. The algorithm is computationally efficient and can be implemented with the computational complexity of fast-backprojection algorithms. Extensive numerical simulations demonstrate the performance of the method.", "paper_title": "Synthetic Aperture Inversion for Statistically Nonstationary Target and Clutter Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500011"}
