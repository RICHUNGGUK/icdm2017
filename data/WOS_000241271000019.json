Results: The integration of the PrediSi algorithm for the prediction of signal peptides for the Sec-dependent protein export into JVirGel 2.0 allows the exclusion of most exported preproteins from calculated proteomic maps and provides the basis for the calculation of Sec-based secretomes. A tool for the identification of transmembrane helices carrying proteins (JCaMelix) and the prediction of the corresponding membrane proteome was added. Finally, in order to directly compare experimental and calculated proteome data, a function to overlay and evaluate predicted and experimental two-dimensional gels was included.", "paper_title": "JVirGel 2.0: computational prediction of proteomes separated via two-dimensional gel electrophoresis under consideration of membrane and secreted proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271000019"}
