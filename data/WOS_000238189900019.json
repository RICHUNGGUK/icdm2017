Yet art and computation are surprisingly poorly integrated, with most practitioners in one discipline receiving little or no training in the other. In the game industry, this can result in coworkers who can't communicate or managers who don't understand the people they manage. Northwestern University's Animate Arts Program seeks to train liberal artist-technologists who can bridge the art and computation divide-an exercise in both pedagogy and cultural engineering. The aim is to recruit students early in their college careers and provide them with an integrated, team-taught curriculum in the basic principles of new media. The program's ultimate goal is to produce graduates with basic literacy in all the disciplines that underlie new media, regardless of their eventual profession or specialization.", "paper_title": "Evolving the artist-technologist", "paper_id": "WOS:000238189900019"}
