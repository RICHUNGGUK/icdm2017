Consequently, cloud manufacturing has been proposed and has become a hot topic in the past 3 years. Many technologies such as service-oriented architecture, resource virtualisation, service ontology and modelling, service composition and management, and product data integration have been used to build the architecture of cloud manufacturing platforms. In this article, the authors survey the state of the art in the area of cloud manufacturing, identify recent research directions, and discuss potential research opportunities.", "paper_title": "A state-of-the-art survey of cloud manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000345571000001"}
