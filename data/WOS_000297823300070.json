Among the factors that may influence product changes include functional improvements, consumer habits, and the emergence of new technologies. Humans must develop products that impact the environment minimally to ensure sustainable living. This work presents a forecasting novel model to acquire innovative ideas more easily to design eco products, followed by evaluation of whether the new design is more effective than currently available ones in the concept design stage. The innovative approach to solving design problems is based on TRIZ evolution patterns, in which the index system of case-based reasoning connects the innovative idea to cases located in a database to accelerate the process. Finally, simple life cycle assessment is introduced to determine whether if the solution is better for the environment than the currently available ones. A novel eco-innovation concept for a cell phone is also presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
