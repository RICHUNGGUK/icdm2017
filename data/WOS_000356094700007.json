This descriptor is produced from the application of the chromatic methodology to extract features from the LADAR data by applying invariant spatial chromatic processors. The descriptor developed has a high discrimination capability, robust to the effects that disturb LADAR data, and requires less storage space and computational time for recognition. The performance of the proposed LADAR descriptor is evaluated using simulated LADAR data, which are generated from special software called LADAR simulator. The simulation results show high discrimination capability for the new descriptor over the traditional techniques such as Moments descriptor. This Moments descriptor is used to benchmark the results. The results also show the robustness of the proposed descriptor in the presence of noise, low resolution, view change, rotation, translation, and scaling effects.", "paper_title": "Invariant chromatic descriptor for LADAR data processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000356094700007"}
