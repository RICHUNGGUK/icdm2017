The reference is based on MOSFETs that are biased in the weak inversion region to consume nanowatts of power and uses no resistors. The maximum supply current at 3.6 V and at 125A degrees C is 173 nA. It provides a 771 mV voltage reference. A temperature coefficient of 7.5 ppm/A degrees C is achieved at best and 39.5 ppm/A degrees C on average, in a range from -40 to 125A degrees C, as the combined effect of a suppression of the temperature dependence of mobility and the compensation of the threshold voltage temperature variation. Several process parameters affect the performance of the proposed voltage reference circuit, so a process adjustment aimed at correcting errors in the reference voltage caused by these variations is dealt with. The total block area is 0.03 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A sub-1-V, high precision, ultra low-power, process trimmable, resistorless voltage reference with low cost 90-nm standard CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400005"}
