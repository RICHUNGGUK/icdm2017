Fitting the time-dependent concentration profiles obtained during the MCR iterative optimization by a kinetic model convoluted with a parametric description of the IRE the approach benefits of the advantages of both hard- and soft-modeling. The performance of the method is first proven on synthetic data sets with overlap of pure time-dependent concentration and/or spectral profiles and presence of interfering contributions. The method is afterwards applied to the resolution of femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy data probing ultrafast photoinduced processes implied in the photochromism of anils. An excited-state proton transfer appearing in similar to 80 fs is characterized using an instrumental system with a severe influence of the convoluted instrumental response function, defined by a time resolution of similar to 150 fs.
