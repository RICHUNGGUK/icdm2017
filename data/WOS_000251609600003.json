We first of all improve the results of K. Chouinard on codewords of small weight in the codes arising from PG( 2, p), p prime. Chouinard characterized all the codewords up to weight 2p in these codes. Using a particular basis for this code, described by Moorhouse, we characterize all the codewords of weight up to 2p + (p- 1)/2 if p >= 11. We then study the codes arising from PG( 2, q = q(0)(3)). In particular, for q(0) = p prime, p >= 7, we prove that the codes have no codewords with weight in the interval [q + 2, 2q - 1]. Finally, for the codes of PG(2, q), q = p(h), p prime, h >= 4, we present a discrete spectrum for the weights of codewords with weights in the interval [q + 2, 2q - 1]. In particular, we exclude all weights in the interval [3q/ 2, 2q - 1].", "paper_title": "Small weight codewords in the codes arising from Desarguesian projective planes", "paper_id": "WOS:000251609600003"}
