Due to the practical applicability for large systems to obtain a better solution, a meta-heuristic optimization method, DEMO(NS-II) has been chosen as a tool for carrying out the multi-objective optimization of TSEP with the objectives of network adequacy assurance, security, and corridor utilization. Multiple adaptable expansions plans fit for various scenarios are obtained. A notion of an efficient plan out of the available multiple optional adaptable plans is introduced with the help of the LP formulations based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). Further, some novel indices have been evolved to judge the performance efficiency of the plans under consideration. Candidate plans are analyzed using a novel concept of \"commonality\" which defines the core content of multiple plans, giving insight for identifying ranking of new lines with their relative urgency for execution. A sequence for identifying reinforcements in the transmission network for short term TSEP is then proposed. A coordination strategy between different planning utilities to identify inter-utility lines and cross territorial dedicated lines for laying is presented.", "paper_title": "A Holistic Approach for Transmission System Expansion Planning Studies: An Indian Experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000290991900006"}
