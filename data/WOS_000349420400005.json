On the other hand, shrinking feature sizes and reducing power supply voltages also make MPSoCs more susceptible to various reliability threats, such as power/ground (P/G) noises. Power gating is an effective technique to minimize leakage power. However, it also introduces significant P/G noises in MPSoCs. With significant area, power and performance overheads, traditional methods rely on reinforced circuits or fixed protection strategies to reduce P/G noises caused by power gating. In this paper, we propose a systematic approach to actively alleviating P/G noises using the parasitic capacitance of on-chip memories through sensor network on-chip (SENoC). We use the parasitic capacitance of on-chip memories as dynamic decoupling capacitance to suppress P/G noises and develop a detailed HSPICE model for related study. SENoC is developed to not only monitor and report P/G noises, but also coordinate PUs and memories to alleviate such transient threats at run time. Extensive evaluations show that compared with traditional method, our approach saves 12.6%-62.8% energy consumption and achieves 14.3%-69.8% performance improvement for different applications and MPSoCs with different scales. We implement the circuit details of our approach and show its low area and energy consumption overheads.", "paper_title": "Actively Alleviate Power Gating-Induced Power/Ground Noise Using Parasitic Capacitance of On-Chip Memories in MPSoC", "paper_id": "WOS:000349420400005"}
