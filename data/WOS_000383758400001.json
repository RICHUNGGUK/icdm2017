The paper introduces an effective feature selection algorithm called Temporal Constraint based on Feature Selection algorithm and also proposes a classification algorithm called hybrid decision tree. This hybrid decision tree has been developed by extending the Enhanced C4.5 algorithm an existing decision tree based classifier. Furthermore, the experiments conducted on the sample Cloud Intrusion Detection Datasets (CIDD) show that the proposed cloud intrusion detection system provides better detection accuracy than the existing work and reduces the false positive rate.", "paper_title": "A Novel Cloud Intrusion Detection System Using Feature Selection and Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000383758400001"}
