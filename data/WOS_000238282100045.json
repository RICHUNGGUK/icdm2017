As the main limitation of IEC is human fatigue, an alternate implementation that requires a reduced amount of human interaction is proposed. The method is applied to a multi-objective genetic algorithm, with the human in a supervisory role, providing evaluation only every n(th)-generation. Human interaction is applied to the evolution process by means of Pareto-rank shifting for the fitness calculation used in selection. The results of a test on 13 users shows that this IEC method can produce statistically significant better MEMS resonators than fully automated non-interactive evolutionary approaches.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary synthesis of micromachines using supervisory multiobjective interactive evolutionary computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100045"}
