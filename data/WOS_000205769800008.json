There is a recent trend to deal with this problem by introducing mobile elements (sensors or sink nodes) in the network. The majority of these approaches assume time-driven scenarios and/or single-hop communication between participating nodes. However, there lire several real-life applications for which an event-based and multi-hop operation is more appropriate. In this paper we propose to adaptively move the sink node inside the covered region, according to the evolution of current events, so its to minimize the energy consumption incurred by the multi-hop transmission of the event-related data. Both analytical and simulation results are given For two optimization strategies: minimizing the overall energy consumption, and minimizing the maximum load on a specific sensor respectively. We show that by adaptively moving the sink, significant power saving can be achieved, prolonging the lifetime of the network.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Sink Mobility in Event-Driven Densely Deployed Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000205769800008"}
