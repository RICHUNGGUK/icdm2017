This paper presents an adaptive neural control scheme for such a task using fuzzy logic and neural networks. The control scheme estimates motor commands from trajectories of flesh-points on selected articulators. These motor commands are then used to reproduce the trajectories of the underlying articulators in a 2nd order dynamical system. Initial experiments show that the control scheme is able to manipulate the mass-spring based elastic tract walls in a 2-dimensional articulatory synthesizer and to realize efficient speech motor control. The proposed controller achieves high accuracy during on-line tracking of the lips, the tongue, and the jaw in the simulation of consonant-vowel sequences. It also offers salient features such as generality and adaptability for future developments of control models in articulatory synthesis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
