A solution is discussed based on using a novel unified framework for engineering experiments and integrating MD5 encryption and decryption algorithm-based security management engine for a federated authentication and authorization uniform resource locator (URL). The established remote engineering laboratory at Texas A&M University at Qatar (TAMUQ) demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed SWS and authentication method.", "paper_title": "An Experiment Scheduler and Federated Authentication Solution for Remote Laboratory Access", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994900003"}
