Robots are used for numerous reasons including reliability and continuously high quality of work. The main decision factor is the overall efficiency of the robotic system in the production line. One key issue for this is the optimality of the whole set of robotic movements for industrial applications, which typically consist of multiple atomic tasks such as welding seams, drilling holes, etc. Currently, in many industrial scenarios such movements are optimized manually. This is costly and error-prone. Therefore, researchers have been working on algorithms for automatic computation of optimal trajectories for several years. This problem gets even more complicated due to multiple additional factors like redundant kinematics, collision avoidance, possibilities of ambiguous task performance, etc. This survey article summarizes and categorizes the approaches for optimization of the robotic task sequence. It provides an overview of existing combinatorial problems that are applied for robot task sequencing. It also highlights the strengths and the weaknesses of existing approaches as well as the challenges for future research in this domain. The article is meant for both scientists and practitioners. For scientists, it provides an overview on applied algorithmic approaches. For practitioners, it presents existing solutions, which are categorized according to the classes of input and output parameters.", "paper_title": "Robotic Task Sequencing Problem: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000362418000006"}
