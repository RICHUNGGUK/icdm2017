In this paper, we propose dynamic role based access control model can support smart and secure services suitable for intelligent ubiquitous home. The proposed model is appropriate for user-oriented service based on ubiquitous computing. In the proposed model, a permission is assigned by context information. In addition, this paper observes detailed access control procedures for service in intelligent ubiquitous home, providing use case scenarios and prototype design.", "paper_title": "A DRBAC model based on context for smart and secure services in intelligent ubiquitous home", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600091"}
