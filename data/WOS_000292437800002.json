Furthermore, the improved CE/SE scheme was applied to dilute gas-particle two-phase flows. A two-fluid model and two corresponding chemical reaction models, i.e., two-step reaction model and detailed chemical reaction model, were used to describe the physical and chemical characteristics in the two-phase flows. Shock wave reflection in gas, shock wave diffraction in air-sand mixture, explosive synthesis of TiO(2) nanoparticle and air-fuel two-phase detonation were simulated by the improved CE/SE scheme and appropriate physical and chemical models. All the numerical results were compared and discussed carefully. The results show that the improved CE/SE scheme is clear in physical concept, easy to be implemented and high accurate for the above-mentioned problems. Thus, the improved CE/SE scheme can be applied to gas-particle flows widely. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
