A product of a proposal density and K copies of the target density is used to define a joint density which is sampled by a Gibbs sampler including a Metropolis step. This provides a framework for adaptation since the current value of all K copies of the target distribution can be used in the proposal distribution. The methodology is justified by standard Gibbs sampling theory and generalizes several previously proposed algorithms. It is particularly suited to Metropolis-within-Gibbs updating and we discuss the application of our methods in this context. The method is illustrated with both a Metropolis-Hastings independence sampler and a Metropolis-with-Gibbs independence sampler. Comparisons are made with standard adaptive Metropolis-Hastings methods.", "paper_title": "On adaptive Metropolis-Hastings methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000313731400009"}
