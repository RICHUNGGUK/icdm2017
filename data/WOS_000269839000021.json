There are 5983 such inequivalent perfect codes and 2165 extended perfect codes. Efficient generation of these codes relies on the recent classification of Steiner quadruple systems of order 16. Utilizing a result of Blackmore, the optimal binary one-error-correcting codes of length 14 and the (15, 1024, 4) codes are also classified; there are 38 408 and 5983 such codes, respectively.", "paper_title": "The Perfect Binary One-Error-Correcting Codes of Length 15: Part I-Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000269839000021"}
