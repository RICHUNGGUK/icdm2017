By using the traditional scattering theory and the mean-field approximation, we calculate the transmission rate of photons along the cavities, and discuss the effect of nonlinearity and the cavity-atom coupling on the photon transport. The results show that the cavity-atom couplings affect the coherent transport of photons. The dynamics of such a system is also studied by numerical simulations, the er effect the atom-field detuning and nonlinearity on the dynamics is shown and discussed.", "paper_title": "NONLINEAR EFFECT ON THE TRANSMISSION OF LIGHT IN A CAVITY ARRAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857800005"}
