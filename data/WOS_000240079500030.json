The enddiastolic model is built in 3D sparsely on 2D planes, representing the anatomical 4-chamber, 2-chamber, and short-axis views. Ultrasound specific intensity normalization and shape-based intensity modeling are employed. The model is matched in an intensity-based registration approach, by perturbing appearance and pose parameters simultaneously. Leave-one-out experiments on 10 patients reveal significant improvement in the segmentation using the normalized cross-correlation metric. The registration method will allow fully automatic extraction of the standard views as used in echocardiography. This will aid in the selection of images for inter- and intra-patient comparison and may provide an alternative for a complete 3D AAM.", "paper_title": "Sparse appearance model based registration of 3D ultrasound images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500030"}
