It was developed to provide innovative access to heritage objects from heterogeneous collections, using historical events and narratives as the context for searching, browsing and presenting of individual and group of objects. This paper describes the DIVE Web Demonstrator.(1) We also discuss how the collection metadata the demonstrator uses are enriched through a hybrid workflow. The demonstrator uses semantics from these enriched collections, their vocabularies and linked data vocabularies to establish connections between the collection media objects and the events, people, locations and concepts that are depicted or associated with those objects. The innovative interface combines Web technology and theory of interpretation to allow for browsing this network of data in an intuitive \"infinite\" fashion. DIVE focuses to support digital humanities scholars in their online explorations and research questions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
