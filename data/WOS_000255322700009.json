The single design techniques produce solutions that perform well for the selected design point but have poor off-design performance. Here, it is shown how the approach can provide robust solutions using game theory in the sense that they are less sensitive to little changes of input parameters. Starting from a statistical definition of stability, the method captures, simultaneously Pareto non-dominated solutions with respect to performance and stability criteria, offering alternative choices to the designer.
