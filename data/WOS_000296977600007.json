This paper investigates the oft-overlooked requirement of attractiveness (or 'aesthetics') in visualization, and, in doing so, discusses a wider role for the design process which emphasizes the benefits of disseminating design rationale. In presenting a model of three potential roles for design in information visualization, we suggest that the field would benefit from encompassing a broader scope that includes visualizations produced as part of commercial practice or artistic exploration. We conclude with a discussion on the practical consequences to the academic community of adopting our model - consequences that will require a paradigm shift in the way we value, teach and conduct information visualization research.", "paper_title": "On the role of design in information visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000296977600007"}
