A singular source of information provides pieces of evidence that are significantly different from the majority of the other sources. In the Dempster-Shafer theory, the pieces of evidence collected by a source are summarized by basic belief assignments (bbas). In this article, we propose to mine singular sources by analyzing the conflict between their corresponding bbas. By viewing the conflict as a function of parameters called discounting rates, new developments are obtained and a criterion that weights the contribution of each bba to the conflict is introduced. The efficiency and the robustness of this criterion is demonstrated on several sets of bbas with various specificities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
