Every day big hospitals are overwhelmed. The problem that it's difficult and expensive for ordinary people to see doctors is becoming a major social host issue. And major chronic diseases are threatening human health. In order to optimize medical resource allocation and provide more efficient services for patients with major chronic diseases, this paper takes stroke as the entry point and proposes a new medical service pattern. Namely, taking stroke patients as the center, medical association collaborates to prevent and treat them. Because cloud computing is dynamic and scalable and in order to expand to other major diseases and attract more medical associations to join when the medical service pattern is mature, this paper uses cloud computing to support the pattern. And this paper details the new medical service pattern, the framework and the service of cloud platform of medical association collaborating to prevent and treat stroke. The pattern can consider the prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and other aspects of stroke. And it can achieve the circular medical service pattern which centered on stroke patients and can provide better service for stroke patients.", "paper_title": "Medical Association Service Pattern of Collaborative Stroke Prevention and Treatment Based on Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968700031"}
