Specifically, the performances of the SUSAN and the Harris corner detection algorithms have been compared. A critical goal of this study was to evaluate the interface of these feature extraction schemes with the successive detection and labeling, and pose estimation schemes in the overall scheme. Closed-loop simulations were performed using a Simulink (R)-based simulation environment to reproduce docking maneuvers using the US Air Force refueling boom.", "paper_title": "Addressing corner detection issues for machine vision based UAV aerial refueling", "paper_id": "WOS:000249919200001"}
