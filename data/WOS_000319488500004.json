Despite its importance, however, solving the problem for a general case (when the coordinator has only partial observations) remains doubly exponential in the number of variables in web service descriptions. Toward this challenge, we propose two novel (signature preserving and subsuming) approximation-based approaches using abstraction and refinement. Given a set of web service behavioural descriptions and a reachability goal, we automatically construct abstract web services which have less variables using over-approximation. If our method identifies a coordinator web service, the coordinator is guaranteed to control the given web services to reach the goal state no matter how they behave. Otherwise, our method refines the current abstraction by adding some variables that have strong dependency on the goal variables.", "paper_title": "Behavioural description based web service composition using abstraction and refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000319488500004"}
