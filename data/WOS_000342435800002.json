In this paper, we present a Semi-supervised Unified Latent Factor learning approach (SULF) to learn a predictive unified latent representation by leveraging both complementary information among multiple views and the supervision from the partially label information. On one hand, SULF employs a collaborative Nonnegative Matrix Factorization formulation to discover a unified latent space shared across multiple views. On the other hand, SULF adopts a regularized regression model to minimize a prediction loss on partially labeled data with the latent representation. Consequently, the obtained parts-based representation can have more discriminating power. In addition, we also develop a mechanism to learn the weights of different views automatically. To solve the proposed optimization problem, we design an effective iterative algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted for both classification and clustering tasks on three real-world datasets and the compared results demonstrate the superiority of our approach.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised Unified Latent Factor learning with multi-view data", "paper_id": "WOS:000342435800002"}
