The emerging notion of \"Project supply chain\" is less studied but also very appealing. In this paper, we study the interaction of different agents within this kind of supply chain. The major issue of such an interaction is the degree of cooperation between the agent and the capacity of each of them to forecast the impact of their behaviour. A simulation tool which studies the relationship between a principal contractor (in charge of project management) and a subcontractor (dealing with the management of a scarce resource) is proposed here, that aim at enabling both actors to understand the impact of their behaviour on risks and delivery dates.
