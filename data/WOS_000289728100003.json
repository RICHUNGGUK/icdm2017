The framework follows the BDI model of agency and is used as the main project for a seminar course on agent-oriented programming and design. When it comes to design, the Prometheus methodology has been used by relying on the Prometheus design tool (PDT) that supports the methodology. In terms of programming language, we have used the JACK agent platform. We believe the domains developed as part of the Multi-Agent Programming Contest are the right type of settings for evaluating our research, in that it provides enough complexity to explore various aspects of multi-agent development while being sufficiently bounded to make the development effort worthwhile.", "paper_title": "A BDI agent system for the cow herding domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000289728100003"}
