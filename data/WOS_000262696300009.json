We introduce a new way of looking at k-triangulations, namely as complexes of star polygons. With this tool we give new, direct proofs of the fundamental properties of k-triangulations, as well as some new results. This interpretation also opens up new avenues of research that we briefly explore in the last section.", "paper_title": "Multitriangulations as Complexes of Star Polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000262696300009"}
