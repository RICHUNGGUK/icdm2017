Since there exist problems of finite samples and uncertain data in complex fuzzy fault system modeling, the input and output variables are described as fuzzy numbers. Then by integrating the fuzzy theory and v-support vector classifier machine, the triangular fuzzy v-support vector regression machine (TF v-SVCM) is proposed. To seek the optimal parameters of TF v-SVCM, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is also applied to optimize parameters of TF v-SVCM. A diagnosing method based on TF v-SVCM and PSO are put forward. The results of the application in fault system diagnosis confirm the feasibility and the validity of the diagnosing method. The results of application in fault diagnosis of car assembly line show the hybrid diagnosis model based on TF v-SVCM and PSO is feasible and effective, and the comparison between the method proposed in this paper and other ones is also given, which proves this method is better than standard v-SVCM.
