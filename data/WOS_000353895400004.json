We propose a necessary and sufficient condition for recognizing such point sets , and present an time algorithm for constructing a 4-connected triangulation of , if it exists. Thus, our algorithm solves a longstanding open problem in computational geometry and geometric graph theory. We also provide a simple time method for constructing a non-complex triangulation of , if it exists. This method provides a new insight into the structure of 4-connected triangulations of point sets.", "paper_title": "Four-Connected Triangulations of Planar Point Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400004"}
