This algorithm is designed to provide both real-time throughput and robust disparity estimation for real-world applications where computation is limited to a pre-defined region-of-interest (ROI). More specifically, this algorithm is used as part of a hand-pair gesture recognition application where the disparity is computed for two ROI around a hand-pair identified by the segmentation component of the recognition application. The developed algorithm provides the required relative difference in disparity with background at high frame rates for the hand-pair gesture recognition application. The results obtained with an inexpensive commercial VGA stereo webcam show a robust disparity computation of 20 ms/frame enabling real-time hand-pair gesture recognition at 25 fps with > 90% recognition rate for a maximum hand speed of 40 cm/s and for hand distances between 30 and 150 cm away from the camera.", "paper_title": "Real-time computation of disparity for hand-pair gesture recognition using a stereo webcam", "paper_id": "WOS:000310994900006"}
