Employing a cross-layer approach spreads the burden of ensuring resilience across multiple levels of the design hierarchy. This article illustrates a methodology for dealing with scaling-related problems via two case studies that link models of low-level technology-related problems to system behavior.", "paper_title": "A CROSS-LAYER TECHNOLOGY-BASED STUDY OF HOW MEMORY ERRORS IMPACT SYSTEM RESILIENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000323014300007"}
