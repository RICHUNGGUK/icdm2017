As the desired SNR in the evolution procedure is hard to obtain, approximate SNR updating formula has been widely adopted in the literature. In this paper a revised SNR updating formula is proposed for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing interleave division multiple access (OFDM-IDMA) systems in Rayleigh fading channels. Theoretical analysis shows that the new updating formula provides a tighter lower bound of the expected SNR in the evolution procedure compared with the existing one. We then verified this by simulations.", "paper_title": "Improved SNR Evolution for OFDM-IDMA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000005"}
