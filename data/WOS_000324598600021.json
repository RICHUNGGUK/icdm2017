Compared with the automatic retransmission request (ARQ) approach, FEC reduces delay but utilizes more bandwidth resources. To enhance video transmission over wireless networks, another mechanism, enhanced adaptive FEC (EAFEC), has been recently presented. According to the throughput and wireless channel state, EAFEC dynamically determines the length of the redundancy and reduces the transmission of unnecessary redundancy to achieve the efficient utilization of wireless networking resources. To further enhance the efficiency of EAFEC, we propose an enhanced structure, adaptive and interleaving FEC (AIFEC) using the features of FEC. Our proposed AIFEC scheme not only dynamically provides different protection strengths for video information of different priority levels based on the throughput and wireless channel state, but also significantly improves the recovery rate for consecutive packet loss.", "paper_title": "AN ENHANCED STRUCTURE OF LAYERED FORWARD ERROR CORRECTION AND INTERLEAVING FOR SCALABLE VIDEO CODING IN WIRELESS VIDEO DELIVERY", "paper_id": "WOS:000324598600021"}
