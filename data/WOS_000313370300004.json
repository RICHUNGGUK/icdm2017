The algorithm has been tested exhaustively with experimental datasets coming from online protein interaction databases and individual experiments and it has been compared with five other effective techniques in order to demonstrate its efficiency and superior performance. Results showed that GAppi produces feasible and very efficient solutions compared to other techniques. Except from that, due to its adaptive behavior, each time it is used it can satisfy different constraints, thus meeting the different needs of each user. Furthermore, a user friendly interface has been implemented that hosts the proposed algorithmic strategy.", "paper_title": "GAPPI: IDENTIFYING IMPORTANT PROTEIN MODULES THROUGH PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTION GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000313370300004"}
