The case studied in this paper concerns a huge physical model of imperial Rome (16 x 17.5 m) whose extremely small details forced the use of high resolution and low noise scanning, in contrast with the long range needed. This paper gives an account of the procedures and the technologies used for solving this \"contradiction\".", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional acquisition of large and detailed cultural heritage objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241687000002"}
