Intensive studies of MapReduce scheduling have been carried out to improve MapReduce system performance. Delay scheduling is a common way to achieve high data locality and system performance. However, inappropriate delays can lead to low system throughput and potentially break the original job priority constraints. This paper proposes a deadline-enabled delay (DLD) scheduling algorithm that optimizes job delay decisions according to real-time resource availability and resource competition, while still meets job deadline constraints. Experimental results illustrate that the resource availability estimation method of DLD is accurate (92%). Compared with other approaches, DLD reduces job turnaround time by 22% in average while keeping a high locality rate (88%).Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "MapReduce delay scheduling with deadline constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000331020300009"}
