Image interpolation algorithm enlarges a cover image before hiding secret data in order to embed a large amount of secret data. Edge detection algorithm is applied to improve a quality of stego-image. Experimental results show that the proposed method can embed a large amount of secret data while keeping visual quality better than previous works. We demonstrate that the average capacity is 391,115bits, and the PSNR and quality index are 44.71dB, 0.9568 for gray images when threshold value is 4 and the embedding bits are given to 2 respectively.", "paper_title": "Data hiding using edge detector for scalable images", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000022"}
