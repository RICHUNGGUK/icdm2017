We propose a statistical measure called the robustness score to quantify this notion. Our initial motivation for measuring ranking robustness is to predict topic difficulty for content-based queries in the ad-hoc retrieval task. Our results demonstrate that the robustness score is positively and consistently correlation with average precision of content-based queries across a variety of TREC test collections. Though our focus is on prediction under the ad-hoc retrieval task, we observe an interesting negative correlation with query performance when our technique is applied to named-page finding queries, which are a fundamentally different kind of queries. A side effect of this different behavior of the robustness score between the two types of queries is that the robustness score is also found to be a good feature for query classification.", "paper_title": "Measuring ranked list robustness for query performance prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000258064200002"}
