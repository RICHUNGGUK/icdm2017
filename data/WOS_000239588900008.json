Rather, too has a presupposition that has to be anaphoric to particular objects which are parallel with the referent of the focus. Van der Sandt and Geurts try to formulate this observation in their binding theory of presupposition, which, though, fails to capture the full range of Kripke's original observation. This paper proposes a simple formulation of the observation by using Rooth's Alternative Semantics for focus and Stalnaker's ideas concerning presuppositions and context.", "paper_title": "A note on Kripke's observation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239588900008"}
