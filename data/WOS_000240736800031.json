This is a major limitation, as most applications demand support for dynamically animated models. In this paper, we present a new approach to ray trace a special but important class of dynamic scenes, namely models whose connectivity does not change over time and for which all possible poses are known in advance. We support these kinds of models by introducing two new concepts: motion decomposition, and fuzzy kd-trees. We analyze the animation and break the model down into submeshes with similar motion. For each of these submeshes and for every time step, we calculate a best affine transformation through a least square approach. Any residual motion is then captured in a single \"fuzzy kd-tree\" for the entire animation. Together these techniques allow for ray tracing animations without rebuilding the spatial index structures for the submeshes, resulting in interactive frame rates of 5 to 15 fps even on a single CPU.", "paper_title": "Ray tracing animated scenes using motion decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240736800031"}
