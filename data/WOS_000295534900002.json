Wireless local area networks (WLANs) are deployed in the hot spots, while a delay/ disruption tolerant network (DTN) provides services to nomadic nodes in the large area with low node density. We investigate the radio resource allocation for a DTN/WLAN integrated network, and propose a DTN-friendly medium access control (DFMAC) scheme for the hot spots supporting voice/data services. Analytical models are established to characterize the interactions between a DTN and WLANs under the proposed DFMAC. Numerical and simulation results demonstrate that our proposed MAC scheme can provide a deterministic delay guarantee for the voice services of local nodes, while achieving an efficient performance tradeoff for the data services between nomadic nodes and local nodes.", "paper_title": "DFMAC: DTN-Friendly Medium Access Control for Wireless Local Area Networks Supporting Voice/Data Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000295534900002"}
