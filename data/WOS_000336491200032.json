The G-nucleolus considers not only the constructive and the blocking powers, but also the size of fuzzy coalitions. Moreover, we show that the G-nucleolus is reasonable, and coincides with the SM-nucleolus when the function f is equal to 1 for each fuzzy coalition. The G-nucleolus can be obtained by calculating the f-nucleolus of a constant-sum fuzzy cooperative game. We prove that G-nucleolus belong to the non-empty precore of the corresponding constant-sum fuzzy cooperative game. Finally, some linear programming models are employed to generate the G-nucleolus effectively.", "paper_title": "The G-nucleolus for fuzzy cooperative games", "paper_id": "WOS:000336491200032"}
