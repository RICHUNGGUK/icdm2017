The major technical difficulty is element separation with irregular spatial distribution, hampering previous texture, and image synthesis methods from easily producing visually compelling results. Our method uses the object-level operations and finds grouped elements based on appearance similarity and curvilinear features. This framework enables a number of image editing applications, including natural image mixing, structure preserving appearance transfer, and texture mixing.", "paper_title": "ImageAdmixture: Putting Together Dissimilar Objects from Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000308414100005"}
