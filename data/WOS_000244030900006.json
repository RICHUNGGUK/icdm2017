This restriction is due to the static nature of the acceleration structures used. While the best reported frame rates for static geometric models have been achieved using carefully constructed kd-trees, this article shows that bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) can be used to efficiently ray trace large static models. More importantly, the BVH can be used to ray trace deformable models (sets of triangles whose positions change over time) with little loss of performance. A variety of efficiency techniques are used to achieve this performance, but three algorithmic changes to the typical BVH algorithm are mainly responsible. First, the BVH is built using a variant of the surface area heuristic conventionally used to build kd-trees. Second, the topology of the BVH is not changed over time so that only the bounding volumes need to be refit from frame-to-frame. Third, and most importantly, packets of rays are traced together through the BVH using a novel integrated packet-frustum traversal scheme. This traversal scheme elegantly combines the advantages of both packet traversal and frustum traversal and allows for rapid hierarchy descent for packets that hit bounding volumes as well as rapid exits for packets that miss. A BVH-based ray tracing system using these techniques is shown to achieve performance for deformable models comparable to that previously available only for static models.", "paper_title": "Ray tracing deformable scenes using dynamic bounding volume hierarchies", "paper_id": "WOS:000244030900006"}
