For a given set of communication requests L = {l(1), l(2), ..., l(n)}, the MLS (maximum link scheduling) problem aims to find the largest possible subset S of L such that the links in S can be scheduled simultaneously. Most of the existing results did not consider bidirectional transmission setting, which is more realistic in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, under physical interference model SINR (signal-to-noise-plus-interference-ratio) and bidirectional transmission model, we propose a constant factor approximation algorithm MLSA (Maximum Link Scheduling Algorithm) for MLS. It is proved that in the same topology setting the capacity under unidirectional transmission model is lager than that under bidirectional transmission model. However, compared with some work under unidirectional transmission model, the capacity of MLSA is improved about 28% to 45%.", "paper_title": "SINR based Maximum Link Scheduling with Uniform Power in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900023"}
