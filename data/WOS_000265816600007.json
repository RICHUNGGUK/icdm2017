For any fixed value k, we present linear- and almost-linear-time algorithms to find a cycle of length >= k, if one exists. We also find a cycle that has length >= log n/log log n in polynomial time, if one exists. Under an appropriate complexity assumption it is known to be impossible to improve this guarantee by more than a log log n factor. Our approach is based on depth-first search.", "paper_title": "Finding a Long Directed Cycle", "paper_id": "WOS:000265816600007"}
