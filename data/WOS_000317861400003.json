Longitudinal examination of 163 pro-white advocacy group websites, in which establishing a core group identity is a critical strategic goal, showed a half-life of 2.40 years and 34% remained active after five years. Analysis of text content from 28 sites collected annually from 2007 to 2012 (n = 1947) showed that persistence was more likely for advocacy group identity, while examples of group goals were transient. Content persistence trends reflect broader phenomena of ideologically oriented website persuasive material.", "paper_title": "Website content persistence and change: Longitudinal analysis of pro-white group identity", "paper_id": "WOS:000317861400003"}
