Puncturing is a scheme to obtain a series of higher rate codes from a lower rate mother code. It is widely used in channel coding but it causes performance is lost compared to non-punctured LDPC codes at the same rate. Previous work, considered the role of survived check nodes in puncturing patterns. Limitations, such as single survived check node assumption and simulation-based verification, were examined. This paper analyzes the performance according to the role of multiple survived check nodes and multiple dead check nodes. Based on these analyses, we propose new algorithm to find a good puncturing pattern for LDPC codes over AWGN channels.", "paper_title": "A Good Puncturing Scheme for Rate Compatible Low-Density Parity-Check Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000271492600003"}
