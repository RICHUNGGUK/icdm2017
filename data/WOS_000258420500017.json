Design/methodology/approach - The influence on the conducted noise by the change of the implements' shape is investigated employing the 3D finite element method. Because of the difficulty in modelizing the electronic ballast accurately as a noise source, the electronic ballast is replaced by a comparison spectrum transmitter. Line impedance stabilization network is used for the measurement of the noise. The validity of this numerical model is confirmed by comparing the measurement results, Findings - The validity of the computation was confirmed by comparison with the measured results of a simplified implement model. The difference between the measured and calculated results was less than 5 dB all over the frequency range. Research limitations/implications - The frequency range is from. 10 to 30 MHz and the construction and wiring of the implement have a great influence on the electromagnetic field. Originality/value - In previous papers, circuit simulators are used to analyze conducted emission from an electronic circuit including inverter, where common mode current cannot be taken into consideration. Therefore, the displacement current was taken into consideration in the model. Not only the implement, but also the measurement method and environment are modelized in the analyzed model.", "paper_title": "Conducted emission analysis of a lighting implement employing the 3D finite element method", "paper_id": "WOS:000258420500017"}
