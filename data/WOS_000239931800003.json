For the modelling of turbulence, the Launder and Sharma low-Re k-epsilon model and a recently produced variant of the cubic non-linear low-Re k-epsilon model have been employed. In this paper, developing turbulent flow through two different 90 degrees bends is examined: a square bend, and a rectangular bend with an aspect ratio of 6. The numerical results indicate that for the bend of square cross-section the curvature induces a strong secondary flow, while for the rectangular cross-section the secondary motion is confined to the corner regions. For both curved ducts, the secondary motion persists downstream of the bend and eventually slowly disappears. For the bend of square cross-section, comparisons indicate that both turbulence models can produce reasonable predictions. For the bend of rectangular cross-section, for which a wider range of data is available, while both turbulence models produce satisfactory predictions of the mean flow field, the non-linear k-epsilon model returns superior predictions of the turbulence field and also of the pressure and friction coefficients.
