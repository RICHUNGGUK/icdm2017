An axisymmetric framework is established, based on an improved CE/SE scheme, to solve the high-velocity impact problems with large deformations, high strain rates and spall fractures. The hybrid particle level set method is adopted for tracking material interfaces and describing the formation and propagation of a crack. A novel representation of crack by level set is proposed. Numerical simulations are carried out and compared to the corresponding experimental results. The numerical results are in good agreement with the experimental data. The edge effects are reproduced and the decrease of scab thickness with increase in impact velocity is observed owing to the numerical analysis. It is proved that our computational technique is feasible and reliable for analyzing the spall fracture. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
