The parallelization is safe in that a speculative execution always produces the same output as the sequential execution. In this paper, we present the dependence hint, an interface for a user to specify possible dependences between possibly parallel tasks. Dependence hints may be incorrect or incomplete but they do not change the program output. The interface extends Cytron's do-across and recent OpenMP ordering primitives and makes them safe and safely composable. We use it to express conditional and partial parallelism and to parallelize large-size legacy code. The prototype system is implemented as a software library. It is used to improve performance by nearly 10 times on average on current multicore machines for 8 programs including 5 SPEC benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Safe Parallel Programming using Dynamic Dependence Hints", "paper_id": "WOS:000298294500016"}
