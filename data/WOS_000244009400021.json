In this type of model framework, a river basin is represented as a series of nodes, where nodes generally represent key points of extraction or instream use. When considering water allocation, agricultural production and other water use decisions generally interact with the stream system in two ways: they can affect the generation of runoff and thus the volume of water reaching the stream; or, they may involve direct extraction or use of water once it has reached the stream. Models are generally required to consider the influence of these decisions on flows and downstream water availability, as well as the influence of flows on the productive, passive use and environmental values of water. This paper provides a generalised conceptual framework for considering these types of interactions and their representation in integrated water allocation models. Applications of this framework to three very different case studies are outlined. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
