A major contribution of this paper is a quantitative assessment of how incorporating adaptivity into the feature calculation, the feature pre-processing, and into the classifiers themselves, influences the final image classification performance. Hereby, results achieved on a range of artificial and real-world test data from applications in printing, die-casting, metal processing and food production are presented.", "paper_title": "Assessment of the influence of adaptive components in trainable surface inspection systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000280249300003"}
