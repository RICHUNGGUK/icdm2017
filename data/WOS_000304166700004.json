This work presents a multi-phase classification (MPC) scheme that builds a mode decision tree according to the clustering of rate-distortion costs. A nearest cluster mean criterion is used to examine candidate modes phase by phase, and a performance control mechanism is incorporated to maintain coding performance. Experimental results confirm that the proposed MPC algorithm reduces encoding time by an average of 68% with only negligible performance degradation.", "paper_title": "Fast Mode Decision for H. 264/AVC Based on Rate-Distortion Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000304166700004"}
