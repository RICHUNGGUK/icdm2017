The fuzzy detector is inspired on the recent rank-ordered differences (ROD) statistic. We propose a noise detection process performed in two steps followed by noise filtering using the vector median filter. Experimental results show that the method is among the best-performing methods for impulse noise reduction and computational analysis indicates that the method is pretty efficient.
