We show that various radiometric calibration problems can be treated in a principled framework that uses a rank minimization approach. This framework provides a principled way of solving radiometric calibration problems in various settings. The proposed approach is evaluated using both simulation and real-world datasets and shows superior performance to previous approaches.", "paper_title": "Radiometric Calibration by Rank Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000311127700014"}
