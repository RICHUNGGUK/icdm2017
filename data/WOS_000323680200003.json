The algorithm is distributed, and in addition, mostly uses local information. Such an algorithm can be implemented by parallel and/or distributed execution and the overhead of message passing is low. It is also possible to embed the algorithm into a network protocol so that the sensor nodes and the sink can run it directly as part of the network operation. We give a proof of the algorithm's optimality and the boundedness of the queue sizes, both in the long-run average sense. The proof is based on analyzing a Lyapunov drift.", "paper_title": "Distributed Algorithm for Lifetime Maximization in a Delay-Tolerant Wireless Sensor Network with a Mobile Sink", "paper_id": "WOS:000323680200003"}
