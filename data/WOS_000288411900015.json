Robust estimators, on the other hand, will resist them. Unfortunately, the multiplicity of alternative robust regression estimators that have been suggested in the literature over the years is a source of confusion for practitioners of regression analysis. Moreover, little is known about their small-sample performance in the nonlinear regression setting, in particular on the chemical engineering field. A simulation study comparing six such estimators (namely LMS, LTS, LTD, MM-, tau-, and L-p-norm) together with the usual least squares estimator is presented. The results obtained provide guidance as to the choice of an appropriate estimator. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
