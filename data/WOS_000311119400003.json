In local view,the support, certainty and coverage factors are proposed to measure MGRS rules, which are support by an object; while in global view, these three factors are proposed to measure MGRS rules,which are coexisting in a decision system. The necessary conditions for these factors to achieve maximal and minimal values are also addressed. Some numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments.", "paper_title": "Local and Global Measurements of MGRS Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000311119400003"}
