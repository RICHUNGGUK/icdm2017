In this construction, feed-forward methods, quantum nondemolition detectors and several optical elements are applied. It is a potentially practical quantum gate with certain features. First, the lack of auxiliary photons is allowable, which decreases consumption of resources. Secondly, employment of the signal photon from either of target output ports and three quantum nondemolition detectors enable the success probability to approach unit and judge whether the signal photons lose or not. Thirdly, the displacement measurement is adopted, and thus the Controlled-NOT gate works against photon loss of the probe coherent state. Finally, in order to circumvent the effect of dephasing, the monochromatic signal photons are exploited.", "paper_title": "NEARLY DETERMINISTIC CONTROLLED-NOT GATE WITH WEAK CROSS-KERR NONLINEARITIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538000011"}
