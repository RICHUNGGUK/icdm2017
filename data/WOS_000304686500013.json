In this work, methanol production from synthesis gas (or syngas) is studied. The syngas is (assumed to be) obtained from an intermittent upstream biomass-gasification process run by solar energy. Development of the methanol synthesis recycle-loop model is described in detail, along with several case studies performed using the steady-state and dynamic models for better understanding of the process behavior. A linear model predictive controller is designed to reject disturbances from a varying upstream syngas production process and track set point changes in the desired variables for methanol synthesis.
