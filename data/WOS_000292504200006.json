This system differs from the classical CRM for retaining and targeting profitable customers; the main focus of the proposed SVM-based ensemble learning system is to identify high-risk customers in CRM for avoiding possible loss. To build an effective SVM-based ensemble learning system, the effects of ensemble members' diversity, ensemble member selection and different ensemble strategies on the performance of the proposed SVM-based ensemble learning system are each investigated in a practical CRM case. Through experimental analysis, we find that the Bayesian-based SVM ensemble learning system with diverse components and choose from space selection strategy show the best performance over various testing samples.", "paper_title": "Developing an SVM-based ensemble learning system for customer risk identification collaborating with customer relationship management", "paper_id": "WOS:000292504200006"}
