In the context of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management), it is not uncommon to use intelligent products to ensure an information continuum all along the product life cycle (e. g. for traceability purposes). However, it is not that easy to identify what information should be stored on the product. To answer this question, this paper proposes a data dissemination process to select context-sensitive information from the database, that must be stored/replicated on the product (especially if the product is made of \"communicating material\"). Our approach uses the fuzzy AHP theory for aggregating points of view from different actors. The data dissemination process is then applied on a case study to embed context-sensitive information on a \"communicating textile\".", "paper_title": "Method for embedding context-sensitive information on \"communicating textiles\" via fuzzy AHP", "paper_id": "WOS:000329926600007"}
