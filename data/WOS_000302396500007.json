The IEEE 802.15.3 Medium Access Control (MAC) is proposed, specifically, for short range and high data rates applications, to coordinate the access to the wireless medium among the competing devices. This paper uses analytical model to study the performance analysis of WPAN (IEEE802.15.3) MAC in terms of throughput, efficient bandwidth utilization, and delay with various acknowledgment schemes and aggregation mechanism under different parameters. From the performance analysis we can determine the optimal payload size, burst-size, and ACK policy for a given set of parameters. Moreover, numerical results demonstrate the advantage of frame aggregation with Dly-ACK policy over basic policies of WPAN.", "paper_title": "WPAN MAC Protocol: Designing and Analysis with Different ACK Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000302396500007"}
