For the n specified receivers, the ciphertext can be decrypted and verified when arbitrary t or more receivers work together. The steps of the private keys extraction, the signcryption, the decryption, and the verification are introduced in detail. The chosen-ciphertext security of the scheme is proved formally. The comparisons to the existing schemes show that the proposed scheme is more secure, more flexible, and the simulative game of the security proof in the scheme is more perfect.
