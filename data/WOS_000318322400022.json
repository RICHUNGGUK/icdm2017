As a consequence, there is need to develop systems to predict and evaluate quality parameters. The objective of the present study was the development of a computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) model for the prediction of air temperature and oxygen concentration temporal and spatial variations in silage storages. Two experimental semi-cylinder silo stacks were used for the validation of the model. For monitoring temperature and oxygen concentration, a network consisting of 18 wireless sensors was placed in each stack. In order to validate the CFD model for both cases of sufficient and insufficient covering one of the stacks was penetrated to emulate the influx of outside air. A good agreement was found between measured and predicted obtained results. Measured and predicted values for air temperature varied between 3% and 11% and for oxygen concentration between 5% and 14% with correlation coefficients between 0.76 and 0.81, and between 0.91 and 0.97, respectively. The results show the potential for the development and implementation of decision support systems for the prediction of quality parameters in storaged biomasses. With such systems, an early detection of process disturbances can be obtained and making possible preventive measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
