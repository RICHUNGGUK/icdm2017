On the other hand, nonparametric belief propagation (NBP), which provides approximated posterior distributions of the location estimates, is expensive mostly because of the transmission of the particles. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reduce communication overhead for cooperative positioning using NBP. It is based on: i) communication of the beliefs (instead of the messages), ii) approximation of the belief with Gaussian mixture of very few components, and iii) censoring. According to our simulations results, these modifications reduce significantly communication overhead while providing the estimates almost as accurate as the transmission of the particles.", "paper_title": "Reducing Communication Overhead for Cooperative Localization Using Nonparametric Belief Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200012"}
