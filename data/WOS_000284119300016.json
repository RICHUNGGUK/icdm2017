This distance function is shown to be a Mahalanobis distance in a higher-dimensional embedding space of the points, and the resulting reconstruction algorithm a natural extension of the classical Radial Basis Function (RBF) approach. Experimental results show the superiority of our reconstruction algorithm to RBF and other methods in a variety of practical scenarios.", "paper_title": "3D Surface Reconstruction Using a Generalized Distance Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000284119300016"}
