A service provider typically adjusts pricing only periodically. Once a \"global\" optimal pricing is derived, it would stay static for a period of time, allowing users to be charged with the same rate while roaming. We utilize a hybrid partitioning-threshold admission control algorithm to analyze a pricing scheme that correlates service demand with pricing, and to periodically determine optimal pricing under which the system revenue is maximized while guaranteeing that QoS requirements of multiple service classes are satisfied.
