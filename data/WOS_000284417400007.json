In this paper, we use adjustable delay buffers (ADB) whose delays can be tuned or adjusted to minimize clock skew under different power modes. Assuming that the positions of k ADBs are already determined, we first propose a linear-time optimal algorithm which assigns the values of ADBs so that the skew is optimal among all possible ADB assignments with a possibility of latency penalty. Then, we propose a modified optimal algorithm without latency penalty. We also propose an efficient heuristic to determine good positions for ADBs. Our results show significant improvement when compared to cases without ADBs.", "paper_title": "Clock Skew Minimization in Multi-Voltage Mode Designs Using Adjustable Delay Buffers", "paper_id": "WOS:000284417400007"}
