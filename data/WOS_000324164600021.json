In this paper, we mainly discuss symmetric fix-free codes. First, the existence of symmetric fix-free codes is studied in detail, and some necessary and sufficient conditions are proposed. We also discuss the problem of achieving synchronization of symmetric fix-free codes, which is important in application. We then establish a scheme with synchronizing codewords to resolve this problem.", "paper_title": "The existence and synchronization properties of symmetric fix-free codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600021"}
