To date, no prior research considers cultural differences in studying IBS adoption of these countries although IBS is a global service. The research model is based on UTAUT model with two additional factors. A questionnaire was distributed to 766 respondents from the three countries. Results reveal that for both the developed and developing countries, attitude toward using IBS is the most important factor followed by performance expectancy. Due to cultural differences between the developed and developing countries (e.g. uncertainty avoidance, individualism, and power distance), perceived credibility of IBS is relevant only in the developed countries. This research helps banks promote their service globally. It also enhances UTAUT model.", "paper_title": "INTERNET BANKING ADOPTION: COMPARING DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000284189000006"}
