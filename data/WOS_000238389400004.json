The triple line dynamics modelling is implicit (as opposed to classical explicit mobility relations), it is based on the Shikhmurzaev equations. These equations include generalized Navier slip type boundary conditions with extra local surface tension gradient terms. Numerical results when spreading and recoiling are presented. A particular attention is paid to flow patterns near the contact line.", "paper_title": "Flow patterns in the vicinity of triple line dynamics arising from a local surface tension model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400004"}
