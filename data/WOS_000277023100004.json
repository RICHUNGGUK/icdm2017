Moreover, when applied to Distributed Video Coding, in systems with at least one moving camera it represents a real challenge due to the necessary data at decoder for generating the side information without any a priori knowledge of each instant camera position. This paper proposes a solution to this problem based on successive multi-view registration and motion compensated extrapolation for on-the-fly re-correlation of two views at decoder. This novel technique for side information generation is codec-independent, robust and flexible with regard to any free motion of the cameras. Furthermore, it doesn't require any additional information from encoders nor communication between cameras or offline training stage. We also propose a metric for an objective assessment of the multi-view correlation performance.", "paper_title": "Successive refinement of side information for multi-view distributed video coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000277023100004"}
