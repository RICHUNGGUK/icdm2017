In this paper we present an extension of the Modeling Field Theory neural network for the classification of objects. Simulations show that (i) the system is able to dynamically adapt when an additional feature is introduced during learning, (ii) that this algorithm can be applied to the classification of action patterns in the context of cognitive robotics and (iii) that it is able to classify multi-feature objects from complex stimulus set. The use of Modeling Field Theory for studying the integration of language and cognition in robots is discussed.", "paper_title": "Language and cognition integration through modeling field theory: Category formation for symbol grounding", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100040"}
