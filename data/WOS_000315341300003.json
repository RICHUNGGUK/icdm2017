However, such data are generally required for designing, training and assessing dialogue systems. User simulations are especially needed when using machine learning methods for optimizing dialogue management strategies such as Reinforcement Learning, where the amount of data necessary for training is larger than existing corpora. The quality of the user simulation is therefore of crucial importance because it dramatically influences the results in terms of SDS performance analysis and the learnt strategy. Assessment of the quality of simulated dialogues and user simulation methods is an open issue and, although assessment metrics are required, there is no commonly adopted metric. In this paper, we give a survey of User Simulations Metrics in the literature, propose some extensions and discuss these metrics in terms of a list of desired features.", "paper_title": "A survey on metrics for the evaluation of user simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000315341300003"}
