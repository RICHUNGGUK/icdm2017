This method is based on the utilisation of low cost chemical sensors in cleaning mobile robots, in order to differentiate clean from dirty areas. The experimental results show that the use of olfactory capabilities allows to efficiently cover and clean a certain area, and demonstrate the possibility of coordinating several mobile robots without the need of expensive sensing capabilities, map building or complex algorithms for task scheduling.", "paper_title": "Olfactory coordinated area coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000238393600007"}
