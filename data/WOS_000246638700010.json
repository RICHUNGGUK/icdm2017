Design/methodology/approach - In the integrated optimisation strategy general models for magnetic sources are employed and local and global inverse problems are iteratively solved for the minimization of the representation error. Findings - The results obtained show that the target accuracy is reached with a low computational effort, employing a minimum number of equivalent sources. Practical implications - The procedure is robust and converges for all the examined magnetic field configurations. Originality/value - Different from other approaches, the procedure presented here can be directly applied to a variety of different models for magnetic sources.", "paper_title": "An iterative procedure for equivalent source representation of focusing magnetic fields in TWT", "paper_id": "WOS:000246638700010"}
