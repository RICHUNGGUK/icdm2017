It is found to be a many-to-one mapping relation to transform a vague set into a fuzzy set. A general model for transforming vague sets into fuzzy sets is proposed. The two transforming methods proposed by Fan Li in [1] are proved to be two special cases of this general transforming model.", "paper_title": "A general model for transforming vague sets into fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500049"}
