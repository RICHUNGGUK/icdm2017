The problem forms a 2-extendible system, so greedy gives us a 1/2 -factor solution which runs in O(m log n) time. We improve this by providing two linear time approximation algorithms for the problem: a 1/2 -factor algorithm that runs in O(bm) time, and a (2/3 - epsilon)-factor algorithm which runs in expected O(bm log 1/epsilon) time.The objective of this paper is to characterize classes of problems for which a greedy algorithm finds solutions provably close to optimum. To that end, we introduce the notion of k-extendible systems, a natural generalization of matroids, and show that a greedy algorithm is a 1/k-factor approximation for these systems. Many seemly unrelated problems fit in our framework, e.g.: b-matching, maximum profit scheduling and maximum asymmetric TSP.", "paper_title": "Greedy in approximation algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200046"}
