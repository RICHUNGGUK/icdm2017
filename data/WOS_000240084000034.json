It's characterized by long latency and tiny energy consumption. However, the current research of CtS is under idealized assumption. In this paper, we analyze the limitation of CtS paradigm in real environment, and then introduce a new paradigm named ALEB based on CtS. In the real environment, CtS method will fail because clocks of different nodes are not synchronized perfectly, and the latency between neighbor nodes varies with an error range. To transfer data without error, we propose a Multiply-Divide method in ALEB. Further more, CtS method is restricted within a small range of applications by its long latency. We propose a mixed method to make ALEB's applicability much broader.", "paper_title": "An adaptive latency-energy balance approach of MAC layer in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000034"}
