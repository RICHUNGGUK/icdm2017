In spite of strong needs of automatic monitoring of nutrients, it is thought that tremendous expense may be required to install equipments related with remote control system, especially on-line sensors for monitoring organic and nutrient concentrations in the treatment processes. In this research, as a cost-effective tool for replacing expensive on-line sensor, PNN(Polynomial Neural Network) models were developed to estimate the NOx-N and ammonia concentrations by only using on-line values of ORP, DO and pH at the wastewater treatment plant. Developed PNN model could estimate the NOx-N and ammonia profile well. However, the error was increased at the first anoxic period of the first sub-cycle and NOx-N accumulation was occur-red at the sub-cycle. To deal with those errors, the rule-base-compensator was developed based on operational knowledge.", "paper_title": "Soft sensor using PNN model and rule base for wastewater treatment plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300184"}
