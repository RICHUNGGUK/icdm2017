This bad customer experience may result from the situation in which Internet service providers (ISPs) accept customers' subscriptions without setting sales limits. As subscribers are potential on-line users, controlling the number of subscribers can be considered as an approach to overcome this problem. The goal of this article is to develop decisions to maximise revenues of ISPs while guaranteeing the expected service quality for distinct service classes. The developed model was a resource constrained nonlinear integer problem, and a heuristic approach was provided to acquire a near-optimal solution. Limited numerical results showed that the proposed heuristic approach can solve this problem efficiently.", "paper_title": "A heuristic to bandwidth allocation and sales limit setting for Internet service providers", "paper_id": "WOS:000309129000014"}
