The Pinhole model and the Levenberg-Marquardt method are briefly described and a four step camera calibration procedure using them is presented. This procedure allows users to use ground control points to estimate all the Pinhole model parameters, including the lens distortion parameters and its implementation results with laboratory data are compared with the results presented by other authors. The procedure is also tested with field data obtained with cameras directed toward the beaches of the city of Cartagena, Colombia. The results show that the procedure is robust enough to be used when just a low number of control points are available, even though a large number of GCP is recommended to obtain high accuracy.
