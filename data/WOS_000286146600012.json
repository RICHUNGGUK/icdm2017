We address the problem of beta-sheet prediction defined as the prediction of beta-strand pairings, interaction types (parallel or antiparallel), and beta-residue interactions (or contact maps). We introduce a Bayesian approach for proteins with six or less beta-strands in which we model the conformational features in a probabilistic framework by combining the amino acid pairing potentials with a priori knowledge of beta-strand organizations. To select the optimum beta-sheet architecture, we significantly reduce the search space by heuristics that enforce the amino acid pairs with strong interaction potentials. In addition, we find the optimum pairwise alignment between beta-strands using dynamic programming in which we allow any number of gaps in an alignment to model beta-bulges more effectively. For proteins with more than six beta-strands, we first compute beta-strand pairings using the BetaPro method. Then, we compute gapped alignments of the paired beta-strands and choose the interaction types and beta-residue pairings with maximum alignment scores. We performed a 10-fold cross-validation experiment on the BetaSheet916 set and obtained significant improvements in the prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Models and Algorithms for Protein beta-Sheet Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000286146600012"}
