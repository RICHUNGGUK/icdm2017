In order to obtain a more accurate model of the femoral head prosthesis for the specified patient, a new personalized modeling system is presented in this paper. It is different from our previous system based on the sphere fitting method. This new system can reconstruct a more accurate ellipsoid model of the femoral head for the specified patient. It can recover the necrotic femoral heads into the satisfactory models. These models can well match with the acetabulum. Also, the static and dynamic matching error analyses for the reconstructed models can be implemented in this system. This new system can give a theoretical model for the accurate operation locating in the treatment of artificial femoral head replacement. And this system also provides an innovative practical means for the personalized modeling of the artificial femoral head before the prosthesis manufacture procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
