The time and energetic cost of this algorithm are 6m . k + 8m - 4 and 8k + 4 [log(2) (m + 1)] + 6, respectively. This algorithm can be applied for sorting a sequence of length N = k . n in a network consisting of n stations with memory limited by theta (k) words. For k = Omega (lg n), the energetic cost of such sorting is O (k . lg n) and the time is O (N lg n). Moreover, the constants hidden by the big \"Oh\" are reasonably small, to make the algorithm attractive for practical applications.", "paper_title": "Sorting long sequences in a single hop radio network", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700050"}
