In recent literature, the global dynamic trajectory planning problem of cable-suspended mechanisms was addressed and some of the characteristic properties of such robots were revealed. In this paper, actuation redundancy is introduced and the dynamic trajectory planning is addressed using a series of periodic trajectories (i.e. straight line and circular periodic trajectories) and the application of the antipodal theorem. The experimental results obtained show that introducing actuation redundancy increases the dynamic capabilities of the robots. Also, cable tensions acquired via tension sensors confirm that cables always remain taut during all experimental verifications at feasible frequencies and that they are consistent with the tension variations predicted by theory. Furthermore, special frequencies are specified that are similar to those encountered with non-redundant mechanisms. Additionally, an alternative architecture is proposed to deal with cable interferences and it is shown that the novel architecture leads to improved dynamic capabilities when compared to the original architecture.
