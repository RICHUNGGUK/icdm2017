Phase I identified significant factors as two categories, namely country and project factor levels. Phase II stuck on identifying a risk of a country market for construction firms with fuzzy preference relations (FPR) and country factors. Of which, FPR helped elicit factor relative weights. Phase Ill devoted to figuring out which project or projects had the best prospects of success and profitability for assisting decisions of decision makers. Within phase III, project factors were used for project prospects, FPR for project success probability, and cumulative prospect theory (CPT) for decision maker prospects. This paper integrates FPR and CPT to select country markets and identify project prospects for decision makers of construction firms. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
