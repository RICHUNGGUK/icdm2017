The objectives have been achieved through developing a new multi-objective formulation for minimizing the total cost and minimizing the bullwhip effect of a two-echelon serial supply chain. A new crossover algorithm for a fuzzy variable and a new mutation algorithm have also been proposed while applying Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) to the proposed problem. The formulated problem has been simulated by Matlab software and the results of the modified NSGA-II have been compared with those of original NSGA-II. It is found from the results that the modified NSGA-II algorithm performs better than the original NSGA-II algorithm since the minimum values for both total cost and the bullwhip effect are obtained in case of the modified NSGA-II. The formulated bi-objective problem is new to the research community. The minimization of bullwhip effect has never been considered in a multi-objective optimization before. Besides crossover operator applied to the fuzzy variable and the mutation operator are newly introduced operators.", "paper_title": "Applying modified NSGA-II for bi-objective supply chain problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000321844800005"}
