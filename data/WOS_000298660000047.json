By using block pulse functions and their stochastic operational matrix of integration, a stochastic Volterra integral equation can be reduced to a linear lower triangular system, which can be directly solved by forward substitution. The results show that the approximate solutions have a good degree of accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
