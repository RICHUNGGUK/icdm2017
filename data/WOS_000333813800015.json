QoI quantifies how useful information is for a given application. Its value is comprised of both intrinsic and contextual attributes related to the information. Intrinsic attributes include freshness and accuracy of the information. Contextual metrics include completeness and timeliness. To design QoI-aware network control algorithms, such as resource control algorithms, attributes of data must be mapped to QoI. Then, network algorithms may deliver the data in such a way that the ultimate information derived from the data is of sufficient quality for its purpose. We propose our QoI framework, and present the concept of QoI functions that capture tradeoffs between different attributes of QoI. We use optical character recognition (OCR) as a model image processing application. We focus on two attributes of QoI for the OCR application: accuracy and timeliness. We show how network controls and data processing, such as error recovery and compression, operating on data, impact the QoI delivered to a recipient. We then show how reductions in the required QoI may have a drastic impact on the amount of network resources required to support a QoI-aware transaction. Our results are based on an implementation on Android phones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
