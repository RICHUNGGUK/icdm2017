However, this problem is commonly formulated as nonlinear, multi-variable and high constrained model. Most of the heuristics for this problem are based on penalty function strategy which unfortunately suffers from inherent drawbacks. To overcome these drawbacks, this paper presented a new powerful tool-Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) and meanwhile proposed a sophisticated constraints handling scheme suitable for the optimization mechanism of PSO. An example involving simultaneously assigning both design and machining tolerances based on optimum total machining cost is employed to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach. The experimental result based on the comparison between PSO and GA show that the new PSO model is a powerful tool.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization for simultaneous optimization of design and machining tolerances", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300110"}
