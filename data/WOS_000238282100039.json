Firstly, a propositional calculus formal deductive system UL(h epsilon(0.1)) of 0-level universal logic is built up, and the corresponding algebra L Pi G is introduced. Then we prove the system UL(h epsilon(0,1)) is sound and complete with respect to the 0-level continuous universal AND operators on [0, 1]. Lastly, three extension logics of UL(h epsilon(0.1)) are also introduced.", "paper_title": "The axiomatization for 0-level universal logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100039"}
