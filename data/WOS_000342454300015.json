Currently, Aloha-based algorithm is one of the popular anti-collision algorithms which performs well when the number of tags is small. But it is not very efficient for cases with large number of tags and some areas which tags' number can be estimated, such as warehouse, supermarket, the production lines of smart factory and so on. So in this paper, we proposed a new anti-collision algorithm called group improved enhanced dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (GroupIEDFSA) by estimating the number of unread tags first, comparing the maximum frame size and dividing tags into groups when the number of tags which are activated is large. What is more, compared with enhanced dynamic frame slotted ALOHA (EDFSA) algorithm in the process of identification, GroupIEDFSA algorithm will combine new group based on the unread tags' number. Simulation results show that the efficiency of GroupIEDFSA algorithm system improves by 20 % in time and over 50 % in rounds than EDFSA algorithm in the standard mode, and increases by 1 % in time when we used fast mode.", "paper_title": "Group improved enhanced dynamic frame slotted ALOHA anti-collision algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000342454300015"}
