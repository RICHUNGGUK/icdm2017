Current computational methods to extract evolutionary information from sequence data for such clusters are suboptimal, in part because accurate sequence data are often lacking in these genomic regions, making existing methods difficult to apply. We describe a new method for reconstructing the recent evolutionary history of gene clusters, and evaluate its performance on both simulated data and actual human gene clusters.", "paper_title": "CAGE: Combinatorial Analysis of Gene-Cluster Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000282275800010"}
