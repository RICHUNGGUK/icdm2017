The additive generator of Archimedean t-norms is utilized to reform the existent genetic algorithm to solve the constrained nonlinear multi-objective optimization problems. We consider thoroughly the feasible set of the fuzzy relation inequality systems in three possible cases, namely \"a parts per thousand currency signaEuroe, \"a parts per thousand yenaEuroe and the combination of them. In general, their feasible sets are nonconvex which are completely determined by one vector as their maximum solution and a finite number of minimal solutions. The maximum and minimal solutions are formulated by using the additive generator. Additionally, we present some conditions for each case under which the problem can be reduced. Finally, each reduced problem is solved by the genetic algorithm and the efficiency of the proposed method is shown by some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Solving nonlinear multi-objective optimization problems with fuzzy relation inequality constraints regarding Archimedean triangular norm compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000307294100004"}
