An upper bound of the (uniform) wavelength index for Cartesian product networks with single-hop is established. This result leads to a consequence for the nth power of an arbitrary network with k-hops. In particular. if k = 1, this bound partially generalizes the results of Pankaj [R.K.

As an application, a tight upper bound for Hamming graph with k hops is established and a corresponding open problem is also proposed. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
