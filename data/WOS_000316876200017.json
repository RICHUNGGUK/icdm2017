User information that is extracted by behavior patterns and user profiles provides the essential relationship between individuals. In this paper, we propose an intelligent movie recommender system with a social trust model. The proposed system is based on a social network for analyzing social relationships between users and generated group affinity values with user profiles. In experiments, the performance of this system is evaluated with precision-recall and F-measures.", "paper_title": "Group affinity based social trust model for an intelligent movie recommender system", "paper_id": "WOS:000316876200017"}
