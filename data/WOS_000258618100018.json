Most of the robust and computationally efficient detectors proposed for this task use the autocorrelation matrix of the localized image derivatives. Although the performance of such detectors and their suitability for particular applications has been studied in relevant literature, their behavior under limited input source (image) precision or limited computational or energy resources is largely unknown. All existing frameworks assume that the input image is readily available for processing and that sufficient computational and energy resources exist for the completion of the result. Nevertheless, recent advances in incremental image sensors or compressed sensing, as well as the demand for low-complexity scene analysis in sensor networks now challenge these assumptions. In this paper, we investigate an approach to compute salient points of images incrementally, i.e., the salient point detector can operate with a coarsely quantized input image representation and successively refine the result (the derived salient points) as the image precision is successively refined by the sensor. This has the advantage that the image sensing and the salient point detection can be terminated at any input image precision (e.g., bound set by the sensory equipment or by computation, or by the salient point accuracy required by the application) and the obtained salient points under this precision are readily available. We focus on the popular detector proposed by Harris and Stephens and demonstrate how such an approach can operate when the image samples are refined in a bitwise manner, i.e., the image bitplanes are received one-by-one from the image sensor. We estimate the required energy for image sensing as well as the computation required for the salient point detection based on stochastic source modeling. The computation and energy required by the proposed incremental refinement approach is compared against the conventional salient-point detector realization that operates directly on each source precision and cannot refine the result. Our experiments demonstrate the feasibility of incremental approaches for salient point detection in various classes of natural images. In addition, a first comparison between the results obtained by the intermediate detectors is presented and a novel application for adaptive low-energy image sensing based on points of saliency is presented.", "paper_title": "Incremental refinement of image salient-point detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000258618100018"}
