Three distinct research laboratories have participated in this project so far. The first, a department of naval history, worked on historical documents, especially the logbooks describing all traveling events of the ship. The second, a research laboratory in archaeology, archaeoscience, and history, proposed a 3D model of the ship based on the original naval architectural plans. The third, a computer science research laboratory, implemented a simulation of the ship sailing in virtual reality.", "paper_title": "An Immersive Virtual Sailing on the 18(th)-Century Ship Le Boullongne", "paper_id": "WOS:000367239600004"}
