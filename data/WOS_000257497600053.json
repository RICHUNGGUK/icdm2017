Brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) is an intelligent controller based on the model of emotional part of brain. A modified BELBIC controller has been applied to a sixth order model of the vehicle which should track any normal path. A model with the coupling terms between steering angle and traction force is considered. The simulation results of this controller has compared with a PID based controller. The policies for PID based and BELBIC controller are the same. Controller is designed for vehicle to accelerate according to distance from reference point and to steer according to direction of vector which is defined from vehicle to reference point. According to simulation results it can be seen that the performance of tracking improved using BELBIC controller.", "paper_title": "Designing PID and BELBIC controllers in path tracking problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600053"}
