In particular, for the modal mu-calculus, the most powerful branching temporal logic used for verification, the problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete (even for a fixed formula). The problem remains EXPTIME-complete also for the logic CTL, which corresponds to a fragment of the alternation-free modal mu-calculus. For the logic CTL*, the problem is known to be in 2EXPTIME. In this paper, we show that the complexity of the PMC problem for CTL* is in fact 2EXPTIME-complete. Moreover, we give a new optimal algorithm to solve this problem based on automata theoretic techniques. Finally, we prove that the program complexity of the PMC problem against CTL (i.e., the complexity of the problem in terms of the size of the system) is EXPTIME-complete. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
