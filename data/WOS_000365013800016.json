However, as the man-hours are predicted by experts at shipyards, existing methods have often resulted in incorrect predictions and cost significant amount of time. There have been several attempts made by many researchers to overcome such problems resulting from prediction by experts. Yet, their approaches considered only a limited number of factors such as ship specifications, and were not highly applicable at shipyards. In this study, we propose a system that predicts man-hours with deployable data in different times of manufacturing process and that can be applied in practical shipbuilding. The results demonstrated the possibility that our prediction system could be a good alternative to existing prediction methods.", "paper_title": "A study on the man-hour prediction system for shipbuilding", "paper_id": "WOS:000365013800016"}
