This numerical scheme, named AUFSR (Tchuen et al. 2011), is obtained by hybridizing the AUFS scheme with Roe's solver. This approach handles difficulties encountered by the AUFS scheme, in the case where the flux vector does not check the homogeneous property. The present scheme for multi-dimensional flows introduces a certain amount of numerical dissipation to shear waves, as Roe's splitting. The AUFSR scheme is not only robust for shock-capturing, but also accurate for resolving shear layers. Numerical results for 1D Riemann problems and several 2D problems are investigated to show the capability of the method to accurately compute inviscid compressible flow when compared to AUFS, and Roe solvers.
