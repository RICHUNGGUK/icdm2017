In contrast to previous studies, our method does not focus on a graph model, but rather on a fuzzy relation model, which uses the operations of fuzzy relation to replace a traversal search of the graph for identifying community structure. In our method, we first use a fuzzy relation to describe the relation between vertices as well as the similarity in network topology to determine the membership grade of the relation. Then, we transform this fuzzy relation into a fuzzy equivalence relation. Finally, we map the non-overlapping communities as equivalence classes that satisfy a certain equivalence relation. Because most real-world networks are made of overlapping communities (e.g., in social networks, people may belong to multiple communities), we can consider the equivalence classes above as the skeletons of overlapping communities and extend our method by adding vertices to the skeletons to identify overlapping communities. We evaluated our method on artificial networks with built-in communities and real-world networks with known and unknown communities. The experimental results show that our method works well for detecting these communities and gives a new understanding of network division and community formation.
