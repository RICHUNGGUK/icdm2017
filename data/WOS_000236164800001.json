In practice, since we do not know the classifier to be used after feature selection, it is desirable to find a feature subset that is universally effective for any classifier. Such a trial is called classifier-independent feature selection. In this study, we propose a novel classifier-independent feature selection method on the basis of the estimation of Bayes discrimination boundary. The experimental results on 12 real-world datasets showed the fundamental effectiveness of the proposed method. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
