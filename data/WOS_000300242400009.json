A compact representation of a convex bipartite graph for specifying such an ordering can be computed in O(|V|+|E|) time. The paired-domination problem on bipartite graphs has been shown to be NP-complete. The complexity of the paired-domination problem on convex bipartite graphs has remained unknown. In this paper, we present an O(|V|) time algorithm to solve the paired-domination problem on convex bipartite graphs given a compact representation. As a byproduct, we show that our algorithm can be directly applied to solve the total domination problem on convex bipartite graphs in the same time bound.", "paper_title": "Linear-Time Algorithm for the Paired-Domination Problem in Convex Bipartite Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000300242400009"}
