It was recently shown to remain polynomially solvable when position-dependent job processing times are assumed. In this paper we further extend these results, and show that minimizing TADC remains polynomial when position-dependent processing times are assumed (i) on uniform and unrelated machines and (ii) for a bicriteria objective consisting of a linear combination of total job completion times and TADC. These extensions are shown to be valid also for the measure of total absolute differences of job waiting times (TADW). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
