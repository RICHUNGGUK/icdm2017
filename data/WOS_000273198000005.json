Adaptation of alignment algorithms to music leads to accurate systems, but their extensions to polyphonic music raise new problems. Indeed, a chord may match several consecutive notes, or the difference between two similar motifs may be a few swapped notes. Moreover, the substitution scores between chords are difficult to set up. In this paper, we propose a general framework for polyphonic music using the substitution score scheme set for monophonic music, which allows new operations by extending the operations proposed by Mongeau and Sankoff [15]. From a practical point of view, the limitation of chord sizes and the number of notes that can be merged consecutively lead to a complexity that remains quadratic.", "paper_title": "Toward a General Framework for Polyphonic Comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000273198000005"}
