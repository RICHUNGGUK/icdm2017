Design/methodology/approach - This approach is to apply this to the study of power transformers, in which grain-oriented steel sheets are usually used. In this type of analysis, magnetic characteristics of the steel sheets such as non-linearity and anisotropy, or even the hysteresis, must be taken into account. Findings - The Newton-Raphson method is generally used to solve the system of equations, but it is a CPU-time-consuming task, especially when finite element models and circuit equations are coupled and therefore, time is considered in the analysis. Originality/value - An approach able to deal with different models for anisotropy in the finite element method is presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling of magnetic anisotropy in the finite element method", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900009"}
