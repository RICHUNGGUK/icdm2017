The proposed implementation compresses the image data with the lossless mode of JPEG-LS. When the acquisition of precious content (image) is specified to occur in real-time, then lossless compression is essential. Lossless compression is important to critical applications, such as the acquisition of medical images and transmission of high-definition high-resolution images from space (satellite). The contribution of the paper is to introduce an efficient pipelined JPEG-LS encoder, which requires significantly lower encoding time than any other available JPEG-LS hardware or software implementation. The experimental results show that encoding is performed as expected in high-speed, being able to serve real-time applications. This is the first time that a JPEG-LS implementation offers such a high-speed encoding.", "paper_title": "Efficient high-performance implementation of JPEG-LS encoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000207724100006"}
