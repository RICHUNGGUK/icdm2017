Moreover, for those unclassified cases, we will classify them with the Naive Bayes Classifier The experimental results show that combining the advantages of these two different classifiers better classification result can be obtained than with a single classifier (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Chinese text classification by the Naive Bayes Classifier and the associative classifier with multiple confidence threshold values", "paper_id": "WOS:000280532400013"}
