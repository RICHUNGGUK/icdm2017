To be precise, the neuron becomes selective to successive coincidences of the pattern. Here we extend this scheme to a more realistic scenario with multiple repeating patterns and multiple STDP neurons \"listening\" to the incoming spike trains. These \"listening\" neurons are in competition: as soon as one fires, it strongly inhibits the others through lateral connections (one-winner-take-all mechanism). This tends to prevent the neurons from learning the same (parts of the) repeating patterns, as shown in simulations. Instead, the population self-organizes, trying to cover the different patterns or coding one pattern by the successive firings of several neurons, and a powerful distributed coding scheme emerges. Taken together, these results illustrate how the brain could easily encode and decode information in the spike times, a theory referred to as temporal coding, and how STDP could play a key role by detecting repeating patterns and generating selective response to them.", "paper_title": "Competitive STDP-Based Spike Pattern Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000266106800003"}
