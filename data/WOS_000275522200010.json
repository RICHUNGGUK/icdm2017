To provide, however, a faithful simulation of a system, all components must be accurately modelled and tested, followed by verification through experimental measurements. This paper presents a validation study of the XRayImagingSimulator, an in-house developed X-ray imaging simulator, which is extensively used as a basic tool in carrying out complex breast imaging simulations. The approach followed compares results obtained via an experimental setup for breast phantom (CIRS 011A) imaging, using synchrotron radiation (SYRMEP beamline at ELETTRA), with those from its simulated setup under the same conditions. The study demonstrated a very good agreement between experimental and simulated images compared both in terms of subjective and objective criteria. The combination of the XRayImagingSimulator with our BreastSimulator provides a powerful tool for in silico testing of new X-ray breast imaging approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
