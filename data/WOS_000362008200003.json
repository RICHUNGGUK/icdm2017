The algorithm is based on the principal feature components obtained by stochastic perturbation of a graph. There are three areas of contributions in this paper. First, a stochastic normalized Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph is obtained by perturbing the matrix of a sensed graph model. Second, we obtain the eigenvectors based on an eigen-decomposition approach, where representative elements of each row of this matrix can be considered to be the feature components of a feature point. Third, correct correspondences are determined in a low-dimensional principal feature component space between the graphs. In order to further enhance image matching, we also exploit the random sample consensus algorithm, as a post-processing step, to eliminate mismatches in feature correspondences. The experiments on synthetic and real-world images demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Graph Matching Based on Stochastic Perturbation", "paper_id": "WOS:000362008200003"}
