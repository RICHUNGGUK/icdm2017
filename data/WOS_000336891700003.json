DrillEdge utilizes case-based reasoning with temporal representations on streaming real-time data, pattern matching, and agent systems to predict problems and give advice on how to mitigate the problems. We document the methods utilized, the architecture, the GUI. and the development cost in addition to two case studies.", "paper_title": "A Real-Time Decision Support System for High Cost Oil Well Drilling Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000336891700003"}
