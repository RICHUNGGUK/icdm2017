Assessing reliability of lifelines requires spatial analysis of lifelines with respect to a given earthquake hazard map. In this paper, a GIS-based software for the spatial assessment of lifeline reliability which is developed by using GeoTools environment is presented. The developed GIS-based software imports seismic hazard and lifeline network layers and then creates a gridded network structure. Finally, it adopts a network reliability algorithm to calculate the upper and lower bounds for system reliability of the lifeline under seismic hazard. The software enables user visualizing the reliability values in graphical form as well as thematic lifeline reliability map with colors indicating reliability level along with the link and the overall network. It also provides functions for saving the analysis results in shape file format. The software is tested and validated for an application taken from literature which is a part of water distribution system of Bursa in Turkey. The developed GIS-based software module that creates GIS-based reliability map of the lifelines under seismic hazard is user friendly, modifiable, fast in execution time, illustrative and validated for the existing literature studies.
