The basal ganglia form loops and learn associations from various source areas to target areas of the cortex. We relate these connections to the cortical perception-action hierarchy. We outline examples of routinization and interleaving for the Tower of Hanoi problem, for routinization of motor control, of problem solving action, and of eye movement. We suggest a role for the ventral group of thalamic nuclei in controlling the flow of routine action. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
