Intrusion detection in wireless mesh networks ( WMNs) is especially challenging and requires particular design concerns due to their special infrastructure and communication mode. In this paper, we propose a novel anomaly detection system, termed RADAR, to detect and handle anomalous mesh nodes in wireless mesh networks. Specifically, reputation is introduced to characterize and quantify a node's behavior in terms of fine-grained performance metrics of interest. The dual-core detection engine of RADAR then explores spatio-temporal property of such behavior to manifest the deviation between that of normal and anomalous nodes. Although the current RADAR prototype is only implemented with routing protocols, the design architecture allows it to be easily extended to cross-layer anomaly detection where anomalous events occur at different layers and can be resulted by either intentional intrusion or accidental network failure. The simulation results demonstrate that RADAR can achieve high detection accuracy, low computational complexity, and low false positive rate.", "paper_title": "RADAR: A reputation-driven anomaly detection system for wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283584100010"}
