This interest arises from the possibility of using changes in these nerves as the basis of a simple and non-invasive method for early detection and follow-up of peripheral diabetic neuropathy, a major cause of chronic disability in diabetic patients. Here, we propose one method for automatic segmentation and analysis of corneal nerves from images obtained in vivo through corneal confocal microscopy. The method is capable of segmenting corneal nerves, with sensitivity near 90% and a percentage of false recognitions with an average of 5.3%. The nerves tortuosity was calculated and shows statistically significant differences between healthy controls and diabetic individuals, in accordance to what is reported in the literature.
