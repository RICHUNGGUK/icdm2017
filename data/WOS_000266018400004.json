The approach is based on the use of graphs to capture SNP, Mendelian, and parity constraints of the given pedigree. This representation allows us to capture the constraints as the edges in a graph, rather than as a system of linear equations as in previous approaches. Graph traversals are then used to resolve the parity of these edges, resulting in an optimal running time.", "paper_title": "LINEAR-TIME HAPLOTYPE INFERENCE ON PEDIGREES WITHOUT RECOMBINATIONS AND MATING LOOPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266018400004"}
