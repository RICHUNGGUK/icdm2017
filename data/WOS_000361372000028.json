To ensure the integrity of data storage in cloud storing, researchers have present some proof of storage schemes. In some cases, the ability to check data possession is delegated by data owners. Hence, the delegable provable data possession and proxy provable data possession are proposed. However the schemes are not secure since the proxy or designated verifier stores some delegation information in cloud storage servers. In this paper, we propose PC-DV POS scheme, which can preserve clients' privacy and designate a verifier by the client signed the data blocks. In particular, we utilize group signatures and key exchange to construct homomorphic authenticators, so that only the designated verifier is able to check the integrity of shared data for users without retrieving the entire data, and cannot reveal the identities of signers on all blocks in shared data.", "paper_title": "A Novel Preserving Client Privacy and Designate Verifier Auditing Scheme for Cloud Storage", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000028"}
