However, these topologies are difficult to deploy in practice, especially when re-designing existing systems, because they lead to increased total cable length and cable packaging complexity. In this work we propose a new method for creating random topologies without increasing cable length: randomly swap link endpoints in a non-random topology that is already deployed across several cabinets in a machine room. We quantitatively evaluate topologies created in this manner using both graph analysis and cycle-accurate network simulation, including comparisons with non-random topologies and previously-proposed random topologies.", "paper_title": "Swap-And-Randomize: A Method for Building Low-Latency HPC Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000356138700022"}
