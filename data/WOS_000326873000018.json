Estimation is considered under two censoring schemes: the progressive Type-I censoring and progressive Type-II right censoring schemes. As an application, the EM algorithm is executed to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates for the beta Weibull distribution under the two censoring schemes. A simulation study and two real data sets are used to show the efficiency of the EM algorithm.", "paper_title": "EM algorithms for beta kernel distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000326873000018"}
