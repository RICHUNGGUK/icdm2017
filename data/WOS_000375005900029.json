The perception of this pain has psychological effects on mood, anxiety, and the degree of perceived control. In turn, these factors may increase the experience of pain. This study aims to develop a new virtual environment for the treatment of FM in order to enhance the therapeutic effects of traditional interventions. The first phase included a sample of 19 patients in order to identify common characteristics of the representation of pain and absence of pain, through drawing. The results showed that patients used different colors and different physical states to depict pain (red, motionless) and the absence of pain (blue, in motion). These features were then included in a 3D representation of the human body. ANOVA analysis showed that the degree of anxiety and depression influenced the perceived characteristic of movement.", "paper_title": "Development Of A Virtual Environment Based On The Perceived Characteristics Of Pain In Patients With Fibromyalgia", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900029"}
