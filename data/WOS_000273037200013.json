The importance and huge capital cost of the system leads to considerable attention on seeking the optimal cost design. The necessity for such a sound research attention arises from the complexity associated with the problem. In the recent years, stochastic optimization algorithms like genetic algorithm, simulated annealing, ant colony optimization etc. are found to be successful in exploring the optimal combination of pipe diameters that can satisfy the hydraulic-head requirements with least cost. In this paper, the details on the optimal water distribution network design with a novel technique called honey-bee mating optimization and its validation with two benchmark water distribution networks are presented. From the results, it is observed that the proposed algorithm identifies the optimal solution with relatively less number of evaluations than the other well-established stochastic optimization algorithms.", "paper_title": "Optimal Water Distribution Network Design with Honey-Bee Mating Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000273037200013"}
