The proposed method can deal with fuzzy rules interpolation involving complex polygonal fuzzy sets with the advantages of simplest calculation and get more reasonable fuzzy interpolative reasoning results. We also make some experiments to compare the fuzzy interpolative reasoning results of the proposed method with the ones of the existing methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing fuzzy interpolative reasoning methods for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
