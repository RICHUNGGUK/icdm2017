An affinity function is defined over pairs of adjacent locations. This function is based on the surface's principal curvature directions, which are intrinsic and can be estimated from the surface normals. The values of this locally supported function are propagated over the field of surface normals using a diffusion process. The surface normals are then regularised, by computing the weighted sum of the affinity evolved over time. Finally, the surface is reconstructed by integrating along integration paths that maximise the total affinity. Preliminary experimental results are shown for different degrees of evolution under the presence of noise.", "paper_title": "Diffusion of geometric affinity for surface integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100009"}
