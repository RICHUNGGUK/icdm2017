In the proposed algorithm, the information entropy is employed for measuring the probability distribution of particles; the user's preference information is represented as the ranking of each particle through the possible matrix. The optimal procedure is guided by the preference information since the global best performance of particle is randomly chosen among non-dominated solutions with higher ranking value in each iteration. Finally, the MOPSO-PI is applied to optimize the steelmaking process; the power supply curve obtained reduces the electric energy consumption, shortens the smelting time and prolongs the lifespan of the furnace lining. The application results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective particle swarm optimization with preference information and its application in electric arc furnace steelmaking process", "paper_id": "WOS:000366590800013"}
