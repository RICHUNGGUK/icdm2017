Molecular simulations starting from these model structures give novel insights in the synthesis mechanisms of micro- and mesoporous materials. ZEOBUILDER is presented as an open-source code with easy plug-in facilities. This architecture offers an ideal platform for further development of new features. Another specific aspect in the architecture of ZEOBUILDER is the data structure with multiple reference frames in which molecules and molecular building blocks are placed and which are hierarchically ordered. The main properties of ZEOBUILDER are the feasibility for constructing complex structures, extensibility, and transferability. The application field of ZEOBUILDER is not limited to zeolite science but easily extended to the construction of other complex (bio)molecular systems. ZEOBUILDER is a unique user-friendly GUI toolkit with advanced plug-ins allowing the construction of the most complex molecular structures, which can be used as input for all ab initio and molecular mechanics program packages.", "paper_title": "ZEOBUILDER: A GUI toolkit for the construction of complex molecular structures on the nanoscale with building blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258004300022"}
