Our put-pose is to design tools for extracting the relevant variables and the relevant individuals for an automatic training from data. The objective is to reduce the complexity of storage, therefore the complexity of calculation, and to gradually improve the performance of ordering, that is to say to arrive at a good quality training.", "paper_title": "Neuro-IG: A hybrid system for selection and elimination of predictor variables and non relevant individuals", "paper_id": "WOS:000247791500001"}
