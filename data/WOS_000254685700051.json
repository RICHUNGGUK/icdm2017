When analysis is performed using the finite element method, meshes of sufficient quality need to be constructed automatically. This work presents a structured meshing procedure that creates subdomains for generating good quality Structured meshes in critical flow regions around aerodynamic profiles. Techniques of this nature enable other kinds of problems and geometries to be tackled. To demonstrate its capacity, it was applied to a straightforward shape optimization problem in fluid dynamics via genetic algorithms (GAs), including a preliminary efficiency study for different GA parameter combinations.
