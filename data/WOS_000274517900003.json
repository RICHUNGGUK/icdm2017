Design/methodology/approach - A transmission-line model (TLM) is developed based oil parameters calculated on the basis of electroquasistatic and magnetoquasistatic finite-element (FE) model of the winding cross-section. Findings - The FE formulations for the low- and high-frequency limits give acceptable results for the respective frequency ranges. An eddy-current formulation is only accurate on a broader region when the FE mesh is sufficiently fine to resolve the skin depth. Research limitations/implications - The paper is restricted to frequency-domain simulations. Practical implications - The results of the paper improve the understanding of higher-frequency parasitic effects in electrical drives with long windings. Originality/value - The paper shows the limitations of the FE methods used for determining the parameters of the TLMs and remedies to avoid these.", "paper_title": "Simulation of wave propagation effects in machine windings", "paper_id": "WOS:000274517900003"}
