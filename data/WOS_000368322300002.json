This model is based on grid cycle providing grid capturing,grid sharing, grid enhancing and grid preserving. Moreover, our model shares grid that supports the law of knowledge dynamics. Later we illustrate a scenario of Pudong District of Shanghai for independence issues. An Artificial Neural network (ANN) based simulation applying the proposed Grid Management System model is also described at the end of this paper to validate its applicability.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network based grid computing of E-government scheduling for emergency management", "paper_id": "WOS:000368322300002"}
