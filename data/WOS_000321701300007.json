Recently, several certificateless short signature schemes, which could satisfy the requirement of low-bandwidth communication environments, have been proposed. However, most of them are not secure against either the Type I adversary or the Type II adversary. In this study, the authors propose a new efficient certificateless short signature scheme. The analysis shows the authors' scheme has better performance than the related schemes and is secure against both of the super Type I and the super Type II adversaries.", "paper_title": "New certificateless short signature scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000321701300007"}
