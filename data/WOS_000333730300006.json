Seven research hypotheses derived from this model are validated using a field survey of feature phone users in Korea. The results indicate that users' switching intention is determined by their expectations regarding the disruptive technology and dissatisfaction with the incumbent technology. User dissatisfaction is influenced by disconfirmation of previously held beliefs regarding ones incumbent technology and ones expectations for the disruptive technology. Switching cost is revealed not significant in the decision to acquire a disruptive technology. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
