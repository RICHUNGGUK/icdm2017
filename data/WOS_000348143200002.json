First, the overall image is pre-processed into transform-domain small blocks from which host vectors are obtained via zig-zag scanning vectorization. Multiuser data hiding is performed in the generated host vectors. Under this data hiding system model, we give an orthogonal set of embedding spread-spectrum signatures that achieves maximum sum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio at the output of the linear-filter receivers for any fixed embedding amplitude values. Then, for any given total embedding distortion constraint, we present the optimal multi-signature assignment and amplitude allocation that maximizes the sum capacity of the concealment procedure. The practical implication of the results is sum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, sum-capacity optimal multiuser/multi-signature spread-spectrum data hiding in the digital image medium. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
