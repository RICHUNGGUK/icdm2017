One can show that such operators can be decomposed as sums of products of simpler operators called atomic combinatorial differential operators. In their paper, Labelle and Lamathe presented a list of the first atomic differential operators. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that allows to generate (and enumerate) all of them, subject to available computer resources. We also give a detailed analysis of how to compute the molecular components of Omega (X,D) F (X). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
