However, research on the decision support thereof has been sparse. As negotiations are increasingly conducted over computer networks. we motivate decision support for online group negotiation, present its theoretical foundation, and propose its design and implementation. We also assess its efficacy through theoretical modeling and empirical testing in which coalition formation is examined as the central process mechanism. The experimental results suggest that with the decision support, parties would engage less in coalition formation and achieve better negotiation outcomes. Both theoretical and practical implications are drawn from the study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
