It provides diverse information to users or other service components in Grid environments. In this paper, we propose a scalable GIS architecture for information management in a large scale Grid Virtual Organization (VO). This architecture consists of the VO layer, site layer and resource layer: at the resource layer, information agents and pluggable information sensors are deployed on each resource monitored. This information agent and sensor approach provides a flexible framework that enables specific information to be captured; at the site layer, a site information service component with caching capability aggregates and maintains up-to-date information of all the resources monitored within an administrative domain, at the VO layer, a peer-to-peer approach is used to build a virtual network of site information services for information discovery and query in a large scale Grid VO. This decentralized approach makes information management scalable and robust. Furthermore, we propose a security framework for the GIS, which provide security policies for authentication and authorization control of the GIS at both the site and the VO layers. Our GIS has been implemented based on the Globus Toolkit 4 as Web services compliant to Web Services Resource Framework (WSRF) specifications. The experimental results show that the GIS presents satisfactory scalability in handling information for large scale Grids. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
