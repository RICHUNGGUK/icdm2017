In this paper the constraint of generality is investigated for constructions between behavioral specifications. Constructions informally represent algorithms, and the goal is to prove that generic constructions are definable. In the end we draw a parallel between this work and the \"theorems for free\" for parametric functions in System F by showing how one can derive properties of generic constructions solely from their generality.
