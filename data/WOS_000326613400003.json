Data services (hardware) together with their functionalities (software) are hosted on web servers rather than on single computers connected by networks. Through a device (e.g., either a computer or a smartphone), a browser and an Internet connection, each user accesses a cloud platform and asks for specific services. For example, a user can ask for executing some applications (jobs) on the machines (hosts) of a cloud infrastructure. Therefore, it becomes significant to provide optimized job scheduling approaches suitable to balance the workload distribution among hosts of the platform. In this paper, a multi-objective mathematical formulation of the job scheduling problem in a homogeneous cloud computing platform is proposed in order to optimize the total average waiting time of the jobs, the average waiting time of the jobs in the longest working schedule (such as the makespan) and the required number of hosts. The proposed approach is based on an approximate is an element of-constraint method, tested on a set of instances and compared with the weighted sum (WS) method. The computational results highlight that our approach outperforms the WS method in terms of a number of non-dominated solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
