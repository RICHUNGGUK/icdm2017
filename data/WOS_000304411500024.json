Our approach combines three new models to allow realistic simulation of wet garments: (1) a simplified saturation model that modifies the masses, (2) a nonlinear friction model derived from previously reported, real-world measurements, and (3) a wrinkle model based on imperfection sensitivity theory. In contrast to previous approaches to wet cloth, the proposed models are supported by the experimental results reported in the textile literature with parameters varying over the course of the simulation. As a result, the wet garment motions simulated by our method are comparable to that of real wet garments. Our approach recognizes the special, practical importance of contact models with human skin and provides a specific skin-cloth friction solution. We evaluate our approach by draping a rotating sphere and simulating a typical garment on a virtual human in the rain. Both of these examples are typical scenarios within computer graphics research.", "paper_title": "Physical simulation of wet clothing for virtual humans", "paper_id": "WOS:000304411500024"}
