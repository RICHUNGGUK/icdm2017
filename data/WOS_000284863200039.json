This system involves locating moving objects present in complex road scenes by implementing an advanced background subtraction methodology. The innovation concerns a histogram-based filtering procedure, which collects scatter background information carried in a series of frames, at pixel level, generating reliable instances of the actual background. The proposed algorithm reconstructs a background instance on demand under any traffic conditions. The background reconstruction algorithm demonstrated a rather robust performance in various operating conditions including unstable lighting, different view-angles and congestion.
