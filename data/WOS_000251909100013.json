This compactor preserves all benefits of spatial compaction and offers, due to its overdrive sequential section, compression much higher than the ratio of scan chains to compactor outputs. X-Press is also capable of handling a wide range of unknown (X) state profiles by deploying a two-level scan-chain-selection mechanism. In addition to a new compactor architecture, original contributions of this paper include a detailed analysis of two-level error masking caused by X states and a new algorithm to both rank scan chains and then to determine, in per-pattern mode, scan-chain-selection rules used to suppress X states. Experimental results obtained for a variety of designs show feasibility and efficiency of the proposed compaction scheme, altogether with actual impact of X states on a test-pattern count. Finally, diagnostic capabilities of the proposed scheme accompanied by further experimental results are also analyzed.", "paper_title": "X-Press: Two-stage X-tolerant compactor with programmable selector", "paper_id": "WOS:000251909100013"}
