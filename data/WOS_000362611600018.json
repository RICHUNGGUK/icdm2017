Using both knowledge sources, the technique considers specific word sequences to form what we call word-islands and which are then employed to create the language models and dictionary used by the system's speech recogniser. Word-islands are easier to recognise than the words comprising the islands, which leads to improved spoken language understanding and system performance. Experiments have been conducted using two spoken dialogue systems which had previously been developed in our lab: one to provide fast food information and the other to provide bus travel information. Results show that the proposed technique improves the performance of both systems by improving speech recognition and spoken language understanding of sentence types that are difficult to process.
