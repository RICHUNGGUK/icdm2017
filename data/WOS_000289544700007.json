The nature and kinematic mechanism of the membership functions in the fuzzy-set constitutive model are illustrated. The model's capability of modeling soil dilatancy is investigated. Important features of volume change and pore water pressure build-up related to soil cyclic mobility are captured. The formulation of the proposed model is relatively simple and it can be readily implemented in finite element codes. The enhanced fuzzy-set model is capable of simulating ground motion problems particularly related to cyclic mobility, soil liquefaction, and spreading behavior. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
