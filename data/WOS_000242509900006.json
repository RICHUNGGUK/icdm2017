The formulation proposed, stemming as a modification of the conventional equations for inextensible cables, ensures exact equilibrium after the deformation of the cable. The use of analytical expressions for both the geometrical description of the element and the corresponding tangent stiffness provides high numerical stability to the calculation procedures. The accuracy and efficiency of the formulation are assessed by comparison with available results obtained by other authors using different analytical or numerical approaches. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
