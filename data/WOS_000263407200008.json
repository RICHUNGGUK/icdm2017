However, in GSM/GRPS-like packet-switching-based system, for the server in the Internet, the anonymity of mobile user is workable. In this paper, we present a proposed protocol to achieve anonymous wireless access of the server of Internet on the GSM/GPRS-like system. The proposed scheme is based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptography and the bilinear pairings. It has the merits of Elliptic Curve Cryptography and can be easily applied to the existing GSM/GPRS system.", "paper_title": "Anonymous Authentication for Wireless Access in Internet from Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000263407200008"}
