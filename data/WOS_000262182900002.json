A personalised in vivo pediatric geometry of L5-S1 low-grade spondylolisthesis patient was used to develop a L5-pelvis motion segment model that took into consideration vertebrae, disc and ligaments. The stress distribution in the affected motion segment under axial force only, and for a combination of flexion and extension was evaluated. Predicted results showed that, under all loading conditions, stresses were much higher on the pedicle and in the dorsal wall of the pars interarticularis due to the abnormal geometry which is consistent with clinical observations.", "paper_title": "Mechanical loading effects on isthmic spondylolytic lumbar segment: Finite element modelling using a personalised geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000262182900002"}
