Buratti, J Combin Des 7:406-425, 1999), Buratti pointed out the lack of systematic treatments of constructions for relative difference families. The concept of strong difference families was introduced to cover such a problem. However, unfortunately, only a few papers consciously using the useful concept have appeared in the literature in the past 10 years. In this paper, strong difference families, difference covers and their connections with relative difference families and optical orthogonal codes are discussed.", "paper_title": "Strong difference families, difference covers, and their applications for relative difference families", "paper_id": "WOS:000263891100004"}
