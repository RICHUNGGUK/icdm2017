The initial state of the problem can be completely specified in terms of the mean energy of the ion along the nanotube, its radial energy (which is necessarily quantised given the wall boundary condition) and its angular momentum along an axis parallel to the nanotube. Its time-dependent flux across two boundaries on the two ends of the nanotube is monitored and examined for various initial conditions. Such calculations can serve to model more complicated systems, such as the migration of ions along cellular membranes.", "paper_title": "Study of the passage of an H+ ion along a carbon nanotube using quantum wavepacket dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900081"}
