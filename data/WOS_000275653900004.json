These conditions are obtained by using successively state and output feedback control laws. The obtained results are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The saturating and non-saturating controllers are synthesised for both cases in this work. Three sets of LMIs are presented for output feedback case. Numerical examples are used to illustrate these techniques by using a linear optimisation problem subject to LMI constraints.", "paper_title": "Stabilisation and control synthesis of switching systems subject to actuator saturation", "paper_id": "WOS:000275653900004"}
