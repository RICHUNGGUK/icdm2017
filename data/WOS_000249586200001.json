Many types of rank based selection have exactly the same expected value in terms of the sampling rate allocated to each member of the population. However, the variance associated with that sampling rate can vary depending on how selection is implemented. We examine two forms of tournament selection and compare these to linear rank-based selection using an explicit formula. Because selective pressure has a direct impact on population diversity, we also examine the interaction between selective pressure and different mutation strategies.", "paper_title": "A note on the variance of rank-based selection strategies for genetic algorithms and genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000249586200001"}
