Deploying indoor RFID localization systems facilitates many applications. Previous approaches, however, are most based on 2D design and cannot provide 3D location information. The lack of one-dimensional information may lead 2D-based systems to inaccurate localization. In this paper, we develop an indoor 3D RFID localization system based on active tag array. In particular, we employ the geometric mean to filter the explicit 3D location information with high accuracy. The experimental results show that our system is efficient in tracking objects and improving the localization accuracy.", "paper_title": "Improving Accuracy for 3D RFID Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000304953200001"}
