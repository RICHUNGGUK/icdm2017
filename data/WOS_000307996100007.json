In this paper, we work on the approach of instance weighting and propose an improved naive Bayes algorithm by discriminative instance weighting. We called it Discriminatively Weighted Naive Bayes. In each iteration of it, different training instances are discriminatively assigned different weights according to the estimated conditional probability loss. The experimental results based on a large number of UCI data sets validate its effectiveness in terms of the classification accuracy and AUC. Besides,the experimental results on the running time show that our Discriminatively Weighted Naive Bayes performs almost as efficiently as the state-of-the-art Discriminative Frequency Estimate learning method, and significantly more efficient than Boosted Naive Bayes. At last, we apply the idea of discriminatively weighted learning in our algorithm to some state-of-the-art naive Bayes text classifiers, such as multinomial naive Bayes, complement naive Bayes and the one-versus-all-but-one model, and have achieved remarkable improvements.", "paper_title": "DISCRIMINATIVELY WEIGHTED NAIVE BAYES AND ITS APPLICATION IN TEXT CLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000307996100007"}
