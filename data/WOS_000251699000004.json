We derive a family of construction methods that require the choice of a single background copula. When this background copula is the greatest copula T-M, we retrieve the well-known ordinal sum construction, while in the case of the smallest copula T-L, we obtain a construction method that is dual to the ordinal sum construction. Also nonsingular background copulas lead to suitable construction methods.", "paper_title": "Orthogonal grid constructions of copulas", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000004"}
