This shows that the scale-gluing lemma (Lee in SODA' 05: Proceedings of the 18th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 92-101, Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, Philadelphia, 2005) is tight and disproves a conjecture stated there. This matching upper bound was known to be tight at both endpoints, i.e., when alpha = Theta(1) and alpha = Theta(log n), but nowhere in between. More specifically, we exhibit n-point spaces with doubling constant lambda requiring Euclidean distortion Omega(root log lambda log n), which also shows that the technique of \" measured descent\" (Krauthgamer et al. in Geom. Funct. Anal. 15(4): 839-858, 2005) is optimal. We extend this to L(p) spaces with p > 1, where one requires distortion at least Omega((log n)(1/q)(log lambda)(1-1/q)) when q = max{p, 2}, a result which is tight for every p > 1.", "paper_title": "On the Optimality of Gluing over Scales", "paper_id": "WOS:000292310200005"}
