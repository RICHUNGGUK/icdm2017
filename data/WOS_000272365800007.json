The most influential risk factors included violent crime prior to the crime that leads to the index hospitalization, conviction of the biological father, and no use of psychotropic medications before the age of 18. The main contributions of this study in comparison to previous studies in this domain included the use of multinational setting, greedy Bayesian algorithm, generalized country-independent factors, a merger model with high predictive performance, various measures of predictive performance including relative predictive value, and independent learning and test sets.
