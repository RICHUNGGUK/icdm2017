This paper addresses the power reduction problem in heterogeneous datapaths, while keeping a similar area and execution time with respect to the baseline case. Our specific approach first diminishes the area via fragmentation techniques and afterwards it gives it back with the introduction of Low Power Functional Units (LP-FUs) that occupy more area than their corresponding non-low power counterparts. Furthermore, a fragmentation algorithm more suitable for power reduction is proposed. Results show that it is possible to diminish power by 27% on average (49% in the best case).
