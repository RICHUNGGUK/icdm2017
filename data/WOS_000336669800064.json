In addition, some services in service-oriented IoT are required to be reconfigurable and composable for QoS-aware services. This paper proposed a three-layer QoS scheduling model for service-oriented IoT. At application layer, the QoS schedule scheme explores optimal QoS-aware services composition by using the knowledge of each component service. At network layer, the model aims at dealing with scheduling of heterogeneous networks environment; at sensing layer, it deals with the information acquisition and resource allocation scheduling for different services. The proposed QoS-aware scheduling for service-oriented IoT architecture is able to optimize the scheduling performance of IoT network and minimize the resource costs.", "paper_title": "QoS-Aware Scheduling of Services-Oriented Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800064"}
