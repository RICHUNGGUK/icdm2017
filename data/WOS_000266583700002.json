We adopt the modelling approach of Rene Thomas, which provides a discrete representation of biological regulatory networks. This framework is entirely formalized using labelled graphs with semantics defined in terms of state graphs with transitions. Our theorem offers the possibility to automatically verify whether a subnetwork has autonomous behaviour. It will allow biologists to better identify relevant sets of genes which should be studied together.", "paper_title": "Behaviour Preservation of a Biological Regulatory Network when Embedded into a Larger Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583700002"}
