One well-studied method of forming an Apollonian configuration is to start with three mutually tangent circles and fill a curvilinear triangle with a new circle, then repeat with each newly created curvilinear triangle. More generally, we can start with three mutually tangent circles and a rule (or rules) for how to fill a curvilinear triangle with circles. In this paper we consider the basic building blocks of these rules, irreducible Apollonian configurations. Our main result is to show how to find a small field that can realize such a configuration and also give a method to relate the bends of the new circles to the bends of the circles forming the curvilinear triangle.", "paper_title": "Irreducible Apollonian Configurations and Packings", "paper_id": "WOS:000280905600001"}
