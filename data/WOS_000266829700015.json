When M-ary phase shift keying (M-PSK) modulation and an improved selection decode-and-forward (SDF) relaying protocol with limited feedback are used at the users and m(m a (c) 3/41) receive antennas are configured at the base station, the average bit-error-rate (BER) system performance for statistically similar uplink channels was derived and it was verified by simulations. Under various channel scenarios of interest, numerical and simulation results show that the diversity gain achieved and the BER performance of the proposed system increase with the interuser channel quality, and the full transmit diversity order of two can be obtained for sufficiently high interuser signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).", "paper_title": "A bandwidth efficient two-user cooperative diversity system with limited feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000266829700015"}
