Learning in these types of environments represents an important challenge for learning systems. In this context, the model used for learning should work in real time and have the ability to act and react by itself, adjusting its controlling parameters, even its structures, depending on the requirements of the process. In a previous work, the authors presented an online learning algorithm for two-layer feedforward neural networks that includes a factor that weights the errors committed in each of the samples. This method is effective in dynamic environments as well as in stationary contexts. As regards this method's incremental feature, we raise the possibility that the network topology is adapted according to the learning needs. In this paper, we demonstrate and justify the suitability of the online learning algorithm to work with adaptive structures without significantly degrading its performance. The theoretical basis for the method is given and its performance is illustrated by means of its application to different system identification problems. The results confirm that the proposed method is Able to incorporate units to its hidden layer, during the learning process, without high performance degradation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
