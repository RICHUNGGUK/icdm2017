Being able to detect such scans can help identify a more dangerous threat to a network. Several techniques exist to automatically detect scans, but these are mostly dependant on some threshold that an attacker could possibly avoid crossing. This paper presents a means to use visualization to detect scans interactively.", "paper_title": "Interactive visualization for network and port scan detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000236107800014"}
