First, stability conditions are derived in terms of Linear Matrix Inequalities, using a multiple Lyapunov function; then, algorithms to calculate controllers that ensure closed-loop stability are derived. To show the applicability of the proposed approach, some examples are also provided.", "paper_title": "CONTROLLER DESIGN FOR TAKAGI-SUGENO SYSTEMS IN CONTINUOUS-TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100029"}
