In this paper, we explore the use of the imprecise Dirichlet model for dealing with such information, and we derive both exact results and bounds which enable analytical investigations. However, we only consider a very basic two-component system, as analytical solutions for larger systems will become very complex. We explain how the results are related to similar analyses under data selection or reporting bias, and we discuss some challenges for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
