It is conjectured that the problem is not fixed parameter tractable. In this paper, we present a fixed parameter tractable randomized approximation scheme (FPTRAS) for the problem. More precisely, we develop a randomized algorithm that, on given positive real numbers is an element of and delta, and a given set S of n triples and an integer k, produces a number h in time O(5.48(3k)n(2)ln(2/delta)/is an element of(2)) such that Prob[(1 - is an element of)h(0) <= h <= (1 + is an element of)h(0)] >= 1 - delta, where h(0) is the total number of matchings of size k in the triple set S. Our algorithm is based on the recent improved color-coding techniques and the Monte-Carlo self-adjusting coverage algorithm developed by Karp, Luby and Madras.", "paper_title": "On Counting 3-D Matchings of Size k", "paper_id": "WOS:000265880400005"}
