The actors studied have been countries, research centers and laboratories, researchers, and journals. The thematic map of the major research areas has been established. Most of the research areas, and those that have the greatest representation in terms of number of documents, are related to physics and chemistry. However, biochemistry and cell biology, medicine (pediatrics and pulmonary physiology), and. to a lesser extent, veterinary medicine and food science and technology are also noteworthy in the field of surfactants, which presents a markedly multidisciplinary profile.", "paper_title": "The scientific network of surfactants: Structural analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000237125400010"}
