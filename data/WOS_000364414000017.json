To compensate more reliable transmission, the proposed method uses the error correction capability of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes additionally. The simulation results show that the proposed method can transmit data more reliably than the basic RS coded decode-and-forward (DF) method.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Communication Using the DF Protocol in the Hierarchical Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414000017"}
