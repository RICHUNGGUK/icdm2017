In future mobile networks, mobile users will be able to choose from multiple network operators and service providers. This capability requires the extension of the existing charging collection information mechanisms and billing systems to assist the oncoming mass service offering by independent service providers. In this paper, we present a platform that extends the existing systems to provide for advanced and flexible charging mechanisms and pricing policies. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
