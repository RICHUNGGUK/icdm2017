We apply this generalisation to show how three presentations of syntax-de Bruijn indices, FM sets, and name-carrying syntax-have a relation generalising to all sets and not only sets of syntax trees. We also give syntax-free accounts of Barendregt representatives, scope extrusion, and other phenomena associated to alpha-equivalence. Our presentation uses a novel presentation based not on a theory but on a concrete model U. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
