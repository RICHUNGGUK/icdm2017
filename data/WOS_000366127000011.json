However, the trust (attestations of routing information) translation of TTM only depends on a single hub node and this results in severe threats for the inter-domain routing system. To overcome the deficiencies of TTM, in this paper we improve TTM to Distributed TTM (DTTM) by expanding the single hub node to a set of selected multiple hub nodes; in our DTTM, the task of attestations is distributed over multiple hub nodes instead of on a single hub node. In order to make the hub nodes respond to the case of single node failures, we design a restoration mechanism to recover the network based on the neighbour-ring structure. Besides, we develop Cooperative Secure BGP (CS-BGP) to realize DTTM in BGP. In comparison with SE-BGP, our experimental results show that CS-BGP achieves an improved scalability, reduced convergence time and enhanced security.", "paper_title": "Achieving Inter-domain Routing Security Based on Distributed Translator Trust Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000366127000011"}
