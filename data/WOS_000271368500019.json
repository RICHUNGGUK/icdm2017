Temperature is a primary interfering quantity and its effect must be reduced through algorithms implementing a suitable compensation scheme. Algorithms to reduce the signals coming from continuously running gravimeters for the effect of meteorological perturbations have been developed and implemented in tools running in offline-mode. Anyway, the need for \"on-the-fly\" processing emerges when the recorded signals are used for volcano monitoring purposes, since any information on the volcanic phenomena under development must be assessed immediately. In this paper the implementation, in a dedicated LabVIEW application, of an algorithm performing temperature reduction on gravity signals is discussed and features of the software's user interface are presented.
