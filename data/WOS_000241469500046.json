This is what we call a connection structure for this group of machines. An important innovative feature of our construction method is that we prove (not just simulate on particular and restricted cases) the fact that this structure has good properties in terms of, simultaneously, induced distances (for latency considerations) and cost (for cost considerations). Hence, we propose a distributed multicriteria approximation algorithm.", "paper_title": "Distributed approximation allocation resources algorithm for connecting groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500046"}
