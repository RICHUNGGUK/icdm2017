In the process for predicting the physical behavior of the design, the design components, physical mechanisms, etc. are idealized as models, the contents of which depend on a various factors such as the type of product, the validation objectives, and the design lead time as well as the design's physical features. It is important to examine such modeling knowledge to enhance the rationality and reusability of engineering analysis. This article proposes a concise and comprehensive format for describing the knowledge of engineering analysis, called Engineering Analysis Modeling Matrix (EAMM). EAMM is a matrix of two axes, that is, a modeling aspect axis and a modeling level axis. The former axis consists of target objects, governing principles and behavior, and the latter axis consists of conceptual, mathematical and computational approaches. EAMM takes the form of a nine-cell matrix by combining the two modeling axes, each having the three sub concepts. Seven scaphoid boxes called operation spaces are arranged among the cell spaces. When a designer describes various elements of modeling knowledge in such a format, the association of the cells and boxes enables the designer to organize the modeling process and obtain its overview. The design of a water heater is used as an example to demonstrate the capability of EAMM for description and management of engineering analysis modeling knowledge.", "paper_title": "A Framework of Describing and Managing Engineering Analysis Modeling Knowledge for Design Validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000282176100002"}
