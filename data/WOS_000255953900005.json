(x)overdot(t) = alpha x, t not equal k, t > 0, Delta x = beta x, t = k, x(0 + 0) = x(0), where alpha not equal 0, beta, x(0) is an element of R, 1 + beta not equal 0, k is an element of N, are investigated. The asymptotical stability conditions of the analytic solution of this equation and the numerical solutions are obtained. Finally, some experiments are given. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
