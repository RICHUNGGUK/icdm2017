Here we present a new scheme for BQC that uses the concept of the measurement based quantum computing with the novel resource state of Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) chains leading to more robust computation. AKLT states are physically motivated resource as they are gapped ground states of a physically natural Hamiltonian in condensed matter physics. Our BQC protocol can enjoy the advantages of AKLT resource states (in a multiserver setup), such as the cooling preparation of the resource state, the energy-gap protection of the quantum computation. It also provides a simple and efficient preparation of the resource state in linear optics with biphotons.", "paper_title": "GROUND STATE BLIND QUANTUM COMPUTATION ON AKLT STATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188500002"}
