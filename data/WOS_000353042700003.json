Several case studies involving distillation, reaction engineering, and thermodynamics are treated with the help of this method. The approach is powerful enough to elucidate situations when several turning points occur. Finally, the authors conclude with their experience teaching this technique. Indeed, this methodology was introduced to the graduate students of the nonlinear dynamics course at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM). (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
