This allows us to fit a simple analytical description of the circle of confusion to the different per pixel measures to obtain approximate depth values up to a scale. Our results are comparable to previous work while offering a faster and flexible pipeline.", "paper_title": "Fast depth from defocus from focal stacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364126900009"}
