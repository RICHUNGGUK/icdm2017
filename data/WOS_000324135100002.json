The number of used bins has to be minimized as usually. We show that the absolute performance bound of algorithm First Fit is not worse than 2+1/6a parts per thousand 2.1666 for the problem, improving the previous best upper bound 2.5. Moreover, if the item sizes do not exceed 1/d, then we improve the previous best result 2+1/d to 2+1/d(d+2), for any da parts per thousand yen2. (Both previously best results are due to Epstein, Nav. Res. Logist. 56(8):780-786, 2009.) Furthermore, we define a problem with the generalized LIB constraint, where some incoming items cannot be packed into the bins of some already packed items. The (in)compatibility of the incoming item with the items already packed becomes known only at the arrival of the actual item, and is given by an undirected graph (and, as usual in case of online graph problems, we can see only that part of the graph what already arrived). We show that 3 is an upper bound for this general problem if some natural transitivity constraint is satisfied.", "paper_title": "Bin packing with \"Largest In Bottom\" constraint: tighter bounds and generalizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000324135100002"}
