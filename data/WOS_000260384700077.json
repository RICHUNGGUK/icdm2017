On a desktop monitor, however, seeing the whole model in detail is not possible. In this paper, we present a new, interactive Focus+Context method for visualizing large surface models. Our method, based on an energy optimization model, allows the user to magnify an area of interest to see it in detail while deforming the rest of the area without perceivable distortion. The rest of the surface area is essentially shrunk to use as little of the screen space as possible in order to keep the entire model displayed on screen. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our method with a variety of models.", "paper_title": "Focus plus Context Visualization with Distortion Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000260384700077"}
