This minimum feasible clock period might be reduced by register relocation maintaining the circuit behavior and topology. In this paper, we propose a gate-level register relocation method to reduce the minimum feasible clock period. The proposed method is a greedy local circuit modification method. We prove that the proposed method achieves the clock period achieved by retiming with delay decomposition, if the delay of each element in the circuit is unique. Experiments show that the computations time of the proposed method and the number of registers of a circuit obtained by the proposed method are smaller than those obtained by the retiming method in the conventional synchronous framework.", "paper_title": "Gate-level register relocation in generalized synchronous framework for clock period minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929500014"}
