Light emitting diode (LED) is expected as the next generation lighting source due to its continuously improving luminous efficacy, better color characteristic, and super long life-time. The two lighting sources may coexist in street lighting applications for a long time. A novel HPS and LED compatible driver is proposed which is rather suitable and flexible for driving HPS and LED in street lighting applications. The proposed driver combines the LLC and LCC resonant circuits into a flexible resonant tank. The flexible resonant tank may change to LLC or isolated LCC circuit according to the lighting source. It inherits the traditional HPS and LED drivers' zero voltage switching (ZVS) characteristics and dimmable function. The design of the proposed flexible resonant tank considers the requirements of both HPS and LED. The experiments of driving HPS and LED on a prototype driver show that the driver can drive the two lighting sources flexibly with high efficiency.", "paper_title": "Flexible resonant tank for a combined converter to achieve an HPS and LED compatible driver", "paper_id": "WOS:000359399700006"}
