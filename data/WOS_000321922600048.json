The results show that the planar compounds 1-2 exhibit significantly lower HOMO level than Mes (3) B, owing to the stronger electronic induction effect of boron centers. This feature conspicuously induces a blue shifted absorption for 1, although 1 seemingly possesses more extended conjugation framework than Mes (3) B. Importantly, the reactivity strength of the boron atoms in 1-2 is much lower than that in Mes (3) B, despite the fact that the tri-coordinate boron centers of 1-2 are completely naked. The interesting and abnormal phenomenon is caused by the strong p-pi electronic interactions, that is, the empty p-orbital of boron center is partly filled by pi-electron of the neighbor carbon atoms in 1-2, which are confirmed by the analysis of Laplacian of the electron density and natural bond orbitals. Furthermore, the negative electrostatic potentials of the boron centers in 1-2 also interpret that they are not the most preferred sites for incoming nucleophiles. Moreover, it is also found that the planar compounds 1-2 can act as promising electron transporting materials since the internal reorganization energies for electron are really small.", "paper_title": "Density functional studies on photophysical properties and chemical reactivities of the triarylboranes: effect of the constraint of planarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000321922600048"}
