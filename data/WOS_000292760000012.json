The UPnP AV architecture expands the UPnP technology to realise efficient communication and management. Petri nets are powerful formalism to model, analyse and simulate dynamic systems with concurrent and non-deterministic behaviours. We use Petri nets to model an UPnP AV media player system. Specifically, we simulate the media player in the digital home, by using reachability graph analysis to study the exception handling, data transmission, integrity and potential problems of this system.", "paper_title": "Modelling and analysis of UPnP AV media player system based on Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000292760000012"}
