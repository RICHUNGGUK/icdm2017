In the cloud computing environment, it becomes particularly serious because the data is located in different places even in all the globe. Data security and privacy protection are the two main factors of user's concerns about the cloud technology. Though many techniques on the topics in cloud computing have been investigated in both academics and industries, data security and privacy protection are becoming more important for the future development of cloud computing technology in government, industry, and business. Data security and privacy protection issues are relevant to both hardware and software in the cloud architecture. This study is to review different security techniques and challenges from both software and hardware aspects for protecting data in the cloud and aims at enhancing the data security and privacy protection for the trustworthy cloud environment. In this paper, we make a comparative research analysis of the existing research work regarding the data security and privacy protection techniques used in the cloud computing.", "paper_title": "Data Security and Privacy in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000339753900001"}
