(2007). Finding the most efficient DMUs in DEA: An improved integrated model. Computers & Industrial Engineering, 52(2), 71-77]. The paper shows the problem of using the integrated DEA model and presents an improved integrated IDEA model for determining a single efficient unit. Also the paper indicates the property of the improvements mathematically and a numerical example shows the usefulness and intelligibility of the study. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
