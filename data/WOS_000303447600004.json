The proposed translation techniques (which work also in the converse direction) exploit a graphical representation of formulae in a hybrid of the two formalisms. A major enhancement relative to previous work is that we can cope with the relational complement construct and with the negation connective. Complementation is handled by adopting a Smullyan-like uniform notation to classify and decompose relational expressions; negation is treated by means of a generalized graph-representation of formulae in L+, and through a series of graph-transformation rules which reflect the meaning of connectives and quantifiers.", "paper_title": "A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION OF RELATIONAL FORMULAE WITH COMPLEMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000303447600004"}
