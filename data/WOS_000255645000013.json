Video is one such technology. Computer vision techniques could provide far richer interactivity than conventional devices. With the video input signal, systems could use large-scale, unencumbered motion from multiple concurrent users, leading to more direct, robust, and effective computing. The visual interaction cues paradigm uses a shared perceptual space between the user and the computer. Approaching the problem this way removes the need to globally track and model the user.", "paper_title": "A practical paradigm and platform for video-based human-computer interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000255645000013"}
