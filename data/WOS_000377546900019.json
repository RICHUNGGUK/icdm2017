We assume that the transmitters are equipped with multiple antennas and use MRT, while the typical receiver is equipped with a single antenna and an energy harvesting receiver using time switching (TS) or power splitting (PS) receiver architectures. First, using stochastic geometry and considering the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio, we derive the exact outage probability at the reference receiver in closed-form. Simulation results confirm the accuracy of the derived analytical expressions. Then, we use the delay-tolerant throughput and delay-limited throughput, which are related to the outage probability, as metrics to study the system performance. The results show that for the delay-limited throughput, PS outperforms TS at low rate or at high energy harvesting ratio, respectively. For delay-tolerant throughput, PS always outperforms TS for any energy harvesting ratio.", "paper_title": "Performance of Maximum Ratio Transmission in Ad Hoc Networks With SWIPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900019"}
