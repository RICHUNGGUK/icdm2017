A unified approach is proposed to detect both unknown video repeats and known video clips of arbitrary length. Two detectors in a cascade structure are employed to achieve fast and accurate detection, and a reinforcement learning approach is adopted to efficiently maximize detection accuracy. In this approach very short video repeats (<1 s) and long ones can be detected by a single process, while overall accuracy remains high. Since video segmentation is essential for repeat detection, performance analysis is also conducted for several segmentation methods. Furthermore we propose a method to analyze video syntactical structure based on short video repeats detection. Experimental results on news videos demonstrate that identifying short video repeats is an effective way for video structure discovery and syntactical segmentation.", "paper_title": "Efficient short video repeat identification with application to news video structure analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000245088100014"}
