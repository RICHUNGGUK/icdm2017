Recently, DART, a practical algorithm was introduced for discrete tomography, which was validated in the domain of X-ray computed and electron tomography. In this paper, DART is introduced for magnetic resonance imaging. Using simulation experiments, it is shown that the proposed MRI-DART algorithm is capable of computing high quality reconstructions from substantially fewer data compared to state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods.", "paper_title": "Discrete Tomography in MRI: a Simulation Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000322028300002"}
