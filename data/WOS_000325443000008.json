The median eigenvalues lambda(H), lambda(L), for H = [(n + 1)/2] and L = [(n + 1)/2] are considered. These play an important role in the Huckel molecular orbital model of pi-electron system's. The HL-index is defined as R(G) := max{vertical bar lambda(H)vertical bar, vertical bar lambda(L)vertical bar}. In this paper, bounds on R(G) are obtained. We also prove that for almost all trees, R(G) is zero.", "paper_title": "Note on the HOMO-LUMO Index of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443000008"}
