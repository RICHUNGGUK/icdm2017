However, the ability of MapReduce is limited in two respects by its default schedulers. First, it does not support concurrent services sharing a cloud datacenter and second, it fails to guarantee response time for deadline-constrained services. This paper proposes the Paused Rate Monotonic (PRM) algorithm for scheduling hard real-time tasks on a MapReduce-based cloud. The scheduling performance is analyzed theoretically. We prove a bound on cluster utilization, which can be used as a sufficient condition to test whether a given task set can be scheduled. Both the theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation show that the PRM algorithm outperforms traditional real-time ones by improving the probability that a real-time task set can be scheduled on a MapReduce-based cloud.", "paper_title": "A novel real-time scheduling algorithm and performance analysis of a MapReduce-based cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826700013"}
