Underlying successful mass customization within the digital marketplace, a firm needs a methodology for striking a balance between the degree of customization and product pricing and delivery time-a critical supply chain issue. Providing either too much or too little customization can negatively impact both the business and the customer. This study introduces a decision-making method for product customization. This method takes into account the level of customization, production costs, and the product delivery time and applies the concept of postponement strategy to the product supply chain to boost overall supply chain effectiveness and customer satisfaction. Bicycle customization is used as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the new approach to determine the optimal level of customization in product deployment.", "paper_title": "TOWARD MASS CUSTOMIZED PRODUCT DEPLOYMENT IN E-COMMERCE: THE MODULARIZATION FUNCTION AND POSTPONEMENT STRATEGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000286892300003"}
