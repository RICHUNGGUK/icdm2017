Many actions and decisions are made based on it, specifically the enrollment process. During enrollment, students have to decide which courses to sign up for. This research presents the rationale behind the design of a recommender system to support the enrollment process using the students' academic performance record. To build this system, the CRISP-DM methodology was applied to data from students of the Computer Science Department at University of Lima, PerA(0). One of the main contributions of this work is the use of two synthetic attributes to improve the relevance of the recommendations made. The first attribute estimates the inherent difficulty of a given course. The second attribute, named potential, is a measure of the competence of a student for a given course based on the grades obtained in related courses. Data was mined using C4.5, KNN (K-nearest neighbor), Na < ve Bayes, Bagging and Boosting, and a set of experiments was developed in order to determine the best algorithm for this application domain. Results indicate that Bagging is the best method regarding predictive accuracy. Based on these results, the \"Student Performance Recommender System\" (SPRS) was developed, including a learning engine. SPRS was tested with a sample group of 39 students during the enrollment process. Results showed that the system had a very good performance under real-life conditions.", "paper_title": "A data mining approach to guide students through the enrollment process based on academic performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000288799600007"}
