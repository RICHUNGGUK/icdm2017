These nonsymmetric systems are very large and sparse, so an iterative method will usually be the method of choice. However, such a method may require a large number of iterations to converge, particularly when the timestep used is large (which is often the case towards the end of a simulation which uses adaptive timestepping). An appropriate preconditioner is therefore desirable. In this paper we show that a very simple multigrid algorithm with standard components works well as a preconditioner for these problems. We analyse the eigenvalue spectrum of the multigrid iteration matrix for uniform grid problems and illustrate the method's efficiency in practice by considering the results of numerical experiments on both uniform grids and those which use adaptivity in space.", "paper_title": "A multigrid preconditioner for an adaptive Black-Scholes solver", "paper_id": "WOS:000288707100011"}
