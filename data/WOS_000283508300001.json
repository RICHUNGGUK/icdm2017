In this paper, we provide a survey of the aggregation techniques of intuitionistic fuzzy information, and their applications in various fields, such as decision making, cluster analysis, medical diagnosis, forecasting, and manufacturing grid. In addition, we analyze their characteristics and relationships. Finally, we discuss possible directions for future research in this area.", "paper_title": "Recent advances in intuitionistic fuzzy information aggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283508300001"}
