A large variety of such features has been suggested in the literature. All of them have drawbacks in one situation or the other since their extraction in the image and/or the matching is prone to errors. In this paper, we propose to use two complementary types of features for pose tracking, such that one type makes up for the shortcomings of the other. Aside from the object contour, which is matched to a free-form object surface, we suggest to employ the optic flow in order to compute additional point correspondences. Optic flow estimation is a mature research field with sophisticated algorithms available. Using here a high quality method ensures a reliable matching. In our experiments we demonstrate the performance of our method and in particular the improvements due to the optic flow.", "paper_title": "High accuracy optical flow serves 3-D pose tracking: Exploiting contour and flow based constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000237555200008"}
