We propose a TTSP term graph which is a TTSP graph having structured variables, that is, a graph pattern over a TTSP graph. Let TG(TTSP) be the set of all TTSP term graphs whose variable labels are mutually distinct. For a TTSP term graph g in TG(TTSP), the TTSP graph language of g, denoted by L(g), is the set of all TTSP graphs obtained from g by substituting arbitrary TTSP graphs for all variables in g. Firstly, when a TTSP graph G and a TTSP term graph g are given as inputs, we present a polynomial time matching algorithm which decides whether or not L(g) contains G. The minimal language problem for the class L(TTSP) = {L(g) vertical bar g is an element of TG(TTSP)} is, given a set S of TTSP graphs, to find a TTSP term graph g in TG(TTSP) such that L(g) is minimal among all TTSP graph languages which contain all TTSP graphs in S. Secondly, we give a polynomial time algorithm for solving the minimal language problem for L(TTSP). Finally, we show that L(TTSP) is polynomial time inductively inferable from positive data.", "paper_title": "Polynomial Time Inductive Inference of TTSP Graph Languages from Positive Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000265700800011"}
