In this paper, we propose a differential fault analysis on SEED on the basis of the bit-oriented model. Our fault model on SEED-128 is more flexible than the previous fault model on SEED-128. And our attack results on SEED-192/256 are the first known cryptanalytic results. From the simulation results, our attack on SEED-128 can recover a 128-bit secret key within a few seconds by inducing four faults. However, the computational complexities of our attack on SEED-192/256 are impractical. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
