In this paper, a DNA sticker algorithm for bit-substitution such as cycle left shift is proposed. The proposed algorithm requires two equal long memory strands. The first memory strand stores the original binary string. while the second memory strand stores the resulting binary string, With the proposed algorithm, cycle left shift is performed on a mass of equal long binary strings, and the computation complexity of the cycle left shift is O(n) for all n-bit binary strings. Furthermore. this work indicates that block cipher systems with a 64-bit key are perhaps insecure. This paper presents clear evidence of the ability of DNA computing to perform intractable computation problems. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
