Different parts of persons will possess different characteristics. Applying the same feature extraction and description to all parts without differentiating their characteristics will result in poor re-identification performances. Therefore, a person re-identification algorithm is proposed to fully exploit region-based feature salience. Firstly, each person is divided into the upper part and the lower part. Correspondingly, a part-based feature extraction algorithm is proposed to adopt different features for different parts. Moreover, the features of every part are separately represented to retain their salience. Secondly, in order to accurately represent the color feature, the salient color descriptor is proposed by considering the color diversity between current region and its surrounding regions. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the accuracy of person re-identification compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
