Especially, spatial queries on two sensor networks need a distributed spatial join processing among the sensor networks. Because the distributed spatial join processing causes lots of wireless transmissions in accessing sensor nodes of two sensor networks; our goal of this paper is to reduce the wireless transmissions for the energy efficiency of sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient distributed spatial join algorithm on two heterogeneous sensor networks, which performs in-network spatial join processing. To optimize the in-network processing, we also propose a Grid-based Rectangle tree (GR-tree) and a grid-based approximation function. The GR-tree reduces the wireless transmissions by supporting a distributed spatial search for sensor nodes. The grid-based approximation function reduces the wireless transmissions by reducing the volume of spatial query objects which should be pushed down to sensor nodes: Finally, we compare naive and existing approaches through extensive experiments and clarify our approach's distinguished features.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Distributed Spatial Join Processing in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279250600014"}
