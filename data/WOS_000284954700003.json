As lightweight embedded devices become more ubiquitous and increasingly networked, they present a new and very disturbing target for malware developers. In this paper, we demonstrate how to execute malware on wireless sensor nodes that are based on the Von Neumann architecture. We achieve this by exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability to smash the call stack and intrude a remote node over the radio channel. By breaking the malware into multiple packets, the attacker can inject arbitrarily long malicious code to the node and completely take control of it. Then we proceed to show how the malware can be crafted to become a self-replicating worm that broadcasts itself and infects the network in a hop-by-hop manner. To our knowledge, this is the first instance of a self-propagating worm that provides a detailed analysis along with instructions in order to execute arbitrary malicious code. We also provide a complete implementation of our attack, measure its effectiveness in terms of time taken for the worm to propagate to the entire sensor network and, finally, suggest possible countermeasures.", "paper_title": "Arbitrary Code Injection through Self-propagating Worms in Von Neumann Architecture Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000284954700003"}
