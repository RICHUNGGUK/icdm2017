We are given a subset of the set of ((n)(2)) pairwise distances among n sensors in some Euclidean space. We want to determine the positions of each sensor from the (partial) distance information. The input can be seen as an edge weighted graph. In this paper, we present some efficient algorithms that solve this problem using the structures of input graphs, which we call their cores. For instance, we present a polynomial-time algorithm solving the network localization problem for graphs with connected dominating sets of bounded size. This algorithm allows us to have fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for some restricted instances such as graphs with connected vertex covers of bounded size. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
