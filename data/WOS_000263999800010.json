Though functional and very powerful, they can also be cumbersome and daunting to a novice user, and creating a complex model requires considerable expertise and effort. A recent trend is toward more accessible and natural interfaces, which has lead to sketch-based interfaces for modeling (SBIM). The goal is to allow sketches-hasty freehand drawings to be used in the modeling process, from rough model creation through to fine detail construction. Mapping a 2D sketch to a 3D modeling operation is a difficult task, rife with ambiguity. To wit, we present a categorization based on how a SBIM application chooses to interpret a sketch, of which there are three primary methods: to create a 3D model, to add details to an existing model, or to deform and manipulate a model. Additionally, in this paper we introduce a survey of sketch-based interfaces focused on 3D geometric modeling applications. The canonical and recent works are presented and classified, including techniques for sketch acquisition, filtering, and interpretation. The survey also provides an overview of some specific applications of SBIM and a discussion of important challenges and open problems for researchers to tackle in the coming years.
