Structural properties of ZnO thin films were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Surface morphology and roughness were studied with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Electrical properties were measured at room temperature using a Hall effect measurement system. The influence of sputtering power on characteristics of ZnO thin films is studied. The results indicate that the sputtering powers have great influence on the crystal quality and mobility of ZnO thin films. By using optimized sputtering conditions, high crystal quality ZnO thin films with Hall mobility of 34 cm(2)/V center dot s at room temperature were obtained.", "paper_title": "Influence of sputtering power on properties of ZnO thin films fabricated by RF sputtering in room temperature", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200021"}
