The remarkable advantages of this novel scheme are the complete removal of the volume discretization of the air space and the capability of simulating large-scale complicated geo-electromagnetic induction problems. To achieve this goal, first the Galerkin edge-based finite-element method (FEM) using unstructured meshes is adopted to solve the electric field differential equation in the heterogeneous Earth, where arbitrary distributions of conductivity, magnetic permeability and dielectric permittivity are allowed for. Second, the point collocation boundary-element method (BEM) is used to solve a surface integral formula in terms of the reduced electrical vector potential on the arbitrarily shaped air-Earth interface. Third, to avoid explicit storage of the system matrix arising from large-scale problems and to reduce the horrendous time complexity of the product of the system matrix with an initial vector of unknowns, the adaptive multilevel fast multipole method is applied. This leads to a matrix-free form suitable for the application of iterative solvers. Furthermore, a highly sparse problem-dependent preconditioner is developed to significantly reduce the number of iterations used by the iterative solvers. The efficacy of the presented hybrid scheme is verified on two synthetic examples against different numerical techniques such as goal-oriented adaptive finite-element methods. Numerical experiments show that at low frequencies, where the quasi-static approximation is applicable, standard FEM methods prove to be superior to our hybrid BEM-FEM solutions in terms of computational time, because the FEM method requires only a coarse discretization of the air domain and offers an advantageous sparsity of the system matrix. At radio-magnetotelluric frequencies of a few hundred kHz, the hybrid BEM-FEM scheme outperforms the FEM method, because it avoids explicit storage of the system matrices as well as dense volume discretization of the air domain required by FEM methods at high frequencies. In summary, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt at completely removing the air space for large scale complicated electromagnetic induction modeling in the Earth.
