We have constructed siRecords, a database of siRNAs experimentally tested by researchers with consistent efficacy ratings. This database will help siRNA researchers develop more reliable siRNA design rules; in the mean time, siRecords will benefit experimental researchers directly by providing them with information about the siRNAs that have been experimentally tested against the genes of their interest. Currently, more than 4100 carefully annotated siRNA sequences obtained from more than 1200 published siRNA studies are hosted in siRecords. This database will continue to expand as more experimentally tested siRNAs are published.", "paper_title": "siRecords: an extensive database of mammalian siRNAs with efficacy ratings", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612900024"}
