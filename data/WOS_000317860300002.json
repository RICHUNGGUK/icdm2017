Moreover, its 3D structure complicates this clustering problem. We propose a centroid-based actionable 3D subspace clustering framework, named CATSeeker, which allows incorporation of domain knowledge, and achieves parameter insensitivity and excellent performance through a unique combination of singular value decomposition, numerical optimization, and 3D frequent itemset mining. Experimental results on synthetic, protein structural, and financial data show that CATSeeker significantly outperforms all the competing methods in terms of efficiency, parameter insensitivity, and cluster usefulness.", "paper_title": "Centroid-Based Actionable 3D Subspace Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000317860300002"}
