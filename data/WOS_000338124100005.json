First, how long does it take to schedule an arbitrary set of communication requests? Second, given a set of communication requests, how many of them can be scheduled concurrently? Our results are derived in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) interference model with geometric path loss and consist of efficient algorithms that find a constant approximation for the second problem and a logarithmic approximation for the first problem. In addition, we show that the interference model is robust to various factors that can influence the signal attenuation. More specifically, we prove that as long as influences on the signal attenuation are constant, they affect the capacity only by a constant factor.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for Wireless Capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000338124100005"}
