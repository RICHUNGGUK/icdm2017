Because the cost of the energy consumption in the environment is a dominant part of the owner's and user's budget. However, when considering energy efficiency, resource allocation strategies become more difficult, and QoS (i.e., queue time and response time) may violate. This paper therefore is a comparative study on job scheduling in large-scale parallel systems to: (a) minimize the queue time, response time, and energy consumption and (b) maximize the overall system utilization. We compare thirteen job scheduling policies to analyze their behavior. A set of job scheduling policies includes (a) priority-based, (b) first fit, (c) backfilling, and (d) window-based policies. All of the policies are extensively simulated and compared. For the simulation, a real data center workload comprised of 22385 jobs is used. Based on results of their performance, we incorporate energy efficiency in three policies i.e., (1) best result producer, (2) average result producer, and (3) worst result producer. We analyze the (a) queue time, (b) response time, (c) slowdown ratio, and (d) energy consumption to evaluate the policies. Moreover, we present a comprehensive workload characterization for optimizing system's performance and for scheduler design. Major workload characteristics including (a) Narrow, (b) Wide, (c) Short, and (d) Long jobs are characterized for detailed analysis of the schedulers' performance. This study highlights the strengths and weakness of various job scheduling polices and helps to choose an appropriate job scheduling policy in a given scenario.", "paper_title": "A comparative study on resource allocation and energy efficient job scheduling strategies in large-scale parallel computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345077400019"}
