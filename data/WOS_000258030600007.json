The optimization objectives include power consumption and resource usage. This paper presents a two-stage synthesis approach consisting of the following: 1) core to router mapping and 2) custom topology and route generation. In particular, it presents an optimal technique for core to router mapping [stage 1)] and a factor-2 approximation algorithm for custom topology generation [stage 2)]. The superior quality of the techniques is established by experimentation with benchmark applications and by comparisons with existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Automated techniques for synthesis of application-specific network-on-chip architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000258030600007"}
