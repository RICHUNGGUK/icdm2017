The main purpose of this study is to develop a WSN system for mechanical condition monitoring as the existing mature WSN nodes are not suitable for long-time monitoring of mechanical equipment due to their short working life and low acquisition accuracy. To realize long-time working of the sensor nodes, we designed an energy harvesting board to harvest the energy and transfer energy with high efficiency. Meanwhile, the nodes have the function of high-accuracy acquisition of analog signals and can access various low-frequency and high-frequency sensors. The experiment results demonstrate that the WSN system designed is suitable for mechanical condition monitoring.", "paper_title": "Design of a WSN System for Condition Monitoring of the Mechanical Equipment with Energy Harvesting", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994600006"}
