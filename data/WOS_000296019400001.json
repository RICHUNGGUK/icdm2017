In recent years, it has aroused increasing interest in many areas of image processing and computer vision and has shown its effectiveness in a number of applications, in particular for facial image analysis, including tasks as diverse as face detection, face recognition, facial expression analysis, and demographic classification. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of LBP methodology, including severalmore recent variations. As a typical application of the LBP approach, LBP-based facial image analysis is extensively reviewed, while its successful extensions, which deal with various tasks of facial image analysis, are also highlighted.", "paper_title": "Local Binary Patterns and Its Application to Facial Image Analysis: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000296019400001"}
