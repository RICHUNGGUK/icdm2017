The msa package, for the first time, provides a unified R interface to the popular multiple sequence alignment algorithms ClustalW, ClustalOmega and MUSCLE. The package requires no additional software and runs on all major platforms. Moreover, the msa package provides an R interface to the powerful (LTEX)-T-A package T(E)Xshade which allows for flexible and customizable plotting of multiple sequence alignments.", "paper_title": "msa: an R package for multiple sequence alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000366630400018"}
