Results: We present a new and comprehensive machine learning data mining framework consisting in a non-linear PCA neural network for feature extraction, and probabilistic principal surfaces combined with an agglomerative approach based on Negentropy aimed at clustering gene microarray data. The method, which provides a user-friendly visualization interface, can work on noisy data with missing points and represents an automatic procedure to get, with no a priori assumptions, the number of clusters present in the data. Cell-cycle dataset and a detailed analysis confirm the biological nature of the most significant clusters.
