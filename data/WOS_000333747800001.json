Firstly, the intelligent electronic devices (IEDs) are utilized to store relevant line parameters, obtain real-time voltage and current data, and facilitate communication among the IEDs. On this basis, the adaptive voltage primary and backup protection scheme are put forward according to the relationship between the before-and-after-fault phase voltage difference and the phase current. Simulation results show the automatically adaptive relaying by the proposed protection scheme under different system operation conditions and fault types, and verify the immunity of the proposed method to the introduction and output variation of DG. Furthermore, compared with traditional voltage protection, the proposed protection scheme extends the protection range to a considerable degree.", "paper_title": "A New Adaptive Voltage Protection Scheme for Distribution Network With Distributed Generations", "paper_id": "WOS:000333747800001"}
