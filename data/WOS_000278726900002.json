To develop the method, we have found optimal characteristic rations in simple arrangement of these parameters via performance map method. Despite its simplicity, the resulted system exhibits better transient response in comparison with the systems obtained from existing methods of determining the characteristics polynomials. Numerical simulations are used to illustrate the specifications of the proposed method. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
