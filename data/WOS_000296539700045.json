The used procedural tree model operates by recursively computing all building parts of a three-dimensional tree structure by applying a fixed procedure on a given large set of numerically coded input parameters. The parameterized procedural model can later be used for computer animation. Reconstruction of a parameterized procedural model from images is done by differential evolution algorithm which evolves this model by fitting a set of its rendered images to a set of given reference images. The comparison is done on pixel level of the images through the integration of distances to the nearest similar pixels. The obtained results show that the presented approach is viable for modeling of woody plants for computer animation by evolution of the numerically coded procedural model. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
