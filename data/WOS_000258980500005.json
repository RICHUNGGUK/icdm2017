The new method is able to exploit the spectral information content, to incorporate various a priori information, and to ameliorate the ill-posedness of the tomographic inversion problem. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of this method for simultaneous temperature and species concentration imaging. This method is expected to enhance the practicality of multispectral tomography.
