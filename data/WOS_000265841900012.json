The SC assistance algorithm used haptic attributes as the control goal. VF provided assistance based on trajectory. Shapes,were chosen from the Visual Motor Integration test book and were used to train candidates nondominant hand, using samples recorded from their dominant hand. The results were analyzed using time, trajectory, forces, shape of trajectory, and haptic profiles as metrics. The results indicate that performance of VF and SC were comparable for simple trajectories and SC performed better for complex trajectories.
