Multiple video versions, however, require more server storage and may also dramatically impact cache performance in a traditional cache or in a CDN server. An alternative to versions is layered encoding, which can also provide multiple quality levels. Layered encoding requires less server storage capacity and may be more suitable for caching; but it typically increases transmission bandwidth due to encoding overhead. In this paper we compare video streaming of multiple versions with that of multiple layers in a caching environment. We examine caching and distribution strategies that use both versions and layers. We consider two cases: the request distribution for the videos is known a priori; and adaptive caching, for which the request distribution is unknown. Our analytical and simulation results indicate that mixed distribution/caching strategies provide the best overall performance.", "paper_title": "Caching video objects: layers vs versions?", "paper_id": "WOS:000241890500005"}
