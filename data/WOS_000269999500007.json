The merits of WiMedia MAC such as distributed nature and high data rate make it a favorite candidate in HR-WPAN. Although QoS parameters such as the range of service rates are provided to a traffic stream, the WiMedia MAC is not able to use the QoS parameters and to determine or adjust a service rate using the QoS parameters for the traffic stream. In this paper, we propose a fair and adaptive resource allocation method that allocates time slots to isochronous streams according to QoS parameters and the current traffic load condition in a fully distributed manner. Although the traffic load condition changes, each device independently recognizes the changes and calculates fair and maximum allowable service rates for traffic streams. From the numerical and simulation results, it is proved that the proposed method achieves high capacity of traffic streams and fair QoS provisioning under various traffic load condition.", "paper_title": "A Fair Distributed Resource Allocation Method in UWB Wireless PANs with WiMedia MAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000269999500007"}
