They are referred to here as single-set semantics, and class-of-sets semantics, respectively. Our description of the distinction between these two approaches focuses on the nature of the topological regularity on which they are based (classical regularity vs. epsilon-regularity). It is shown in this note that both approaches may be useful, depending on what information is available. As an illustrative example, an elementary result is given, for a point-membership-classification algorithm, that is sufficiently general to be of practical interest but sufficiently special to be transparent.
