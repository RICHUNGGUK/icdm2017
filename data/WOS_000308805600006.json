Often the number of these features exceeds the number of the samples in the data set. After a feature generation process the problem of feature selection from a set of highly correlated features arises. The proposed algorithm uses an evidence maximization procedure to select a model as a subset of generated features. During the selection process it rejects multicollinear features. A problem of European option volatility modeling illustrates the algorithm. Its performance is compared with the performances of similar well-known algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
