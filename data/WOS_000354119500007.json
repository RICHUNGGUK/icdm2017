This paper concerns with the investigation of the conditions, on the characteristic parameters, under which the function is locally integrable and completely monotonic; these properties are essential for the physical feasibility of the corresponding models. In particular the classical Havriliak-Negami model is extended to a wider range of the parameters. The problem of the numerical evaluation of the three parameters Mittag-Leffler function is also addressed and three different approaches are discussed and compared. Numerical simulations are hence used to validate the theoretical findings and present some graphs of the function under investigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
