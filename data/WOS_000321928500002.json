As shown by Pinsker, under the peak energy constraint, the best error exponent for communicating an M-ary message, M > 3, with noise-free feedback is strictly larger than the one without feedback. This paper extends Pinsker's result and shows that if the noise power in the feedback link is sufficiently small, the best error exponent for communicating an M-ary message can be strictly larger than the one without feedback. The proof involves two feedback coding schemes. One is motivated by a two-stage noisy feedback coding scheme of Burnashev and Yamamoto for binary symmetric channels, while the other is a linear noisy feedback coding scheme that extends Pinsker's noise-free feedback coding scheme. When the feedback noise power alpha is sufficiently small, the linear coding scheme outperforms the two-stage (nonlinear) coding scheme, and is asymptotically optimal as alpha tends to zero. By contrast, when alpha is relatively larger, the two-stage coding scheme performs better.", "paper_title": "Gaussian Channel With Noisy Feedback and Peak Energy Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000321928500002"}
