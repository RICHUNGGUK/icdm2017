The basic idea of the method is simply divide-and-conquer to achieve both computational precision and speed. The load balancing strategies for the permanental polynomial computation are further improved with the help of the theory of parallel machine scheduling in combinatorial optimization. The special structural properties of the matrices are considered intensively so that very high parallel efficiency is, acquired. The algorithm developed in this paper can handle the permanental polynomial of C-60 and even larger fullerenes, which are of interest in applications.", "paper_title": "Computing the permanental polynomial of C-60 in parallel", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200008"}
