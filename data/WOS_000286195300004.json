Many protocols for wireless networks-routing, topology control, information storage/retrieval and numerous other applications-have been based on the idealized unit-disk graph (UDG) network model. The significant deviation of the UDG model from many real wireless networks is substantially limiting the applicability of such protocols. A more general network model, the quasi unit-disk graph (quasi-UDG) model, captures much better the characteristics of wireless networks. However, the understanding of the properties of general quasi-UDGs has been very limited, which is impeding the designs of key network protocols and algorithms. In this paper, we present results on two important properties of quasi-UDGs: separability and the existence of power efficient spanners. Network separability is a fundamental property leading to efficient network algorithms and fast parallel computation. We prove that every quasi-UDG has a corresponding grid graph with small balanced separators that captures its connectivity properties. We also study the problem of constructing an energy-efficient backbone for a quasi-UDG. We present a distributed local algorithm that, given a quasi-UDG, constructs a nearly planar backbone with a constant stretch factor and a bounded degree. We demonstrate the excellent performance of these auxiliary graphs through simulations and show their applications in efficient routing.", "paper_title": "Separability and topology control of quasi unit disk graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000286195300004"}
