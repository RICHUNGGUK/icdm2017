This article presents ExaMine, a system for identifying expertise within a user's social network connections. During the learning phase, the system mines the activities associated with each connection to generate profiles. When the user browses the Web, the system retrieves an ordered list of connections for any viewed webpage. These connections are identified as experts on the dynamic topics of the webpage according to a classification process.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Latent Expertise Mining in Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341587800004"}
