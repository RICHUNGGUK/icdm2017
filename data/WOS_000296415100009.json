Web services composition gives us a possibility to fulfil the user request when no single web service can satisfy the functionality required by the user. In this paper, we propose a new system called PSR for the scalable and efficient web services composition search using a relational database. In contrast to previous work, the PSR system pre-computes web services composition using joins and indices and also supports semantic matching of web services composition. We demonstrate that our pre-computing web services composition approach in RDBMS yields lower execution time for processing user queries despite of and shows good scalability when handling a large number of web services and user queries.
