In order to compare their optimization ability for training adaptive support vector regression, the performance evaluation is accomplished in the basis of forecasting the complex time series through two real world experiments. The model used for this complex time series prediction comprises both BPNN-Weighted Grey-C3LSP (BWGC) and nonlinear generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (NGARCH) that is tuned perfectly by quantum-optimized adaptive support vector regression. Finally, according to the predictive accuracy of time series forecast and the cost of the computational complexity, the concluding remark will be made to illustrate and discuss these quantum optimizations.
