The first general Zagreb index of G is defined as M(1)(alpha)(G) = Sigma(v is an element of V(G)) d(v)(alpha), where d(v) is the degree of v. In this paper we determine the minimum value of the first general Zagreb index in the case alpha is an element of (-infinity, 0) boolean OR (1, +infinity), and the maximum value of the first general Zagreb index in the case alpha is an element of (0, 1), for bipartite graphs with a given number of vertices and edges.", "paper_title": "BIPARTITE GRAPHS WITH EXTREME VALUES OF THE FIRST GENERAL ZAGREB INDEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000275842600016"}
