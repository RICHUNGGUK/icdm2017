In the context of binary spreading codes, the maximization problem is NP-hard with complexity exponential in the code length. A new method for the optimization of binary spreading codes under a rank-2 approximation of the inverse interference autocovariance matrix is presented where the rank-2-optimal binary code is obtained in lower than quadratic complexity. Significant SINR performance improvement is demonstrated over the common binary hard-limited eigenvector design which is shown to be equivalent to the rank-l-optimal solution.", "paper_title": "Rank-2-optimal Adaptive design of binary spreading codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100007"}
