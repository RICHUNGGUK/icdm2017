To address this issue, we propose Vis, a lightweight virtualization approach to provide accurate retrieval of physical memory content without disturbing the execution of the target native system. Our experimental results indicate that Vis is capable of reliably retrieving an accurate system image. Moreover, Vis accomplishes live acquisition in around 100 s, where previous remote live acquisition tools take hours and static acquisition takes days. On average, the performance reduction for the target system is 9.62%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
