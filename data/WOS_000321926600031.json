To provide a more general solution to these challenges, we propose a novel segmentation model that considers global and local image statistics to eliminate the influence of image noise and to compensate for intensity inhomogeneities. In our model, the global energy derived from a Gaussian model estimates the intensity distribution of the target object and background; the local energy derived from the mutual influences of neighboring pixels can eliminate the impact of image noise and intensity inhomogeneities. The robustness of our method is validated on segmenting synthetic images with/without intensity inhomogeneities, and with different types/levels of noise, including Gaussian noise, speckle noise, and salt and pepper noise, as well as images from different medical imaging modalities. Quantitative experimental comparisons demonstrate that our method is more robust and more accurate in segmenting the images with intensity inhomogeneities than the local binary fitting technique and its more recent systematic model. Our technique also outperformed the region-based Chan-Vese model when dealing with images without intensity inhomogeneities and produce better segmentation results than the graph-based algorithms including graph-cuts and random walker when segmenting noisy images.", "paper_title": "Robust Model for Segmenting Images With/Without Intensity Inhomogeneities", "paper_id": "WOS:000321926600031"}
