The study collected genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and autoantibody profiles from a single individual over a 14- month period. The results revealed various medical risks and extensive, dynamic changes in diverse molecular components and biological pathways across healthy and diseased conditions. The current article is a data publication that provides the checklists for the metadata of the proteomics (see Table 1) and metabolomics (see Table 2) datasets of the study. The proposed checklist was recently developed and endorsed by the Data- Enabled Life Sciences Alliance (DELSA Global). We call for the broader use of data publications using the metadata checklist to make omics data more discoverable, interpretable, and reusable, while enabling appropriate attribution to data generators and infrastructure science builders.", "paper_title": "METADATA CHECKLIST FOR THE INTEGRATED PERSONAL OMICS STUDY: Proteomics and Metabolomics Experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000209646300006"}
