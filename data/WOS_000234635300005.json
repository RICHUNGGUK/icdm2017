A search is conducted over the space of permutations of batting orders where simulated annealing is used to explore the space. A non-standard aspect of the optimization is that the objective function (which is the mean number of runs per innings) is unavailable and is approximated via simulation. The simulation component generates runs ball by ball during an innings taking into account the state of the match and estimated characteristics of individual batsmen. The methods developed in the paper are applied to the national team of India based on their performance in one-day international cricket matches. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
