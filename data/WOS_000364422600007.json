In this paper we propose an unsupervised approach to mine discriminative parts for object detection. This work features three aspects. First, we introduce an unsupervised, exemplar-based training process for part detection. We generate initial parts by selective search and then train part detectors by exemplar SVM. Second, a part selection model based on consistency and distinctiveness is constructed to select effective parts from the candidate pool. Third, we combine discriminative part mining with the deformable part model (DPM) for object detection. The proposed method is evaluated on the PASCAL VOC2007 and VOC2010 datasets. The experimental results demons-trate the effectiveness of our method for object detection.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Middle-Level Parts Mining for Object Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422600007"}
