We derive two different interference graphs based on the cellular channel statistics, namely, the enhanced interference graph (EIG) and simplified interference graph (SIG). For EIG, the edge between two UEs is associated with the weight value related to the interference state between them; whereas for SIG, the edge between two UEs exists only when they interfere with each other. Given that the LTE uplink resource allocation is NP-hard, heuristic algorithms are proposed based on EIG and SIG, respectively, to give solutions with reasonable complexity. The system-level simulation results show that all the algorithms can mitigate the inter-cell interference significantly. EIG-based algorithm has the better fairness relative to SIG-based algorithms, however SIG-based algorithms are preferred in terms of throughput, complexity, and overhead. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
