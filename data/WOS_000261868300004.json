We argue that microsimulation modelling is not entirely effective in the representation of student populations. Alternative approaches using both spatial interaction models and student agents are presented and evaluated. The results from the agent-based model are found to be particularly encouraging. We suggest that agent-based modelling and microsimulation are powerful as complementary technologies for individual-based modelling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
