By using deadline-constrained flooding collector dissemination and P2P-like information collection schemes. PIVOT provides an active mechanism to collect application-specific resource information In particular. PIVOT provides a resource information service for application-specific schedulers The best-effort performance on overhead traffic and communication latency during information discovery is guaranteed by two new distributed cooperative algorithms The experimental results in the simulations and real computational grid platform demonstrate that PIVOT has a high level of adaptability lot application-specific resource information discovery. and also improves the accuracy of resource allocation and the efficiency of executing parallel tasks in traditional information services (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
