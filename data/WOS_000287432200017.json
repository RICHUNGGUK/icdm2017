Our numerical method is based on an integration factor method for solving the IODE and a time-splitting sine pseudospectral method for solving the GPEs. Our numerical method keeps well the dynamical properties of the mathematical model and have spectral accuracy in space. Through extensive numerical simulations, we analyze which factors may be useful for uniting Bose-Einstein condensates in optical resonators and study the possible way of dynamically uniting two Bose-Einstein condensates in optical resonators.
