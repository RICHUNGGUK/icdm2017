The use of the grid provides access to the substantial data storage and processing power, which are necessary to translate such models from computational tools into genuine planning aids. As well as providing access to virtualized compute resources, the architecture allows customized applications to meet the needs of an array of potential user organizations. A number of key obstacles in the deployment and integration of e-Science services are identified. These include the high computational costs of simulation modeling at the microscale for typical \"what if'' scenario questions in research and policy settings; the management and technical issues relating to security in licensing common data sources; sociocultural, legal, and administrative restrictions on the privacy of individual-level response data; and the slow development and lack of uptake of agreed standards such as JSR-168 compliant portlets in the construction of useable applications.", "paper_title": "MoSeS A Grid-Enabled Spatial Decision Support System", "paper_id": "WOS:000270984300004"}
