As result, the operation by one operator and more intuitive operation method are proposed to improve ASCI's operation method which need one person with a remote joystick and another operating an excavator. The human-robot cooperative system can cope with various and untypical constructing environment through the real-time interacting with a human, robot and constructing environment simultaneously. The physical power of a robot system helps a human to handle heavy construction materials with relatively scaled-down load. Also, a human can feel and response the force reflected from robot end effecter acting with working environment. This paper presents the feasibility study regarding the application of the proposed human-robot cooperation control for construction robot through experiments on a 2DOF manipulator.", "paper_title": "Human-robot cooperation control for installing heavy construction materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000244684400010"}
