The difference between success and failure in such a competitive market often rests in the ability to deliver advertisements that are closely in line with a user's interests. In this work, we propose and test a new online advertisement targeting technique which adapts and utilizes several powerful and well tested information retrieval and lexical techniques to develop an estimate of a user's affinity for particular products and services based on an analysis of a user's web surfing behavior. This new online ad targeting technique performs extremely well in Our empirical tests. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
