As these spaces contain less smooth functions, a larger number of problems could be solved in this framework, and by a suitable choice of weighting functions, additional design objectives could be achieved using the present formulation. Moreover, any solution of the W-1,W-p, p = 2, infinity problem, is automatically a solution of the corresponding H-p-problem. Sufficient conditions for the solvability of the problems are given in terms of new Hamilton-Jacobi equations (HJEs). These new HJEs may also be easier to solve because of the additional degrees of freedom offered by the current norms. Both the state-feedback and output-feedback problems are discussed. The results are then specialised to linear systems, in which case the solutions are characterised in terms of new algebraic-Riccati equations.", "paper_title": "Extending nonlinear H-2, H-infinity optimisation to W-1,W-2, W-1,W-infinity spaces - part I: optimal control", "paper_id": "WOS:000287649700018"}
