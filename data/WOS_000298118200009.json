Existing dynamic programming algorithms used to parse sentences under these models have running time of O(|w|(4)), where w is the input string. A 2-LCFG is splittable if the left arguments of a lexical head are always independent of the right arguments, and vice versa. When a 2-LCFGs is splittable, parsing time can be asymptotically improved to O(|w|(3)). Testing this propertyis therefore of central interest to parsing efficiency. In this article, however, we show the negative result that splittability of 2-LCFGs is undecidable.", "paper_title": "Splittability of Bilexical Context-Free Grammars is Undecidable", "paper_id": "WOS:000298118200009"}
