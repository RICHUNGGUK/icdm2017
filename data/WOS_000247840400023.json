Another type of single input type fuzzy reasoning method proposed by Hayashi et al. (we call it \"Single Input Connected fuzzy reasoning method\" (SIC method, for short) in this paper) uses rule modules to each input item as well as SIRMs method. We expect that inference results of SIRMs method and SIC method have monotonicity if the antecedent parts and consequent parts of fuzzy rules in SIRMs rule modules have monotonicity. However, this paper points out that even if fuzzy rules in SIRMs rule modules have monotonicity, the inference results do not necessarily have monotonicity. Moreover, it clarifies the conditions for the monotonicity of inference results by SIRMs method and SIC method.", "paper_title": "On the monotonicity of single input type fuzzy reasoning methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400023"}
