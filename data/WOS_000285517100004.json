It is shown that the number of paths in an MTBDD (SBDD) can be uniquely determined by values of specific weighted-autocorrelation coefficients. An analytical expression for the number of paths as a linear function of the values of the weighted-autocorrelation coefficients is presented. Based on this expression, a method of minimization of the number of paths is proposed. The method is based on replacing the initial set of input variables with their linear combinations. By using this method, a deterministic paths-reduction procedure, which provides MTBDDs and SBDDs with a reduced number of paths, is presented. The efficiency of the suggested approach is demonstrated on benchmark functions.", "paper_title": "Determining the Number of Paths in Decision Diagrams by Using Autocorrelation Coefficients", "paper_id": "WOS:000285517100004"}
