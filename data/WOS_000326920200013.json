However, since ADS-B messages are unauthenticated, it is easy to insert fake aircrafts into the system via spoofing or insertion of false messages. Unfortunately, the authentication for ADS-B messages has not yet been well studied. In this paper, we propose an efficient broadcast authentication scheme with batch verification for ADS-B messages which employs an identity-based signature (IBS). Security analysis indicates that our scheme can achieve integrity and authenticity of ADS-B messages, batch verification, and resilience to key leakage. Performance evaluation demonstrates that our scheme is computationally efficient for the typical avionics devices with limited resources, and it has low communication overhead well suitable for low-bandwidth ADS-B data link.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Broadcast Authentication Scheme with Batch Verification for ADS-B Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000326920200013"}
