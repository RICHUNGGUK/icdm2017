Each segment of the approximate offset surface and the corresponding segment of the original surface are proved to be of the same function type. After affine transformation, the geometric invariance of the original surface is proved to be retained in the approximate offset surface. The numerical example demonstrated the efficiency of our method.", "paper_title": "Using Affine Transformation to Obtain Approximate Offset Surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000265103800023"}
