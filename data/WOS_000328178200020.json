A nonlinear model predictive formation controller (NMPFC) for target perception was implemented to converge a group of mobile robots toward a desired target. The team must also maintain a desired formation following a target while it is moving, or follow a leader in the case of target's absence. The structure details of the controller, as well as a mathematical analysis of the formation model used, are presented. Furthermore, results of simulations and experiments with real robots are presented and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
