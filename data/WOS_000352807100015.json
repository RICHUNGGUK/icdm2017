The finite element discretization of the filter equation on a structured grid results in a discrete compact filter. The proposed filter is significantly less dissipative than Germano's differential filter, while completely suppresses fluctuations at the grid cutoff frequency. Manufactured solutions were used to verify the performance of the proposed filter. The results suggest that the proposed filter will be very effective for explicit filtering and approximate deconvolution modeling in Large Eddy Simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
