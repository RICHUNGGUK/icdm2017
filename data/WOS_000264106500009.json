We propose to use a novel hybrid geometric- and image-based rendering (GIBR) method to achieve photo realistic representation of textile products. The image-based technique, with its radiance synthesis algorithm, enables us to recover the reflectance properties of textile in an environment photo, and thus can render the appearance of textile material. The geometry-based technique, with its traditional illumination model of assigning illumination parameters extracted from the original scene (such as radiance and chroma dispatch), makes it possible to interactively manipulate 3D virtual objects in the \"real\" environment. Our realistic textile rendering method has advantages over the traditional ones in its easiness to implement and its wide range of applications.", "paper_title": "A hybrid rendering algorithm for textile objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000264106500009"}
