The new method takes full advantage of two scaling strategies: Multiple Bitplanes Grouping (MBG) and Partial Bitplanes Scaling (PBS). According to different importance of ROI and BG (background) bitplanes, the MBG divides all bitplanes into three parts: MSRB, GSRB and LSB. Then, the PBS scheme completes all bitplanes shift. When MROIs are coded in an image, the new method can adjust the bitplane scaling value of every ROI in GSRB based on the degree of interest of ROI. The experimental results show the new method not only has the advantages of the Maxshift method, but also supports MROls coding in different degrees of interest without any ROI shape information.", "paper_title": "New multiple regions of interest coding using partial bitplanes scaling for medical image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300039"}
