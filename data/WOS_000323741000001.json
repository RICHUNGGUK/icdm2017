In this paper, we report a study designed to investigate whether the software evolution categories proposed by Lanza can be used to explain not only the growth of a system in terms of lines of code (LOC), but also in terms of metrics from the Chidamber and Kemerer (CK) object-oriented metrics suite. Our results show that high levels of recall (ranging on average from 52 to 72 %) are achieved when using LOC to predict the evolution of coupling and size. For cohesion, we have achieved smaller recall rates (< 27 % on average).", "paper_title": "Mining the impact of evolution categories on object-oriented metrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000323741000001"}
