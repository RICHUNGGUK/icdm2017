Most of the previous approaches made use of an identical primitive domain to parameterize a mesh model. In recent works of mesh parameterization, more flexible and attractive methods that can create direct mappings between two meshes have been reported. These mappings are called \"cross-parameterization\" and typically preserve semantic feature correspondences between target meshes. This paper proposes a novel approach for parameterizing a mesh into another one directly. The main idea of our method is to combine a competitive learning and a least-square mesh techniques. It is enough to give some semantic feature correspondences between target meshes, even if they are in different shapes or in different poses.", "paper_title": "3D Triangular Mesh Parameterization with Semantic Features Based on Competitive Learning Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000261359100021"}
