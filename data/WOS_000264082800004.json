Direct laser modulation and externally modulated links have been investigated, and demonstrations of single-mode fiber and multi-mode fiber systems are presented. The wireless networks studied range from personal area networks ( such as ZigBee and ultrawideband) through wireless local area networks to wireless metropolitan area networks (WiMAX) and third-generation mobile communications systems. The performance of the radio-over-fiber transmission is referenced to the specifications of the relevant standard, protocol operation is verified, and complete network demonstrations are implemented.
