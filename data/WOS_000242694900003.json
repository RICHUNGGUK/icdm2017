Salient features of robot localization are that the system is partially dynamic and information for fitness evaluation is incomplete and corrupted by noise. In this research, variations to the above three evolutionary computing techniques are proposed to tackle the specific dynamic and noisy system. Their performances are compared based on simulation and experiment results and the feasibility of the proposed approach to mobile robot localization is demonstrated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
