Our pseudo-dynamics model consists of a static equilibrium Model, Which call handle the bending of a curved beam loaded by ail arbitrary force in three-dimensions, and a dynamic motion model that describes the dynamic response of the beam subjected to turbulence. Using the static equilibrium model, we call apply it to controlling the free bending of petioles and branches. Furthermore, We extend it to a surface deformation model that call deform some flexible laminae. Based on a mass spring system, we analyze the property of dynamic response of a cantilever beam in turbulence with various combinations of f(0) and e, and we give some guidelines to determine the combination types of branches and leaves according to their shapes and stiffness. The main advantage of our techniques is that we are. able to deform curved branches and some flexible leaves dynamically by taking account of their structures. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed method is effective by showing various motions of leaves and branches with different model parameters.
