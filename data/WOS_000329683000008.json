The reason may be the lack of standards and specifications to specify learning processes unambiguously. The work presented in this paper try to solve such problem with two main contributions: the creation of a OKI-OSID metamodel to specify learning processes unambiguously, and the creation of a system that creates automatically partial implementations of learning processes from the OKI-OSID metamodel. Furthermore, an implementation of the method is also provided as well as some insights about the problems found in OKI-OSID and the underspecifications these lacks produces. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
