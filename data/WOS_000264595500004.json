This paper presents a practical video analysis system to facilitate semantic content understanding. A physics-based algorithm is designed for ball tracking and 3D trajectory reconstruction in basketball videos and shooting location statistics can be obtained. The 2D-to-3D inference is intrinsically a challenging problem due to the loss of 3D information in projection to 2D frames. One significant contribution of the proposed system lies in the integrated scheme incorporating domain knowledge and physical characteristics of ball motion into object tracking to overcome the problem of 2D-to-3D inference. With the 2D trajectory extracted and the camera parameters calibrated, physical characteristics of ball motion are involved to reconstruct the 3D trajectories and estimate the shooting locations. Our experiments on broadcast basketball videos show promising results. We believe the proposed system will greatly assist intelligence collection and statistics analysis in basketball games.
