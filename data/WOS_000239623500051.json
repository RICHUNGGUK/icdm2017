To decrease the complexity of computation, the idea of granular computing is applied to lower the rank of discernibility matrix. In addition, the absorptivity based on bit-vector computation is proposed to simplify computation of relative core and relative reducts.", "paper_title": "Application of granular computing in knowledge reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500051"}
