It proposes a specific structure for the supporting information accompanying the arguments that agents exchange during a dialogue, it defines formally how this information relates to the agent theory, and assigns to it semantics that is associated to each of the atomic dialogue types of the Walton-Krabbe typology. This allows the formal definition of necessary and sufficient initiation and acceptance conditions of licit dialectical shifts that are necessary for the modelling of embedded agent dialogues.", "paper_title": "Argumentation based modelling of embedded agent dialogues", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626900011"}
