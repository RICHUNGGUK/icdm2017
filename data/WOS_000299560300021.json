This paper examines the electrical characterization of vertical intertier connections such as through silicon via (TSV) and microbumps considering process variations and studies their timing impact on the circuit level. We first provide parasitic RC characteristics of intertier connections including TSV and microbumps and examine their delay. Then circuit simulation is performed to evaluate the timing impact of intertier connections.", "paper_title": "Electrical Characterization for Intertier Connections and Timing Analysis for 3-D ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560300021"}
