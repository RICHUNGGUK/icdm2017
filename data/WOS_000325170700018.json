While the existing studies mainly focus on the packet transmission delay due to medium access control (MAC), our new EED metric further takes into account the queuing delay at the MAC layer. In particular, in the MR-MC context, we develop a generic iterative approach to compute the multiradio achievable bandwidth (MRAB) for a path, taking the impact of inter-/intraflow interference and space/channel diversity into consideration. The MRAB is then combined with the EED to form the metric weighted end-to-end delay (WEED). As a byproduct of MRAB, a channel diversity coefficient is defined to quantitatively represent the channel diversity for a given path. Moreover, we design and implement a distributed WEED-based routing protocol for MR-MC wireless networks by extending the well-known AODV protocol. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the performance of EED/WEED-based routing, with comparison to some existing well-known routing metrics.", "paper_title": "Routing Metrics for Minimizing End-to-End Delay in Multiradio Multichannel Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325170700018"}
