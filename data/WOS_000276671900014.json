Recent research has unveiled some of the mathematical foundations of the problem, but a practical algorithm which can handle realistic sequences is still missing. In this paper, we discuss the requirements for such an algorithm, highlight theoretical issues and practical problems, and describe how a static structure-from-motion framework needs to be extended to handle real dynamic scenes. Theoretical issues include different situations in which the number of independently moving scene objects changes: Moving objects can enter or leave the field of view, merge into the static background (e. g., when a car is parked), or split off from the background and start moving independently. Practical issues arise due to small freely moving foreground objects with few and short feature tracks. We argue that all of these difficulties need to be handled online as structure-from-motion estimation progresses, and present an exemplary solution using the framework of probabilistic model-scoring.", "paper_title": "Multibody Structure-from-Motion in Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000276671900014"}
