However, traditional join processing mostly relies on string equality comparisons. Given the growing demand for ad-hoc data analysis, we have seen an increasing number of scenarios where the desired join relationship is not equi-join. For example, in a spreadsheet environment, a user may want to join one table with a subject column country-name, with another table with a subject column country-code. Traditional equi-join cannot handle such joins automatically, and the user typically has to manually find an intermediate mapping table in order to perform the desired join. We develop a SEMA-JOIN approach that is a first step toward allowing users to perform semantic join automatically, with a click of the button. Our main idea is to utilize a data-driven method that leverages a big table corpus with over 100 million tables to determine statistical correlation between cell values at both row-level and column-level. We use the intuition that the correct join mapping is the one that maximizes aggregate pairwise correlation, to formulate the join prediction problem as an optimization problem. We develop a linear program relaxation and a rounding argument to obtain a 2-approximation algorithm in polynomial time. Our evaluation using both public tables from the Web and proprietary Enterprise tables from a large company shows that the proposed approach can perform automatic semantic joins with high precision for a variety of common join scenarios.", "paper_title": "SEMA-JOIN: Joining Semantically-Related Tables Using Big Table Corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800003"}
