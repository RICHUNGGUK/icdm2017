The construction takes advantage of Schnyder tree decompositions of plane triangulations. This bijection yields an interpretation of the formula for the number of plane triangulations with n vertices. Moreover, the construction is simple enough to induce a linear random sampling algorithm, and an explicit information theory optimal encoding. Finally, we extend our bijection approach to triangulations of a polygon with k sides with in inner vertices, and develop in passing new results about Schnyder tree decompositions for these objects.", "paper_title": "Optimal coding and sampling of triangulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500013"}
