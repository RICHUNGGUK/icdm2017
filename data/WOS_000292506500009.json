In the emotion modeling theory of emotional Markov chain model (eMCM) for spontaneous transfer and emotional hidden Markov model (eHMM) for stimulated transfer, there are three problems: 1) Emotion distinguishing problem: whether adjusting parameters of the model have any effects on individual emotions; 2) How much effect the change makes; 3) The problem of different initial emotional states leading to different resultant emotions from a given stimuli. To solve these problems, a research method of individual emotional difference is proposed based on metric multidimensional scaling theory. Using a dissimilarity matrix, a scalar product matrix is calculated. Subsequently, an individual attribute reconstructing matrix can be obtained by principal component factor analysis. This can display individual emotion difference with low dimension. In addition, some mathematical proofs are carried out to explain experimental results. Synthesizing the results and proofs, corresponding conclusions are obtained. This new method provides guidance for the adjustment of parameters of emotion models in artificial emotion theory.", "paper_title": "Individual difference of artificial emotion applied to a service robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000292506500009"}
