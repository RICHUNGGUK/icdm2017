In total 358 partition coefficients were collected. The experimental log K(blood) data were con-elated with expressions based on both the Abraham model and Goss modified Abraham model. Species indicator variables were added to the basic models to provide for interspecies variability in the observed log K(blood) data. The derived correlations describe the experimental log K(blood) data to within an approximate standard deviation of 0.31 log units. Training and test set analyses were used to validate the derived correlation models.", "paper_title": "Correlation of human and animal air-to-blood partition coefficients with a single linear free energy relationship model", "paper_id": "WOS:000259888600006"}
