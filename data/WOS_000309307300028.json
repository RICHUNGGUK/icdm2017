This interactive learning environment also foresees the use of a virtual theatre, by which students can manipulate 3D contents (parameterized models of expressive faces called \"Talking Heads\"), in order to realize a computer performance on the explanation of Chaos concepts. After an entry assessment of subjects' information on Chaos, 30 high school students aged between 16 and 18 have manipulated real and virtual objects related to Chua's circuit. Then they have written a script on Chaos topic, manipulated the Talking Heads for the realization of a virtual theatre performance, and filled a Chaos knowledge questionnaire and a motivation test. The control group (30 students) has attended traditional lessons on Chaos, and compiled the same tests. Results enhance the great potentiality of the realized setting for science education and motivation. In particular, very positive results in learning, as well as an increase of motivation linked to interest/enjoyment and competence, have been demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
