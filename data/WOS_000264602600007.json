We are interested in the connection between the neighbors of a tile in the tiling and its topology. We show that lattice and p2-tiles always have at least six neighbors. We characterize self-affine tiles that are homeomorphic to a disk in a rather easy way by the set and number of neighbors of the central tile in the tiling. This extends the work of Bandt and Wang devoted to lattice self-affine disk-like tiles of the plane.", "paper_title": "On a Theorem of Bandt and Wang and Its Extension to p2-tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000264602600007"}
