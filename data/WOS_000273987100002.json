Optical interconnections are attractive due to their high bandwidth and concurrent access to the bus in a pipelined fashion. The Linear Array with Reconfigurable Pipelined Bus System (LARPBS) model is a powerful optical bus system that combines both the advantages of optical buses and reconfiguration. To increase the scalability of the LARPBS model, we propose a two-dimensional extension: a simplified two-dimensional Array with Reconfigurable Pipelined Bus System (2D ARPBS). While achieving better scalability, we show the effectiveness of this newly proposed model by designing two novel optimal sorting algorithms on this model. The first sorting algorithm is an extension of Leighton's seven-phase columnsort algorithm that eliminates the restriction of sorting only an r x s array, where r >= s(2), and sorts an n x n array in O(log n) time. The second one is an optimal multiway mergesort algorithm that uses a novel processor efficient two-way mergesort algorithm and a novel multiway merge scheme to sort n(2) items in O(log n) time. Using an optimal sorting algorithm Pipelined Mergesort designed for the LARPBS model as a building block, we extend our research on parallel sorting on the LARPBS to a more scalable 2D ARPBS model and achieve optimality in both sorting algorithms.", "paper_title": "Optimal Sorting Algorithms for a Simplified 2D Array with Reconfigurable Pipelined Bus System", "paper_id": "WOS:000273987100002"}
