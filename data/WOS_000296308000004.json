The accuracy rates of the cabbage coverage estimated using an unmixing method from AVNIR-2 and QuickBird imagery were almost the same. This result is very interesting, because it shows that we may be able to evaluate cabbage coverage using remote sensing data obtained at different spatial resolutions on different observation days. Thus, it would be possible to use different remote sensing imagery systems to evaluate cabbage conditions during the growing period using this proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
