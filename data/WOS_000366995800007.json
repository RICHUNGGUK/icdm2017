First of all, the Bat Algorithm (BA) was improved from two aspects: firstly, the random vector beta was adjusted adaptively according to bats fitness so that the pulse frequency had the adaptive ability. Secondly, bats were guided to move by the average position of all the best individuals before the current iteration so that the speed had variable performance; Then in the third stage of DV-Hop algorithm the improved bat algorithm was used to estimate node location and then quasi-Newton algorithm was used to continue searching for the node location from the estimated location as the initial searching point. The simulation results show that, compared with the traditional DV-Hop algorithm and the improved algorithm of DV-Hop based on bat algorithm (BADV-Hop). Positioning precision of the proposed algorithm increases about 16.5% and 5. 18%, and the algorithm has better stability, it is suitable for high positioning precision and stability situation.", "paper_title": "Node Localization of Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Hybrid Bat-Quasi-Newton Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000366995800007"}
