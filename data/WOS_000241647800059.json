Presently, existing proposals show some limitations: (i) the quantity of data that can be handled contemporarily is limited, due to the fact that reasoning is generally carried out in main memory; (ii) the interaction with external (and independent) DBMSs is not trivial and, in several cases, not allowed at all; (iii) the efficiency of present implementations is still not sufficient for their utilization in complex reasoning tasks involving massive amounts of data. This paper provides a contribution in this setting; it presents a new system, called DLVDB, which aims to solve all these problems.", "paper_title": "Adding efficient data management to logic programming systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800059"}
