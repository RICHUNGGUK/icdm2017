For improving the quality of the rendering results on the PDA, the overall rendering speed, and the user interactivity, we propose three novel methods and adapt a GPU-based direct volume rendering technique. Using these proposed methods, our system can support approximately a two times faster navigation speed and 17 percent better PSNR than previous remote visualization methods with a 512x512x361 volumetric colon CT data using a PDA device over 802.11b wireless network.", "paper_title": "Interactive wireless virtual colonoscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000247979200002"}
