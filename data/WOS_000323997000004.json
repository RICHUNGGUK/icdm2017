However, little attention has been given to qualitative studies in the field, which seek to explore new aspects of online or mobile customer behaviour, adding to existing theories or even creating new ones. Thus, the purpose of the present paper is to critically evaluate studies employing Grounded Theory (GT), a method commonly used for theory building in qualitative social research. Nine studies were identified examining online or mobile customer behaviour under this approach, providing theories based on emerging categories. Results of their studies seem to be very similar to existing customer behaviour theories, occasionally adding new categories to the existing theory nomenclature. Studies presented weaknesses regarding the accurate methodological conduct of GT and the process of generating theory, attributed predominantly to methodological, verification and reporting bias. Nevertheless, the main advantage of GT studies remains the generation of theory that can be applied in practice, reinforced by the presentation of conceptual prospects for testing new variables in quantitative studies. Overall, the contribution of GT studies to online and mobile customer behaviour research should be based on more rigorous methodology and aim to challenge rather than confirm existing theories with the purpose of advancing knowledge in the field.", "paper_title": "Online and mobile customer behaviour: a critical evaluation of Grounded Theory studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000323997000004"}
