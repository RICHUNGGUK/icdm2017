The size of the domain is of a similar to that of experiments, and encompases the splitter plate effect. The calculations are ascertained to be grid independent for grid sizes of 1200 x 260,800 x 200 and 600 x 160. The calculations are shown to match the experiments of Goebel and Dutton (1990) [1] and Papamoschou and Roshko (1988) [2] reasonably well, and are able to capture the effect of the reduced growth rate with increased M-c within the tolerance of experiments. The simulations are used further to study the removal of velocity deficit and the attainment of self similarity with increasing M-c. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
