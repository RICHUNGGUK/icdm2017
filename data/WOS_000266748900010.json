In this paper, we consider the trees with order n, diameter d or radius r, and extremal zeroth-order general Randic index. We obtain the trees with first three largest zeroth-order general Randic index among all the trees with order n, diameter d or radius r.", "paper_title": "Zeroth-order general Randic index of trees with given order and distance conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000266748900010"}
