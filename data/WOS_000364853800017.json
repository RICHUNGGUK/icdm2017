In particular, we focus on one of the most important human groups-the triad-and try to understand how closed triads are formed in dynamic networks, by employing data from a large microblogging network as the basis of our study. We formally define the problem of triadic closure prediction and conduct a systematic investigation. The study reveals how user demographics, network characteristics, and social properties influence the formation of triadic closure. We also present a probabilistic graphical model to predict whether three persons will form a closed triad in a dynamic network. Different kernel functions are incorporated into the proposed graphical model to quantify the similarity between triads. Our experimental results with the large microblogging dataset demonstrate the effectiveness (+10 percent over alternative methods in terms of F1-Score) of the proposed model for the prediction of triadic closure formation.", "paper_title": "Triadic Closure Pattern Analysis and Prediction in Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000364853800017"}
