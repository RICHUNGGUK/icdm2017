Principal effects, natures, flavors, meridian affinity, lifting, lowering,floating and sinking (LLFS) and toxicity of single herbs are then combined with their dosages to generate formula descriptors in a linear manner. Herbal actions and properties defined by TCM theory are foundations of formula prescriptions. Therefore, the resulted formula descriptors will simulate a TCM doctor's knowledge well. Moreover, during the development of TCM for thousands of years, herbal actions and properties are well understood and one can generate descriptors for any TCM formula based on our method. To validate and demonstrate the usefulness of the newly proposed formula descriptors, a case study of quantitative formula-activity relationship (QFAR) of hypertension formulas is performed. Based on 64 general formula descriptors, least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM) is used to discriminate the effective hypertension formulas from the negative ones. An external validation set is used to optimize LS-SVM parameters and evaluate the performance of classification models. The prediction accuracy of independent positive formulas and negative formulas are 93.1% and 96.5%, respectively. The new formula descriptors and the corresponding QFAR model can be used for preliminary screening of effective formulas from the massive TCM formula data distributed in various literatures and databases.
