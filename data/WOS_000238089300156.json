We designed and implemented virtual anatomy training system for medical students. Anatomical images of Visible Korean Human (VKH) data were produced with serial sectioning of the Korean cadaver's whole body at 0.2 mm intervals. 3D volume data was made by stacking the color and segmented images, and the volume data was reconstructed with 1 mm voxel size since entire volume data is so large. We present the virtual anatomy training system using volume rendering, on which the 3D anatomical volume and 3D segmented volume can be sectioned at arbitrary angles, and the 3D rendered images of the several anatomical structures can be displayed and rotated at any angles.", "paper_title": "Computer-aided training system of educational virtual dissection using visible Korean human", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300156"}
