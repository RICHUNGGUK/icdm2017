By learning the difference between the theoretical covariance and practical covariance of the innovation which is defined as measurement residue through ELM, the adaptive factor of the covariance matrix of the observation noise was obtained. Then the covariance matrix of the observation noise can be adjusted online according to the ELM learning data. Simulation results showed that the proposed algorithm can improve the estimation accuracy and the robustness of the Kalman filtering for target tracking. It is also applied in the gaze tracking system for pupil tracking and shows satisfactory results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
