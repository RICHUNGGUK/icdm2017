This method incurs large routing traffic incurred by frequent route discovery, which implies that it may not increase the network life time as much as it intends to. To solve this problem, we propose an energy efficient routing algorithm which uses two levels of route alternation. When it first finds the end to end route, it also caches the backup routes. It first changes the route using the backup routes and after the all the costs of the backup routes increase more than a certain amount, it begins to find a new end to end route and new backup routes. When it alternates routes using the backup route, the routing overhead is very small. In this way HPSR can reduce the routing overhead while distributing the cost throughout the network. We compare the performance of HPSR with existing routing algorithms using OPNET.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware routing algorithm using backup route for ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100087"}
