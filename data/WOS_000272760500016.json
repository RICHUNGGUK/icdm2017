In this paper, a method of coupling of finite element and boundary integral equation methods is presented for the solutions of electromagnetic scattering in both transverse electric and magnetic polarization cases. The well-posedness of the continuous and discrete problems, as well as optimal error estimates for the coupled variational approximations, are obtained. Numerical results are included to illustrate the accuracy with the optimal convergence property of the proposed method and to show the wave features in a two-layered medium.
