It is based on formulation of BDDC with global matrices without explicit coarse problem. The implementation is based on the MUMPS parallel solver for computing the approximate inverse used for preconditioning. It is successfully applied to several problems of Stokes flow discretized by Taylor Hood finite elements and BDDC is shown to be a promising method also for this class of problems.
