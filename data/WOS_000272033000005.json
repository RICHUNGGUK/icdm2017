Necessary and sufficient conditions for an optimal control of the control problem with the control domain being convex are proved by the classical method of convex variation, and the coefficients appearing in the systems are allowed to depend on the control variables. As an application, the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem is studied.", "paper_title": "Necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal control of stochastic systems associated with Levy processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000272033000005"}
