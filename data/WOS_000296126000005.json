The proposed segmentation scheme is the first to exploit the attractive properties of the active contour formulation in order to cope with crucial issues in 2D-GE image analysis, including the presence of noise, streaks, multiplets and faint spots. In addition, it is unsupervised, providing an alternate to the laborious, error-prone process of manual editing, which is required in state-of-the-art 2D-GE image analysis software packages. It is based on the formation of a spot-targeted level-set surface, as well as of morphologically-derived active contour energy terms, used to guide active contour initialization and evolution, respectively. The experimental results on real and synthetic 2D-GE images demonstrate that the proposed scheme results in more plausible spot boundaries and outperforms all commercial software packages in terms of segmentation quality.
