Based on the projection vectors of swing angles on 2-D plane and the remaining distance to the destination, this approach can be easily incorporated into an intelligent fuzzy controller. Experimental results indicate superior performance over conventional techniques in a crane control problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
