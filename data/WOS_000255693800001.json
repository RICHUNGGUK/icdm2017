Two feature selection methods of Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and a stepwise regression approach adopted for the Multiple Linear Regressions (MLR) were used to predict the Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) Retention Time (RT) of these compounds on a Xterra MS C-18 stationary phase. ANFIS and MLR methods were used as variable selection tools and a neural network was employed for predicting the RTs. Three descriptors of 3D-MoRSE-signal 06/weighted by atomic polarizabilities (Mor06p), Radial Distribution Function-1.0/ weighted by atomic van der Waals volumes (RDF010v), and number of functional groups of R-Co-N< and > N-C=N (N-072) reveal the importance of dispersion interactions between benzodiazepines and C-18 stationary phases and also electrostatic and hydrogen bond interactions of these compounds with the polar mobile phase. The superiority of 3-4-1 ANFIS-Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) model over MLR-ANN with a linear feature selection method was illustrated by Leave-Multiple-Out (LMO) cross-validation method. Values of R-L6O(2)=0.771 and RMSEL6O=4.792 for ANFIS-ANN model should be compared with the values of R-L6O(2) = 0.632 and RMSEL6O = 6.481. for the MLR-ANN model. LMO-CV and Y-randomization results indicate the robustness and predictive ability of the generated model of ANFIS-ANN and show the ability of ANFIS in selecting the features for phenomena with nonlinear characteristics. Sequential Zeroing of Weights (SZW) as a sensitivity analysis method showed the importance of dispersion interaction in the retention mechanism of benzodiazepines in LC method.", "paper_title": "Quantitative structure-retention relationship study of benzodiazepines using adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system as feature selection method", "paper_id": "WOS:000255693800001"}
