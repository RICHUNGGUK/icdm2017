Projectors in the past have been used as fixed devices, but the latest, generation of 'pocket projectors' is small and portable. We demonstrate the feasibility of using a projector held in the hand, and the types of applications that can be done with a handheld projector. We attach a camera to the projector to support its operation in two ways. Firstly, vision is used to recover the motion of the projector relative to the display surface. A handheld projector with motion recovery allows a range of interesting functionality, and we show how web-browsing can be done with a handheld projector, complete with mouse interaction and text-entry. Secondly, we use the camera to process information about the projection surface - for example we demonstrate an application that allows a user to attach digital information to a physical texture, and later to recover and view the digital data via recognition of the texture.", "paper_title": "A handheld projector supported by computer vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200019"}
