MOS transistors in weak-inversion region and a master-slave technique for the temperature compensation were used. The circuit was fabricated with standard CMOS 0.35 mu m process using a single supply voltage of 1.5 V. Experimental results validate the theoretical analysis and verify the effectiveness of the proposed structure. A 40 dB range linearly in dB controlled output current with less than 1.5 dB linearity error was achieved. The structure features +/- 1 and +/- 3 dB deviations for +/- 10% supply voltage and 80 degrees C temperature variations, respectively.", "paper_title": "1.5-V CMOS exponential current generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000306121500005"}
