To solve the LSP-WCP problem under static traffic provisioning, an Integer Linear Programming model is formulated to achieve the optimal solution in the sense that the total number of wavelength channels required by the multicast requests is minimized. To solve the LSP-WCP problem under dynamic traffic provisioning, a complementary-combined LSP-WCP heuristic is proposed to minimize the multicast traffic blocking probability, and is proved through extensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Placement of light splitters and wavelength converters for efficient multicast in all-optical WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800038"}
