In order to reduce complexity, most of these fast wavelet image encoders are non-(SNR)-embedded and as a consequence, precise rate control is not supported. In this work, we propose some simple rate control algorithms for these kind of encoders and we analyze their impact to determine if, despite their inclusion, the global encoder is still competitive with respect to popular embedded encoders like SPIHT and JPEG2000. In this study we focus on the non-embedded LTW encoder, showing that the increase in complexity due to the rate control algorithm inclusion, maintains LTW competitive with respect to SPIHT and JPEG2000 in terms of R/D performance, coding delay and memory consumption.", "paper_title": "Rate Control Algorithms for Non-Embedded Wavelet-Based Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000303886100005"}
