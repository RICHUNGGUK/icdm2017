The Lagrange dual method was employed to design the optimal algorithm. First, the optimization problem was formulated for the single-relay system and the optimal centralized algorithm was presented by resolving the dual problem. Next, the optimal algorithm for a multi-relay system was proposed in a similar way. Compared with the exhaustive search method, the computational complexity of the proposed optimal algorithms was reduced from non-polynomial to polynomial time. Finally, the centralized algorithm was extended to the distributed algorithm, which was more feasible for the practical system. Simulation results verify our analysis.", "paper_title": "Centralized and distributed resource allocation in OFDM based multi-relay system", "paper_id": "WOS:000278156200006"}
