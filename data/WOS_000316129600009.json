By using a suitable phase sensitivity indicator we study the zero temperature junction-states useful to achieve sub shot-noise precisions. Sub shot-noise phase shift sensitivities can be reached even at finite temperature under a suitable choice of the junction state. We infer a scaling law in terms of the size system (that is, the number of particles) for the temperature at which the shot-noise limit is not overcome anymore.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM INTERFEROMETRY AT ZERO AND FINITE TEMPERATURE WITH TWO-MODE BOSONIC JOSEPHSON JUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000316129600009"}
