If the network environments change, the false negative rates and false positive rates will increase rapidly. So the traditional method can not adapt to changing network environments. In order to get over the limitation of the traditional means, an immunity-based dynamic intrusion detection system is proposed in this paper. In the proposed model, a dynamic renewal process of self set is described in detail. In addition, we establish a new set to improve the detection precision and shorten the training phase by adding the characters of the current known attacks to memory cell set. The experimental results show that the new model not only reduces the false negative rates and false positive rates effectively but also has the feature to adapt to continuous changing network environments.", "paper_title": "An immunity-based dynamic multilayer intrusion detection system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400068"}
