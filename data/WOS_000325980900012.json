In this model, the output nodes are defined as the Heaviside function. Subsequently, its finite time convergence property and the exact convergence time are analyzed. However, the discovered characteristics of this model are based on the assumption that there are no physical defects during the operation. In this brief, we analyze the convergence behavior of the Wang's kWTA model when defects exist during the operation. Two defect conditions are considered. The first one is that there is input noise. The second one is that there is stochastic behavior in the output nodes. The convergence of the Wang's kWTA under these two defects is analyzed and the corresponding energy function is revealed.", "paper_title": "Effect of Input Noise and Output Node Stochastic on Wang's kWTA", "paper_id": "WOS:000325980900012"}
