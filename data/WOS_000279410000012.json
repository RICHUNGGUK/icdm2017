In the present work, a fully explicit method of implementing DNS is presented for investigating transient multi-component methane/air jet flame in the near field. The detailed methodology, enclosing non-dimensional governing equations, inlet velocity disturbance, chemical scheme and fluid property, was discussed. An explicit eighth-order finite-difference scheme was used combined with an explicit tenth-order filter. Conservative variables are temporally advanced in two segmented stages that handle Euler terms and viscous terms respectively. A modified non-reflecting boundary condition was used, which has better performance about the characteristic waves on boundary planes. The developed code was firstly tested with an air jet and evaluated in terms of accuracy and parallel efficiency. Then a methane/air combusting jet was simulated to study the characteristics of the chemical heat-release in turbulence. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
