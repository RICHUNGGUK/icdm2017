We propose an integration framework for building and querying catalogs. Our approach is based on a hybrid of peer-to-peer data sharing paradigm and Web-services architecture. Peers in our system serve as domain-specific data integration mediators. Links between peers are established based on the similarity of the domain they represent. The relationships are used for routing queries among peers. As the number of catalogs involved grow larger, the need for filtering irrelevant data sources will become increasingly high. We apply a summarisation technique to summarise the content of catalogs. The summaries are used to pre-selecting data sources that are relevant to a user query.", "paper_title": "Building and querying e-catalog networks using P2P and data summarisation techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000236616100002"}
