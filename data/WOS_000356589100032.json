Screen content video coding is widely used in applications with a high demand for real-time performance. HEVC usually introduces great computational complexity, which makes fast algorithms necessary to offset the limited computing power of HEVC encoders. In this study, a statistical analysis of several screen content sequences is first performed to better account for the completely different statistics of natural images and videos. Second, a fast coding unit (CU) splitting method is proposed, which aims to reduce HEVC intra coding computational complexity, especially in screen content coding. In the proposed scheme, CU size decision is made by checking the smoothness of the luminance values in every coding tree unit. Experiments demonstrate that in HEVC range extension standard, the proposed scheme can save an average of 29% computational complexity with 0.9% Bjontegaard Delta rate (BD-rate) increase compared with HM13.0+RExt6.0 anchor for screen content sequences. For default HEVC, the proposed scheme can reduce encoding time by an average of 38% with negligible loss of coding efficiency.", "paper_title": "Fast CU Splitting in HEVC Intra Coding for Screen Content Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000356589100032"}
