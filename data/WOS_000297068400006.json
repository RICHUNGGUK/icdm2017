On one hand, models such as attack graphs and attack trees have been proposed to assess the cause-consequence relationships between various network states, while on the other hand, different decision problems have been explored to identify the minimum-cost hardening measures. However, these risk models do not help reason about the causal dependencies between network states. Further, the optimization formulations ignore the issue of resource availability while analyzing a risk model. In this paper, we propose a risk management framework using Bayesian networks that enable a system administrator to quantify the chances of network compromise at various levels. We show how to use this information to develop a security mitigation and management plan. In contrast to other similar models, this risk model lends itself to dynamic analysis during the deployed phase of the network. A multiobjective optimization platform provides the administrator with all trade-off information required to make decisions in a resource constrained environment.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Security Risk Management Using Bayesian Attack Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000297068400006"}
