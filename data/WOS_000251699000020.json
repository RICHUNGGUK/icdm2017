A fuzzy expected value model, which aims to maximize the utility function of the principal under the incentive constraints, is developed from the principal's point of view. Pontryagin maximum principle is adopted in this paper to find the optimal solutions to the fuzzy expected value model.", "paper_title": "Principal-agent problem in a fuzzy environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000251699000020"}
