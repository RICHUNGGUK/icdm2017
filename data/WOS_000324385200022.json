The proposed framework relies on a constrained optimization technique, which is solved by a sequence of unconstrained sub-problems, and allows the incorporation of existing CS reconstruction algorithms in compressive BID problems. As an example, a non-convex l p quasi-norm with 0 < p < 1 is employed as a regularization term for the image, while a simultaneous auto-regressive regularization term is selected for the blur. Nevertheless, the proposed approach is very general and it can be easily adapted to other state-of-the-art BID schemes that utilize different, application specific, image/blur regularization terms. Experimental results, obtained with simulations using blurred synthetic images and real passive millimeter-wave images, show the feasibility of the proposed method and its advantages over existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Compressive Blind Image Deconvolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200022"}
