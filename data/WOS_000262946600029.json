The primary contribution of our work is to develop a low overhead, highly scalable admission control technique for Internet applications. Cataclysm provides several desirable features, such as guarantees on response time by conducting accurate size-based admission control, revenue maximization at multiple time-scales via preferential admission of important requests and dynamic capacity provisioning, and the ability to be operational even under extreme overloads. Cataclysm can transparently trade-off the accuracy of its decision making with the intensity of the workload allowing it to handle incoming rates of several tens of thousands of requests/second. We implement a prototype Cataclysm hosting platform on a Linux cluster and demonstrate the benefits of our integrated approach using a variety of workloads. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
