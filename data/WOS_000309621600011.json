It is the largest organization in Australia dedicated to ICT research. While it has close links with local universities, it is in fact an independent but not-for-profit company in the business of doing research, commercializing that research and training Ph.D. students to do that research. Much of the work taking place at NICTA involves various topics in artificial intelligence. In this article, we survey some of the AI work being undertaken at NICTA.", "paper_title": "AI@NICTA", "paper_id": "WOS:000309621600011"}
