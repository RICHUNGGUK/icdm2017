Research of inter-human coordination in purely rhythmic action tasks reveals that the observed patterns of interaction are dominated by synchronization effects. Initiated by our finding that human dyads synchronize their arm movements even in a goal-directed action task, we present a step-wise approach to a model of inter-human movement coordination. In an experiment, the hand trajectories of ten human dyads are recorded. Governed by a dynamical process of phase synchronization, the participants establish in-phase as well as anti-phase relations. The emerging relations are successfully reproduced by the attractor dynamics of coupled phase oscillators inspired by the Kuramoto model. Three different methods on transforming the motion trajectories into instantaneous phases are investigated and their influence on the model fit to the experimental data is evaluated. System identification technique allows us to estimate the model parameters, which are the coupling strength and the frequency detuning among the dyad. The stability properties of the identified model match the relations observed in the experimental data. In short, our model predicts the dynamics of inter-human movement coordination. It can directly be implemented to enrich human-robot interaction.", "paper_title": "Modeling inter-human movement coordination: synchronization governs joint task dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000305951000003"}
