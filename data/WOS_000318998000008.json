Method: A review of major programs and initiatives for ensuring safety of health information technology in the three countries was conducted. Published literature and Web resources from national programs were reviewed for relevant information. Results: It was found that in all three countries the issue of technology-induced error has been recognized as being of critical importance. The three countries have developed approaches for dealing with the issue that have some commonalities; however, they are at varying different stages of maturity, with England having the longest standing and most well developed safety programs, while Canada and the United States are at earlier stages. The types of approaches employed have included work on developing standards related to usability and interface design, certifications, directives from regulatory bodies, educational initiatives in health information technology (HIT) safety as well as research into safer HIT design and implementation methods. Conclusions: HIT promises to lead to improved patient safety. However, it has become recognized that if not designed and deployed appropriately, such systems can lead to new types of errors. Based on this recognition, a variety of initiatives are being undertaken in Canada, the United States and England to promote the safe design, procurement and deployment of HIT. It is concluded that improved approaches to system design, testing, regulation, error reporting, safety education and cross-country collaboration will be needed to further promote safer HIT.
