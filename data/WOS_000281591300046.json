We present a mathematical programming model based on cell loss and a Tabu Search algorithm with short-term memory that is reinforced with a long-term memory procedure. The estimation of the quality of the solutions is fast due to the specific encoding of the feasible solutions. The Tabu Search algorithm reaches good quality solutions outperforming other approaches such as Genetic Algorithms and the Minimum Switching Path heuristic attending both to the cell loss and the CPU time consumption. The best results were found for the more complex networks with a high number of switches and links. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
