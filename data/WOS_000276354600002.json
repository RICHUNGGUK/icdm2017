A recent trend in the use of the multimedia Internet exhibits rapid growth of UCC with the potential to create a huge amount of uplink traffic for wireless operators. Our objective is finding the optimal heterogeneous network operation framework under the precise uplink UCC traffic analysis. We suggest the market-based evaluation of the relative value of resources for each network, and develop a whole new uplink UCC operation framework in heterogeneous 3G/4G networks. To prove the applicability of the proposed operation framework and analysis, we build a large-scale uplink test-bed system. The test-bed contains all necessary functions of network facilities and protocols for development of emerging multimedia UCC traffic. We can easily test the various service scenarios in heterogeneous network environment by the developed test-bed system.", "paper_title": "Design of a Test-Bed System for Multimedia Uplink UCC Traffic Management in Heterogeneous 3G/4G Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000276354600002"}
