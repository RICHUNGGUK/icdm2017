Aiming at improving the frequency efficiency of the secondary network, we set a multiantenna relay station in the secondary network to perform two-way relaying. Three linear processing schemes at the relay station based on zero forcing, zero forcing-maximum ratio transmission, and minimum mean square error criteria are derived to guarantee the quality of service of primary users and to suppress the intrapair and interpair interference among secondary users (SUs). In addition, the transmit power of SUs is optimized to maximize the sum rate of SUs and to limit the interference brought to PUs. Numerical results show that the proposed multiuser two-way relay processing schemes and the optimal power control policies can efficiently limit the interference caused by the secondary network to primary users, and the sum rate of SUs can also be greatly improved.
