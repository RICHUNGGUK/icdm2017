Examples of problems that belong to this category are transportation routing problem, scan chain optimization and drilling problem in integrated circuit testing and production. This pap er presents a Bee Colony Optimization (BCO) algorithm for symmetrical TSP. The BCO model is constructed algorithmically based on the collective intelligence shown in bee foraging behaviour. The algorithm is integrated with a fixed-radius near neighbour 2-opt (FRNN 2-opt) heuristic to further improve prior solutions generated by the BCO model. To limit the overhead incurred by the FRNN 2-opt, a frequency-based pruning strategy is proposed. The pruning strategy allows only a subset of the promising solutions to undergo local optimization. Experimental results comparing the proposed BCO algorithm with existing approaches on a set of benchmark problems are presented. For 84 benchmark problems, the BCO algorithm is able to obtain an over all average solution quality of 0.31% from known optimum. The results also show that it is comparable to other algorithms such as Ant Colony Optimization and Particle Swarm Optimization.", "paper_title": "BEE COLONY OPTIMIZATION WITH LOCAL SEARCH FOR TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000279431700006"}
