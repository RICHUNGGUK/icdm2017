The problem of telepresence across delayed networks is well known. A delay in feedback information such as visual and haptic data can make the task at hand very unintuitive and difficult for the operator. The first presented method investigates the hypothesis that simulated inertia in the haptic input device can be a supporting factor during teleoperation across delayed networks. An experiment involving 36 human subjects was carried out under varying network and inertia conditions. Psychophysical experiments were conducted to determine suitable values of inertia. However, simulated inertia was found to be neither a supporting factor nor a detrimental factor to operator performance and immersion in the presence of both delayed and non-delayed networks. The second presented method is a force prediction approach, which extends the teleoperation system with a local force model. This is a learned force model situated locally at the operator-side. Instead of relying on the delayed force signals from the teleoperator-side, haptic information can be extracted from this local force model. An experiment has been created to demonstrate the benefits of this approach in compensating for the instabilities due to time delay.", "paper_title": "The effects of simulated inertia and force prediction on delayed telepresence", "paper_id": "WOS:000249657200008"}
