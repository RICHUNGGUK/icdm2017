In this paper, we discuss several graph-cover-based methods for deriving families of time-invariant and time-varying LDPC convolutional codes from LDPC block codes and show how earlier proposed LDPC convolutional code constructions can be presented within this framework. Some of the constructed convolutional codes significantly outperform the underlying LDPC block codes. We investigate some possible reasons for this \"convolutional gain,\" and we also discuss the-mostly moderate-decoder cost increase that is incurred by going from LDPC block to LDPC convolutional codes.", "paper_title": "Deriving Good LDPC Convolutional Codes from LDPC Block Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000286514200017"}
