The methodology adopted in this paper is inspired by and taken from the various research papers published in the literature. The proposed framework considers seven important elements of the reverse logistics system. It is divided into three hierarchical levels (strategic, tactical, and operational). By carrying out experimentation with the proposed conceptual model, all three levels were tested in different industrial sectors during its development. Three real-world case studies are presented to test and to show the flexibility and applicability of the framework. The proposed conceptual framework will help practitioners in the field to structure their reverse logistics activities and also help academics in developing better decision models.
