A broadband microwave receiver (with astronomical applications) is modeled and simulated to illustrate the technique. This particular receiver is a challenging case because it samples cosmic microwave background (CMB) low-power broadband (10-gigahertz) signals over a long period.", "paper_title": "Frequency-Domain Identification and Model-Order Selection for Efficiently Simulating Microwave Radiometers", "paper_id": "WOS:000303014500009"}
