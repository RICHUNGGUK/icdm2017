In this paper, the open vehicle routing problem with fuzzy demands (OVRPFD) is considered. A fuzzy chance-constrained program model is designed based on fuzzy credibility theory. Stochastic simulation and an improved differential evolution algorithm are integrated so as to use a hybrid intelligent algorithm to solve the OVRPFD model. The influence of the decision-maker's preference on the final outcome of the problem is analyzed using stochastic simulation, and the range of possible preferences is calculated.
