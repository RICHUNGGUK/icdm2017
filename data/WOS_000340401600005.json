An efficient reanalysis method is proposed. The method is based on the introduction of the modified master stiffness matrices, the rank-one decomposition of the corresponding incremental stiffness matrix, and the sparse Cholesky rank-one update/downdate algorithm. Adding and deleting of supports with arbitrary orientations can be dealt with. Numerical examples show that exact results can be obtained by the proposed method, and the computational times can be significantly reduced in comparison with the direct analysis method.", "paper_title": "Structural static reanalysis for modification of supports", "paper_id": "WOS:000340401600005"}
