Although more genome-sequence data are becoming available, a large fraction of it remains functionally uncharacterized. Thus, it is important to be able to predict the mapping of poorly annotated proteins to original pathway models. Results: We have developed a Relational Learning-based Extension (RLE) system to investigate pathway membership through a function prediction approach that mainly relies on combinations of simple properties attributed to each protein. RLE searches for proteins with molecular similarities to specific pathway components. Using RLE, we associated 383 uncharacterized proteins to 28 pre-defined human Reactome pathways, demonstrating relative confidence after proper evaluation. Indeed, in specific cases manual inspection of the database annotations and the related literature supported the proposed classifications. Examples of possible additional components of the Electron transport system, Telomere maintenance and Integrin cell surface interactions pathways are discussed in detail.
