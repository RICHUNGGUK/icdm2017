Given a string x of length n and an integer lambda, the lambda-seed problem is to find all the sets of lambda substrings of x that cover a superstring of x, assuming that each element of the set is of equal length. We present an efficient algorithm that can compute all the lambda-seeds of x in O(n(2)) time.", "paper_title": "Computing the lambda-seeds of a string", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600028"}
