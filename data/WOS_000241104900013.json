The k-anonymity model guarantees that no private information in a table can be linked to a group of less than k individuals. We suggest extended definitions of k-anonymity that allow the k-anonymity of a data mining model to be determined. Using these definitions, we present decision tree induction algorithms that are guaranteed to maintain k-anonymity of the learning examples. Experiments show that embedding anonymization within the decision tree induction process provides better accuracy than anonymizing the data first and inducing the tree later.", "paper_title": "kappa-Anonymous decision tree induction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241104900013"}
