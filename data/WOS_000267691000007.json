However, unlike barcodes, these tags have a longer range in which they are allowed to be scanned, subjecting them to unauthorized scanning by malicious readers and to various other attacks, including cloning attacks. Therefore, a security protocol for RFID tags is necessary to ensure the privacy and authentication between each tag and their reader. In order to accomplish this, we propose PAP, a privacy and authentication protocol for passive RFID tags. This protocol requires little computation and achieves both privacy and authentication, making it sufficient enough for use in supply chain management; however, this protocol is also suitable for use in other RFID applications as well.
