They form a strict hierarchy and we investigate the following decision problem: given a relation in one of the families, does it belong to a smaller family? We settle the problem entirely when all monoids have a unique generator and fill some gaps in the general case. In particular, adapting a proof of Stearns, we show that it is recursively decidable whether or not a deterministic subset of an arbitrary number of free monoids is recognizable. Also we exhibit a single exponential algorithm for determining if a synchronous relation is recognizable.", "paper_title": "Decision problems among the main subfamilies of rational relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790500010"}
