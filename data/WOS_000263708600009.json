The protocol is highly efficient and suitable for real-world applications despite offering no resilience against key-compromise impersonation (K-CI). We show that the protocol is also insecure against reflection attacks. We propose a slight modification to the protocol and prove its security in a widely accepted model. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
