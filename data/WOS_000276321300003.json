First, we present an integrated model of the evolution of regulation networks that can be used to uncover organization principles of such networks. Then, we propose to use the results of our model as a benchmark for knowledge discovery algorithms. We describe a first experiment of such benchmarking by using gene knock-out data generated from the modeled organisms.", "paper_title": "From digital genetics to knowledge discovery: Perspectives in genetic network understanding", "paper_id": "WOS:000276321300003"}
