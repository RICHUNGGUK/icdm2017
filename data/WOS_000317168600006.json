The pectoral muscle is a mass of tissue on which the breast rests. During routine mammographic screenings, in Medio-Lateral Oblique (MLO) views, the pectoral muscle turns up in the mammograms along with the breast tissues. The pectoral muscle has to be segmented from the mammogram for an effective automated Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD). This is due to the fact that pectoral muscles have pixel intensities and texture similar to that of breast tissues which can result in awry CAD results. As a result, a lot of effort has been put into the segmentation of pectoral muscles and finding its contour with the breast tissues. To the best of our knowledge, currently there is no definitive literature available which provides a comprehensive review about the current state of research in this area of pectoral muscle segmentation. We try to address this shortcoming by providing a comprehensive review of research papers in this area. A conscious effort has been made to avoid deviating into the area of automated breast cancer detection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
