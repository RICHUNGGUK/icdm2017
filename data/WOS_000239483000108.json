First, FODD amplitude response is given in the form of sum of exponential basis functions. Then, the exponential basis function neural network is used to approximate FODD amplitude response. Finally, some examples compared with others' method are given to illustrate the advantages of this paper approach.", "paper_title": "Fractional order digital differentiators design using exponential basis function neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000108"}
