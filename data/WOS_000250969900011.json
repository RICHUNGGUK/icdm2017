The design problem of 2D state-space digital filters is formulated subject to the constraint that the resultant filters are stable. To apply the genetic algorithm to the design problem, all coefficients of 2D state-space digital filters are encoded into the Gray code representation demonstrating the superior performance to the standard binary one. In addition, a stability test routine is embedded in the design procedure in order to ensure the stability for the resultant filters. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "GA-based design of 2D state-space digital filters with linear phase characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000250969900011"}
