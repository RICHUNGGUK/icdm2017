Although information technologies enable distributed teamwork, they may increase the level of abstraction forced upon teams by the absence of co-location. To counter these effects, we explore how elements of narrative may be useful through their ability to convey team-related information. Nine research questions are presented that examine ways in which we can explore narrative information systems as tools for studying distributed teamwork.", "paper_title": "Narrative-Based Collaboration Systems for Distributed Teams: Nine Research Questions for Information Managers", "paper_id": "WOS:000262354000004"}
