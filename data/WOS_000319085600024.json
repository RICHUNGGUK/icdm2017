In this letter, we investigate the turbo equalization method for the decoding of the Davey-MacKay (DM) construction over the IDS-AWGN channels, which indicates a cascaded insertion, deletion, substitution (IDS) channel and an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. The inner decoder for the DM construction can be seen as an maximum a-posteriori (MAP) detector. it receives the beliefs generated by the outer LDPC decoder when turbo equalization is used. Two decoding schemes with different kinds of inner decoders, namely hard-input inner decoder and soft-input inner decoder, are investigated. Simulation results show that significant performance gains are obtained for both decoders with respect to the insertion/deletion probability at different SNR values.", "paper_title": "Iterative Decoding for the Davey-MacKay Construction over IDS-AWGN Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600024"}
