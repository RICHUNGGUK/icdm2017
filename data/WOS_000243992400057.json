It allows for easy viewing and interpretation of genetic associations, correlations among covariates and SNPs, and information about the replication and cross-validation of the associations. The KGraph allows the user to more easily investigate multicollinearity and confounding through visualization of the multidimensional correlation structure underlying genetic associations. It emphasizes gene-environment and gene-gene interaction, both important components of any genetic system that are often overlooked in association frameworks.", "paper_title": "KGraph: a system for visualizing and evaluating complex genetic associations", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400057"}
