LDR content expansion is required due to the lack of fast and reliable consumer level HDR capture for still images and videos. Furthermore, LDR content expansion, will allow the re-use of legacy LDR stills, videos and LDR applications created, over the last century and more, to be widely available. The use of certain LDR expansion methods, those that are based on the inversion of Tone Mapping Operators (TMOs), has made it possible to create novel compression algorithms that tackle the problem of the size of HDR content storage, which remains one of the major obstacles to be overcome for the adoption of HDR. These methods are used in conjunction with traditional LDR compression methods and can evolve accordingly. The goal of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview on HDR Imaging, and an in depth review on these emerging topics.", "paper_title": "High Dynamic Range Imaging and Low Dynamic Range Expansion for Generating HDR Content", "paper_id": "WOS:000272569400027"}
