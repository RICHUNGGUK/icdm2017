Combining the Lyapunov equation with the weighted logarithmic matrix norm technique, four sequences are presented to locate eigenvalues of a matrix. Based on the relations between the real parts of the eigenvalues and the weighted logarithmic matrix norms, we derive both lower and upper bounds of the matrix exponential, which complement and improve the existing results in the literature. Some numerical examples are also given.", "paper_title": "BOUNDS OF THE MATRIX EIGENVALUES AND ITS EXPONENTIAL BY LYAPUNOV EQUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000312568700003"}
