This algorithm is obtained by constructing a dominating set of the graph greedily, enumerating all possible 3-colorings of the dominating set, and then solving the resulting 2-list coloring instances in polynomial time. We also show that a 3-coloring can be obtained in 2(o(n)) time for graphs having minimum degree at least w(n) where w(n) is any function which goes to infinity. We also show that if the lower bound on minimum degree is replaced by a constant (however large it may be), then neither a 2(o(n)) time nor a 2(o(m)) time algorithm is possible (m denotes the number of edges) for 3-colorability unless Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH) fails. We also describe an algorithm which obtains a 4-coloring of a 3-colorable graph in O(1.2535(n)) time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
