It provides additionally a widely used visual tool in the cases K = 2 and K = 3. It is the main purpose of this paper to investigate how to bootstrap a natural empirical estimator of the ROC surface in order to build accurate confidence regions in the ROC space. We first introduce a resampling procedure based on smooth versions of the empirical distributions involved to construct non Gaussian confidence regions. Simulation results are then displayed to show that such a \"smoothed bootstrap'' technique is preferable to a \"naive'' bootstrap approach in this situation. The accuracy of the method proposed is also illustrated using a psychometric dataset. An asymptotic analysis providing a rigorous theoretical basis for the method proposed is finally carried out in a functional framework. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
