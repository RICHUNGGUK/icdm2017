The dynamic feedback strategy begins with an input-driven filter. By utilizing fuzzy logic systems to approximate unknown and desired control input signals directly instead of the unknown nonlinear functions, an output-feedback fuzzy tracking controller is designed via a backstepping approach. It is shown that the proposed fuzzy adaptive output controller can guarantee that all the signals remain bounded and that the tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Simulations results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Output-Feedback Fuzzy Tracking Control for a Class of Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295586600015"}
