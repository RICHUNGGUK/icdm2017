In the method we build a function to describe the fat extent of every vertex on the body. The fat extent is relative to the slim body template and the fat body template. Using the fat function and two templates a synthesizing model is created. The 3D scans of dressed human obtained by kinects are used to calculate the fat extents of feature rings on the bodies, and the results are used as the control points to build the fat function. We construct two databases corresponding to the persons wearing winter clothes and summer clothes respectively. The two databases consist of the fat extents of the feature rings on the naked bodies and on the 3D scans of dressed human. According the current season and the corresponding database, considering the proportional relations about these feature rings' fat extents as restrictions, the real body of dressed human can be estimated with quadratic programming. The experiments demonstrate the availability of our method.", "paper_title": "Creating real body model of dressed human based on fat extent of body", "paper_id": "WOS:000360071800017"}
