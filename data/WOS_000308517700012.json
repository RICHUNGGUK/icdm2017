For e-Science application in a sensor web environment, how to internally integrate the sensor system, observation, and processes (physical and non-physical) as a geoprocessing e-Science workflow model is a critical issue. The OGC Sensor Model Language offers the possibility to construct a geoprocessing e-Science workflow model in the form of observation processes. We propose a construction method for a geoprocessing e-Science workflow model that integrates logical and physical processes into a composite process chain for sensor observations. The three phases of geoprocessing e-Science workflow creation are abstract process chain modeling, process chain instantiation, and process chain workflow execution. An experiment on chaining-related sub-processes for deriving the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index of Hubei Province (China) was conducted to verify the feasibility of the proposed workflow model.
