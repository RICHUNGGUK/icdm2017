From this observation, a concise prediction formula linking wavelength consumption to network topologies is derived and evaluated for real-world wide area networks. It is shown that the algebraic-connectivity-based wavelength usage estimation is more precise than evaluations relying on node degree variance, number of spanning trees, and average internodal distance.", "paper_title": "Topological Wavelength Usage Estimation in Transparent Wide Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270332700016"}
