Even when robust design methods based on synchronizers and design verification techniques are used, process variations can introduce subtle timing problems that affect data transfer across clock-domain boundaries for fabricated chips. We integrate solutions for detecting and locating CDC faults, and ensuring post-silicon recovery from CDC failures. In the proposed method, CDC faults are located using a CDC-fault dictionary, and their impact is masked using post-silicon clock-path tuning. To quantify the impact of process variations in the transfer of data at clock domain boundaries of multiclock circuits and to validate the proposed error-recovery method, we conducted a series of HSpice simulations using a 45-nm technology. The results demonstrate high incidence of process variation-induced violation of setup and hold time at the boundary flip-flops, even when synchronizer flip-flops are employed. The results also confirm the effectiveness of the proposed error-recovery scheme in recovering from CDC failures.", "paper_title": "Detection, Diagnosis, and Recovery From Clock-Domain Crossing Failures in Multiclock SoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323516100009"}
