We also introduce the concepts of EIMTL and associative filters in MTL-algebras. The relationships between these filters and quotient algebras that are constructed via these filters are described. We clarify that EIMTL. IMTL and fantastic filters coincide in BL-algebras, whereas they have different properties in MTL-algebras; moreover, the relations between them are delineated. We prove that strong filters include some current filters such as implicative, positive implicative and fantastic filters. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
