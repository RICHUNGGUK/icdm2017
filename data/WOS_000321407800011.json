Three different sampling techniques, the Regular Sampled, Naturally Sampled and the Oversampled are studied by simulation. It is found that the SVM is proned to generate DC current in the stator windings. Furthermore subharmonic flux and current components with considerable amplitudes can also be generated in USIM. In the paper it is revealed that both the DC and the subharmonic components could lead to extremely large additional losses in the USIM enhanced by its special parameters. (C) 2012 IMACS.
