The advances in mobile devices and ever increasing wireless link bandwidth motivate us to study whether players can enjoy online gaming over broadband wireless networks such as mobile Worldwide Inter-operability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). In this paper, we carry out comprehensive measurements of the World of Warcraft (WoW) over the mobile WiMAX in Seoul, Korea, and analyze the network performance focusing on two aspects: (1) network layer dynamics such as round trip time, jitter, and packet loss and (2) WiMAX link layer statistics such as the radio signal strength, handovers, and piggyback mechanism. From the empirical data, we set up performance models and evaluate the performance of WoW over WiMAX. We also discuss how to improve the service quality of online gaming over WiMAX.Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Measurement and analysis of online gaming services on mobile WiMAX networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352811800007"}
