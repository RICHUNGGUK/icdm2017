One and two sample mean and variance tests (differences and ratios) are considered. The test statistics are all expressed in the same form as the Student t-test, which facilitates their presentation in the classroom. This contribution also fills the gap of a robust (to non-normality) alternative to the chi-square single variance test for large samples, since no such procedure is implemented in standard statistical software.", "paper_title": "asympTest: A Simple R Package for Classical Parametric Statistical Tests and Confidence Intervals in Large Samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000208589800005"}
