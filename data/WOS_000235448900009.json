We consider a hierarchical architecture for WSNets composed of sensors, relays, and relay gateways. Sensors send data they generate at a known average bit rate to relays in one hop. The relay nodes use a multi-hop mechanism to reach a set of assigned gateways which then forward the data directly to the base station. We are concerned with finding an assignment of relay gateways to relays so that certain constraints are satisfied. We define a unified model in which constraints such as lifetime, data delay, and data flow splitting are formulated in terms of four optimisation problem in graphs.", "paper_title": "Data relaying with constraints in hierarchical sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235448900009"}
