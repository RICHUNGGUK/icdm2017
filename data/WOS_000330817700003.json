Recently, Chen et al. showed that (n, k)-star graphs are 6-weak-vertex-pancyclic for k < n - 1. That is, every vertex of an (n, k)-star graph is contained in cycles of lengths ranged from 6 to n!/(n - k)!. In this paper, we show that (n, k)-star graphs are 6-pancyclic even when there exist n - 3 faulty edges for n >= 4 and 1 <= k < n. Since (n,k)-star graphs are regular of degree n - 1, our result is optimal with respect to the maximum number of tolerated edge faults. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
