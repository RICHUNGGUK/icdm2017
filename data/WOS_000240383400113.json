Firstly, a fuzzy aggregate algorithm is used to indicate the group fuzzy perception of opponent players' outcome preference. The level sets of each group fuzzy outcome preference perception are obtained by solving linear programming models. Based on a defuzzification function associated with the level sets of fuzzy number and the Newton-Cotes numerical integration formula, the group crisp perception for opponent players' outcome preference relation is determined. At last, the concept of most consensus winner is used to decide the crisp outcome preference vectors in the hypergame models. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy information fusion for hypergame outcome preference perception", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400113"}
