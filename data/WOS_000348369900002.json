It is based on a set of deltas specifying modifications that are incrementally applied to a core product. The applicability of deltas depends on application conditions over features. This paper presents abstract delta modelling, which explores delta modelling from an abstract, algebraic perspective. Compared to the previous work, we take a more flexible approach to conflicts between modifications by introducing the notion of conflict-resolving deltas. Furthermore, we extend our approach to allow the nesting of delta models for increased modularity. We also present conditions on the structure of deltas to ensure unambiguous product generation.", "paper_title": "Abstract delta modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000348369900002"}
