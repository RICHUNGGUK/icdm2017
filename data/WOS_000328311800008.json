It was originally defined to prove upper and lower bounds on the expected running time. Recently, upper tail bounds were added to the technique; however, these tail bounds only apply to running times that are at least twice as large as the expectation. We remove this restriction and supplement the fitness-level method with sharp tail bounds, including lower tails. As an exemplary application, we prove that the running time of randomized local search on ONEMAX is sharply concentrated around n In n - 0.1159...n. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
