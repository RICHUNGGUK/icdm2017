This paper presents new aligners designed for improving the performance of classical sentence-level aligners while aligning structured text such as HTML. The new aligners are compared with other well-known geometric aligners.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of alignment methods for HTML parallel text", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400027"}
