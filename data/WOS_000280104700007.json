A simple and effective way to save energy is to place sensor nodes in sleep mode periodically. However, sleep mode corresponds to low power consumption as well as to reduced network capacity and increased latency. This paper develops an analytical framework to study the interaction between random sleep scheme and network performance. Our framework consists of the queueing model for sensor node and performance model for the whole network. We derived the network throughput, power consumption and packet delivery delay. Our analytical models shed light on the guidelines to design random sleep scheme and enable us to explore the trade-offs existing between sensor sleep/active dynamics and those performance measures.", "paper_title": "Analysis of random sleep scheme for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280104700007"}
