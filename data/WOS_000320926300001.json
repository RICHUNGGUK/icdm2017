Firstly, the equivalent conditions of IF-ideals and IFI-ideals are given in lattice implication algebras. Then the proposition of IFI-ideal is investigated in lattice implication algebras. Next, the relations between IFI-ideal and IF-ideal, between IFI-ideal and IFI-filter, between IFI-ideal and fuzzy impilcative ideals, between IFI-ideal and implicative ideals are discussed in lattice implication algebras. Moreover, the extension theorem of IFI-ideals is obtained, and Psi(L) which is composed of all IFI-ideals constitutes a closure system. Finally, we prove that for all alpha is an element of [0, 1]; A = (mu(0,alpha), (mu(0,alpha)) over bar) is an IFI-ideal of lattice implication algebra L if and only if L is a lattice H implication algebra.", "paper_title": "IFI-ideals of lattice implication algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000320926300001"}
