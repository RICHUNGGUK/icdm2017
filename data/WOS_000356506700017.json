Investigation of the response of the network to different external stimuli indicates an increase in the network capability for coding and information retrieval. Comparison of the network output with that of an equivalent experiment with subjects, for recognizing perturbed binary patterns, shows comparable results between the two approaches. We also discuss the enhanced storage capacity of the network.", "paper_title": "Phase Oscillatory Network and Visual Pattern Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000356506700017"}
