(Word-Oriented Feedback Shift Register: sigma-LFSR, 2007) holds in the affirmative in a special case, and outline a plausible approach to prove it in the general case. This conjecture is about the number of primitive sigma-LFSRs of a given order over a finite field, and it generalizes a known formula for the number of primitive LFSRs, which, in turn, is the number of primitive polynomials of a given degree over a finite field. Moreover, this conjecture is intimately related to an open question of Niederreiter (Finite Fields Appl 1:3-30, 1995) on the enumeration of splitting subspaces of a given dimension.", "paper_title": "Primitive polynomials, singer cycles and word-oriented linear feedback shift registers", "paper_id": "WOS:000286986500002"}
