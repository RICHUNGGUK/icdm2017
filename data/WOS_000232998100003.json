Finite convergence is established while assuming the trust regions are of full dimension and never shrink to a single point. The approach is specialized to the cutting plane/column generation context. The resulting algorithm ensures convergence to a pair of primal and dual optimal solutions. Computational experiments carried over multi-depot vehicle scheduling instances show a great stabilizing and accelerating effect on the column generation method. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
