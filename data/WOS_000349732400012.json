However, this has also raised many new challenges to efficiently use the TVWS spectrum. One of the primary challenges is the design of efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols that conform to various rules imposed to protect primary users as well as accommodate spatio-temporal variations of the TVWS spectrum. This article presents MAC-related challenges related to cognitive access to TVWS, discusses potential approaches to overcoming these challenges, and investigates open research issues. It also reviews regulatory activities in several countries and worldwide standardization efforts for TVWS access. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
