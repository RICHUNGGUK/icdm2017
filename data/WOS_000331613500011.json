Our algorithm consists of four basic steps. First, we learn color names offline using the probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) model to find the mapping between basic color names and pixel values. The color names can be used for image segmentation and region description. Second, image pixels are assigned to special color names according to their values, forming different color clusters. The saliency measure for every cluster is evaluated by its spatial compactness relative to other clusters rather than by the intra variance of the cluster alone. Third, every cluster is divided into local regions that are described with color name descriptors. The regional contrast is evaluated by computing the color distance between different regions in the entire image. Last, the final saliency map is constructed by incorporating the color cluster's spatial compactness measure and the corresponding regional contrast. Experiments show that our algorithm outperforms several existing salient object detection methods with higher precision and better recall rates when evaluated using public datasets.", "paper_title": "Salient Object Detection Based on Regional Contrast and Relative Spatial Compactness", "paper_id": "WOS:000331613500011"}
