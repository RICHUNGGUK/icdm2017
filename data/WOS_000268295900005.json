Solid obstacles of arbitrary shape are taken into account using the volume penalization method to impose no-slip boundary condition. The 2D Navier-Stokes equations, written in the vorticity-streamfunction formulation, are discretized using a Fourier pseudo-spectral scheme. Four different time discretization schemes of the penalization term are proposed and compared. The originality of the present work lies in the implementation of time-dependent penalization, which makes the above method capable of solving problems where the obstacle follows an arbitrary motion. Fluid-solid coupling for freely falling bodies is also implemented. The numerical method is validated for different test cases: the flow past a cylinder, Couette flow between rotating cylinders, sedimentation of a cylinder and a falling leaf with elliptical shape.
