Like many MCR methods, ICE also estimates pure components, or endmembers, via alternating least squares; however, it is explicitly based on a convex geometry model and estimation is carried out in a subspace of reduced dimensionality defined by the minimum noise fraction (MNF) transform. In this paper, we describe the ICE algorithm and its properties. We also illustrate its use on a hyperspectral image of cervical tissue. The unmixing of hyperspectral images presents some unique challenges, and we also outline where further development is required.
