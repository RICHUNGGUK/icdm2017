For a neuronal network coupled by two single-small-world-layer networks with link probability differences between layers, the two-layer network can achieve synchrony as the interlayer coupling strength increases. When chaotic layer network is coupled with chaotic-burst-synchronization layer network, the latter is dominant at small interlayer coupling strength, so it can make the layer with the irregular pattern show some regular and also exhibit the same pattern with the other layer. However, when chaotic layer is coupled with firing synchronization layer, the ordered layer is dominated by a disordered one with the interlayer coupling strength increasing. When the interlayer coupling strength is large enough, both networks are chaotic burst synchronization. Therefore, the synchronous states strongly depend on the interlayer coupling strength and the link probability. Moreover, the spatiotemporal pattern synchronization between the networks is robust to small noise.", "paper_title": "Chaotic burst synchronization in a two-small-world-layer neuronal network", "paper_id": "WOS:000351729600004"}
