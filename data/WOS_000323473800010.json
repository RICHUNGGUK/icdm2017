In this paper, we introduce a method that can analyze the intrinsic multiscale features of flow fields from a decomposition point of view, by using the Hilbert-Huang transform method on 3D fluid simulation. We show how this method can provide insights to flow styles and help modulate the fluid simulation with its internal physical information. We provide easy-to-implement algorithms that can be integrated with standard grid-based fluid simulation methods and demonstrate how this approach can modulate the flow field and guide the simulation with different flow styles. The modulation is straightforward and relates directly to the flow's visual effect, with moderate computational overhead.", "paper_title": "Flow Field Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000323473800010"}
