We also give explicit expressions for the arithmetical complexity of Sturmian words of slope between 1/3 and 2/3 (in particular, of the Fibonacci word). In this case, the difference between the genuine arithmetical complexity function and our upper bound is bounded, and ultimately 2-periodic. In fact, our formula is valid not only for Sturmian words but for rotation words from a wider class. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
