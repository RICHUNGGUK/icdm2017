Supplier selection is a significant work in supply chain management. Often, there will be thousands of potential suppliers and identifying a subset of these suppliers can be a complex process of determining a satisfactory subset based on a number of factors. In this paper, the Supplier selection can be viewed as the problem of mining a large database of shipment. The proposed method incorporates the extended association rule algorithm of data mining with that of set theory to find key suppliers. This research has employed a numerical example for the integrated method to develop suitable supplier clusters. The results Show that the method is effective and applicable. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
