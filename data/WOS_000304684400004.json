This framework, while not strictly neuromimetic, finds its roots in the role of the dorsal perceptual pathway of the human brain. Its composing models build upon a common spatial configuration that is naturally fitting for the integration of readings from multiple sensors using a Bayesian approach devised in previous work. The framework presented in this article is shown to adequately model human-like active perception behaviours, namely by exhibiting the following desirable properties: high-level behaviour results from low-level interaction of simpler building blocks; seamless integration of additional inputs is allowed by the Bayesian Programming formalism; initial 'genetic imprint' of distribution parameters may be changed 'on the fly' through parameter manipulation, thus allowing for the implementation of goal-dependent behaviours (i.e. top-down influences).", "paper_title": "A hierarchical Bayesian framework for multimodal active perception", "paper_id": "WOS:000304684400004"}
