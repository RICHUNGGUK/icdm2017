The Apache Hadoop-based solutions have become popular in genomics because of their scalability in a cloud infrastructure. So far, most of these tools have been used for batch data processing rather than interactive data querying. The SparkSeq software has been created to take advantage of a new MapReduce framework, Apache Spark, for next-generation sequencing data. SparkSeq is a general-purpose, flexible and easily extendable library for genomic cloud computing. It can be used to build genomic analysis pipelines in Scala and run them in an interactive way. SparkSeq opens up the possibility of customized ad hoc secondary analyses and iterative machine learning algorithms. This article demonstrates its scalability and overall fast performance by running the analyses of sequencing datasets. Tests of SparkSeq also prove that the use of cache and HDFS block size can be tuned for the optimal performance on multiple worker nodes.", "paper_title": "SparkSeq: fast, scalable and cloud-ready tool for the interactive genomic data analysis with nucleotide precision", "paper_id": "WOS:000342913000015"}
