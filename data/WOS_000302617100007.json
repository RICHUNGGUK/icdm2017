This task is known in the literature as rendezvous. Among many alternative assumptions that have been used to study the rendezvous problem, two most significantly influence the methodology appropriate for its solution. The first of these assumptions concerns the environment in which the mobile entities navigate: it can be either a terrain in the plane, or a network modeled as an undirected graph. The second assumption concerns the way in which the entities move: it can be either deterministic or randomized. In this article, we survey results on deterministic rendezvous in networks.
