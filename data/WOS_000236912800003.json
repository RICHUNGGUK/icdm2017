However, as infrastructure and evaluation system are more diversified and complicated compared with single screening, the development of a novel health information system is paramount. Methods: The main goal of our health information system was to support the multiple screening program not only from technical aspect but also from a broad range of perspectives including quality assurance system, organized features appertaining to screening, economic evaluation (cost-effectiveness or cost-utility analysis), epidemiological applications, behavior risk factor surveillance system, and social impact due to the introduction of the Keelung Community-Based Integrated Screening (KCIS) program. Results: Health information system was designed and programmed on the basis of the demand derived from KCIS within which five cancers and three chronic diseases were included. In addition to the detailed description of infrastructure and process, design, relevant database and security involved in health information system, an innovative and extensive evaluation system in accordance with the main goats was included in our health information system. Conclusion:: Our information system proposed several aspects regarding organized screening system that has never been addressed in computerized system supporting for single screening. These included quality assurance system, organization features, co-morbidity profiles, epidemiological applications and social and economic considerations. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
