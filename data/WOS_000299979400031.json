This decision-making model helps decision-makers with reducing decision-making time and choosing a suitable decision alternative for a capital budgeting investment within the companies' goals, constraints and strategies. The methods utilized in this paper are goal programming (GP) and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP). We demonstrate a case study of the capital budgeting investment by using these two methods in a small car rental company. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
