From the multi-valued solutions determined by the method of characteristics, our algorithm \"extracts\" the entropy dissipative solutions, even after the formation of shocks. It applies to both convex and non-convex flux/Hamiltonians. We demonstrate the relevance of the proposed method with a variety of numerical tests, including conservation laws in one or two spatial dimensions and problem arising in fluid dynamics.
