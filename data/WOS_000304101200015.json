Time-mode signal processing, defined as the processing of sampled analog information using time-difference variables, is still a relatively new technology, and therefore, there is still much development needed to extend the technology into a general signal-processing tool. In this work, a set of general building blocks will be introduced that perform the most basic mathematical operations in the time-mode. By arranging these basic structures, higher-order time-mode systems, specifically, time-mode IIR filters, will be realized. A second low-pass time-mode IIR filter is implemented using discrete components. Measured results confirmed that the circuit performed low-pass filtering, providing a maximum SNR of 45.2 dB and SNDR of 35.3 dB.", "paper_title": "Sampled-data IIR filtering via time-mode signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000304101200015"}
