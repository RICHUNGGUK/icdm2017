The visualization is done through a graphics processing unit (GPU) ray casting algorithm applied to the whole object. At rendering time, the fine-scale details (mesostructures) are reconstructed preserving original quality. Visualizing surfaces with geometry textures allows a natural level-of-detail (LOD) behaviour. There are numerous applications that can benefit from the use of geometry textures. In this paper, besides a mesostructure visualization survey, we present geometry textures with three possible applications: rendering of solid models, geological surfaces visualization and surface smoothing.", "paper_title": "Geometry Textures and Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000261137800006"}
