Description Logics (DLs) are suitable, well-known logics for managing structured knowledge that have gained considerable attention the last decade. The current research progress and the existing problems of uncertain or imprecise knowledge representation and reasoning in DLs are analyzed in this paper. An integration between the theories of intuitionistic fuzzy DLs and rough DLs has been attempted by providing intuitionistic fuzzy rough DLs; based on intuitionistic fuzzy rough set theory. The syntax, semantics and properties of intuitionistic fuzzy rough DLs are given. It is proved that the satisfiability, subsumption, entailment and ABox consistency reasoning in intuitionistic fuzzy rough DLs may be reduced to the corresponding satisfiability, subsumption, entailment and ABox consistency reasoning in fuzzy DL over complete lattice, respectively.
