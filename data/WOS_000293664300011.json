A property of d-form functions is obtained firstly. Then we present a way to construct d-form sequences and extended d-form sequences with ideal autocorrelation. Based on our result, many sequences with ideal autocorrelation can be constructed by the corresponding difference-balanced d-form functions.", "paper_title": "Construction of d-Form Sequences with Ideal Autocorrelation", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300011"}
