This is usually referred to as deterministic analysis. But in reality there are uncertainties in design variables. These uncertainties include geometric properties (cross-sectional properties and dimensions), material mechanical properties (modulus and strength, etc), load magnitude and distribution, etc. Thus deterministic analysis cannot provide complete information regarding cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed. The purpose of this paper is to determine cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed under parametric uncertainty. Design/methodology/approach - An efficient and accurate algorithm is proposed to determine the cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed under parameter uncertainty. The proposed method is a hybrid method, consisting of the improved Monte Carlo simulation method and forward process analysis method. Findings - The proposed algorithm can obtain more information about the cable forces at different construction stages than the commonly used deterministic method, and it provides an improved understanding of the cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed with parameter uncertainties. Originality/value - The values of this type of research are that: it developed an efficient and accurate algorithm for determining the cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed under parameter uncertainty; and it provided an improved understanding of the cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed with parameter uncertainties.", "paper_title": "Determination of cable forces in cable-stayed bridges constructed under parametric uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000281276000001"}
