Based on a shape decomposing method, two-level generative shape grammars are developed within the application of Zhuang ethnic embroidery design. In our approach, free B-spline curves are used to derive initial design concepts together with a new interpolation algorithm. In order to cope with the potentially huge solution space, a novel aesthetic evaluation model and a design exploration algorithm are developed for designers to find their favorite design solutions based on their subjective assessments. A system is introduced to demonstrate this research with an example of Zhuang ethnic embroidery design. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
