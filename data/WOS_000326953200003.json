As a result, the energy spent on massive data accessing grows rapidly. In this paper, an energy-aware scheduling algorithm is proposed, which introduces a novel heuristic called Minimal Data-Accessing Energy Path for scheduling data-intensive workflows aiming to reduce the energy consumption of intensive data accessing. Extensive experiments based on both synthetical and real workloads are conducted to investigate the effectiveness and performance of the proposed scheduling approach. The experimental results show that the proposed heuristic scheduling can significantly reduce the energy consumption of storing/retrieving intermediate data generated during the execution of data-intensive workflow. In addition, it exhibits better robustness than existing algorithms when cloud systems are in presence of I/O-intensive workloads.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Aware Heuristic Scheduling for Data-Intensive Workflows in Virtualized Datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000326953200003"}
