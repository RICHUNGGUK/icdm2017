An accurate model usually leads to a better reconstruction quality, and the autoregressive (AR) model is a widely adopted model for image interpolation. Although a large amount of works have been done on AR models for image interpolation, there are plenty of rooms for improvements. In this work, we propose a robust and precise k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) searching scheme to form an accurate AR model of the local statistic. We make use of both LR and HR information obtained from a large amount of training data, in order to form a coherent soft-decision estimation of both AR parameters and high-resolution pixels. Experimental results show that the proposed learning-based AR interpolation algorithm has a very competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art image interpolation algorithms in terms of PSNR and SSIM values.
