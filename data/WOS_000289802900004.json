However, when the array facing a large steering direction error, their performance degrade significantly since the uncertainty in steering direction generally gives rise to an outstanding mismatch in ASV. In the applications of microphone array, large steering direction error is often unavoidable because of the motion of target speaker. Meanwhile, in addition to conventional adaptive beamformers, microphone array also requests a controlled frequency response to target signal. In this paper, we propose a new adaptive microphone array implemented in frequency domain with controlled mainlobe and frequency response. A compact ASV uncertainty set explicitly modelling steering direction error and the other arbitrary ASV errors is exploited to derive beamformer with robust constraints on array magnitude response. Numerical results show that the proposed microphone array not only produces large controlled robust response region and robust frequency response, but also achieves high performance in SINR enhancement.", "paper_title": "Robust Adaptive Microphone Array with Mainlobe and Response Ripple Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000289802900004"}
