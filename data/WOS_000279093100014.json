The identity (ID)-based public-key system with bilinear pairings defined on elliptic curves offers a flexible approach to achieve simplifying the certificate management. In the past, many user authentication schemes with bilinear pairings have been proposed. In 2009, Goriparthi et al. also proposed a new user authentication scheme for mobile client-server environment. However, these schemes do not provide mutual authentication and key exchange between the client and the server that are necessary for mobile wireless networks. In this paper, we present a new user authentication and key exchange protocol using bilinear pairings for mobile client-server environment. As compared with the recently proposed pairing-based user authentication schemes, our protocol provides both mutual authentication and key exchange. Performance analysis is made to show that our presented protocol is well suited for mobile client-server environment. Security analysis is given to demonstrate that our proposed protocol is provably secure against previous attacks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
