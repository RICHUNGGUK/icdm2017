Tessellation is performed according to a local test to generate primitives dynamically. The refinement procedure does not require the pre-computation of any refinement pattern. The resulting adaptive procedure is efficient and simple, and generates the tessellation pattern of each triangle dynamically. The non-recursive strategy simplifies mesh reconstruction, avoids irregular memory access patterns and uses a simple control flow to make it a good candidate to guide the evolution of tessellation algorithms on future graphics cards. To test our proposal, we have used the geometry shader of current GPUs to generate primitives dynamically.", "paper_title": "Efficient Adaptive and Dynamic Mesh Refinement Based on a Non-recursive Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000321052400004"}
