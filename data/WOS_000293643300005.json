Our new scheme is also the first one-time signature scheme that supports aggregation, batch veri fication, and which admits efficient proofs of knowledge. It has a fast signing algorithm, requiring only modular additions, and its verification cost is comparable to ECDSA verification. These properties make our scheme suitable for applications on resource-constrained devices such as smart cards and sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "SHORT ONE-TIME SIGNATURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000293643300005"}
