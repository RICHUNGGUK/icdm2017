However, distance measures commonly adopted for comparing time series, such as Euclidean and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), either are known to be inaccurate or are too time-consuming to be applied in a streaming environment. In this paper we propose a novel DTW-like distance measure, called Strearn-DTW (SDTW), which unlike DTW can be efficiently updated at each time step. We formally and experimentally demonstrate that SD TW speeds up the monitoring process by a factor that grows linearly with the size of the window sliding over the streams. For instance, with a sliding window of 512 samples, SDTW is about 600 times faster than DTW. We also show that SDTW is a tight approximation of DTW, errors never exceeding 10%, and that it consistently outperforms approximations developed for the case of static time series.
