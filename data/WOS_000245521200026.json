Results are presented comparing the method with an exact solution. Excellent agreement is obtained for economical solution representations. The aproximate analytic solution is supplemented by a correction term to ensure that the boundary conditions for the problem are satified exactly. In this form, the method is used to present calculations for the mapping of a hexahedral space to the unit cube.", "paper_title": "An analytic mapping of 3-D space to facilitate physical analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000245521200026"}
