For both proteins the global elastic modes are assigned to their characteristic topologies. Dronpa is a rigid beta-barrel structure, presenting the twisting, bending and breathing motion of a cylindrical rod. The beta sliding clamp of Escherichia coli is a hexagonal beta-wheel, consisting of rigid segments. In its spectrum four classes of vibrations are identified which are characteristic of an elastic torus. Correlation diagrams and RMSF analysis are compared. The results provide not only a comprehensive validation of the use of both methods to describe the elastic behavior according to the low-frequency normal modes, but also depict the correlated motions of beta-barrel and beta-wheel proteins. The harmonic flexibility of the Dronpa protein is compared to the principal components of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. A functionally important localized cleft opening mode is found, which is not detected by harmonic analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
