With the development of NCS, it is become more and more important for them to have the minimum time-delay and the ability of dynamic reconfiguration, which can accommodate the changes rapidly, smartly and flexibly. And it is important to find a routing algorithm, which is quicker to reduce the time to update the router and decrease the reconfiguration time as much as possible. In this paper, based on NCS, we discuss the process of GA with specialized encoding, initialization, selection, crossover and mutation. A specialized repair function is used to improve performance. In addition, experiment results are given to illuminate that GA can improve the performance of the NCS.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithm-based dynamic reconfiguration for networked control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000253522700008"}
