The existence of nonlinear balanced symmetric polynomials is an immediate corollary of this bound. Furthermore, we prove that X (2(t), 2(t+1) l-1) are balanced and conjecture that these are the only balanced symmetric polynomials over GF(2), where X(d, n) = Sigma(1 <= i1<i2<...<id <= n) x(i1) x(i2) ... x(id).", "paper_title": "Balanced symmetric functions over GF(p)", "paper_id": "WOS:000253602200026"}
