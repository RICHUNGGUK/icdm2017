Unfortunately, most of the existing data mining algorithms do not fit well in such environments since they require data that can be accessed in its entirety. It also is not easy due to the requirements of online transactional data streams. In this paper, we have developed a local algorithm for tracing frequent item sets over a P2P network. The performance of the proposed algorithm is comparatively tested and analyzed through a series of experiments.", "paper_title": "DISTRIBUTED FREQUENT ITEM SETS MINING OVER P2P NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361869000008"}
