The proposed model can be considered as a hierarchical multi-rate power control scheme, where current rate allocation decisions are influenced by a larger time horizon that contains information about directionality and velocity of vehicular mobile users. In this paper we integrate the mobility aware algorithm with a greedy channel rate allocation scheme to illustrate its effectiveness. Numerical investigations show that required power per transmitted packet can be reduced on average by 40% without penalizing throughput. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
