By linearising complicated system to some time-delayed subsystems, some novel criteria are given to ensure the robust synchronisation for the complex systems with multiple delays. Moreover, the presented results are also applied to the system with single time delay, and the coupling configuration matrix is not necessarily symmetric. Since the results are expressed in the form of linear matrix inequality , the obtained criteria can be easily checked in practice. Finally, numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Synchronisation analysis for coupled networks with multiple delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000357935900011"}
