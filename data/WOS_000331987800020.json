In ID/locator separation architecture, an ID/locator mapping system is indispensable to provide location management in mobile environments. This paper conducts a comparative study on two different ID/locator mapping approaches: centralized and distributed ID/locator mapping systems. We develop analytical models on the signaling cost incurred in location update and location query procedures of the centralized and distributed ID/locator mapping systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the distributed ID/locator mapping system with enhanced distributed hash table (DHT) has comparable signaling cost to the centralized ID/locator mapping system while providing higher scalability and robustness.
