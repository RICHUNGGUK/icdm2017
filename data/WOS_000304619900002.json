The proposed system allows children to learn about new objects/entities by tapping on physical objects through a specially designed RFID-Bluetooth based Tangible User Interface (TUI) tool. The output of the system is delivered as a set of appropriate multimedia representations related to the objects being tapped. The TUI uses RFID technology for object identification and Bluetooth communication to transmit data to the computer where the system's software is running. We incorporated our system in three games that allow children of different ages to benefit from the system's functionalities and encourage them to interact with it.", "paper_title": "RFID-based interactive multimedia system for the children", "paper_id": "WOS:000304619900002"}
