Traditionally, customer segmentation is achieved using statistics-based methods that compute a set of statistics from the customer data and group customers into segments by applying clustering algorithms. Recent research proposed a direct grouping-based approach that combines customers into segments by optimally combining transactional data of several customers and building a data mining model of customer behavior for each group. This paper proposes a new micro-targeting method that builds predictive models of customer behavior not on the segments of customers but rather on the customer-product groups. This micro-targeting method is more general than the previously considered direct grouping method. We empirically show that it outperforms the direct grouping and statistics-based segmentation methods across multiple experimental conditions and that it generates predominately small-sized segments, thus providing additional support for the micro-targeting approach to personalization.", "paper_title": "Dynamic micro-targeting: fitness-based approach to predicting individual preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000266453600004"}
