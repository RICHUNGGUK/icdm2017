Any cognitive architecture that supports visual search must account for where such memory resides in the system and how it can be used to guide eye movements in visual search. This paper presents a simple solution for the EPIC architecture that is consistent with the overall requirements for modeling visually-intensive tasks and other visual memory phenomena.
