Human behavior modeling can predict the general tendency in making errors, while data mining can recognize neurophysiological feedback in detecting cognitive abnormality on a trial-by-trial basis. This study suggests integrating human behavior modeling and datamining to predict human errors because it utilizes both 1) top-down inference to transform interactions between task characteristics and conditions into a general inclination of an average operator to make errors and 2) bottom-up analysis in parsing psychophysiological measurements into an individual's likelihood of making errors on a trial-by-trial basis. Real-time electroencephalograph (EEG) features collected in a numerical typing experiment and modeling features produced by an enhanced human behavior model (queuing network model human processor) were combined to improve error classification performance by a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. Integrating EEG and modeling features improved the results of LDA classification by 28.3% in keenness (d') and by 10.7% in the area under ROC curve (AUC) from that of using EEG only; it also outperformed the other three benchmarking scenarios: using behaviors only, using apparent task features, and using task features plus trial information. The AUC was significantly increased from using EEG along only if EEG + Model features were used.", "paper_title": "Integrating Human Behavior Modeling and Data Mining Techniques to Predict Human Errors in Numerical Typing", "paper_id": "WOS:000348072800004"}
