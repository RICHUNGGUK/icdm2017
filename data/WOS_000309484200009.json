In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach to approximately implement QPE with arbitrary constant-precision controlled phase shift operators. The new quantum algorithm bridges the gap between QPE algorithms based on QFT and Kitaev's original approach. For approximating the eigenphase precise to the nth bit. Kitaev's original approach does not require any controlled phase shift operator. In contrast, QPE algorithms based on QFT or approximate QFT require controlled phase shift operators with precision of at least Pi/2n. The new approach fills the gap and requires only arbitrary constant-precision controlled phase shift operators. From a physical implementation viewpoint, the new algorithm outperforms Kitaev's approach.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM PHASE ESTIMATION WITH ARBITRARY CONSTANT-PRECISION PHASE SHIFT OPERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309484200009"}
