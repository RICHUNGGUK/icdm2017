In this paper, we evaluate micro-blogger's features by follower factor, spreading factor and interaction factor, and integrate these user features with social relationship network structures into a unity graph model. Then we propose an influence analysis algorithm Influence-Rank, which aims to quantify the micro-bloggers' influence. Experimental results show that Influence-Rank can take both the network connectivity and user characteristics into account, dig out influential micro-bloggers who are important for information generation and dissemination. Compared with other methods, Influence-Rank shows better performance in objectivity and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Micro-Blogger Influence Analysis Based on User Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000317156900015"}
