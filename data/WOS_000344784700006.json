In this system, coupling of the flow with the electromagnetic field is obtained through nonlinear and stiff source terms, which may cause difficulties with the numerical solution of the coupled system. The discontinuous Galerkin finite element method is used for the numerical solution of this system. For the magnetic field vector, discontinuous Galerkin discretization is performed using a divergence-free vector base for the magnetic field to preserve zero divergence in the element and retain the implicit constraint of a divergence-free magnetic field vector down to very low level both globally and locally. To circumvent difficulties resulting from the presence of the stiff source terms, implicit time marching is used for the fully coupled system to avoid wrong wave shapes and propagation speeds that are obtained when the coupling source terms are lagged in time or by using splitting iterative schemes. Numerical solutions for benchmark problems computed on collocated meshes for the flow and electromagnetic field variables with this fully coupled monolithic approach showed good agreement with other numerical solutions and exact results.
