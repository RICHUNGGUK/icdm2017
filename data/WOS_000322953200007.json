We study the minimum mean-weight cycle on the complete graph on n vertices, with random i.i.d. edge weights drawn from an exponential distribution with mean 1. We show that the probability of the min mean weight being at most c/n tends to a limiting function of c which is analytic for c <= 1/e, discontinuous at c = 1/e, and equal to 1 for c > 1/e. We further show that if the min mean weight is <= 1/(en), then the length of the relevant cycle is Theta(p)(1) (i.e., it has a limiting probability distribution which does not scale with n), but that if the min mean weight is > 1/(en), then the relevant cycle almost always has mean weight (1 + o(1))/(en) and length at least (2/pi(2) - o(1)) log(2) n log log n.", "paper_title": "The Min Mean-Weight Cycle in a Random Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000322953200007"}
