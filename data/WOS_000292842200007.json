A design method for an optimal preview controller is presented, when the desired tracking and disturbance are piecewise-continuously differentiable functions. Applying the same techniques as for optimal control in linear quadratic optimal control, we derive a type-one servomechanism with both desired tracking preview and disturbance preview compensation. A proof is presented that if the original system is stabilizable and detectable, the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. We also design a full-dimensional state observer for the considered system. Finally, numerical simulations show the efficiency of the controller.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF AN OPTIMAL PREVIEW CONTROLLER FOR CONTINUOUS-TIME SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292842200007"}
