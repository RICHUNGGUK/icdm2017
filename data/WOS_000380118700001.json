They act only on those vectors in Hilbert space whose entries belong to some chosen number field. For Mutually Unbiased Bases the relevant number field is a cyclotomic field. By including Galois unitaries we are able to remove a mismatch between the finite projective group acting on the bases on the one hand, and the set of those permutations of the bases that can be implemented as transformations in Hilbert space on the other hand. In particular we show that there exist transformations that cycle through all the bases in all dimensions d - p(n) where p is an odd prime and the exponent n is odd. (For even primes unitary MUB-cyclers exist.) These transformations have eigenvectors, which are MUB-balanced states (i.e. rotationally symmetric states in the original terminology of Wootters and Sussman) if and only if d = 3 modulo 4. We conjecture that this construction yields all such states in odd prime power dimension.", "paper_title": "GALOIS UNITARIES, MUTUALLY UNBIASED BASES, AND MUB-BALANCED STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000380118700001"}
