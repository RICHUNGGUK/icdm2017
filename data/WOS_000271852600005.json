It is shown that the plant model can be identified from the input and output data obtained by output over-sampling even though the conventional identifiability conditions are not satisfied. Furthermore, its implementation is also investigated under the environment where the numerical representations in measurement device or controller only have finite wordlength. The new explicit expressions are presented to illustrate the property of quantization errors caused by finite wordlength effect and asymptotic variance of identification result. Some simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in the practical applications.", "paper_title": "ALGORITHM AND IMPLEMENTATION OF DIRECT CLOSED-LOOP IDENTIFICATION VIA OUTPUT OVER-SAMPLING SCHEME", "paper_id": "WOS:000271852600005"}
