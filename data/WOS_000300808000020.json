Simulations are performed to evaluate the average run length, standard deviation of the run length, and diagnostic abilities of the MaxGWMA and maximum exponentially weighted moving average (MaxEWMA) charts. An extensive comparison reveals that the MaxGWMA control chart is more sensitive than the MaxEWMA control chart. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
