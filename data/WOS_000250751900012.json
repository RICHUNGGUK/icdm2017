We consider a general class of nonautonomous neural networks with delays and various activation functions. A geometrical formulation that leads to a decomposition of the phase space into invariant regions is employed. We further derive criteria under which the n-neuron network admits 2(n) exponentially stable sets. In addition, we establish the existence of 2(n) exponentially stable almost periodic solutions for the system, when the connection strengths, time lags, and external bias are almost periodic functions of time, through applying the contraction mapping principle. Finally, three numerical simulations are presented to illustrate our theory.", "paper_title": "Multiple almost periodic solutions in nonautonomous delayed neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250751900012"}
