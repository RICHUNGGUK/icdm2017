In addition to accessing data from a wireless sensor network for personal use, and the generation of data through participatory sensing, we propose the use of smartphones to collect data from sensor nodes opportunistically. For this to be feasible, the mobility patterns of smartphone users must support opportunistic use. We analyze the dataset from the Mobile Data Challenge by Nokia, and we identify the significant patterns, including strong spatial and temporal localities. These patterns should be exploited when designing protocols and algorithms, and their existence supports the proposal for opportunistic data collection through smartphones. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
