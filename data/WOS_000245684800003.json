We recall some of the advantages of bilattice-based frameworks for handling fuzzy sets and systems, provide the related structures with adequately defined graded versions of the basic logical connectives, and study their properties and relationships.", "paper_title": "Uncertainty modeling by bilattice-based squares and triangles", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800003"}
