The paper is based on an in-depth case study and presents a solution delivery framework that can help companies in the professional printing industry devise, deliver and price integrated solutions. The case of Oce suggests that succeeding as a solution provider requires developing the capability to provide highly customised service logic-based solutions while retaining the capability to provide, efficiently, standardised goods logic-based solutions. Hence, it suggests that adopting different delivery approaches to address customers with different types of needs can help achieve such a capability. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
