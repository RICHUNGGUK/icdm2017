Reversible automata have been carefully analyzed by means of graph and matrix tools, in particular the extensions of the ancestors in these systems have a complete representation by Welch diagrams. This paper illustrates how the whole information of a reversible one-dimensional cellular automaton is conserved at both sides of the ancestors for sequences with an adequate length. We give this result implementing a procedure to obtain the inverse behavior by means of calculating and studying a single Welch diagram corresponding with the extensions of only one side of the ancestors. This work is a continuation of our study about reversible automata both in the local [15] and global [16] sense. An illustrative example is also presented.", "paper_title": "The inverse behavior of a reversible one-dimensional cellular automaton obtained by a single Welch diagram", "paper_id": "WOS:000252003800002"}
