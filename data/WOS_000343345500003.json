The construction is based on the use of dissimilarity functions and fuzzy equivalencies. Firstly, we introduce some ways of generating dissimilarity functions. Then, we present several formulae of divergence measures. Finally, we examine the properties of divergence measures as a whole. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
