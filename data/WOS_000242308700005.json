A classification of Turing machines according to their zeta numbers is proposed: divergent, convergent, and tuatara. We prove the existence of universal convergent and tuatara machines. Various results on (algorithmic) randomness and partial randomness are proved. For example, we show that the zeta number of a universal tuatara machine is c.e. and random. A new type of partial randomness, asymptotic randomness, is introduced. Finally we show that in contrast to classical (algorithmic) randomness-which cannot be naturally characterised in terms of plain complexity-asymptotic randomness admits such a characterisation.
