A periodic waveform reconstruction using incoherent undersampling remaps time indices of samples using the modulus of the suspected period of the signal, effectively folding the signal into a time window equal to one period. The major cost and accuracy limitations of the reconstruction technique arise from estimation of the waveform period. Multiple cost functions have been proposed to estimate the period, including frequency domain metrics, which are computationally intensive. In this paper, we propose a new time domain zero-crossing (ZC)-based metric, where the metric gives the number of ZC in the reconstructed waveform for an assumed period of the waveform. The reconstruction technique is also extended to beyond the track-and-hold amplifier bandwidth using a novel test setup combining the incoherent undersampling with multichannel bandwidth interleaving.", "paper_title": "Incoherent Undersampling-Based Waveform Reconstruction Using a Time-Domain Zero-Crossing Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000001"}
