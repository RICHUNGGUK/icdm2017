The simulated systems are defined in the Systems Biology Markup Language with additions to define compartment geometries.

These new features make it possible to construct physically consistent models of diffusion-controlled reactions also at fine spatial discretization.", "paper_title": "MesoRD 1.0: Stochastic reaction-diffusion simulations in the microscopic limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000311902700025"}
