The most important part of SPARQL query processing is its method of subgraph pattern matching. For this, most RDF stores use relation-based approaches, which can produce a vast number of redundant intermediate results during query evaluation. In order to address this problem, we propose an RDF Triple Filtering (R3F) method that exploits the graph-structural information of RDF data. We design a path-based index called the RDF Path index (RP-index) to efficiently provide filter data for the triple filtering. We also propose a relational operator called the RDF Filter (RFLT) that can conduct the triple filtering with little overhead compared to the original query processing. Through comprehensive experiments on large-scale RDF datasets, we demonstrate that R3F can effectively and efficiently reduce the number of redundant intermediate results and improve the query performance.", "paper_title": "R3F: RDF triple filtering method for efficient SPARQL query processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000349608400009"}
