A recursive, modified Newton approach to computing the estimates is presented. The structure of the problem is exploited to make the algorithm efficient. It is shown how to efficiently compute a descent search direction by using updating/downdating techniques for matrix factorizations. Numerical test results suggest that the proposed approach is effective. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.
