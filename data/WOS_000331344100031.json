The inter-description correlation at macro block (MB) level is applied to produce side information of different modes which is helpful for better side decoding quality. Furthermore, the intra-description correlation at MB level is exploited to design the adaptive skip mode for higher compression efficiency. The experimental results exhibit a better rate of side and central distortion performance compared with other relevant MDC schemes.", "paper_title": "Multiple Description Video Coding Using Inter- and Intra-Description Correlation at Macro Block Level", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100031"}
