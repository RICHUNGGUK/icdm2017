It is known that every complete fuzzy lattice can be represented as the concept lattice of a fuzzy context based on formal concept analysis [R. Belohlavek, Concept lattices and order in fuzzy logic, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 128 (2004) 277-298]. This paper shows that every complete fuzzy lattice can be represented as the concept lattice of a fuzzy context based on rough set theory if and only if the residuated lattice (L, *, 1) satisfies the law of double negation. Thus, the expressive power of concept lattices based on rough set theory is weaker than that of concept lattices based on formal concept analysis. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
