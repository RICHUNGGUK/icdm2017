Singularities in the parameter space determine the accuracy of estimation in the Bayesian scenario. The Newton diagram in algebraic geometry is recognized as an effective method by which to investigate a singularity. The present paper proposes a new technique to plug the diagram in the Bayesian analysis. The proposed technique allows the generalization error to be clarified and provides a foundation for an efficient model selection. We apply the proposed technique to mixtures of binomial distributions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
