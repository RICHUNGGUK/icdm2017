The model is generated by adding one node i with m links into a square lattice at each time step and the new node i is connected to the existing nodes with probabilities proportional to: (k(j))(alpha)/d(ij)(2), where k(j) is the degree of node j, alpha is the tunable parameter and d(ij) is the Euclidean distance between i and j. It is found that both the degree heterogeneity and the clustering coeffcient monotonously increase with the increment of alpha, while the average shortest path length monotonously decreases. Moreover, the evolutionary game dynamics and network traffic dynamics are investigated. Simulation results show that the value of alpha can also greatly influence the dynamic behaviors.", "paper_title": "TOPOLOGY PROPERTY AND DYNAMIC BEHAVIOR OF A GROWING SPATIAL NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000290495000002"}
