These pheromone marks can be sensed by all robots and thus provide a way for indirect communication between the robots. Apart from this, the robots have no means to communicate. Additionally they are memoryless, have no global information such as the domain map, own position, coverage percentage, etc. Despite the robots' simplicity, we show that they are able to cover efficiently any connected domains, including non-planar ones.", "paper_title": "Covering a continuous domain by distributed, limited robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100013"}
