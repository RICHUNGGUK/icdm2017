The requirement of enormous computational power, however, has made such simulations prohibitive so far. By using up to 12,288 Intel Xeon Phi 31S1P coprocessors on the new hybrid cluster Tianhe-2, which is the new number one supercomputer of the world, we have achieved 1.27 Pflop/s in double precision, which brings us much closer to the nanometre resolution. This is the result of efficiently using the hardware on different levels: (1) a single Xeon Phi (2) a single compute node that consists of a host and three coprocessors, and (3) a huge number of interconnected nodes. To overcome the challenge of programming Intel's new many-integrated core (MIC) architecture, we have adopted techniques such as vectorization, hierarchical data blocking, register data reuse, offloading computations to the coprocessors, and pipelining computations with intra-/inter-node communications.", "paper_title": "Towards simulation of subcellular calcium dynamics at nanometre resolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000349452000005"}
