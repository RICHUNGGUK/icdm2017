It is necessary in these conditions to have a method for accurate, real-time state estimation in the presence of channel noise. This problem is addressed, for the case of polynomial-growth-rate state spaces, through a new type of error-correcting code that is online and computationally efficient. This solution establishes a constructive analog, for some applications in estimation and control, of the Shannon coding theorem.", "paper_title": "Error-Correcting Codes for Automatic Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222000003"}
