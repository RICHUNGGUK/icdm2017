These parameters were developed using automated procedures within the program FFGenerAtor from a combination of crystallographic structures and ab initio calculations. These new parameters produced results in good agreement with experiment when tested against a blind validation set. To illustrate the utility of these new force field parameters, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models were developed to predict the P-glycoprotein uptake (log(10) VI) of a series of hexakis(areneisonitrile)technetium(I) complexes and to predict their biodistribution. The log(10) VI QSAR model, built using a training set of 16 Tc(I) isonitrile complexes, exhibited a correlation between the experimental log(10) VI and 5 simple descriptors as follows: r(2) = 0.94, q(2) = 0.93. When applied to an external test set of six Tc(l) isonitrile complexes, the QSAR preformed with great accuracy q(2) = 0.78 based on a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis. Further QSAR models were developed to predict the biodistribution of the same set of Tc(I) isonitrile complexes; a QSAR model to predict hepatic uptake exhibited a correlation between the experimental log(10)(Blood/Liver) with six simple descriptors as follows: r(2) = 0.97, q(2) = 0,96. A QSAR model to predict renal uptake exhibited a correlation between the experimental log(10)(Blood/Kidney) and six simple descriptors as follows: r(2) = 0.85, q(2) = 0.82. When applied to the external test set the QSAR models preformed with great accuracy, q(2) = 0.78 and 0.56, respectively. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
