Previous studies have shown that internal service quality (ISQ) ultimately drives the profit of enterprises. This research has thus chosen ISQ as the focus for the development of an assessment model to reform organizations that undertake ISQ to enhance their core competencies. This paper describes a fuzzy hierarchical analytic approach to determine the weighting of subjective judgments and presents a nonadditive fuzzy integral technique to evaluate an ISQ case as a fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem. Through literature reviews and experts interviews, 26 criteria are generated along with nine dimensions and five strategy alternatives. By ranking fuzzy weights and fuzzy synthetic utility values, the relative importance of criteria and the best strategies can be determined. An empirical case of ISQ improvement strategy for a Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer is demonstrated to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods when dealing with criteria that are not independent. The empirical results show that employee rewards and recognition outrank other strategies with regard to improving the ISQ. These results will not only help organizations that aim to improve their internal service operations, but can also assist human resource professionals in more effectively monitoring and improving the performance of employees.", "paper_title": "SELECTION OF AN IMPROVEMENT STRATEGY IN INTERNAL SERVICE OPERATIONS: THE MCDM APPROACH WITH FUZZY AHP AND NONADDITIVE FUZZY INTEGRAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800036"}
