It is shown that determining whether a finite system of fuzzy relational equations with min-biimplication composition has a solution is NP-complete. Moreover, a system of such equations can be fully characterized by a system of integer linear inequalities and consequently its solution set can be expressed in the terms of the minimal solutions of this system of integer linear inequalities.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy relational equations with min-biimplication composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000304103200006"}
