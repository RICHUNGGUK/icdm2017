For protocol stack reconfiguration to become commonplace, a language suitable for modeling, expressing, and circulating metadata essential to reconfiguration, including reconfigurable device capabilities and semantic properties of reconfigurable protocol stacks, is necessary. We outline related standardization initiatives in the mobile domain, summarize existing work in reconfiguration architectures and identify key shortcomings that hinder the advent of ubiquitously reconfigurable systems. Further on, we outline the major limitations of existing standards for the representation of capability information pertaining to protocol stacks. To support reconfigurable communication systems, we identify essential metadata classes and introduce an associated object-oriented UML model. We elaborate on the design rationale of the UML model, presenting and discussing the alternative metadata representation standards and suitable encoding formats. Finally, we demonstrate the suitability of our UML model by using it to describe the standardized protocol stacks of 3G cellular network elements.", "paper_title": "A generic model for reconfigurable protocol stacks in beyond 3G", "paper_id": "WOS:000238547100010"}
