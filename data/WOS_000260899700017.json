The method is based only on the structural information in a model, which means that possibly large and nonlinear differential-algebraic models can be handled in an efficient manner. The approach is exemplified on a model of an industrial valve where the benefits and properties of the method are clearly shown.", "paper_title": "Sensor Placement for Fault Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000260899700017"}
