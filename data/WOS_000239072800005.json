The Vanderbilt e-prescribing design team conducted initial interviews with clinic managers, physicians and nurses, and then represented the sequences of steps carried out to complete prescriptions in activity diagrams. The diagrams covered outpatient prescribing for patients during a clinic visit and between clinic visits. Practice size, practice setting, and practice specialty type influenced the prescribing processes used. The model developed may be useful to others engaged in building or tailoring an e-prescribing system to meet the specific workflows of various clinic settings.", "paper_title": "Case report: Activity diagrams for integrating electronic prescribing tools into clinical workflow", "paper_id": "WOS:000239072800005"}
