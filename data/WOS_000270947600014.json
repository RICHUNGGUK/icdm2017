These methods furnish a partition and a prototype for each cluster by optimizing an adequacy criterion that measures the fitting between the clusters and their representatives. These adaptive quadratic distances change at each algorithm iteration and can either be the same for all clusters or different from one cluster to another. Moreover, various tools for the partition and cluster interpretation of interval-valued data are also presented. Experiments with real and synthetic interval-valued data sets show the usefulness of these adaptive clustering methods and the merit of the partition and cluster interpretation tools.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Clustering of Interval-Valued Data Based on Adaptive Quadratic Distances", "paper_id": "WOS:000270947600014"}
