Recently, Average Normalized Mutual Information (ANMI) has been used to define categorical data clustering as an optimization problem. To find globally optimal or near-optimal partition determined by ANMI, a genetic clustering algorithm (G-ANMI) is proposed in this paper. Experimental results show that G-ANMI is superior or comparable to existing algorithms for clustering categorical data in terms of clustering accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
