However, there has been little work yet for digraphs. Recently, Perera and Mizoguchi (2010) introduced the directed Laplacian matrix L = D - A and directed Laplacian energy LE(G)= Sigma(n)(i=1) lambda(2)(i) using the second spectral moment of L for a digraph G with n vertices, where D is the diagonal out. degree matrix, and A = (a(ij)) with a(ij) = 1 whenever there is an arc (i, j) from the vertex i to the vertex j and 0 otherwise. They studied the directed Laplacian energies of two special fatuities of digraphs (simple digraphs and symmetric digraphs). In this paper, we extend the study of Laplacian energy for digraphs which allow both simple and symmetric arcs. We present lower and upper bounds for the Laplacian energy for such digraphs and also characterize the extremal graphs that attain the lower and upper bounds. We also present a polynomial algorithm to find an optimal orientation of a simple undirected graph such that the resulting oriented graph has the minimum Laplacian energy among all orientations. This solves an open problem proposed by Perera and Mizoguchi at 2010.", "paper_title": "Laplacian Energy of Digraphs and a Minimum Laplacian Energy Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000370870100004"}
