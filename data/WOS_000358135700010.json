However, the efficacy assessment of this traditional intervention has been mainly empirical rather than scientific. In this paper, we propose a surface electromyography (sEMG) based approach for quantitative assessment of acupuncture on Bell's palsy. The assessment is made by comparing the muscle activities of healthy with diseased ones. A feature-vector of four individual sEMG features is introduced for more comprehensive representation of muscle activity. A clustering technique is then proposed to calculate quantitative differences between the muscle activities of the healthy and diseased sides. A regressive model is also proposed to predict the recovery trend of a patient based on the quantitative assessments during his/her clinical acupuncture history. As reported in the paper, a total of 20 selected Bell's palsy patients have participated in the extensive experiments that were conducted to verify the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "sEMG based quantitative assessment of acupuncture on Bell's palsy: an experimental study", "paper_id": "WOS:000358135700010"}
