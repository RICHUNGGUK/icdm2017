Thus, this research compares the attitudes of undergraduates in Taiwan and in the United States toward USC, in particular, legal and ethical perspectives. A collection of 133 surveys indicates undergraduate students in Taiwan are significantly more sensitive to USC than those in the United States. In addition, the self-reported ability to copy software was significantly lower among Taiwanese participants than U.S. students. For those who reported higher abilities to copy software or those with religious convictions, their attitudes seemed to be more open-minded toward USC either in terms of legality or degree of ethical behavior The implications is that government agents should actively attempt to reformulate undergraduates' ethical values and enact appropriate policies to prevent students in Taiwan from engaging in USC.", "paper_title": "CULTURAL EFFECTS ON PERCEPTIONS OF UNAUTHORIZED SOFTWARE COPYING", "paper_id": "WOS:000311005000007"}
