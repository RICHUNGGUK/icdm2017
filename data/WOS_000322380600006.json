First, we propose token flow control, which enables bypassing of flit buffering in routers, thereby reducing buffer size and their power consumption. We also incorporate reduced-swing signaling in on-chip links and crossbars to minimize datapath interconnect energy. The 64-node NoC is experimentally validated with a 2 x 2 test chip in 90 nm, 1.2 V CMOS that incorporates traffic generators to emulate the traffic of the full network. Compared with a fully synthesized baseline 8 x 8 NoC architecture designed to meet the same peak throughput, the fabricated prototype reduces network latency by 20% under uniform random traffic, when both networks are run at their maximum operating frequencies. When operated at the same frequencies, the SWIFT NoC reduces network power by 38% and 25% at saturation and low loads, respectively.", "paper_title": "SWIFT: A Low-Power Network-On-Chip Implementing the Token Flow Control Router Architecture With Swing-Reduced Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000322380600006"}
