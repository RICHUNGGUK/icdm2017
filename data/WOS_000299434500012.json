By means of the finite element (FE) method, the influence of the number of implants used in immediately loaded fixed partial prosthesis (FPP) on the load distribution was investigated, considering the abutment geometry. Two 3D FE models were studied employing four implants to support a FPP in the premaxilla. One model was designed with straight abutments and the other with 20 degrees-angled abutments. The results concerning implant displacements, stresses and strains were compared with those of two implant-supported FPPs, obtained in a previous study. A noticeable reduction in the determined biomechanical bone loading was observed with the use of more implants in supporting an immediately loaded prosthesis. This study confirms that the use of additional numbers of implants in an immediately loaded prosthesis is highly recommended.", "paper_title": "The influence of implant number and abutment design on the biomechanical behaviour of bone for an implant-supported fixed prosthesis: a finite element study in the upper anterior region", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434500012"}
