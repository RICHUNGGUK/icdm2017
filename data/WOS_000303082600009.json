The Kronecker product G(1) x G(2) has vertex set V(G(1) X G(2)) = V(G(1)) X V(G(2)) and edge set E(G(1) x G(2)) = {(u(1), nu(1))(u(2), nu(2)): u(1)u(2) is an element of E(G(1)) and nu(1) v(2) is an element of E(G(2))}. A graph G is super connected, or simply super-kappa, if every minimum separating set is the neighbors of a vertex of G, that is, every minimum separating set isolates a vertex. In this paper we show that if G is a graph with kappa(G)=delta(G) and K-n (n >= 3) a complete graph on n vertices, except that G is a complete bipartite graph K-m,K-m (m >= 1) and K-n = K-3, then G x K-n is super-kappa, where kappa(G) and delta(G) are the connectivity and the minimum degree of G, respectively.
