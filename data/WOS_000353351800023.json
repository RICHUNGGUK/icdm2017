It is a challenge problem on how to keep them both private and accessible. Re-encryption function is a useful tool to fulfill secure cloud computing. Cloud data owners store their encrypted data on the cloud server. When other cloud users want to share the cloud data, cloud server can re-encrypt the encrypted data for them. So data on the cloud server can be both accessible and private. Secure obfuscation for re-encryption function can hide all the private information in the re-encryption function, so the obfuscated program can be directly outsourced to cloud server without leaking anything about the computation task. In this paper, we study on secure obfuscation for three kinds of new re-encryption functions: multi-use re-encryption, conditional re-encryption with keyword search, and broadcast re-encryption. We utilize the obfuscated results as tools to fulfill secure cloud computing. Cloud-computing schemes based on obfuscation have better security compared with other tools.
