This complexity results in a significant amount of work and risk. This article presents a case study of a product software vendor that tries to reduce this complexity by integrating product data management (PDM), software configuration management (SCM), and customer relationship management (CRM) into one system. The case study shows that by combining these management areas in a single software knowledge base, software maintenance processes can be automated and improved, thereby enabling a software vendor of enterprise resource planning software to serve a large number of customers with many different product configurations.
