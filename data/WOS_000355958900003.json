Indeed, RGB-D sensors are promising in their use as assistive technologies in ambient assisted living and rehabilitation places. The paper describes the system developed for creating and monitoring the ambient assisted environment for rehabilitation. The proposal consists of four major tasks: workspace configuration, information integration, user identification, and user tracking. Another main concern in this paper is to assess the user experience of the environment and scenario. A qualitative evaluation of the proposal has been performed to find out how the stakeholders of the proposed RGB-D assistive technologies environment (injured patients and therapists) use and perceive the ambient assisted rehabilitation room.", "paper_title": "RGB-D assistive technologies for acquired brain injury: description and assessment of user experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000355958900003"}
