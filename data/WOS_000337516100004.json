However, it also brings the problem of sensitive information leaking in disregard of privacy, especially when it is executed in distributed environment. In this paper, we propose a cryptography-based framework to realize privacy-preserving document clustering among the users under the distributed environment; there are two parties, each having his private document database, want to collaboratively execute agglomerative document clustering without disclosing their private contents. We provide two implementations of such a framework, one is with more precision and stronger security but requires more computational resources. The other is a simplified version with less computational complexity and achieves higher processing speed. Additionally, we provide the security proofs and experimental analysis of precision and scalability of our proposal.
