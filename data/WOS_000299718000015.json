First, the pulse generation control logic, an AND function, is removed from the critical path to facilitate a faster discharge operation. A simple two-transistor AND gate design is used to reduce the circuit complexity. Second, a conditional pulse-enhancement technique is devised to speed up the discharge along the critical path only when needed. As a result, transistor sizes in delay inverter and pulse-generation circuit can be reduced for power saving. Various postlayout simulation results based on UMC CMOS 90-nm technology reveal that the proposed design features the best power-delay-product performance in seven FF designs under comparison. Its maximum power saving against rival designs is up to 38.4%. Compared with the conventional transmission gate-based FF design, the average leakage power consumption is also reduced by a factor of 3.52.", "paper_title": "Low-Power Pulse-Triggered Flip-Flop Design With Conditional Pulse-Enhancement Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000015"}
