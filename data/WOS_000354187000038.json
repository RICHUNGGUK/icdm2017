Statistical methods have been extensively applied in the forecasting community for the past decades. Recently, machine learning techniques have drawn attention and useful forecasting systems based on these techniques have been developed. In this paper, we propose an approach based on neuro-fuzzy modeling for time series prediction. Given a predicting sequence, the local context of the sequence is located in the series of the observed data. Proper lags of relevant variables are selected and training patterns are extracted. Based on the extracted training patterns, a set of TSK fuzzy rules are constructed and the parameters involved in the rules are refined by a hybrid learning algorithm. The refined fuzzy rules are then used for prediction. Our approach has several advantages. It can produce adaptive forecasting models. It works for univariate and multivariate prediction. It also works for one-step as well as multi-step prediction. Several experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
