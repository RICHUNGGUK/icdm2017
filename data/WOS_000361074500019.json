It works by reducing the otherwise complex problem of a 3D shape and material morph into multiple simpler 2D morphs. The shape morph operates on 2D depth maps and then reconstructs a conventional mesh, making it insensitive to the input geometry quality. Our morphing algorithm robustly handles topology changes and outputs complete meshes and lumigraphs for later use. We show how 2D image morphs can be computed from 3D correspondences, while eliminating ambiguities that might result in the projected 2D morphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
