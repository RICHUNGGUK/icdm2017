The proposed heuristic combines genetic algorithm with rolling horizon approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic, some numerical experiments are conducted and corresponding results are compared with those of previously developed heuristics by authors. The comparative results indicate the superiority of genetic algorithm-based heuristic specially in solving the large-sized problem instances. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
