On the basis of discernibility function, the solution of rough set based attribute reduction can be found by satisfiability methods. With extension rule theory, a satisfiability method, the distribution of solutions with different number of attributes is obtained without enumerating all attribute reductions. Then, it is easy to search the attribute reduction with the smallest number of attributes. In addition, the cost of space and time is analyzed to find factors playing role in the computation of the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
