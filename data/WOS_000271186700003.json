This work examines the potential of feed forward artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a data reduction approach and compared predictions to rigid link and EMG-assisted models. Ten males and ten females performed dynamic lifts, all approaches were applied and comparisons of predicted joint moments and joint forces were evaluated. While the ANN underpredicted peak extension moments (p = 0.0261) and joint compression (p < 0.0001), predictions of cumulative extension moments (p = 0.8293) and cumulative joint compression (p = 0.9557) were not different. Therefore, the ANNs proposed may be used to obtain estimates of cumulative exposure variables with reduced input demands; however they should not be applied to determine peak demands of a worker's exposure.", "paper_title": "The use of artificial neural networks to reduce data collection demands in determining spine loading: a laboratory based analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000271186700003"}
