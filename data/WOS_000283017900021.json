For this reason, when planning a step-stress experiment, the change point could be chosen so as to minimize the probability of non-existence of the MLE. These non-existence probabilities are examined and compared in the one- as well as the two-sample situations. Moreover, the optimal allocations of the change points are discussed and the effects of the use of non-optimal choices for the change points are assessed. (C) 2010 Elsevier BM.
