Unfortunately, the signal in plastic injection modeling process such as nozzle pressure that is relevant to part quality is not easy to obtain because of the cost of sensors. The sensor-based modeling idea is therefore adopted. In this paper, a new method for predicting the parts weight in plastic injection molding using least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR) is proposed, which is composed of two steps. The first step is to estimate the nozzle pressure with the hydraulic system pressure using an LS-SVR model. The second step is to predict product weight using the estimated nozzle pressure, which is done using another LS-SVR model. The experimental results show that the new method is very effective.", "paper_title": "Predicting the Parts Weight in Plastic Injection Molding Using Least Squares Support Vector Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000260899300009"}
