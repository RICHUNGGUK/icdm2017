Hence, the information-centric networks (ICNs), or so-called future Internet, have been proposed for efficient data delivery. In this paper, we propose to place data repeaters (DRs) in high-demand regions. Placement of the DRs in these regions is optimized though the deployment approach that achieves two main network objectives: 1) minimizing data-delivery traffic and 2) minimizing data-publisher load. We formulate the deployment problem as a mixed integer linear program that determines the optimal set of deployment locations among the candidate hot spots to meet the future Internet objective. Our simulation results demonstrate that the significant data-delivery traffic and publishers' load reductions are possible by incorporating the proposed deployment strategy. Through simulations, we also use the optimized deployment approach to investigate the factors that affect the optimal DR allocation in the ICN, such as the DRs' count, network size, hot spots distribution, and publishers' load-balance. Using our results, we make observations on how service providers can best deploy/utilize DRs in the future Internet.", "paper_title": "A Novel Architecture for Data-Repeaters in the Future Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000369396100003"}
