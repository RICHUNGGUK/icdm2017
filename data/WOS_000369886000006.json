Like other dual decomposition algorithms, AD(3) has a modular architecture, where local subproblems are solved independently, and their solutions are gathered to compute a global update. The key characteristic of AD(3) is that each local subproblem has a quadratic regularizer, leading to faster convergence, both theoretically and in practice. We provide closed-form solutions for these AD(3) subproblems for binary pairwise factors and factors imposing first-order logic constraints. For arbitrary factors (large or combinatorial), we introduce an active set method which requires only an oracle for computing a local MAP configuration, making AD(3) applicable to a wide range of problems. Experiments on synthetic and real-world problems show that AD(3) compares favorably with the state-of-the-art.", "paper_title": "AD(3): Alternating Directions Dual Decomposition for MAP Inference in Graphical Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000369886000006"}
