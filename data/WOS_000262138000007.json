We investigate such an effect under quantum models, and make a complete research about the initial states that can be adapted. By the comparison of the payoffs which come from the GHZ class, W class and initial states without entanglement, we find out that entanglement plays an important role here. Moreover, we reveal that, particular initial state without entanglement can even provide us optimal payoff. Thorough discussion and exact results in this article will help us not only to make appropriate choices in quantum Parrondo game, but also have a deeper understanding about entanglement and quantum game.", "paper_title": "INFLUENCE OF ENTANGLEMENT IN QUANTUM PARRONDO GAME", "paper_id": "WOS:000262138000007"}
