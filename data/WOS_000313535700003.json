Design/methodology/approach - Because of its specific structure, the cogging torque influences the main part of the torque pulsation in a Halbach array PMSM. In this paper, first it is shown that the conventional magnet skewing method does not have a significant effect on the torque pulsation in this motor, and then an improved skewing method with fewer skewing steps is proposed. In this method permanent magnet segments are placed sinusoidally, with two-step skewing along the rotor. Generalization with different combinations of slots and poles is considered for a Halbach array PMSM. Findings - Using a detailed finite element method (FEM) it was found that with the proposed technique the cogging torque factor is reduced to as low as 8 percent, while the average value of the torque is maintained near the machine nominal average torque. Practical implications - Halbach array PMSMs are very good candidates for high dynamic performance applications such as aerospace applications due to their high acceleration and deceleration features. This technique also resolves the mechanical vibration and acoustic noise issues, which are caused by torque pulsation and significantly affect machine performance. Originality/value - The originality of this paper lies in the FEM results. Since Halbach array PMSMs have a special structure it was shown that the conventional skewing method does not work well for this machine. The new proposed technique has a significant effect on the torque pulsation.", "paper_title": "Improved technique for minimizing torque pulsation in Halbach array permanent magnet machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000313535700003"}
