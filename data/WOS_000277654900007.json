For this problem, an algorithm of time complexity O(V nT(n+T)) is presented, where V is an upper bound on the total supply, n is the number of nodes, and T denotes the given time horizon of the dynamic flow problem. The algorithm is a discrete-time version of the successive shortest path algorithm.", "paper_title": "Minimum cost time-varying network flow problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000277654900007"}
