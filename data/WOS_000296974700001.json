Hall and ion-slip effects are retained in the presence of mass diffusion of chemically reacting species. The governing partial differential equations are transformed into the ordinary differential equations by the use of similarity variables. The resulting problems are solved analytically by homotopy analysis method (HAM). A comparative study between the present and existing limiting results is carefully made. The convergence of derived series solutions is ensured. The influence of different physical parameters on dimensionless velocities, temperature and concentration field are seen through plots. The variation of skin friction coefficients, Nusselt number and Sherwood number for different values of involved parameters is analyzed.
