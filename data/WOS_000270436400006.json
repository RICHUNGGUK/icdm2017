The proposed method uses a cell-based approach with a dedicated hardware description language called ARITH. By using ARITH, we can describe and verify any binary/multiple-valued arithmetic circuits in a formal manner. The ARITH description can be transformed into a technology-dependent netlist in binary/multiple-valued fused logic. The process of transforming the netlist into a physical layout pattern is automatically performed by an off-the-shelf place-and-route tool. In this paper, we present a specific cell library containing a multiple-valued signed-digit adder and its related circuits with a 0.35 mu m CMOS technology, and demonstrate that the proposed method can synthesize a 32 x 32-bit parallel multiplier in multiple-valued current-mode logic from an ARITH description.", "paper_title": "Systematic Approach to Designing Multiple-Valued Arithmetic Circuits Based on Arithmetic Description Language", "paper_id": "WOS:000270436400006"}
