One important approach, suggested by Wang, Luo and Liu in 2007 determines a special class of OWA operators with the least square deviation (LSD) of OWA weights for a given orness level. In this paper, using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we solve this constrained optimization problem analytically, and derive a polynomial equation to determine the optimal weighting vector. Numerical examples illustrate our proposed approach. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
