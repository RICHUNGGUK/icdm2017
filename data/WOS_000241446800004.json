Currently many structured and semi-structured documents have been applied for ontology learning and annotation. However, most of the electronic documents on the web are plain-text, and these texts are still not well utilized for the Semantic Web. In this paper, we propose a novel method to automatically extract topic terms to generate a concept hierarchy from the data of Chinese Bulletin Board System (BBS), which is a collection of plain-text. In addition, our work provides the text source associated with the extracted concept as well, which could be a perfect fit for the semantic search application that makes a fusion of both formal and implicit semantics. The experimental results indicate that our method is effective and the extracted concept hierarchy is meaningful.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical topic term extraction for Semantic annotation in Chinese bulletin board system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800004"}
