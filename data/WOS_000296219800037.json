We define this new problem and develop an integer programming-based heuristic for it. We apply our heuristic to 30 instances to determine the reduction in distance traveled that can be achieved by allowing split deliveries among vehicles based at the same depot and vehicles based at different depots. We generate new test instances with high-quality, visually estimated solutions and report results on these instances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
