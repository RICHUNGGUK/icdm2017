Design/methodology/approach - Reviewing of former studies and correction of conceptual mistakes in a reviewed former study. Findings - The required classification is possible, and a battery of tests has been developed. Practical implications - This research is applicable for choosing for each individual student the teaching approach most suiting this student. Originahty/value - The suggested classification method is new. It may prevent learning problems like dyslexia and dyscalculia, and it may increase the learning level of the entire population.", "paper_title": "The cybernetics of learning mathematics and computer sciences", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029100008"}
