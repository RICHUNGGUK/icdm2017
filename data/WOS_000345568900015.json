This paper introduces Minitaur, an event-driven neural network accelerator, which is designed for low power and high performance. As an field-programmable gate array-based system, it can be integrated into existing robotics or it can offload computationally expensive neural network tasks from the CPU. The version presented here implements a spiking deep network which achieves 19 million postsynaptic currents per second on 1.5 W of power and supports up to 65 K neurons per board. The system records 92% accuracy on the MNIST handwritten digit classification and 71% accuracy on the 20 newsgroups classification data set. Due to its event-driven nature, it allows for trading off between accuracy and latency.", "paper_title": "Minitaur, an Event-Driven FPGA-Based Spiking Network Accelerator", "paper_id": "WOS:000345568900015"}
