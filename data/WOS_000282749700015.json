This is surprising, given that many protein interactions have high specificity that depends on detailed atomic recognition between physiochemically complementary surfaces. Are the reported high accuracies realistic? Results: We find that the reported accuracies of the predictions are significantly over-estimated, and strongly dependent on the structure of the training and testing datasets used. The choice of which protein pairs are deemed as non-interactions in the training data has a variable impact on the accuracy estimates, and the accuracies can be artificially inflated by a bias towards dominant samples in the positive data which result from the presence of hub proteins in the protein interaction network. To address this bias, we propose a positive set-specific method to create a 'balanced' negative set maintaining the degree distribution for each protein, leading to the conclusion that simple sequence-based features contain insufficient information to be useful for predicting PPIs, but that protein domain-based features have some predictive value.", "paper_title": "Simple sequence-based kernels do not predict protein-protein interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000282749700015"}
