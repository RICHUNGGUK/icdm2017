We show that, for any crossing supermodular function f, the f-connectivity can be tested with a constant number of queries in the general digraph model with average degree bound. As immediate corollaries, we obtain constant-time testers for k-edge-connectivity, rooted-(k,l)-edge-connectivity, and the property of having k arc-disjoint arborescences. We also give a corresponding result for the undirected case.", "paper_title": "Testing the Supermodular-Cut Condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000350873800013"}
