However, the large size, dynamic nature, and heterogeneous expression of distributed manufacturing resources bring forth a serious challenge in scalability and efficiency. This paper presents a self-organized P2P framework that supports scalable and efficient manufacturing service (MS) discovery for cross-enterprise collaboration by forming and maintaining autonomous enterprise peer groups (PG). Each enterprise exhibits as a peer that provides some sharable MSs that are represented comprehensively and formally with a generalized ontology. Each enterprise PG dynamically clusters a set of enterprise peers offering semantically similar MSs, and elects the most reputed peer through multicriteria trust evaluation as its core (i.e., super peer, SP). Then, a MS request can be first routed to the suitable SP and further to its leaf peer in a systematic way, thus supporting efficient service discovery. A prototype system is implemented on JXTA for real application and validated through an experimental case study.", "paper_title": "Self-Organized P2P Approach to Manufacturing Service Discovery for Cross-Enterprise Collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000331905300002"}
