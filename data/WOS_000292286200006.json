Service oriented architectures provide a composition framework to create new business functionalities from autonomous building blocks called services, enabling organizations to quickly adapt to changing conditions and requirements. Characteristics of services offer the promise of leveraging the value of enterprise systems through source code reuse. In this respect, existing system components can be used as the foundation of newly created services. However, one problem to overcome is the lack of business semantics to support the reuse of existing source code. Without sufficient semantic knowledge about the code in the context of business functionality, it would be impossible to utilize source code components in services development. In this paper, we present an automated approach to enrich source code components with business semantics. Our approach is based on the idea that the gap between the two ends of an enterprise system-(1) services as processes and (2) source code-can be bridged via similarity of data definitions used in both ends. We evaluate our approach in the framework of a commercial enterprise systems application. Initial results indicate that the proposed approach is useful for annotating source code components with business specific knowledge.", "paper_title": "Semantic enrichment process: An approach to software component reuse in modernizing enterprise systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000292286200006"}
