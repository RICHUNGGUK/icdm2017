According to the high regularity of hypercube networks, an optimized distributed algorithm (Opt-AMPA) for AMPA is proposed by clustering strategy, whose time cost can fill the requirements of the actual networks. The simulation results indicate that effectiveness of the algorithm can be improved drastically using Opt-AMPA.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL ACO-BASED MULTICAST PATH ALGORITHM IN HYPERCUBE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000294522100006"}
