However interfaces that use a pen alone can be slow and inefficient. Thus most pen interfaces also support keyboard and mouse input. Multi-modal input exponentially increases the complexity of the design and usability of these systems. Here we describe our usability testing experiences of four different pen-dominant software tools. One is designed for a digital whiteboard, two for a Tablet PC and the last for a Tablet PC coupled to a haptic pen. Our experiences suggest that pen only input is difficult to achieve with a standard operating system because the pen is appreciably overloaded. However, in situations where a keyboard and mouse is convenient, users tolerate the inefficient of pen interaction in exchange for convenience.", "paper_title": "Experiences with digital pen, keyboard and mouse usability", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536700003"}
