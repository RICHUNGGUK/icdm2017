An overview of model formulations of the aircraft and crew scheduling problems is presented in order to emphasize similarities between solution approaches applied to the planning and recovery problems. A brief overview of research within schedule robustness in airline scheduling is included in the review, since this proactive measure is a natural complement to disruption management.
