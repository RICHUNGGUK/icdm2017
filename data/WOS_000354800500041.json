Different from previous works, weighted assumptions are introduced to attain completeness of our framework. Since weighted assumptions can be implicitly represented by multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDD's), we give an L*-based learning algorithm for MTBDD's to infer weighted assumptions. Experimental results suggest promising outlooks for our compositional technique.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Weighted Automata in Compositional Reasoning about Concurrent Probabilistic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354800500041"}
