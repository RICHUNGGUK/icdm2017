We will describe how, apart from being a standard dynamic environment for elementary geometry, GDI addresses some key problems of the dynamic geometry paradigm, by including enhanced tools for loci generation and automatic proving, plus another distinguished feature, namely, a discovery option, allowing the user to find complementary hypotheses for arbitrary statements to become true. The key technique for all these improvements is the development of an automatic \"bridge\" between the graphic and the algebraic counterparts of the program (calling on an external computer algebra system).", "paper_title": "Towards solving the dynamic geometry bottleneck via a symbolic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835500007"}
