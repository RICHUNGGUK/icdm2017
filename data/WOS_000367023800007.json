Transferring big data volume among the aforementioned parties requires a high bandwidth connection, which consumes larger amounts of energy than just processing and storing big data on cloud data centres, and hence producing high carbon dioxide emissions. This power consumption is highly significant when transferring big data into a data centre located relatively far from the users geographical location. Thus, it became high-necessity to locate the lowest energy consumption route between the user and the designated data centre, while making sure the users requirements, e.g. response time, are met. The main contribution of this paper is GreeDi, a network-based routing algorithm to find the most energy efficient path to the cloud data centre for processing and storing big data. The algorithm is, first, formalised by the situation calculus. The linear, goal and dynamic programming approaches are used to model the algorithm. The algorithm is then evaluated against the baseline shortest path algorithm with minimum number of nodes traversed, using a real Italian ISP physical network topology. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
