As the first commercial application of CR technology, IEEE 802.22 wireless regional area networks (WRAN) aim to offer broadband wireless access by efficiently utilizing the unoccupied TV channels. In this paper, we investigate the problem of utility function selection and its impact on streaming video quality through an IEEE 802.22 WRAN base station (BS) cognitive engine (CE) testbed developed at Wireless@Virginia Tech. We find that significant improvement on received video quality can be achieved when CE adopts a dynamic, content-aware, video-specific utility function rather than a static, predefined, general purpose utility function. This work indicates the importance of video distortion modeling and cross-layer design, and the need for employing dynamic content-aware utility functions at the CE for cognitive streaming video communication networks.", "paper_title": "Utility Function Selection for Streaming Videos with a Cognitive Engine Testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000277203400012"}
