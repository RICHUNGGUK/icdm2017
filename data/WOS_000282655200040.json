This enhances the capabilities of the model and allows to obtain, at a low computational cost, a better reproduction of the wave field (and as a consequence currents and beach response) behind a coastal structure, especially if it is permeable and/or low crested. Model results are compared with laboratory data, showing a good agreement and the suitability of the followed approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
