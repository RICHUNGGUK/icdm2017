By constructing a new parameter-dependent Lyapunoy functional and applying free-weighting matrices technique, the new parameter-dependent and delay-dependent robust stability conditions will be obtained in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and the merits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED PARAMETER-DEPENDENT ROBUST STABILITY CRITERIA FOR TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS WITH POLYTOPIC UNCERTAINTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000265260800010"}
