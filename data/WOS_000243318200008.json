The entanglement for three different cases is studied: the homogeneous case, the impurity case of symmetric electron hopping, and asymmetric electron hopping. We find that the local entanglement of the system can be tuned by introducing different impurities characterized by the physical parameters of the system. In particular, for certain parameters, the entanglement is negligible up to a critical point U-c, where a quantum phase transition occurs, and is different from zero above U-c.", "paper_title": "Entanglement and quantum phase transition in a one-dimensional system of quantum dots with disorder", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318200008"}
