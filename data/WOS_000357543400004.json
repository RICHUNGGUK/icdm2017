Many researches have been conducted in the literature for this purpose. But, still recognizing activities in a video with unrestricted conditions is a challenging problem. Moreover, finding the spatio-temporal location of the activity in the video is another issue. In this paper, we present a method based on a non-negative matrix completion framework, that learns to label videos with activity classes, and localizes the activity of interest spatio-temporally throughout the video. This approach has a multi-label weakly supervised setting for activity detection, with a convex optimization procedure. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
