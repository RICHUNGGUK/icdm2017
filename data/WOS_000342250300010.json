This paper evaluates eight different concept drift detectors (Dom, EDDM, PHT, STEPD, DOF, ADWIN, Paired Learners, and ECDD) and performs tests using artificial datasets affected by abrupt and gradual concept drifts, with several rates of drift, with and without noise and irrelevant attributes, and also using real-world datasets. In addition, a 2(k) factorial design was used to indicate the parameters that most influence performance which is a novelty in the area. Also, a variation of the Friedman non-parametric statistical test was used to identify the best methods. Experiments compared accuracy, evaluation time, as well as false alarm and miss detection rates. Additionally, we used the Mahalanobis distance to measure how similar the methods are when compared to the best possible detection output. This work can, to some extent, also be seen as a research survey of existing drift detection methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
