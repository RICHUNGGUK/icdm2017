The uncertainty is represented as a vector constrained in a given set that affects the coefficients of the mathematical model of the GRN. It is shown how regions containing all possible steady states can be estimated via an iterative strategy that progressively splits the concentration space into smaller sets, discarding those that are guaranteed not to contain equilibrium points of the considered model. This strategy is based on worst case evaluations of some appropriate functions of the uncertainty via linear matrix inequality optimization.", "paper_title": "On the Steady States of Uncertain Genetic Regulatory Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305584400021"}
