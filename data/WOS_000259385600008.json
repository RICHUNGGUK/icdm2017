The IEEE 802.11r proposes the fast basic service set (BSS) transition to speed up the transition process for a STA moving within the same mobility domain (MD). This scheme require unique MD assignment so that the STA knows whether it should conduct fast BSS transition process (for intra-MD scenario) or the expensive initial MD association process (for inter-MD scenario). However, how to guarantee unique MD identifier (MDID) assignment is not mentioned in the specification. This paper proposes a mechanism for IEEE 802.11r fast transition without using MDID, and therefore eliminates the cost for MDID management.
