In this paper we present the application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the self-emergence of a common lexicon in robot teams. By modeling the vocabulary or lexicon of each agent as an association matrix or look-up table that maps the meanings (i.e. the objects encountered by the robots or the states of the environment itself) into symbols or signals we check whether it is possible for the robot team to converge in an autonomous, decentralized way to a common lexicon by means of RL, so that the communication efficiency of the entire robot team is optimal. We have conducted several experiments aimed at testing whether it is possible to converge with RL to an optimal Saussurean Communication System. We have organized our experiments alongside two main lines: first, we have investigated the effect of the team size centered on teams of moderated size in the order of 5 and 10 individuals, typical of multi-robot systems. Second, and foremost, we have also investigated the effect of the lexicon size on the convergence results. To analyze the convergence of the robot team we have defined the team's consensus when all the robots (i.e. 100% of the population) share the same association matrix or lexicon. As a general conclusion we have shown that RL allows the convergence to lexicon consensus in a population of autonomous agents. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
