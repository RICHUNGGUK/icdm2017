Only by understanding the discipline of opinion formation under the influence of internet chat rooms, can we succeed in monitoring and guiding opinions effectively, and thereby securing internal networks. We propose a multi-agent model permitting neutral opinions to investigate the influence of internet chat rooms on network public opinion evolution. The populations with Internet Chat Room always reach consensus instead of fragmentation. The convergence time decays remarkably as more and more people participate in discussion in Internet Chat Room. Moreover, Internet Chat Room also can help group advertise their opinion. Our investigation demonstrates that internet chat rooms strengthen our communication between each other, and accelerate the process of opinion spreading.", "paper_title": "Influence of Internet Chat Rooms on Network Public Opinion", "paper_id": "WOS:000291504300004"}
