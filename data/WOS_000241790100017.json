Memory is said to be labile when certain cognitive and/or pharmacological processes lead to its partial or total destruction, Classical theory held that once consolidated, memory is not susceptible to disruption. However, recent experiments have suggested that when a consolidated memory is reactivated, it can become labile again (Nader 2003). A process of reconsolidation is likely to be required for the activated memory (\"reconsolidation hypothesis\"). Here we investigate the lability of human declarative memory. The results show that a reactivated declarative memory becomes labile under certain conditions. It is suggested that declarative memory in an active recollected state becomes susceptible to modification, editing, and even erasure in some extreme cases.", "paper_title": "Lability of reactivated human declarative memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100017"}
