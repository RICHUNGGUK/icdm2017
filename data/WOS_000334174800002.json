The data were collected over a period of 3 years at a technical university by means of two field studies. Particular attention is drawn to how the situated orchestration of devices and applications within a group's constellation reflects university students' concern to manage their projects at a number of locations, as well as issues of time and circulation of resources. The analysis brings into focus how constellations of technologies emerge and dissolve within collaborative ensembles that only exist for the duration of a project, and how this can cause appropriation issues within groups.", "paper_title": "Understanding Constellations of Technologies in Use in a Collaborative Nomadic Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000334174800002"}
