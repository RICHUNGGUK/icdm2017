In the past the relational database model was generalized to the multimedia database model. More recently the relational database model was generalized to the data streams model, as the technology advanced and data became bulky and unbounded in size due to the utilization of sensor networks. In this paper we take one more step of generalization by providing a multimedia data streams model. The objective is to furnish a formal framework to design multimedia data streams (MMDS) schema for efficient content based information retrieval. We also extend the functional dependency theory and the normalization framework to handle multimedia data streams. Finally we present algorithmic methods of generating continuous multimedia queries along with examples for illustration.", "paper_title": "A computation-oriented multimedia data streams model for content-based information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000273480300011"}
