The structure of our algorithm allows efficient implementation on parallel architectures. Two implementations on a SIMD processor and on a GPU are discussed. Numerical results demonstrate up to four orders of magnitude improvement in execution time compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Parallel Algorithms for Approximation of Distance Maps on Parametric Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000260888800001"}
