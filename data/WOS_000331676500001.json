The topology optimization is integrated into a multidisciplinary algorithm in which both the aerodynamic shape and the structural topology are optimized concurrently using gradient-based optimization. The optimization results were compared with the results of a sequential procedure in which the aerodynamic shape was optimized separately and then used as a fixed design feature in a subsequent structural optimization. The results show that the concurrent approach offers a significant advantage, as this design achieved 42% less drag than the sequentially optimized wing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
