In the present method, which is originated in VSIAM3 (volume/surface integrated average based multi-moment method), the surface-integrated values are employed as the major variables to increase the connectivity between the volume-integrated and surface-integrated values and between the collocated volume-integrated values. Resultingly, it changes the solution procedure by modifying the trajectory averaging process of all moments having been introduced in the original researches. To verify the staggered-like CIP-CSL/FV method, two phase benchmarking problems are tested with the THINC/WLIC (tangent of hyperbola for interface capturing/weighted line interface calculation) scheme capturing interfaces sharply and volume-conservatively.
