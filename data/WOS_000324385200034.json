To improve the ability to interpret apparent object motion in video containing illumination variation, an illumination-robust optical flow method is designed. This method decouples brightness into reflectance and illumination components using a stochastic technique; reflectance is given higher weight to ensure robustness against illumination, which is suppressed. Illumination experiments using the Middlebury and University of Oulu databases demonstrate the decoupled method's improvement when compared with state-of-the-art. In addition, a novel technique is implemented to visualize optical flow output, which is especially useful to compare different optical flow methods in the absence of the ground truth.", "paper_title": "A Decoupled Approach to Illumination-Robust Optical Flow Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200034"}
