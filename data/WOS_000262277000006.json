Once a server falls, the other server will take full responsibility for the services. Here, we assume that the servers do not fail simultaneously. In the backup 2-center problem, we want to deploy two servers at the vertices such that the expected distance from a farthest vertex to the closest functioning server is minimum. In the backup 2-median problem, we want to deploy two servers at the vertices such that the expected sum of distances from all vertices to the set of functioning servers is minimum. We propose an O(n)-time algorithm for the backup 2-center problem and an O(n log n)-time algorithm for the backup 2-median problem, where n is the number of vertices in the given tree network.
