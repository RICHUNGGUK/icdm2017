This randomized approach is based on a variant of red-blue intersections and is appealing due to its elegance and practical efficiency when compared to parametric search. We introduce the first algorithm to compute the geodesic Frechet distance between two polygonal curves A and B inside a simple bounding polygon P. The geodesic Frechet decision problem is solved almost as fast as its nongeodesic sibling in O(N-2 log k) time and O(k + N) space after O(k) preprocessing, where N is the larger of the complexities of A and B and k is the complexity of P. The geodesic Frechet optimization problem is solved by a randomized approach in O(k + N-2 log kN log N) expected time and O(k + N-2) space. This runtime is only a logarithmic factor larger than the standard nongeodesic Frechet algorithm [Alt and Godau 1995]. Results are also presented for the geodesic Frechet distance in a polygonal domain with obstacles and the geodesic Hausdorff distance for sets of points or sets of line segments inside a simple polygon P.", "paper_title": "Geodesic Frechet Distance Inside a Simple Polygon", "paper_id": "WOS:000288825000009"}
