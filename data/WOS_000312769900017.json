At the beginning of the work, the amplifier circuit is deeply analyzed and is optimized for the best phase linearity over the bandwidth resulted in a group delay variation less than 1 ps. The amplifier circuit is designed with 0.35 mu m SiGe heterojunction bipolar transistor BICMOS process. 9 GHz bandwidth, almost 58 dB Omega transimpedance gain with less than 11.18 pA/ averaged input-referred noise current are achieved. Electrical sensitivity is 15 mu A(pp). Power consumption is 71 mW at 3.3 V single power supply.", "paper_title": "A broadband, differential transimpedance amplifier in 0.35 mu m SiGe BICMOS technology for 10 Gbit/s fiber optical front-ends", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900017"}
