In this paper, a model checking method is introduced including semantic aspects in both the model description and the formula to be verified. In addition, Unary resource description framework (RDF) annotated Petri net systems, a formalism that allows the semantic description of business processes using RDF annotations, is formally defined and used to represent the input model of the model checker. Finally, the prototype implementations of both the Unary RDF annotated Petri net formalism and a model checker framework based on the use of RDF and SPARQL tools are also presented.", "paper_title": "Model Checking Analysis of Semantically Annotated Business Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305584400006"}
