This article proposes a novel method for detecting driver normal and emergency left-or right-lane-changing intentions by using driver models based on the queuing network cognitive architecture. Driver lane-changing and lane-keeping models are developed and used to simulate driver behavior data associated with 5 kinds of intentions (i.e., normal and emergency left-or right-lane-changing and lane-keeping intentions). The differences between 5 sets of simulated behavior data and the collected actual behavior data are computed, and the intention associated with the smallest difference is determined as the detection outcome. The experimental results from 14 drivers in a driving simulator show that the method can detect normal and emergency lane-changing intentions within 0.325 s and 0.268 s of the steering maneuver onset, respectively, with high accuracy (98.27% for normal lane changes and 90.98% for emergency lane changes) and low false alarm rate (0.294%).", "paper_title": "Detecting Driver Normal and Emergency Lane-Changing Intentions With Queuing Network-Based Driver Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000349841800006"}
