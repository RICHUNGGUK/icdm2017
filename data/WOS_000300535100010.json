Design/methodology/approach - The magnetic saturation and strong coupling make it very difficult to derive a comprehensive mathematical model for the behavior of the LSRMs. Meanwhile, the various end effects could not be comprehensively considered in the two-dimensional model which is widely studied. Therefore, the magnetic equivalent circuit model including the three-dimensional (3-D) effects is presented in this paper and 3-D finite element analysis (FEA) is used to validate the mathematical model. Findings - The results from 3-D FEA are in good agreement with the numerical simulation, which validates the accuracy of the magnetic equivalent circuit modeling method. Practical implications - This technique helps one to know the influence exerted by the magnet saturation and end effect of LSRMs and provides a powerful computer-aided analysis tool. Meanwhile, this modeling method supplies accurate values for the following study of reliable control algorithm. Originality/value - The paper presents a magnetic equivalent method to estimate the magnetic saturation and end effect of ISRMs with fully pitched winding configuration used in the wave energy conversion.", "paper_title": "Magnetic saturation and end effects in LSRMs modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000300535100010"}
