The configuration step plays a vital role in determining two important aspects of a product family: efficiency (cost savings due to commonality) and effectiveness (capability to satisfy performance requirements). Many existing product platform design methods ignore it, assuming a given platform configuration. Most approaches, whether or not they consider the configuration step, are single-platform methods, in which design variables are either shared across all product variants or not shared at all. In multiple-platform design, design variables may be shared among variants in any possible combination of subsets, offering opportunities for superior overall design but presenting a more difficult computational problem. In this work, sensitivity analysis and cluster analysis are used to improve both efficiency and effectiveness of a scale-based product family through multiple-platform product family design. Sensitivity analysis is performed on each design variable to help select candidate platform design variables and to provide guidance for cluster analysis. Cluster analysis, using performance loss due to commonization as the clustering criterion, is employed to determine platform configuration. An illustrative example is used to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method, and the results are compared with existing results from the literature.", "paper_title": "Product platform design through sensitivity analysis and cluster analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000248171700007"}
