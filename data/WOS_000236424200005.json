Leuven is benchmarked with several commercially available solvers in the analysis of a complete industry-standard SOIC8 (single-outline integrated circuit with eight leads) circuit, packaging, and interconnection topology. The benchmark deals with predicted results as well as computer speed and memory. The benchmark description and results should give practicing engineers valuable insights into (at least part of) the products on the present-day full-wave 3D EM simulation market.
