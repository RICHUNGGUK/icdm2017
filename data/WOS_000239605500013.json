Previous formulations only incorporate local region potentials, which are sensitive to incorrectly classified pixels during iteration. We introduce a global likelihood potential to achieve better estimation of the foreground and background models and, thus, better extraction results. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficacy.", "paper_title": "Iterative local-global energy minimization for automatic extraction of objects of interest", "paper_id": "WOS:000239605500013"}
