Our CPN based scheme addresses two key issues on task scheduling problems, dependence detecting and task dispatching. We model inter-task dependences using CPN, including true-dependences, output-dependences, anti-dependences and structural dependences. The dependences can be detected automatically during model execution. Additionally, the proposed model takes the checking of real-time constraints into consideration. We evaluated the scheduling scheme on the state-of-art FPGA based multiprocessor hardware system and modeled the system behavior using CPN tools. Simulations and state space analyses are conducted on the model. Experimental results demonstrate that our scheme can achieve 98.9% of the ideal speedup on a real FPGA based hardware prototype.
