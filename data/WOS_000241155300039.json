To manage replica allocation efficiently, CLEAR exploits user mobility patterns and deploys a super-peer architecture, which avoids both broadcast storm during replica allocation as well as broadcast-based querying. CLEAR considers different levels of replica consistency and load as replica allocation criteria. Our performance study indicates CLEAR's overall effectiveness in improving data availability in M-P2P networks.", "paper_title": "CLEAR: An efficient context and location-based dynamic replication scheme for Mobile-P2P networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300039"}
