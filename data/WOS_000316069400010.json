In particular, mobile devices with cameras allow us to easily capture and modify photographs that can be shared via social networks. In this paper, we introduce a mobile device application for converting photographs into photomosaic images. In general, high-quality photomosaics require large databases. However, mobile devices have limited resources; hence it is difficult for such devices to support photomosaics. We propose a method that produces a photomosaic effect using a database that consists of rotatable images. We also propose a solution to the performance issue based on a best match search.", "paper_title": "A study on stackable mosaic generation for mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000316069400010"}
