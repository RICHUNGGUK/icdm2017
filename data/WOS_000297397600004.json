Wang and Chen (2008) gave a simple method to construct the complete fuzzy complementary preference relation from only n - 1 pairwise comparisons. However, some values may not be in the defined scope and need to be transformed, and thus some original information may be lost in the transformation process. In this paper, we propose a new method to avoid this issue based on the multiplicative consistency of the fuzzy complementary preference relation and apply it to fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). An example is further given to illustrate our method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
