In real life, some information retrieval problems can only be described as learning a binary classifier from a set of incompletely labeled examples, where a small set of labeled positive examples and a very large set of unlabeled ones are provided. In this case, all of the traditional text classification methods can't work properly. In this paper, we propose a method called Weighted Voting Classifier, which is an improved 1-DNF algorithm. Experimental results on the Reuters-21578 set show that our algorithm Weighting Voting Classifier outperforms PEBL and one-class SVM in terms of F measure. Weighting Voting Classifier can achieve high F score when comparing with PEBL and one-class SVM. Furthermore, the reduction of iterations is 2.26 when comparing the method of PEBL with ours.", "paper_title": "Extracting initial and reliable negative documents to enhance classification performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000237198800009"}
