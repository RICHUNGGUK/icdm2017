In this paper, the parametric form of the fuzzy linear system is used. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the set of fuzzy solutions are derived, and a numerical procedure for calculating the solutions is designed.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy linear matrix equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000265818300003"}
