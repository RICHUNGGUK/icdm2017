Coalitions are viewed as [0,1]-valued functions on a set of players, which enables to express a degree of membership of a player in a coalition. Every game is a real-valued mapping on a semisimple MV-algebra. The goal is to recover the so-called core: a set of final distributions of payoffs, which are represented by measures on the MV-algebra. A class of sublinear games are shown to have a non-empty core and the core is completely characterized in certain special cases. The interpretation of games on propositional formulas in Lukasiewicz logic is introduced.", "paper_title": "Core of Coalition Games on MV-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000290588300006"}
