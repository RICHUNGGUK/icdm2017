With the emergence of new data intensive technologies and increasing amounts of data, new computing concepts are needed. The integration of big data producing technologies, such as wireless sensor networks, Internet of Things, and cloud computing, into cyber-physical systems is reducing the available time to find the appropriate solutions. This paper presents one possible solution for the coming exascale big data processing: a data flow computing concept. The performance of data flow systems that are processing big data should not be measured with the measures defined for the prevailing control flow systems. A new benchmarking methodology is proposed, which integrates the performance issues of speed, area, and power needed to execute the task. The computer ranking would look different if the new benchmarking methodologies were used; data flow systems would outperform control flow systems. This statement is backed by the recent results gained from implementations of specialized algorithms and applications in data flow systems. They show considerable factors of speedup, space savings, and power reductions regarding the implementations of the same in control flow computers. In our view, the next step of data flow computing development should be a move from specialized to more general algorithms and applications.", "paper_title": "New Benchmarking Methodology and Programming Model for Big Data Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000361196000001"}
