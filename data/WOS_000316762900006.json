We study the codes' properties especially using the ambiguity function to analyze the nature of the output of the matched filter. We apply our provided ternary codes to the SSN as pulse compression codes for narrowband pulse signals and simulate the target detection performance of the system. Comparing with the classical periodic Gold sequences, our codes could improve the system detection performance.", "paper_title": "Phase Coded Waveform Design for Sonar Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000316762900006"}
