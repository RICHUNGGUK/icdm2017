We propose a localized delay-bounded and energy-efficient data aggregation (DEDA) protocol for request-driven wireless sensor networks with IEEE 802.11 carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance run at media access control layer. This protocol uses a novel two-stage delay model, which measures end-to-end delay by using either hop count or degree sum along a routing path depending on traffic intensity. It models the network as a unit disk graph (UDG) and constructs a localized minimal spanning tree (LMST) sub-graph. Using only edges from LMST, it builds a shortest-path (thus energy-efficient) tree rooted at the actor for data aggregation. The tree is used without modification if it generates acceptable delay, compared with a given delay bound. Otherwise, it is adjusted by replacing LMST sub-paths with UDG edges. The adjustment is done locally on the fly, according to the desired progress value computed at each node. We further propose to integrate DEDA with a localized sensor activity scheduling algorithm and a localized connected dominating set algorithm, yielding two DEDA variants, to improve its energy efficiency and delay reliability. Through an extensive set of simulation, we evaluate the performance of DEDA with various network parameters. Our simulation results indicate that DEDA far outperforms the only existing competing protocol.
