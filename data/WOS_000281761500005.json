In addition, there is a universal constantO = 22 such that if f (x) is a separable self-concordant barrier, then O2F(X) is a self-concordant barrier. This generalizes the relationship between the standard logarithmic barriers -Sigma(n)(i=1) log xi and -log det X and gives a partial solution to a conjecture of L.
