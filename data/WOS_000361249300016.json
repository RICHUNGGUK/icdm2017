Exergy analysis offers a clear understanding of the integration of thermodynamic systems in process integration. A new methodology that combines total site analysis and exergy analysis is presented. The methodology allows for simultaneous use of both thermodynamic systems and heat transfer networks. The combination of the two types of utilities allows for better exploitation of the plants' energy profile. In addition, the methodology allows specifying the networks' and thermodynamic systems characteristics and number. The capacities of this methodology are tested on a case study where different combinations of systems are studied to determine their behavior with variable parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
