This lack of work relates to difficulties faced by scientists and engineers, mostly due to two Achilles' heels of Grid computing: incompleteness of resource information and high execution failure rates. This paper shows an application (Industry@Grid) developed to profit from grid computing resources to support the product-mix decision making in a plastic company and presents an analysis of grid related issues that drove the current design of Industry@Grid.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Product-Mix: A Grid Computing Industrial Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000354499900008"}
