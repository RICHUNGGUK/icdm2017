However, the use of limited window in signal processing may introduce a cross-term between them, which deteriorates the speech recognition accuracy. To tackle this problem, we introduce the q-logarithmic (q-log) spectral domain of non-extensive statistics and propose q-log spectral mean normalization (q-LSMN) which is an extension of log spectral mean normalization (LSMN) to this domain. The recognition experiments on a synthesized noisy speech database, the Aurora-2 database, showed that q-LSMN was consistently better than the conventional normalization methods, CMN, LSMN, and MVN. Furthermore, q-LSMN was even more effective when applied to a real noisy environment in the CEN-SREC-2 database. It significantly outperformed ETSI AFE front-end. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
