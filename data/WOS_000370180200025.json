The proposed scheme provides both end-to-end privacy and data integrity for data aggregation in WSNs. In our scheme, the base station can recover each sensing data collected by all sensors even if these data have been aggregated by aggregators, thus can verify the integrity of all sensing data. Besides, with these individual sensing data, base station is able to perform any further operations on them, which means RPIDA is not limited in types of aggregation functions. The security analysis indicates that our proposal is resilient against typical security attacks; besides, it can detect and locate the malicious nodes in a certain range. The performance analysis shows that the proposed scheme has remarkable advantage over other asymmetric schemes in terms of computation and communication overhead. In order to evaluate the performance and the feasibility of our proposal, the prototype implementation is presented based on the TinyOS platform. The experiment results demonstrate that RPIDA is feasible and efficient for resource-constrained sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "RPIDA: Recoverable Privacy-preserving Integrity-assured Data Aggregation Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000370180200025"}
