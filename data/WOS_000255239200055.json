An adaptive NN feedback control scheme and an impulsive controller for output tracking error disturbance attenuation of nonlinear switched impulsive systems are given under all admissible switched strategy based on NN. The NN is used to compensate for the nonlinear uncertainties of switched impulsive systems, and the approximation error of NN is introduced to the adaptive law in order to improve the tracking attenuation quality of the switched impulsive systems. Impulsive controller is designed to attenuate effect of switching impulse. Under all admissible switching law, impulsive controller and adaptive NN feedback controller can guarantee asymptotic stability of tracking error and improve disturbance attenuation level of tracking error for the overall nonlinear switched impulsive system. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control and stabilization methods. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
