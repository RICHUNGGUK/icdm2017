The solution to this problem stems from recent neighborhood-based vision systems research. A neighborhood is viewed in the context of a covering of a visual space defined by a tolerance relation. Determination of neighborhoods and tolerance classes leads to a highly practical tolerance near-set approach in vision system design. The contribution of this article is threefold: an algorithm for finding tolerance classes, a new measure for quantifying the similarity between tolerance classes, and a practical application in the design of cybernetic vision systems.", "paper_title": "NEIGHBORHOOD-BASED VISION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286901200003"}
