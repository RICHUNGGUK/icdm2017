The wave numbers of amide I, amide II and amide III bands of all three conformations predicted at B3LYP/6-31G and B3LYP/6-31G* are in good agreement with previously reported experimental values of polyglutamic acid and polylysine. Agreement with experiment improves when polarization functions are included in the basis set. Explicit water molecules, H-bonded to the backbone amide groups were found to be absolutely necessary to obtain this agreement. Our results indicate that DFT is a promising tool for assignment of the spectral data on kinetics of conformational changes for peptides during amyloid formation.", "paper_title": "Are density functional theory predictions of the Raman spectra accurate enough to distinguish conformational transitions during amyloid formation?", "paper_id": "WOS:000277202700004"}
