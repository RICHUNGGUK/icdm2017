This notion generalizes that of partial words. The theory of codes on combinatories on words is revisited by defining (R, S)-codes for arbitrary similarity relations R and S. We describe an algorithm to test whether or not a finite set of words is an (R, S)-code. Coding properties of finite sets of words are explored by finding maximal and minimal relations with respect to relational codes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
