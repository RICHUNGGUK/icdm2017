IP alias resolution, the task of mapping IP addresses to their corresponding routers, is an important task in building such topology maps. In this paper, we present a new probe-based IP alias resolution tool called palmtree. Palmtree can be used to complement the existing schemes in improving the overall success of alias resolution process during topology map construction. In addition, palmtree incurs a linear probing overhead to identify IP aliases. The experimental results obtained over Internet2 and GEANT networks as well as four major Internet Service Providers (ISPs) present quite promising results on the utility of palmtree in obtaining more accurate network topology maps.
