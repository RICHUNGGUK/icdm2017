Nevertheless, little research has been done with regard to children and VMC. In this paper, we explore the behavior of a group of children, who exchanged video messages in an informal context. In particular, this paper presents the results of 11-week VMC study of 30 children from the USA and Greece, exploring children's behavior with the asynchronous video-based messaging tool we developed called VideoPal. In the study, children's interactions, perceptions, content exchanged and emotions were collected. The results from the analyses highlight that the emotion of happiness dominated in the communication. Moreover, the content included useful personal information and is connected with children's interactions (e.g., number of views and of recipients). In addition, children generally preferred VideoPal to email because they felt that it was easier and has more fun.", "paper_title": "Understanding children's behavior in an asynchronous video-mediated communication environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000327131800005"}
