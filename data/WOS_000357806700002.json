The aim of this work is to develop a seizure detection system with high accuracy. The proposed system was mainly based on multifractal analysis, which describes the local singular behavior of fractal objects and characterizes the multifractal structure using a continuous spectrum. Compared with computing the single fractal dimension, multifractal analysis can provide a better description on the transient behavior of EEG fractal time series during the evolvement from interictal stage to seizures. Thus both interictal EEG and ictal EEG were analyzed by multifractal formalism and their differences in the multifractal features were used to distinguish the two class of EEG and detect seizures. In the proposed detection system, eight features (alpha(0), alpha(min), alpha(max), Delta alpha, f(alpha(min)), f(alpha(max)), Delta f and R) were extracted from the multifractal spectrums of the preprocessed EEG to construct feature vectors. Subsequently, relevance vector machine (RVM) was applied for EEG patterns classification, and a series of post-processing operations were used to increase the accuracy and reduce false detections. Both epoch-based and event-based evaluation methods were performed to appraise the system's performance on the EEG recordings of 21 patients in the Freiburg database. The epoch-based sensitivity of 92.94% and specificity of 97.47% were achieved, and the proposed system obtained a sensitivity of 92.06% with a false detection rate of 0.34/h in event-based performance assessment.", "paper_title": "Multifractal Analysis and Relevance Vector Machine-Based Automatic Seizure Detection in Intracranial EEG", "paper_id": "WOS:000357806700002"}
