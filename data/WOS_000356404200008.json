Recently, a distributed localization method has been proposed based on a novel concept of angle of departure (AOD) estimation, which can be employed by e.g., the single antenna sensors to estimate the angle information and achieve localization. Based on the AOD estimation, in this paper, we introduce a synthetic uniform circular array (SUCA) synthesized by a rotary antenna on anchor to get the distributed localization of the sensors in multi-path environments. The rotated operation of antenna could create the SUCA with a larger aperture to deal with AOD of multipath components (MPCs) and relax the condition that array aperture should be greater than the number of MPCs. This new localization method only relies on radio transceivers without requiring extra measuring equipments, and the sensor nodes conduct localization in a completely distributed manner instead of centralized processing, which is suitable for large-scale WSN. Meanwhile, the influence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) between the transceivers is also considered and it is eliminated by utilizing the signal emitted from an auxiliary antenna.", "paper_title": "A distributed localization in wireless sensor networks utilizing AOD estimation and synthetical uniform circular array", "paper_id": "WOS:000356404200008"}
