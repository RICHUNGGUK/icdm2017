Using the model of parametric timed automata and model checker HYTECH, we formally derive a set of linear constraints that ensure the correctness of the response times of the memory. We are also able to infer the constraints characterizing the optimal setup timings of input signals. We have checked, for two different implementations of this architecture, that the values given by our model match remarkably with the values obtained by the designer through electrical simulation.", "paper_title": "Timed verification of the generic architecture of a memory circuit using parametric timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000263011000003"}
