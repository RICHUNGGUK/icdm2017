Although several scheduling approaches have been developed to address voltage scaling together with stringent timing constraints, inter-task relations have been neglected. This work presents a pre-runtime method for hard real-time systems scheduling considering dynamic voltage scaling, overheads and inter-task relations. The proposed work considers time Petri nets as a formal model in order to provide a basis for precise schedule generation as well as to allow property analysis and verification. Experimental results depict the proposed approach feasibility, in the sense that energy consumption is minimized as well as system constraints are met.
