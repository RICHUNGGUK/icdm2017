The determination of an appropriate kernel type and the associated parameters for SVR is a challenging research topic in the field of support vector learning. In this study, we present a novel method for simultaneous optimization of the SVR kernel function and its parameters, formulated as a mixed integer optimization problem and solved using the recently proposed heuristic 'extremal optimization (EO)'. We present the problem formulation for the optimization of the SVR kernel and parameters, the EO-SVR algorithm, and experimental tests with five benchmark regression problems. The results of comparison with other traditional approaches show that the proposed EO-SVR method provides better generalization performance by successfully identifying the optimal SVR kernel function and its parameters.", "paper_title": "Extremal optimization for optimizing kernel function and its parameters in support vector regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000289803000005"}
