In cooperative communications, rational helper selection is an important issue to obtain good cooperative gain at destinations. There are many works on this topic; however, most of them are based on hop-by-hop model and few works investigate how to select helpers for the nodes in a multi-hop path to optimize the end-to-end performance. The helper selection for one node could affect the helper selection for other nodes on the same route and in turn affect end-to-end performance. In other words, the traditional hop-by-hop helper selection methods could not lead to optimal performance in multi-hop environments. To solve this, this paper firstly defines a novel cooperation mode, named segment cooperation, and deduces the capacity and outage probability of cooperation segment. Then new performance metrics, end-to-end capacity and end-to-end outage probability, are defined to measure the end-to-end performance of multi-hop route. Finally, a segment cooperation method is proposed to maximize these metrics.", "paper_title": "Segment cooperation communication in multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308427200008"}
