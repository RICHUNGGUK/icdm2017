As for the first contest in 2004, this dataset was selected to test the ability of participants to apply regression methods to NIR data. The aim of Challenge 2007 was to perform a calibration model as robust and precise as possible using a data set with only a few reference values available and submitted to different perturbation factors. The committee received nine answers; this paper summarizes the best three approaches, as well as the approach proposed by the organisers. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
