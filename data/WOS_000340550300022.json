We propose the gCLSR, namely graph-Constrained Least Squares Regression, to super-resolve a high-resolution (HR) image from a single low-resolution (LR) observation. The basic idea of gCLSR is to learn a projection matrix mapping the LR image patch to the HR image patch space while preserving the intrinsic geometric structure of the original HR image patch manifold. Even if gCLSR resembles other manifold learning-based SR methods in preserving the local geometric structure of HR and LR image patch manifolds, the innovation of gCLSR lies in that it preserves the intrinsic geometric structure of the original HR image patch manifold rather than the LR image patch manifold, which may be contaminated by image degeneration (e.g., blurring, down-sampling and noise). Upon acquiring the projection matrix, the target HR image can be simply super-resolved from a single LR image without the need of HR-LR training pairs, which favors resource-limited applications. Experiments on images from the public database show that gCLSR method can achieve competitive quality as state-of-the-art methods, while gCLSR is much more efficient in computation than some state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient single image super-resolution via graph-constrained least squares regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300022"}
