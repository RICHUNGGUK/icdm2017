Several clinical outcomes can be determined using this information. However, direct measurement is difficult and risky, so that estimation methods are preferred. In the current paper a novel method is introduced which is a new basis for this estimation process. A one-dimensional arterial model is created using basic equations of fluid dynamics and a viscoelastic material model. In case of \"forward\" calculation the volumetric flow rate curve of the heart is set as a boundary condition. Pressure, velocity, wave propagation speed and deformation are calculated in the whole network. In case of \"backward\" calculation the pressure waveform is given at an arbitrary point of the network. With modification of the equations the calculation is turned backwards: knowing a pressure waveform at the downstream end of a vessel segment, the pressure waveform at the upstream end is calculated. The central aortic pressure waveform can be estimated within the 1D arterial model using this method. Details of the computation method and results of testing calculations are presented. The developed method is a powerful tool that might be used for central aortic pressure wave estimation in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
