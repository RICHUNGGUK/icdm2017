The orbit-following studies so far have been restricted either to time-independent approximation of the rotating modes, or to an axisymmetric magnetic field, which is an assumption severely compromised in ITER. In this paper we extend the previous work to accommodate time. dependent modes in non-axisymmetric magnetic fields. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
