The foreground and background regions may have different depth values in an image. First, we detect the foreground objects and the background by using a depth histogram. Then, the proposed method creates the virtual image by projecting each region with its computed projective matrix. Experimental results compared to previous research show that the proposed method provides realistic stereoscopic images.", "paper_title": "Automatic SfM-Based 2D-to-3D Conversion for Multi-Object Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738400019"}
