Knowledge generated during the software development process can be a valuable asset for a software company. But in order to take advantage of this knowledge, the company must store it for reuse. This can be achieved through the use of knowledge management tools integrated in CASE tools. This paper provides an overview of a system integrated in a CASE tool that manages and reuses software design knowledge. We describe how knowledge is stored and reused based on a Case-Based Reasoning approach. This tool aids the software designer in new ways: searching the design repository, suggesting designs, learning new knowledge from the user interaction, and other capabilities. We show the innovative aspects of our system.", "paper_title": "A tool for management and reuse of software design knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000241683600032"}
