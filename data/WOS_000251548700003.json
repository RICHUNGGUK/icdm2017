In order to determine the precision and speed of the method, it is compared with one of the most popular community identification approaches, namely Girvan and Newman's algorithm. Although the hierarchical growth method is not as precise as Girvan and Newman's method, it is potentially faster than most community finding algorithms.", "paper_title": "Fast community identification by hierarchical growth", "paper_id": "WOS:000251548700003"}
