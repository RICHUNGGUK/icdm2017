As a key component in Event-Driven Service-Oriented Architecture (EDSOA) for IOT services, this architecture organizes multiple pub/sub brokers into a Quorum-based peer-to-peer topology for efficient topic searching. It also leverages a topic searching algorithm and a one-hop caching strategy to minimize the search latency. Light-weight RESTful interfaces make the authors' GQPS more suitable for IOT services. Cost analysis and experimental study demonstrate that the GQPS achieves a significant performance gain in search satisfaction without compromising search cost. The authors apply the proposed GQPS in the District Heating Control and Information Service System in Beijing, China. This system validates the effectiveness of GQPS.", "paper_title": "A Low-Delay, Light-Weight Publish/Subscribe Architecture for Delay-Sensitive IOT Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000330770600005"}
