These algorithms enable probability intervals to be obtained for the states of a given query variable. The first algorithm is approximate and uses the hill-climbing technique in the Shenoy-Shafer architecture to propagate in join trees; the second is exact and is a modification of Rocha and Cozman's branch-and-bound algorithm, but applied to general directed acyclic graphs, (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
