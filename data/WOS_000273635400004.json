Increasingly, firms seek business rules management systems (BRMS) for assistance. Although studies have examined BRMS technical considerations, few have examined management considerations of deploying and managing BRMS projects. This study addresses this gap through examination and comparative analysis of BRMS deployments. Qualitative case study methods are employed and findings suggest a common deployment methodology and emergence of tightly structured services model. Participant's adoption drivers, consequences of deployment, IT alignment and transitions to IT service-orientations are provided. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
