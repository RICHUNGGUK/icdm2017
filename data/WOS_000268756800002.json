A Q-learning approach is used to maximize the expected utility of consumption. The first part of the paper presents conceptually the implementation of Q-learning in a discrete state-action space and illustrates the relation of the technique to the dynamic programming method for a simplified setting. In the second part of the paper, different generalization methods are explored and, compared to other implementations using neural networks, a combination with self-organizing maps (SOMs) is proposed. The resulting policy is compared to alternative strategies.", "paper_title": "A Q-Learning Approach to Derive Optimal Consumption and Investment Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000268756800002"}
