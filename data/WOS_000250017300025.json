The technique exploits the quadratic relationship between power and voltage to significantly increase the scan-shift speed while staying within the same power budget constraints. The technique is also orthogonal to techniques that lower power consumption by controlling the activity ratio or gating the clock.", "paper_title": "Energy-delay efficient test", "paper_id": "WOS:000250017300025"}
