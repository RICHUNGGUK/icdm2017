Unfortunately, the existing best effort IP network infrastructure, originally designed with little real-time QoS requirement, has started to suffer from performance degradation on emerging multimedia networking applications. This inadequacy problem is further deepened by the prevalence of last/first-mile wireless networking, such as Wi-Fi, mobile WiMAX, and many wireless sensors and ad-hoc networks. This can be evidenced by more and more fragmentation of application-driven IP-based networks, such as for power grid distribution, networked security surveillance, intelligent transportation communication, and many other sensor networks. To overcome the QoS challenges, the next generation wireless IP networks have to be architected in a top-down manner, i.e., application-driven layered protocol design. More specifically, based on the application media data, compression schemes are applied, the subsequent Network, MAC- and PHY-layered protocols need to be accordingly or jointly enhanced to reach the optimal performance. This is the fundamental concept behind the design of Wireless MediaNets. In this survey paper, I will address the QoS challenges specifically encountered in video over heterogeneous wireless broadband networks and address several application-driven Wireless MediaNet solutions based on effective cross-layer integration of APP and MAC/PHY layers. More specifically, the congestion control for achieving airtime fairness of video streaming to maximize the link adaptation performance of Wi-Fi, the minimum latency event-driven data exchange for distributed wireless ad-hoc sensor networks, and the opportunistic multicast of scalable video live streaming over mobile WiMAX.", "paper_title": "Wireless MediaNets: application-driven next-generation wireless IP networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291061300002"}
