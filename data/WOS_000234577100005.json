One is channel idle overhead, where all contending stations are waiting to transmit. Another is collision overhead, which occurs when multiple contending stations attempt to transmit simultaneously. Either idle overhead or collision overhead being large, contention resolution algorithm would be inefficient. Prior research work tries to minimize both the idle and the collision overheads using various methods. In this paper, we propose to apply \"pipelining\" techniques to the design of multiple access control protocol so that channel idle overhead could be ( partially) hidden and the collision overhead could be reduced. While the concept of pipelined scheduling can be applied to various MAC protocol designs in general, in this paper, we focus on its application to IEEE 802.11 DCF. In particular, an implicitly pipelined dual-stage contention resolution MAC protocol ( named DSCR) is proposed. With IEEE 802.11, the efficiency of contention resolution degrades dramatically with the increasing load due to high probability of collision. Using the implicit pipelining technique, DSCR hides the majority of channel idle time and reduces the collision probability, hence, improves channel utilization, average access delay, and access energy cost over 802.11 significantly both in wireless LANs and in multihop networks. The simulation results, as well as some analysis, are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of DSCR.", "paper_title": "A wireless MAC protocol using implicit pipelining", "paper_id": "WOS:000234577100005"}
