The concepts of D-logic pseudo-metric and D-logic metric space are also introduced and it is proved that there is no isolated point in the space. The new built D-randomized concepts are extensions of the corresponding concepts in quantified logic. Moreover, it is proved that the basic logic connectives are continuous operators in D-logic metric space. Lastly, three different types of approximate reasoning patterns are proposed.", "paper_title": "Randomization of classical inference patterns and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000251020500005"}
