In order to simulate large colloidal systems we have parallelized the Stokesian Dynamics method and combined it with DLVO theory. Through an efficient parallelization using the message passing system MPI we are able to reduce the computational costs of the problem from O(N-2) to O(Pn (2)(p,max)), where N is the number of particles in the system, P the number of used processes and n(p,max) = [N/P], respectively. This allows the simulation of large colloidal systems, as the computational time now not only depends on the number of particles, but also on the number of cores, through which the CPU time can be reduced dramatically.
