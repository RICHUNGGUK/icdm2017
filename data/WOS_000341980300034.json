We analyze the detection dynamics of some iterative detectors, namely soft-PIC, the Onsager-reaction-canceling parallel interference canceler (ORC-PIC) and the belief-propagation-based detector (BP-based detector), by the generating functional analysis (GFA). The GFA allows us to study the asymptotic behavior of the dynamics in the infinitely large system without assuming the independence of messages. We study the detection dynamics and the stationary estimates of an iterative algorithm. We also show the decoupling principle in iterative multiuser detection algorithms in the large-system limit. For a generic iterative multiuser detection algorithm with binary input, it is shown that the multiuser channel is equivalent to a bank of independent single-user additive non-Gaussian channels, whose signal-to-noise ratio degrades due to both the multiple-access interference and the Onsager reaction, at each stage of the algorithm. If an algorithm cancels the Onsager reaction, the equivalent single-user channels coincide with an additive white Gaussian noise channel. We also discuss ORC-PIC and the BP-based detector.", "paper_title": "Generating Functional Analysis for Iterative CDMA Multiuser Detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300034"}
