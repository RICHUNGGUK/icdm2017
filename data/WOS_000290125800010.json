In this letter, a least memory used algorithm is proposed by combining the source array and target array for comparing the sizes of disk and labeling the disks in the towers of Hanoi problem. As a result, the proposed algorithm reduces the space needed from 2n + 2 to n + 5, where n represents the disks number.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Algorithm for Solving the Towers of Hanoi Problem with the Least Storage Used", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125800010"}
