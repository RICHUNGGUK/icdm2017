Differing from previous results in the analysis and control design of interval systems, the new necessary and sufficient conditions proposed in this paper for the quadratic stability, quadratic stabilization and D-stabilization are based on parameter-dependent model representation of interval systems. In the quadratic framework, an approach based on a vertex result on interval uncertain parameters is proposed. This allows the solvability conditions to be presented in terms of a set of parameterized linear matrix inequalities which can be efficiently solved by using standard numerical softwares. A linearized longitudinal dynamic model of the flight control system of a supersonic cruise missile is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT LMI-BASED QUADRATIC STABILITY AND STABILIZATION OF PARAMETER-DEPENDENT INTERVAL SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300028"}
