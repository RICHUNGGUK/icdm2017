First, we calculate the normalized protrusion degree of each dual vertex on a smoothed 3-D mesh. The protrusion degree of a vertex and the vertex's 3-D coordinates form a 4-D feature vector, which we use to represent the polygon mesh. Then, we apply PCA to the set of 4-D feature vectors. The projected data along the first principal axis reveals the salient structures of the 3-D object. Therefore, by using the first component axis as the search basis, we can identify all the salient parts of an arbitrary 3-D object.", "paper_title": "Principal Component Analysis-based Mesh Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000268197700001"}
