Degradation reduction for a class of digital chaotic systems is investigated in this paper. A varying parameter control method is proposed based on the state feedback control technology at first. Then two chaotic maps are applied to verify its validity. Finally, a novel pseudorandom number generator is constructed, which can pass all the tests of NIST SP800-22 at both level-one and level-two approaches and also most of the tests of TestU01. Moreover, it performs better than some existing pseudorandom number generators. Thus, it has acceptable quality of randomness and can be used for cryptography and other applications.", "paper_title": "Feedback control of digital chaotic systems with application to pseudorandom number generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000350338800011"}
