The Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL), which is a Rule based ontology language, allows users to take advantage of inferencing of new knowledge from existing OWL knowledge base. In this paper, we describe a use case focused on building SWRL rule base on top of the tooth positional ontology represented in OWL so as to assist a dental decision-making on a missing tooth. Then, we discuss limitations of a current SWRL specification, through our experiences on converting dental knowledge into SWRL rules.", "paper_title": "Dental decision making on missing tooth represented in an ontology and rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800032"}
