Comparing with the normal bi-level orthogonal code by using Walsh code or Gold code, the proposed method can improve the bandwidth utilizations and reduce the optical beat noise. Simulation results show 31 ONUs, of which each data rate is 10 Gb/s and total rate is 310 Gb/s, can be transmitted 30 km. Three ONUs with each data at 622 Mb/s over 50-km single-mode fiber is experimentally demonstrated.", "paper_title": "An uplink data transmission method based on wavelet packet transform coding in passive optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348133600003"}
