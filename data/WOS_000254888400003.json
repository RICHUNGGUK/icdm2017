The algorithm is based on finite volume conservative discretisation method. It can deal with wet/dry and irregular beds. Second-order accuracy, in both time and space, is achieved using prediction and correction steps. A very simple and efficient flux limiting technique is used to equip the algorithm with total variation dimensioning property for shock capturing purposes. In order to make sure about the balance between the flux gradient and the bed slope, treatment of the source term has been done using a new procedure inspired mainly by the physical rather than mathematical consideration. SEA has been applied to one-dimensional problems, although it can equally be applied to multi-dimensional problems. In order to assess the capability of proposed algorithm in dealing with practical applications, several test cases have been examined.
