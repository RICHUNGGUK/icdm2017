Design/methodology/approach - First, the evacuation route planning system is described and the notations are defined. An inexact programming model is proposed. The goal of the model is to achieve optimal planning of vehicles allocation with a minimized system time under the condition of inexact information. The constraints of the model include four types: number of vehicles constraint, passengers balance constraints, maximum capacity of links constraints and no negative constraints. The model is solved through the decomposition of the inexact model A hypothetical case is developed to illustrate the proposed model. Findings - The paper finds that the interval solutions are feasible and stable for evacuation model in the given decision space, and this may reduce the negative effects of uncertainty, thereby improving evacuation managers' estimates under different conditions. Originality/value - This method entails incorporation of uncertainties existing as interval values into model formulation and solution procedure, and application of the developed model and the related solution algorithm in a hypothetical case study.", "paper_title": "An inexact optimization model for evacuation planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500004"}
