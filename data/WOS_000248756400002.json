The future multimedia communication applications have to support the user's needs, the terminal capabilities, the content specification and the underlying networking technologies. They should be network-aware, topology-aware, and end-user-centric. Thus, in this paper, we use the characteristics of the object-based encoding scheme and P2P network topology to propose adaptive content delivery architecture for P2P networks. We propose an efficient mechanism for transmission of real-time content over P2P networks, called POEMS (P2P Object-based adaptivE Multimedia Streaming). This object-based audio-visual quality adaptive mechanism over P2P networks is media-aware, network-aware, and user-centric that is carried-out through (1) selection of appropriate sending peers willing to participate in the streaming mechanism, (2) organization of sending peers by constructing an overlay network to facilitate content delivery and adaptation, (3) dynamicity management of peers when some peer enters or leaves the system to maintain an acceptable level of perceived video quality, and (4) ensuring the end-to-end QoS (Quality of Services) by orchestrating the overall streaming mechanism. The obtained results demonstrate that combining content adaptation using object-based encoding and advance network-aware peers selection based on peer monitoring leads to intelligent, efficient, and large-scale support of multimedia services over complex network architectures.", "paper_title": "P2P object-based adaptivE multimedia streaming (POEMS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000248756400002"}
