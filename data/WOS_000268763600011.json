We study the state complexity of Boolean operations and obtain lower bounds that are tight within an additive constant. The results for union and complementation differ from corresponding bounds for ordinary finite automata. For reversal and concatenation, we establish lower bounds that are of a different order than the worst-case bounds for ordinary finite automata. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
