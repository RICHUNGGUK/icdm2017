These equations are solved by an explicit finite difference time domain algorithm. To investigate the numerical stability of the proposed algorithm, the amplification matrix is extracted. The results of the proposed algorithm are confirmed by the results of the Agilent ADS commercial software. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
