Our error indicators are based on the defect of the collocation solution with respect to an associated exact difference scheme and backsolving using a cheap, low order finite-difference scheme. We prove high asymptotical correctness of this error indicator and illustrate the theoretical analysis by numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Error estimation based on locally weighted defect for boundary value problems in second order ordinary differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000346656400002"}
