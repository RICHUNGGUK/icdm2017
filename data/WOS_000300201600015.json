These frameworks include fuzzy states and events occurring simultaneously with different membership degrees. Fuzzy states and events have been used to describe uncertainties that occur often in practical problems, such as treatment planning for HIV/AIDS patients, sensory information processing for robotic control, and fault diagnosis problems. In order to measure information associated with FDESs or FDEDSs, the classical discrete event system (DES) observability has been turned into fuzzy observability for FDESs or FDEDSs. The newly proposed method allows ease of defining degrees of observability so that uncertainties in FDESs or FDEDSs can be dealt with effectively. This gives an opportunity to design better decision-making systems. To calculate the observability degree, a simple fuzzy observability checking method is introduced, and two examples are elaborated upon to illustrate the presented method. Finally, the newly proposed method is tested on a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
