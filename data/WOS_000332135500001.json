The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Due to the very small ratio of the dimensions of cables to the dimensions of the whole system, using actual geometry of the cables with all layers in this study causes deformation of the cable's model. Therefore, multi-dipole modeling is used for modeling the cables. Findings - This model includes specific voltages and currents in lines and nodes, respectively. Radiated electric and magnetic fields at a far distance are selected as the index of appropriateness of the model. Originality/value - In order to investigate the accuracy of the model, various configuration of the cable is studied. Additionally, coupling of the cable with an electrical machine is investigated. They all show that the equivalent models can be used in place of the actual model for signature studies.", "paper_title": "Multi-dipole modeling of XLPE cable for electromagnetic field studies in large power systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500001"}
