Even if in the last few years its usage has significantly increased, the remarkable involvement of the operator has until now represented a significant constraint for its growth. Having regard to the fact that this process, and in particular its first step (that is the acquisition phase), strongly depends on the operator's ability and expertise, this paper aims at proposing a strategy for automatically supporting an \"optimal\" acquisition phase. Moreover, the acquisition phase represents the only moment in which there is a direct contact between the virtual model and the physical model. For this reason, designing an \"optimal\" acquisition phase will provide as output an efficient set of morphological data, which will turn out to be extremely useful for the following reverse engineering passages (pre-processing, segmentation, fitting,...). This scenario drives the researcher to use a selective sampling plan, whose grid dimensions are correlated with the complexity of the local surface region analyzed, instead of a constant one. As a consequence, this work proposes a complete operative strategy which, starting from a first raw preliminary acquisition, will provide a new selective sampling plan during the acquisition phase, in order to allow a deeper and more efficient new scansion. The proposed solution does not require the creation of any intermediate model and relies exclusively on the analysis of the metrological performances of the 3D scanner device and of the morphological behaviour of the surface acquired.
