The proposed ADSSCG can provide an accurate programmable spreading ratio with process, voltage, and temperature variations. To maintain the frequency stability while performing triangular modulation, the fast-relocked mechanism is proposed. The proposed fast-relocked ADSSCG is implemented in a standard performance 90-nm CMOS process, and the active area is 200 mu m x 200 mu m. The experimental results show that the electromagnetic interference reduction is 14.61 dB with a 0.5% spreading ratio and 19.69 dB with a 2% spreading ratio at 270 MHz. The power consumption is 443 mu W at 270 MHz with a 1.0 V power supply.", "paper_title": "A Low-Cost Low-Power All-Digital Spread-Spectrum Clock Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000355212000020"}
