But still two problems related remain in need of better solutions. One problem is generating the meshes with desired size and pattern efficiently from easier user inputs. The other problem is improving the quality of synthesized results with mesh information. We present a new two-step texture design and synthesis method that addresses these two problems. Besides example texture, a small piece of mesh sketch drawn by hand or detected from example texture is input to our algorithm. And then a mesh synthesis method of geometry space is provided to avoid optimizations cell by cell. Distance and orientation features are introduced to improve the quality of mesh rasterization. Results show that with our method, users can design and synthesize textures from mesh sketches easily and interactively.", "paper_title": "Interactive texture design and synthesis from mesh sketches", "paper_id": "WOS:000334183200014"}
