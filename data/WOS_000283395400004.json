Parametric hull form modeling is used to generate the variant hull forms with some of the form parameters modified, which are evaluated in the optimization scheme based on evolutionary strategies. Rankine-source panel method and strip theories are used for the hydrodynamic evaluation. The methodology is implemented in the optimization of a double-chine, planing hull form. Furthermore, a dual-stage optimization strategy is applied on a modern fast displacement ferry. The effect of the selected optimization parameters is presented and discussed.
