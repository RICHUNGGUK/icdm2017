However, new applications demand better quality of service (QoS) and host mobility according to wireless and Internet technologies are more widely available. To satisfy QoS and mobility of communication, we deploy differentiated services (Diffserv) model to provide differentiated QoS in mobile IPv6 networks. The operational procedures and cost analyzing models are suggested for an MN (mobile node)'s mobility and its performance is presented by cost analysis.", "paper_title": "Cost evaluation of differentiated QoS model in mobile IPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100044"}
