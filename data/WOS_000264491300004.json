Based on neighborhood information, our method calculates the non-negative locally linear reconstruction coefficients from its neighbors for each data point, and the numbers of those dominant positive reconstruction coefficients are regarded as a faithful guide to the intrinsic dimensionality of data set. The proposed method requires no parametric assumption on data distribution and is easy to implement in the general framework of manifold learning. Experimental results on several synthesized data sets and real data sets have shown the benefits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "INTRINSIC DIMENSIONALITY ESTIMATION WITHIN NEIGHBORHOOD CONVEX HULL", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491300004"}
