Having a defined basin of attraction is highly desired, especially in robotic applications, as it provides tracking stability in addition to robustness against disturbances. The CPG model is composed of a set of phase-locked coordinated one-dimensional models; called xi-models. The idea behind the xi-model is generating any one-dimensional periodic signal by altering the behavior of an existing oscillator through two nonlinear maps. The mappings are designed in such a way that the Poincare-Bendixson theorem is satisfied and, consequently, the desired basin of attraction is shaped. The proposed CPG model is extensively tested for generating multidimensional signals; including DC, triangular, and smooth wavy ones. The results show that the CPG model has a low tracking error in addition to being robust against disturbances within the designed basin of attraction. Finally, the proposed CPG model is successfully employed to generate the dancing motion of a situated robotic marionette. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
