In this paper, we introduce a gridless-routing model that can obtain design-rule-correct paths and avoid redundant wires. Besides, we propose an enhanced model for the gridless-routing model to reduce the solution space and the runtime. Based on the enhanced gridless-routing model, we present the first multilevel full-chip gridless detailed router (called MGR). The router integrates global routing, detailed routing, and congestion estimation together at each level of multilevel routing. It can handle designs with nonuniform wire/via widths and spacings and consider routability and optical-proximity correction. Experimental results show that MGR achieves the best routing solutions in smaller running times than previous works, based on a set of commonly used benchmarks (with uniform and nonuniform wire widths) and a set of real industrial benchmarks (with a versatile set of design rules).", "paper_title": "Multilevel full-chip gridless routing with applications to optical-proximity correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000246863300004"}
