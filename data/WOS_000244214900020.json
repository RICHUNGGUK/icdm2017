We prove that if there is a balanced function in NP such that any circuit of size s(n) = 2(Omega(n)) fails to compute it on a 1/poly(n) fraction of inputs, then there is a function in NP such that any circuit of size s(n) fails to compute it on a 1/2 - 1/s'(n) fraction of inputs, with s'(n) = 2(Omega(n2/13)). This improves the result of Healy et al. (STOC'04), which only achievess s' (n) = 2(Omega(n1/2)) for the case with s(n) = 2(Omega(n)). (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
