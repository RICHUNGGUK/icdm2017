One is high time cost due to growing data and complex computation of compression algorithms. The other is low compression factor because of complex motions of dynamic scenes and unknown motion equations. In this paper, composite rigid body construction for fast and compact compression of 3D dynamic datasets is proposed to solve these two problems. It accelerates the compression with a fast rigid body decomposition based on disjoint union, and avoids serial searching, comparing and merging of the rigid body decomposition. To increase the compression factor, composite rigid body is introduced with consideration of motion consistency among rigid bodies at different time periods. The results of the experiments show that our algorithm compresses dynamic datasets quickly and achieves a high compression factor.", "paper_title": "Fast and compact dynamic data compression based on composite rigid body construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700012"}
