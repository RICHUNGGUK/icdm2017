However, most of researches concentrated on communication link fault tolerance but ignored sensing fault tolerance. Actors thus may take incorrect actions according to fault data items forwarded by multi-hops over WSANs. To address this issue, we proposed the sensing fault tolerance by quartile and outlier method (SFTQOM). SFTQOM could estimate the range of correct sensed data and eliminate the fault sensor nodes in advance. SFTQOM thus promoted the detected rate of correct data, R-d, and the detected accuracy of correct data, R-a. Simulation results indicated that SFTQOM increased more 40% of R-d and 30% of R-a higher than AFTM averagely. Moreover, R-d and R-a of SFTQOM increased gradually as the times of running fault tolerance increased.", "paper_title": "Sensing Fault Tolerance by Quartile and Outlier Method in Multi-Hops Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303174900006"}
