The spot market, however, inevitably involves price fluctuation risk and supply risk. Assuming that the manufacturer is the leader in a procurement game and offers a real-option contract to the supplier, we study the manufacturer's optimal mixed procurement strategy that integrates the use of the real-option contract and the spot market. Moreover, we analyze the effects of the price risk and the supply risk in the spot market on market equilibrium. We show that using the real-option contract mechanism improves the overall expected profit of a supply chain and guarantees supply chain coordination in the presence of the spot market. The results also demonstrate that the price risk and the supply risk in the spot market adversely affect the manufacturer's expected profit. On the contrary, these two risks bring benefits to the supplier. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
