We analyze algebraic gossip (i.e., random linear coding) and consider three gossip algorithms for information spreading: Pull, Push, and Exchange. The stopping time of algebraic gossip is known to be linear for the complete graph, but the question of determining a tight upper bound or lower bounds for general graphs is still open. We take a major step in solving this question, and prove that algebraic gossip on any graph of size n is O(n) where is the maximum degree of the graph. This leads to a tight bound of (n) for bounded degree graphs and an upper bound of O(n(2)) for general graphs. We show that the latter bound is tight by providing an example of a graph with a stopping time of (n2). Our proofs use a novel method that relies on Jackson's queuing theorem to analyze the stopping time of network coding; this technique is likely to become useful for future research.
