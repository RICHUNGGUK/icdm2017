But these methods are not applicable for situations in which some or all variables are restricted to lie within fuzzy lower and fuzzy upper bounds. In this paper, as a natural extension of the results in crisp linear programming and based on a certain linear ranking function we obtain some new results leading to a new method to overcome this shortcoming. To show the application of our method a real life problem is solved by using the proposed method. Also, one application of this approach in solving maximum flow problem with fuzzy capacity is dealt with.", "paper_title": "On solving bounded fuzzy variable linear program and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000343806200011"}
