This paper explores certain basic issues involved in inspection planning using case-based reasoning in an environment of a Generic CAPP Support System. Firstly, algorithmic methods for characterizing and extracting inspection features are proposed and discussed. A sequential knowledge based filtering method is developed to reduce the number of inspection features typically encountered in metrological inspection planning. Finally, a formalized approach for case representation of relevant inspection domain knowledge using a newly developed parametric-list technological feature graph (PLTFG) is presented.
