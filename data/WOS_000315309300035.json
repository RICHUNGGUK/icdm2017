In our approach, each candidate solution in the entire search space is allocated to a separate thread, rather than dividing the search space into parallel subsets. This strategy maximizes the usage of CPU parallel architecture and results in a significant speedup and robust solution quality. Computationally, pVS reduces the worst case complexity from sequential VS's O(p . n(2)) to O(p . (n - p)) on each thread by parallelizing computational tasks on GPO implementation. We tested the performance of pVS on two sets of numerous test cases (including 40 network instances from OR-lib) and compared the results against a CPU-based sequential VS implementation. Our results show that pVS achieved a speed gain ranging from 10 to 57 times over the traditional VS in all test network instances. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
