One way to significantly reduce energy consumption is applying transmission power control (TPC) techniques to dynamically adjust the transmission power. This article presents two new TPC techniques for WSNs. The experimental evaluation compares the performance of the TCP techniques with B-MAC, the standard MAC protocol of the Mica 2 platform. These experiments take into account different distances among nodes, concurrent transmissions and node mobility. The new transmission power control techniques decrease energy consumption by up to 57% over B-MAC while maintaining the reliability of the channel. Under a low mobility scenario, the proposed protocols delivered up to 95% of the packets, showing that such methods are able to cope with node movement. We also show that the contention caused by higher transmission levels might be lower than analytical models suggest, due to the action of the capture effect. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
