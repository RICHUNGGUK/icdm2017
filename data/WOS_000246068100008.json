However, it has a flaw in description ability for enterprises, which effects its decisionmaking ability in other fields. To solve more enterprise problems, GRAI method needs to be extended. In this paper an extended GRAI model for enterprise process diagnosis is presented. The diagnosis model includes an extended GRAI grid view and an extended GRAI net view used to aid the diagnosis of certain aspects of an enterprise, such as business process, organization, resource and information. A mapping mechanism among views and some rules of model maintenance are also put forward. Based on the model, a systematic diagnosis procedure and types of problems that can be diagnosed are introduced. Finally, an instance of enterprise process diagnosis is mentioned in detail.", "paper_title": "An extended GRAI model for enterprise process diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000246068100008"}
