Our analysis shows her protocol is still vulnerable to three kinds of attacks: 1). undetectable on-line dictionary attacks, 2). key-compromise impersonation attack. Thereafter we propose an enhanced protocol that can defeat the attacks described and yet is reasonably efficient.", "paper_title": "Enhancements of a Three-Party Password-Based Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000319788800002"}
