Making efficient use of video information requires that data to be accessed in a user-friendly way. Ideally, one would like to understand a video content, without having to watch it entirely. This has been the goal of a quickly evolving research area known as video summarization. In this paper, we present a novel approach for video summarization that works in the compressed domain and allows the progressive generation of a video summary. The proposed method relies on exploiting visual features extracted from the video stream and on using a simple and fast algorithm to summarize the video content. Experiments on a TRECVID 2007 dataset show that our approach presents high quality relative to the state-of-the-art solutions and in a computational time that makes it suitable for online usage.
