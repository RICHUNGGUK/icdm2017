In the paper, we present all efficient identity-based universal designated multi-verifiers signature (ID-UDMVS) scheme by extending a single verifier to a Set Of multi-verifiers for verification of a signature. To achieve our goal, we construct an ID-based signature scheme providing batch verification and then, using this scheme as a building block, we firstly propose an ID-UDMVS scheme with constant signature size. Interestingly our construction method can be used as a generic method transforming an ID-UDVS scheme, which is defined in a bilinear version of the so-called Sigma protocol, to an ID-UDMVS scheme.
