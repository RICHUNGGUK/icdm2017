Input rates of fluid flows in respective classes and the drain rate from the buffer are modulated by a continuous-time Markov chain with finite states. We derive the joint Laplace-Stieltjes transform for the stationary buffer contents in respective classes, assuming the FIFO service discipline. Further we develop a numerically feasible procedure to compute the joint and marginal moments of the stationary buffer contents in respective classes. Some numerical examples are then provided.", "paper_title": "Multiclass markovian fluid queues", "paper_id": "WOS:000248906200004"}
