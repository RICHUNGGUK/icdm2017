However, in order to increase the financial return on the investment, service operators need to make every effort in designing and deploying the most cost-effective networks using this technology. This paper presents a novel dimensioning technique for WiMAX technology which takes the dimensioning problem to a new level and produces more accurate results in comparison to traditional methods. Furthermore, a novel decomposed optimization framework for the WiMAX network planning is introduced which subdivides the overall problem into three distinct stages - a network dimensioning stage, initial sectorization and configuration stage and a final network configuration stage. The proposed framework also solves two fundamental problems, which are cell planning and frequency planning, simultaneously. Optimization is based on a tailored simulated annealing algorithm. Results, based on experiments in and around a UK city, show that the three stage framework produces viable designs with good coverage and service. In particular Stage 1 is efficient and more accurately dimensions the network than the traditional methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
