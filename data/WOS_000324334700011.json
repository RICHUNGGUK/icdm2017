This concept provides sufficient time to restructure the product family architecture for the inclusion of a new innovative product variant while fulfilling the market segments with the customer delight and an extended profitability. To implement the concept of sustainable mass customization we have proposed the notions of generic-bill-Of-products (GBOP: list of product variants agreed for the market segments), its interface with generic-supply-chain-structure and strategic decisions about opening or closing of a market segment as an optimization MILP (mixed integer linear program) model including logistics and GBOP constraints. Model is tested with the varying market segments demands, sales prices and production costs against 1 to 40 market segments. Simulation results provide us an optimum GBOP, its respective segments and decisions on the opening or closing of the market segments to sustain mass customization efforts.", "paper_title": "Integrated supply chain and product family architecture under highly customized demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000324334700011"}
