To deal with multi-team design, a framework consisting of four mapping constituents (i.e. design decomposition -> goal formulation -> preference modelling -> satisfaction aggregation) is suggested and elaborated together with the related solution strategy. In this framework, three cooperative team design models are proposed to characterize and account for typical schemes of cooperation in design computing. Related algorithms are also presented to facilitate executing these models. To validate the cooperative design models, an example of heat exchanger design is worked out illustratively. The results further show how different schemes of cooperation in multi-team design affect the final design solutions.", "paper_title": "Modelling for cooperative multi-team-based design optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000237806000002"}
