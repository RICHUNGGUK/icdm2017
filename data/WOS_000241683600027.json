Our approach relies on coupling a Bayesian network design with an association rule discovery technique. First, discovered association rule relevancy isenhanced by exploiting the expert knowledge encoded within a Bayesian network, i.e., avoiding to provide trivial rules w.r.t. known dependencies. Moreover, the Bayesian network can be updated thanks to an expert-driven annotation process on computed association rules. Our approach is experimentally validated on the Asia benchmark dataset.", "paper_title": "Iterative Bayesian network implementation by using annotated association rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000241683600027"}
