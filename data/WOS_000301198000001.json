However, it is well known that most of biological tissues have anisotropic conductivity values. In this study, four novel anisotropic conductivity reconstruction algorithms are proposed to reconstruct high resolution conductivity tensor images. Performances of these four algorithms and a previously proposed algorithm are evaluated in several aspects and compared.", "paper_title": "Image Reconstruction in Magnetic Resonance Conductivity Tensor Imaging (MRCTI)", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198000001"}
