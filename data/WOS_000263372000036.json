Some easy-to-test sufficient conditions are given to ensure the global exponential synchronization of uncertain network with delay and mixed coupling for all admissible uncertainties. The proposed linear matrix inequality results are computationally efficient as it can be solved numerically using standard commercial software. An illustrative example is given to show the usefulness of the result.
