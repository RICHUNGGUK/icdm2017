These structures correspond to a system of cables and triangular bar formations jointed at their ends by hinged connections to form a rigid framework. The optimized cabled-truss is determined through a discrete optimization procedure that uses nonlinear finite element analysis, genetic algorithm, and fuzzy logic. In this work, planar and spatial trusses and cabled-trusses are optimized to achieve minimum weight designs. Also, the structural performance of the optimized structures is compared. In summary, the results show that cabled-trusses feature improvements over trusses.", "paper_title": "Hybrid optimization of cabled-trusses: Benchmarks for mechanical engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000346978800039"}
