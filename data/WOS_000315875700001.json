Because the human target often moves with high nonlinearity, the proposed approach applies the unscented Kalman filter (UKF) technique. A novel sensor node selection scheme at each time step considering both the tracking accuracy and the energy cost is presented. Experimental results in a real human motion tracking system show that the proposed approach can perform better tracking accuracy compared to the most recent human motion tracking scheme in the real testbed implementation.", "paper_title": "A Novel Human Motion Tracking Approach Based on a Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000315875700001"}
