Several methods have been proposed in the literature in order to obtain fuzzy-efficient solutions to fuzzy multi-objective programming problems. In this paper we show that, in the case that one of our goals is fully achieved, a fuzzy-efficient solution may not be Pareto-optimal and therefore we propose a general procedure to obtain a non-dominated solution, which is also fuzzy-efficient. Two numerical examples illustrate our procedure. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
