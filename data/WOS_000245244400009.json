It is also known that properties occurring at arbitrarily high levels of the alternation hierarchy can be formalised using only two variables. This raises the question of whether the number of fixed-point variables in mu-formulae can be bounded in general. We answer this question negatively and prove that the variable-hierarchy of the mu-calculus is semantically strict. For any k, we provide examples of formulae with k variables that are not equivalent to any formula with fewer variables. In particular, this implies that Parikh's Game Logic is less expressive than the mu-calculus, thus resolving, an open issue raised by Parikh in 1983.", "paper_title": "The variable hierarchy of the mu-calculus is strict", "paper_id": "WOS:000245244400009"}
