Based on stability theory of impulsive dynamical systems, a simple but less-conservative criterion is derived for global synchronization of such coupled neural networks. Furthermore, the theoretical result is applied to a typical chaotic delayed Hopfied neural networks, and is also illustrated by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Global synchronization of impulsive coupled delayed neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000047"}
