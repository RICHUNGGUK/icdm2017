Structural summaries are derived directly from data and serve as the indexes for evaluating path expressions. We introduce D(k)-index, an adaptive structural summary, for general graph-structured data. Building on previous 1-index and A(k)-index, D(k)-index is also based on the concept of bisimilarity. However, as a generalization of 1-index and A(k)-index, D(k)-index possesses the adaptive ability to adjust its structure to changes in query load. It also enables efficient update algorithms, which are crucial to real applications but have not been adequately addressed in previous literatures. Our experiments show that D(k)-index is a more effective structural summary than previous static ones as a result of its query load sensitivity. In addition, the update operations on it can be performed more efficient than on its predecessors. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
