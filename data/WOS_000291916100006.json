Two iterative methods are considered: a simultaneous estimation method and a switching estimation method. The asymptotic properties of the GMM estimators of these methods are found to be the same as those of the Gaussian reduced-rank estimator. Through Monte Carlo simulation, the small-sample properties of the GMM estimators are studied and compared with those of the Gaussian reduced-rank estimator and the maximum likelihood estimator considered by other researchers. In the case of small samples, the GMM estimators are more robust to deviations from normality assumptions, particularly to outliers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
