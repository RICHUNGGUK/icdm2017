We focus on the classical Buss' theories S-2(i) and T-2(i) and prove that they are for all Sigma(i)(b) conservative over their inference rule counterparts, and there exists for all epsilon(b)(i) conservative over their parameter-free versions. A similar analysis of the Sigma(b)(i)-replacement scheme is also developed. The proof method is essentially the same for all the schemes we deal with and shows that these conservation results between schemes and inference rules do not depend on the specific combinatorial or arithmetical content of those schemes. We show that similar conservation results can be derived, in a very general setting, for every scheme enjoying some syntactical (or logical) properties common to both the induction and replacement schemes. Hence, previous conservation results for induction and replacement can be also obtained as corollaries of these more general results.", "paper_title": "Existentially Closed Models and Conservation Results in Bounded Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000262721500007"}
