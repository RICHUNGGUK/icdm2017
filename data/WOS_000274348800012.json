Display equipment of system adopts two high definition front-projectors and uses Image stitching for generating fine Image and wide-angle view, this reinforces the audiences' visual feel as if they were actually within the hemispherical display environment Due to posture of projectors and shape of screen critical influence Image accuracy on screen. we design and analyze posture of projector corresponding to original of system Base on confirmable projectors posture, we also take advantage of pre-warping correctional method to adjust image warping and alpha-mask method to reduce intensity of overlapping area Besides, we stitch wide-angle seamless content by mosaicked image taken by cameras in 3D VR To connect various correctional processes in 3D VR software, a real-time content will display on hemispherical screen", "paper_title": "Image Information Processing System for Hemispherical Screen With Dual 1080P High-Resolution Projectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000274348800012"}
