We first develop an adaptive spatio-temporal bilateral filter, which produces temporally-coherent and feature-preserving multi-scale representation for the time-varying surfaces. We then extract the geometric details from the time-varying surfaces, and enhance geometric details by exaggerating detail information at each scale across the time-varying surfaces.-Our approach can process mesh sequences with consistent connections or point sequences with unconstructed point set. In addition, as applications, based on the developed multi-scale surface representation and detail enhancement operators, we present geometric detail transfer, space-time morphing, and local regions detail enhancement for the time-varying surface.
