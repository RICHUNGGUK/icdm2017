It is proved the WAAF is a variable weight analog IIR filter. IIR filter weights vary with gate-source voltage control of a MOSFET transistor in triode region. The best balance point control of the WAAF is achieved using least mean square (LMS) algorithm. It is proved that analog LMS algorithm converges faster than digital LMS adaptive filter. The superiority of the proposed WAAF is observed in the designing process, computational cost, convergence speed and real time operation. Also, experimental results show ability of the proposed WAAF in the hybrid circuit of the telephone echo cancellation.", "paper_title": "The Wheatstone bridge-based analog adaptive filter with application in echo cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000279214200013"}
