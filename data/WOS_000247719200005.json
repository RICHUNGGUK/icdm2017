It provides a neurological tolerance for retinal defocus and the perception of blur. Hence, the DOF has been an important component in bioengineering models of the accommodative system, but with its model-based control function limited to the fovea. However, new studies have demonstrated the influence of the near retinal periphery on the DOF: with increased target extent, the DOF increases. Thus, the blur control derived from the combined fovea and near retinal periphery should be incorporated into future models of accommodation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
