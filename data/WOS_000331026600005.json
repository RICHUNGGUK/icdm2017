Objective: In this paper, we focus on learning dominant motion patterns in unstructured scene. Methods: As the invisible implicit indicator to scene structure, latent structural information is first defined and learned by clustering source/sink points using CURE algorithm. Considering the basic assumption that most pedestrians would find the similar paths to pass through an unstructured scene if their entry and exit areas are fixed, trajectories are then grouped based on the latent structural information. Finally, the motion patterns are learned for each group, which are characterized by a series of statistical temporal and spatial properties including length, duration and envelopes in polar coordinate space. Results: Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method, and the learned motion patterns can efficiently describe the statistical spatiotemporal models of the typical pedestrian behaviors in a real scene. Based on the learned motion patterns, abnormal or suspicious trajectories are detected. Conclusion: The performance of our approach shows high spatial accuracy and low computational cost.
