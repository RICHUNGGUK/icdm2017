A new method is presented to obtain a set of optimal wavelet packet basis by constructing the PAPR optimization model and the optimal PAPR of system can be obtain by modulating the signal with the optimal wavelet packet basis. Numerical and simulation results show the new algorithm obtains better bit error rate (BER) performance than the threshold method and the PAPR values of the WOFDM system with fixed wavelet packet tree space and fixed number of sub-channel can be optimized without any side information required.
