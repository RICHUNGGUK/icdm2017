Nevertheless, preprocessing methods and noise reduction strategies used to enhance the computational efficiency in text classification cannot be so efficient in e-mail filtering. This fact is demonstrated here where a comparative study of the use of stopword removal, stemming and different tokenising schemes is presented. The final goal is to preprocess the training e-mail corpora of several content-based techniques for spam filtering (machine approaches and case-based systems). Soundness conclusions are extracted from the experiments carried out where different scenarios are taken into consideration.", "paper_title": "Tokenising, stemming and stopword removal on anti-spam filtering domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100047"}
