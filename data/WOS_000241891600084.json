Solving this problem is significantly important to construct a robust classification system. Therefore, three algorithms for solving the generalized class cover problem are proposed, which are greedy algorithm, binary particle swarm optimization algorithm, and their hybrid algorithm. Comparison results of these three methods show that the hybrid algorithm can get better solutions in less runtime.", "paper_title": "A hybrid algorithm for solving generalized class cover problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600084"}
