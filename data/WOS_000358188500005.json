We show that the minimal degree of the former equals (up to a factor of 2) the minimal query complexity of the latter. We give optimal (up to constant factors) quantum algorithms with postselection for the Majority function, slightly improving upon an earlier algorithm of Aaronson. Finally we show how Newman's classic theorem about low-degree rational approximation of the absolute-value function follows from these algorithms.", "paper_title": "RATIONAL APPROXIMATIONS AND QUANTUM ALGORITHMS WITH POSTSELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188500005"}
