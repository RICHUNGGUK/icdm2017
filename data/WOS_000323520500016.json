However, current security model in RF4CE standard has potential weakness that transmission of initial key seeds is operated via unencrypted air interface. In this paper, we propose a secure key agreement protocol that uses pre-shared information between consumer devices and manufacturers and controllers receive the information by communication with manufacturers.", "paper_title": "A novel secure key paring protocol for RF4CE ubiquitous smart home systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323520500016"}
