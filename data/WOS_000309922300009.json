Iris is a part of human body that is desirable for biometric identification and has favorable factors. We have focused on the reality that iris is a fractal phenomenon in this paper. During the production of new fractals, some features will be extracted by Chaos Game mechanism. These features are useful and effective in iris identification. There are three steps for iris identification with fractal and Chaos Game Theory. The first step is making a new fractal. The second step includes extracting features during the first step. Finally, the iris identification based on extracted features is the third step. We have named this technique Iris Identification based-Fractal and Chaos Game Theory (Iris-IFCGT). This technique has some fractal properties like stability against zoom, removing part of the iris image, no sensitivity on rotation and so on as well as desirable speed which helps preventing time consuming process of pattern recognition.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS A FAST METHOD FOR IRIS IDENTIFICATION WITH FRACTAL AND CHAOS GAME THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300009"}
