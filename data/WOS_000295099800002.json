This is largely due to the intricacy of the analog behavioral intent which cannot be captured purely in terms of logic. In this paper, we show that by using auxiliary forms of formal specifications such as abstract state machines and real-valued functions, called auxiliary functions, as references for AMS assertions, it becomes possible to model complex AMS behavioral properties. In addition, we present complexity results for the satisfiability problem of such specifications. This approach leverages the growing adoption of AMS behavioral modeling in the industry. This paper also shows that the use of auxiliary state machines allows us to separate out the scope of different analog assertions leading to significant performance gains in the assertion checking overhead.", "paper_title": "Auxiliary Specifications for Context-Sensitive Monitoring of AMS Assertions", "paper_id": "WOS:000295099800002"}
