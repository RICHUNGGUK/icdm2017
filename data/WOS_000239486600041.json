Our algorithm first decomposes the bounding volume of the cover model into voxels based on a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) tree. The voxels are then further categorized into eight subspaces, each of which is numbered and represented as three-digit binary characters. In the embedding process, we first traverse the BSP tree, locating a leaf voxel; then we embed every three bits of the payload message into the vertex inside the leaf voxel. This is realized by translating a vertex's current position to the corresponding numbered subspace. This technique is a substitutive blind extraction scheme, where messages embedded can be extracted without the aid of the original cover model. This technique achieves high data capacity, equivalent to at least three times the number of the embedded vertices in the cover model. In addition, the stego model has insignificant visual distortion. Finally, this scheme is robust against similarity transformation attacks.", "paper_title": "Steganography on 3D models using a spatial subdivision technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600041"}
