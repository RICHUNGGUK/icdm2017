Most mechanical structures are complex and are essentially multicriteria optimization problems with objective functions retained as constraints. The weight of each factor can be defined according to the effects of and the priorities among objective functions, and a single Pareto-optimal solution exists for the criteria-defined constraints. In this paper, a multicriteria optimization design based on the Pareto-optimal sensitivity is applied to the noise, vibration, and harshness qualities of automotive bodies.", "paper_title": "Design of automotive body structure using multicriteria optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613500008"}
