He claimed that the protocol was secure against guessing, stolen-verifier, replay, denial-of-service, and impersonation attacks. However, we show that the protocol is vulnerable to impersonation, guessing, and stolen-verifier attacks. We propose improvements to increase the security level of the protocol.", "paper_title": "Weaknesses and Improvement of Secure Hash-Based Strong-Password Authentication Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000282396700018"}
