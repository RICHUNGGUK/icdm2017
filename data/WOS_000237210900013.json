The main idea of the anticipation is based on the acquisition of knowledge of events happened in the environment of the past, later to compare them with the actions that appear in the present, in a time specify. The events of the past to like learning and make the calculus and the interpolating with the actions that happen in the present, this way to be able to make all the calculations necessary to be able to anticipate the possible changes in the environment [Hoffmann, J (1993)].", "paper_title": "Anticipative emergence in environment virtual", "paper_id": "WOS:000237210900013"}
