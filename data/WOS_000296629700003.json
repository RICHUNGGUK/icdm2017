All the previous works dealt with the minimization of number of product terms only in the two sum-of-product-expressions representing a Boolean function during AND-OR-XOR network synthesis. To the best of knowledge this is the first ever effort to incorporate total power, that is, dynamic and leakage power along with the area (in terms of number of product terms) during three-level AND-OR-XOR networks synthesis. The synthesis process, without changing the delay performance results in lesser number of product terms compared to those reported in the literature. It also enumerates the trade-offs present in the solution space for different weights associated with area, dynamic power, and leakage power of the resulting circuit.", "paper_title": "AND-OR-XOR NETWORK SYNTHESIS WITH AREA-POWER TRADE-OFF", "paper_id": "WOS:000296629700003"}
