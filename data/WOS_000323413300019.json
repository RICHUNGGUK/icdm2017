In terms of linear matrix inequalities approach, some new delay-dependent stability criteria are established for the considered systems by constructing a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. And our derived results shown by three illustrative examples are more effective than some existing ones.", "paper_title": "Further results on delay-dependent exponential stability for uncertain stochastic neural networks with mixed delays and Markovian jump parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000323413300019"}
