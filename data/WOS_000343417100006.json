We show how to construct identity-based key encapsulation mechanism (IB-KEM) from IB-EHPS in a simple and modular fashion. Our construction provides a generic method of building and interpreting CCA-secure IB-KEMs based on computational assumptions. As instantiations, we realize IB-EHPS from the bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption and the modified bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption, respectively. Besides, we carefully investigate the relation between EHPS and IB-EHPS, and indicate possible refinement and generalization of EHPS.", "paper_title": "CCA-Secure IB-KEM from Identity-Based Extractable Hash Proof System", "paper_id": "WOS:000343417100006"}
