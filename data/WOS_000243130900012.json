The existing reachability algorithm is based on the exploitation of topological properties of the plane which are used to accelerate certain kind of cycles. The complexity of the algorithm makes the analysis of large systems generally unfeasible. In this paper we present a compositional parallel algorithm for reachability analysis of SPDIs. The parallelization is based on the qualitative information obtained from the phase portrait of an SPDI, in particular the controllability kernel.", "paper_title": "A compositional algorithm for parallel model checking of polygonal hybrid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243130900012"}
