We discuss several candidates that suggest themselves as generalizations P of P for multi-path interferometers, and treat the case of three paths in considerable detail. To each choice for the path knowledge P, the interference strength V - the corresponding generalization of V - is found by a natural, operational procedure. In experimental terms, it amounts to finding those equal-weight superpositions of the path amplitudes which maximize P for the emerging intensities. Mathematically speaking, one needs to identify a certain optimum one among the Fourier transforms of the state of the interfering quantum object. Wave-particle duality is manifest, inasmuch as P = 1 implies V = 0 and V = 1 implies P = 0, whatever definition is chosen. The possible values of the pair (P, V) are restricted to an area with corners at (P, V) = (0, 0), (P, V) = (1, 0), and (P, V) = (0, 1), with the shape of the border line from (1, 0) to (0, 1), depending on the particular choice for P and the induced definition of V.", "paper_title": "Wave-particle duality in multi-path interferometers: General concepts and three-path interferometers", "paper_id": "WOS:000255525000002"}
