First, inclusion degree is introduced in an extension of the interior and closure operators in crisp topology. This idea is then introduced in fuzzy topology by incorporating a relaxed version of fuzzy subsethood. The introduction of inclusion degree leads to a means of dealing with imperfections and small errors, especially in cases such as digital images where boundaries of subsets of an image are not crisp. The properties of the new operators are presented. Applications of the proposed operators are given in terms of rough sets and mathematical morphology.", "paper_title": "Crisp and Fuzzy Topological Interior and Closure Operators with Inclusion Degree.
