The proposed techniques have been successfully evaluated on artificial and real data sets. The new methods outperform the best individual kernel under consideration and they can be used as an alternative to the parameter selection problem in Gaussian kernel methods.", "paper_title": "Fusion of Gaussian kernels within support vector classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400098"}
