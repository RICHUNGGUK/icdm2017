However, it only uses labeled samples while neglecting unlabeled samples, which are abundant and can be easily obtained in the real world. In this paper, we propose a new dimension reduction method, called \"SL-LDA\", by using unlabeled samples to enhance the performance of LDA. The new method first propagates label information from the labeled set to the unlabeled set via a label propagation process, where the predicted labels of unlabeled samples, called \"soft labels\", can be obtained. It then incorporates the soft labels into the construction of scatter matrixes to find a transformed matrix for dimension reduction. In this way, the proposed method can preserve more discriminative information, which is preferable when solving the classification problem. We further propose an efficient approach for solving SL-LDA under a least squares framework, and a flexible method of SL-LDA (FSL-LDA) to better cope with datasets sampled from a nonlinear manifold. Extensive simulations are carried out on several datasets, and the results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
