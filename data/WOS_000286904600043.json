This study combines the concepts of factor analysis, analytic hierarchy process (AHP), genetic algorithm (GA), and fuzzy integral to construct an entry mode selection approach. This study produces several interesting findings. (1) In the different investment entry modes, there are large differences in evaluation focus when investors select their entry modes. (2) For example, Taiwanese bio-tech firms entering mainland China consider merger and acquisitions to be the first priority, and followed by strategic alliances. This research shows that if the stock share holding is unlimited, Taiwanese bio-tech firms prefer to select a high stock share holding investing mode. (3) In various investment modes, the aspects of \"Capital and Risk\" and \"Technology Ability\" have the most consistent effect on entry mode selection. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
