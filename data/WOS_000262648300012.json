In order to optimally meet the ever-increasing design requirements and at the same time leverage design productivity, higher level aspects need to be addressed before worrying about the HW/SW boundary. This paper deals with high-level aspects of system-level modeling and provides modeling extension, from which contemporary related methodologies can greatly benefit. High-level aspects, their influence on the entire design. flow, and systematic integration into the codesign environment are presented. An approach is proposed with a higher level of abstraction that helps bridge the gap between informal and formal system specifications. Higher level design decisions are enabled, avoiding premature ad hoc design decisions. Applicability of the proposed high-level codesign concepts is illustrated with a case study.", "paper_title": "A METHODOLOGY FOR SUPPORTING SYSTEM-LEVEL DESIGN SPACE EXPLORATION AT HIGHER LEVELS OF ABSTRACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648300012"}
