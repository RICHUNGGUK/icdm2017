The proposed power regulation method is employed to regulate the power intensity transmitted by magnetic flux transmitter, based on distance change and angle misalignment between transmitter and receiver. Therefore, not only the power transmitted by magnetic flux transmitter is adjustable, but also consistent power received by locomotive devices can be achieved. Firstly, by Faraday's law and Kirchhoff's circuit law, the dynamic equation for proposed wireless power transmission is constructed. The distance change and angle misalignment between transmitter and receiver are also considered to reflect the influence on power received by micro-devices. In order to ensure that the power received by receiver is consistent at various locations along an ellipse trajectory, the sliding mode controller is synthesized to regulate the power transmitted by the magnetic energy source. In addition, the sliding mode estimator is also employed so that not only the system states can be estimated, but also the cost for sensors and the physical size of secondary side can be much reduced. By intensive simulation, no matter which distance and misalignment angle between transmitter and receiver is present, stable and consistent power at receiver can be achieved. Finally, the test rig for wireless micro-power transmission is constructed for performance verification. The experimental result shows that the constant power at receiver can be obtained if the SMC controller is applied to regulate the output power by transmitter. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
