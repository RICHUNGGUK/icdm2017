In these methods, feature selection plays an important role to achieve a superior performance. Actions are represented by local spatio-temporal features extracted from action videos. Action representations are then classified by applying a classifier (such as k-nearest neighbor or SVM). In this paper, we have proposed two feature weighting methods to better discriminate similar actions. We have proposed a definition of feature discrimination power to be used in the feature selection process. Our proposed weighting schemes have greatly improved the final categorization accuracy on the well-known KTH and Weizmann datasets.", "paper_title": "Human action categorization using discriminative local spatio-temporal feature weighting", "paper_id": "WOS:000306651300002"}
