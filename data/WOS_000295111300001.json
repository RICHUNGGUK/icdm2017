While this problem has been addressed with greedy approaches, these usually converge to sub-optimal solutions. In this work, we describe an approach to perform complete search over the search space. We formulate the problem as a matter of finding the minimal set of patterns contained in a sequence, where patterns can be interleaved but do not have repeating symbols. This represents a new problem that has not been previously addressed in the literature, with NP-hard variants and conjectured NP-completeness. We solve it in a stepwise manner, by generating and verifying a list of candidate solutions. The techniques, introduced to address various subtasks, can be applied independently for solving more specific problems. The approach has been implemented and applied in a case study with real data from a business process supported in a software application. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
