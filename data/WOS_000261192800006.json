Participants describe 10 second clips of songs and score points when their descriptions match those of other participants. The rules were designed to encourage players to be thorough and the clip length was chosen to make judgments objective and specific. To analyse the data, we measured the degree to which binary classifiers could be trained to spot popular tags. We also compared the performance of clip classifiers trained with MajorMiner's tag data to those trained with social tag data from a popular website. On the top 25 tags from each source, MajorMiner's tags were classified correctly 67.2% of the time, while the social tags were classified correctly 62.6% of the time.", "paper_title": "A Web-Based Game for Collecting Music Metadata", "paper_id": "WOS:000261192800006"}
