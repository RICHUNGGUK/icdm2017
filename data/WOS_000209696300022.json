The plurality of orthogonal sets is generated using any single two-level autocorrelation sequence of period one less than the desired spreading factor of the orthogonal codes. The proposed method hence generates orthogonal codes of all spreading factors for which a corresponding two-level autocorrelation sequence exists. The resulting orthogonal sets with wide choice of spreading factors is desirable in synchronous direct sequence spread spectrum systems. The sets can be generated such that they do not contain the codeword with single polarity as in the case of Walsh-Hadamard codes and orthogonal sets generated from cyclic shifts of two-level autocorrelation sequences. This renders all codes in the generated sets with an effective spreading gain. The generation method also encompasses a procedure to generate N - 1 sets with low interset correlation for application to oversaturated spread spectrum systems.", "paper_title": "Method of Generating Multiple Sets of Orthogonal Codes with Wide Choice of Spreading Factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300022"}
