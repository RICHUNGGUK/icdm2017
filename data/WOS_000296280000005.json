In order to generalize the evaluation task in VE, especially for physical fatigue evaluation, we integrated a new fatigue model into a virtual environment platform. Virtual Human Status is proposed in this paper in order to assess the difficulty of manual handling operations, especially from the physical perspective. The decrease of the physical capacity before and after an operation is used as an index to indicate the difficulty level. The reduction of physical strength is simulated in a theoretical approach on the basis of a fatigue model in which fatigue resistances of different muscle groups were regressed from 24 existing maximum endurance time models. A framework based on digital human modeling technique is established to realize the comparison of physical status. An assembly case in airplane assembly is simulated and analyzed under the framework in VRHIT experiment platform. The endurance time and the decrease of the joint moment strengths are simulated. The experimental result in simulated operations under laboratory conditions confirms the feasibility of the theoretical approach: integration of virtual human simulation into virtual reality for physical fatigue evaluation.", "paper_title": "Fatigue evaluation in maintenance and assembly operations by digital human simulation in virtual environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000296280000005"}
