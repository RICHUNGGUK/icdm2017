The fused image is more suitable for image processing. The novel pixel level image fusion schemes are presented based on multi-scale decomposition. The wavelet coefficients of image axe chosen according to the image fusion operators and different fusion rules. Experiments of multi-spectral image and high-resolution panchromatic images are given. It shows that the wavelet-based human visual system method can achieve better fusion performance than others.", "paper_title": "Wavelet-based weighted average and human vision system image fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000236891300006"}
