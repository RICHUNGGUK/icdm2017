Second, both a random walk analysis and a computation of a time correlation function involving the Fourier amplitudes of the interface height can be utilized to derive the mobility of grain boundaries and crystal-melt interfaces Finally, the probability distribution of premelted grain boundary widths as a function of undercooling can be used to obtain the so-called disjoining potential, which is the thermodynamic driving force responsible for premelting.
