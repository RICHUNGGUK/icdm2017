In this study of its adoption, three competing attribute-sets are compared. This study aims to reveal the attribute-set best predicting its adoption. The research model was empirically tested and validated using SPSS. Four attributes from the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory, four from the PCI theory, and four from Tornatzky and Klein's meta-analysis significantly affected behavioral intentions. Only complexity failed to influence use intentions, and behavioral intention and riskiness significantly impacted adoption.", "paper_title": "Empirical Examination of the Role of Three Sets of Innovation Attributes for Determining Adoption of IRCTC Mobile Ticketing Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000353144800006"}
