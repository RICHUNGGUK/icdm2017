First, an experimental study on a given structural property of connectedness of the efficient set is conducted. Based on this property, a local search algorithm is proposed and its performance is compared to exact algorithms in terms of runtime and quality metrics. The experimental results indicate that this simple local search algorithm is able to find a representative set of optimal solutions in most of the cases, and in much less time than exact algorithms.", "paper_title": "On Local Search for Bi-objective Knapsack Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000316061600007"}
