In this paper, we present an intelligent framework for detection of multiple events in surveillance videos. Based on the principle of compositionality, we modularize the surveillance problems into a set of variables comprising regions-of-interest, classes (i.e. human, vehicle), attributes (i.e. speed, locality) and a set of notions (i.e. rules) associated to each of the attributes to construct a knowledge-based understanding of the environment. The final output from the reasoning process, which combines the definition domains of the various variables, allows a broader and integrated understanding of complex pattern of activities in the scene. This is in contrast to the state-of-the-art solutions that are only able to perform only a singular task, at a time. Experimental results on both the public and real-time datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in detecting multiple events in surveillance videos.
