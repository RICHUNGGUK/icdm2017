The root of these concepts can be traced to the works ([24] and [36]) by Rancho and Klein in 19851987, where the forcing number was introduced under the name of \"innate degree of freedom\" of a Kekule structure, which plays an important role in the resonance theory in chemistry. Over the past two decades, more and more mathematicians were attracted to the study on forcing sets (including forcing edges and forcing faces, etc.) and the forcing numbers of perfect matchings of a graph. The scope of graphs in consideration has been extended from polyhexes to various bipartite graphs and non-bipartite graphs. Some varied topics such as global forcing matchings and anti-forcing matchings also emerged recently. Here we will present a brief survey on the known results, as well as some open problems and conjectures in this growing field.", "paper_title": "Forcing on Perfect Matchings - A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000292855700004"}
