A novel architecture to solve vague queries that allows users to find objects and scenes in virtual environments is described. As a base, a new virtual worlds representation model and an associated fuzzy querying approach are used. The, new representation model adds a semantic level to the usual models, providing more suitable environments for the interaction with users. The query solver is able to work with queries expressing the vagueness inherent to human conceptualization of visual perception (for example, tall tree, a park with many tall trees, or a park bench near approximately five tall trees). The system has been developed and evaluated with user experiments, where comparison with navigation and keyword-based query approaches have been realized. The results of this study show that the proposed architecture is more powerful and intuitive for finding the targets.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy approach to the intelligent management of virtual spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000238069200002"}
