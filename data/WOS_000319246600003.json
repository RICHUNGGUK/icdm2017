In more recent years, trilattices have been used to introduce a number of many-valued systems that generalize the Belnap-Dunn logic of first-degree entailment, proposed as logics of how several computers connected together in a network should think in order to deal with incomplete and possibly contradictory information. The aim of the present work is to develop a first purely algebraic study of trilattices, focusing in particular on the problem of representing certain subclasses of trilattices as special products of bilattices. This approach allows to extend the known representation results for interlaced bilattices to the setting of trilattices and to reduce many algebraic problems concerning these new structures to the better-known framework of lattice theory.
