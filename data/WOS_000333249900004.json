Based on mass sequencing data, we proposed a nucleosome center score (NCS) for quantifying nucleosome stability by measuring shifts of the nucleosome center, and then mapping NCS scores to nucleosome positions in Brogaard et al.' s study. Results: We demonstrated the efficiency of NCS by known preference of A/T-based tracts for nucleosome formation, and showed that central nucleosomal DNA is more sensitive to A/T-based tracts than outer regions, which corresponds to the central histone tetramer-dominated region. We also found significant flanking preference around nucleosomal DNA for A/T-based dinucleotides, suggesting that neighboring sequences could affect nucleosome stability. Finally, the difference between results of NCS and Brogaard et al.'s scores was addressed and discussed.
