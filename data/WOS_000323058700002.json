Special cases are processes with stationary or stationary and independent increments. In the L,vy process case, the decomposition holds not only in the limit but also at independent exponential times, due to the Wiener-Hopf decomposition. A similar statement holds regarding the GI/GI/1 setting with multiple vacations.", "paper_title": "Another look into decomposition results", "paper_id": "WOS:000323058700002"}
