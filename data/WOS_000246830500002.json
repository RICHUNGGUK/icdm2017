This paper analyzes both code portability and performance portability of parallel programs for fine-grained multi-threaded execution and architecture models. We concentrate on one particular event-driven fine-grained multi-threaded execution model-EARTH, and discuss several design considerations of the EARTH model and runtime system that contribute to the performance portability of parallel applications. We believe that these are important issues for future high end computing system software design. Four representative benchmarks were conducted on several different parallel architectures, including two clusters listed in the 23rd supercomputer TOP500 list. The results demonstrate that EARTH based programs can achieve robust performance portability across the selected hardware platforms without any code modification or tuning", "paper_title": "Performance portability on EARTH: a case study across several parallel architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000246830500002"}
