This yields the crucial question of determining wether such an augmentation is possible for all graphs. In this paper, we answer negatively to this question by exhibiting a threshold on the doubling dimension, above which an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable whatever the distribution of random edges is. Precisely, it was known that graphs of doubling dimension at most 0(loglogn) are navigable. We show that for doubling dimension >> log log n, an infinite family of graphs cannot be augmented to become navigable. Finally, we complete our result by studying the special case of square meshes, that we prove to always be augmentable to become navigable.", "paper_title": "A doubling dimension threshold Theta (log log n) for augmented graph navigability", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200033"}
