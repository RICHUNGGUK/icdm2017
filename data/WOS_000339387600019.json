The mixed delays consist of discrete and distributed time-varying delays. At first, based on a Halanay-type inequality for stochastic differential equations, by virtue of drive-response concept and time-delay feedback control techniques, a delay-dependent sufficient condition is proposed to guarantee the exponential synchronization of two identical Markovian jumping chaotic-delayed neural networks with stochastic perturbation. Then, by utilizing the Jensen integral inequality and a novel Lemma, another delay-dependent criterion is established to achieve the globally stochastic robust synchronization. With some parameters being fixed in advance, these conditions can be solved numerically by employing the Matlab software. Finally, a numerical example with their simulations is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the presented synchronization scheme.", "paper_title": "Exponential synchronization of stochastic chaotic neural networks with mixed time delays and Markovian switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387600019"}
