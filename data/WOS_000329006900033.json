Since the optimal architecture is different from application to application, finding the most suitable accelerator is very important. In this paper, we propose an FPGA-based heterogeneous multicore platform with custom accelerators for power-efficient computing. Using the proposed platform, we evaluate several applications and accelerators to identify many key requirements of the applications and properties of the accelerators. Such an evaluation is very important to select and optimize the most suitable accelerator according to the requirements of an application to achieve the best performance.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of an FPGA-Based Heterogeneous Multicore Platform with SIMD/MIMD Custom Accelerators", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900033"}
