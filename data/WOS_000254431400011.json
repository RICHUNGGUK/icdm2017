The aim of this paper is to report an integrated circuit (IC) that was designed as part of an implantable telemetry device to monitor the ETI. The proposed system performs various types of measurements, such as impedance spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and galvanostatic double pulse method. Hence, the evolution of various electrochemical parameters of the ETI such as complex impedance, faradic resistance, double layer capacity, rheobase current, and chronaxy time, could be monitored long time after implantation. Deviation from nominal impedance for example could indicate electrodes faults as well as nerve conduction changes. The full custom IC has been designed and fabricated with the CMOS 0.18 mu m technology. The circuit occupies a silicon area of 2 mm(2), and consumes less than 3 mW during measurements. Characterisation and in-vivo experimental results validate the full functionalities of the implantable monitoring system including the custom IC.", "paper_title": "Wireless monitoring of electrode-tissues interfaces for long term characterization", "paper_id": "WOS:000254431400011"}
