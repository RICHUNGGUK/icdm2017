In this paper, we present a robust node-disjoint multipath routing (RNMR) protocol for WSNs. The protocol first constructs a multi-routing tree which has a number of node-joint but link-disjoint subtrees, and then finds multiple paths along these subtrees. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the structural characteristics inherent in the multi-routing tree, we present a customised redundancy scheme to improve the reliability of data transmission. The scheme provides individualised data redundancy for each sensor node. The protocol does not need to employ any control beacons in the data routing phase. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that our protocol achieves higher reliability, reduces end-to-end delay and improves energy efficiency compared with existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Robust node-disjoint multipath routing for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000335648100004"}
