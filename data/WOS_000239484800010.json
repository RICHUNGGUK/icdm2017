Recently, [N.U. Ahmed, Bo Li, Luis Orozco-Barbosa, Modelling and optimization of computer network traffic controllers, Mathematical Problems in Engineering, 2005, 6(2005), 617-640] an optimization technique, based on dynamic programming and genetic algorithm, has been developed which improves network utilization or throughput by reducing data losses and service time, etc. This, however, requires long execution time and excessive memory space thereby imposing limitation on its applicability to high dimensional problems. In this study we have conserved both space and time complexity. This is achieved by introducing multiple processors and the Reduced Memory Algorithm thereby opening up the prospects of solving large-scale problems. Our parallel processing algorithm is tested with MPEG-4 traces. Our numerical results show that the algorithm can effectively solve the multiple Token Bucket problems. The results also provide us with the guidelines to configure the parallel processing platform. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
