In order prove our result we establish a close relationship between the PICG and a graph layout problem the proper colored layout problem (PCLP). We show a dichotomy: the PICG and the PCLP are NP-complete for colored caterpillars of hair length >= 2, while both problems are in P for colored caterpillars of hair length <2. For the hardness results we provide a reduction from the multiprocessor scheduling problem, while the polynomial time results follow from a characterization in terms of forbidden subgraphs.", "paper_title": "ON THE PROPER INTERVALIZATION OF COLORED CATERPILLAR TREES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271470900001"}
