Most of currently available business process engineering and mining techniques either focus on machine learning techniques to mine, discover and model any possible Business Processes from raw data, or use semantically-enabled process models and service descriptions to construct and represent complex Business Processes. However, in real-life scenario, all the required services are not always available and hence exact matching of the services in order to construct Business Process is not possible. In this paper, we present our approach of using fuzzy Web Service discovery to construct and represent Business Processes. It helps in relaxing the matching criteria of Web Services, and allows service consumers to specify business requirements in a more fuzzy way, and hence increases the possibility of finding required Web Services that could construct Business Processes. The paper presents the proposed solution then reports and discusses the evaluation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
