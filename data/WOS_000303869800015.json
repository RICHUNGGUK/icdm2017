This paper introduces a semantic video adaptation system that incorporates the media adaptation process in the center of the drama production process. Producers, directors and other creative staff instruct the semantic adaptation system using common cinematographic terminology and vocabulary, thereby seamlessly extending the drama production process into the realm of content adaptation. The multitude of production metadata obtained from various steps in the production process provides a valuable context of narrative semantics that is exploited by the adaptation process. As such, high definition imagery can be intelligently adapted to smaller resolutions while optimally fulfilling the filmmaker's dramatic intentions with respect to the original narrative and obeying various rules of cinematographic grammar.", "paper_title": "Semantic Mastering: content adaptation in the creative drama production workflow", "paper_id": "WOS:000303869800015"}
