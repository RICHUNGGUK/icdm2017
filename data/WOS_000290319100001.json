We proved that if F is a 1-fold obstinate filter, then A/F is a Boolean algebra. Several characterizations of n-fold fantastic filters are given, and we show that A is a n-fold fantastic BL-algebra if A is a MV-algebra (n >= 1) and A is a 1-fold positive implicative BL-algebra if A is a Boolean algebra. Finally, we construct some algorithms for studying the structure of the finite BL-algebras and n-fold filters in finite BL-algebras.", "paper_title": "n-Fold obstinate filters in BL-algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000290319100001"}
