At each step two random edges are presented, and if the first edge would join two isolated vertices, it is added to a graph; otherwise the second edge is added. We present several new results on the phase transition of the Bohman-Frieze process. We show that it has a qualitatively similar phase transition to the Erds-Renyi process in terms of the size and structure of the components near the critical point. We prove that all components at time t(c) - E (that is, when the number of edges are (t(c) - E)n/2) are trees or unicyclic components and that the largest component is of size (E(-2)log n). Further, at t(c) + E, all components apart from the giant component are trees or unicyclic and the size of the second-largest component is (E(-2)log n). Each of these results corresponds to an analogous well-known result for the Erds-Renyi process. Our proof techniques include combinatorial arguments, the differential equation method for random processes, and the singularity analysis of the moment generating function for the susceptibility, which satisfies a quasi-linear partial differential equation.
