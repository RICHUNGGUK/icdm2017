For this purpose we represent a method which utilizes a special class of rational curves called Rational Frenet-Serret (RF) curves for robot trajectory planning. RF curves distinguished by the property that the motion of their Frenet-Serret frame is rational. We describe an algorithm for interpolation of positions by a rational Frenet-Serret motion. Further more we present an algorithm for tracking the constructed RF motion to achieve the desired velocity distribution profile of robot arm.", "paper_title": "Velocity distribution profile for robot arm motion using Rational Frenet-Serret curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000236620800006"}
