These technologies include trust computing, negotiation, argumentation and semantic alignment. In this paper, we identify a number of open questions regarding the integration of computational models and tools for trust computing with negotiation, argumentation and semantic alignment. We consider these questions in general and in the context of applications in open, distributed settings such as the grid and cloud computing.", "paper_title": "On the integration of trust with negotiation, argumentation and semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000332295000002"}
