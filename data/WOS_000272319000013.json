There can be different approaches to implement PR, e. g., firing-interval-based PR (FI-PR), which has been proposed in J. M. Mendel and D. Wu, IEEE Trans. Fuzzy Syst., vol. 16, no. 6, pp. 1550-1564, Dec. 2008 and similarity-based PR (SPR), which is proposed in this paper. Both approaches satisfy the requirement on a CWW engine that the result of combining fired rules should lead to a footprint of uncertainty (FOU) that resembles the three kinds of FOUs in a CWW codebook. A comparative study shows that S-PR leads to output FOUs that resemble word FOUs, which are obtained from subject data, much more closely than FI-PR; hence, S-PR is a better choice for a CWW engine than FI-PR.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Reasoning for Perceptual Computing: A Similarity-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000272319000013"}
