In this paper, we propose side-channel attacks on HIGHT (HIGh security and light weigHT) with the first 11, 12, 13 reduced masked rounds using impossible collision. Our best attacks on HIGHT with the first 11, 12 and 13 reduced masked rounds need 2(17), 2(32) and 2(40) chosen plaintexts and 2(23.6), 2(56.6) and 2(80.6) curve comparisons, respectively. They are the first known side-channel attacks on HIGHT with reduced masked rounds.", "paper_title": "Side-channel attacks on HIGHT with reduced masked rounds suitable for the protection of multimedia computing system", "paper_id": "WOS:000300189100003"}
