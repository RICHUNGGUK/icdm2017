To better support service process collaboration, an event view model is proposed, which is composed of a set of event types and their dependency relationships. It provides a general and flexible way to define a public view of a service process model and serves as the basis for defining service process collaboration protocols. In the paper, the basic concepts and a system framework for event-based service process collaboration are first introduced. The definitions of event and the dependency relationships among event types are then presented. Especially, how to identify dependency relationships among composite event types is studied in detail. After discussing the definition of event view and its specifying approach, a procedure for transforming a BPEL process model into an event model and deriving dependencies among events is given. Finally, a case study is presented, and some implementation issues for defining and publishing an event view are discussed.
