A finite element full-system approach is employed. The hydrodynamic and elastic problems are solved simultaneously which leads to fast convergence rates. The free boundary problem at the contact's exit is handled by a penalty method. For highly loaded contacts, the standard Galerkin solution of Reynolds equation exhibits an oscillatory behaviour. The use of artificial diffusion techniques is proposed to stabilize the solution. This approach is then extended to account for non-Newtonian lubricant behaviour and thermal effects. Artificial diffusion procedures are also introduced to stabilize the solution at high loads. (C) 2010 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
