These techniques are driven by a prediction engine or algorithm that guesses following actions of web users. A large amount of prediction algorithms has been proposed since the first prefetching approach was published, although it is only over the last two or three years when they have begun to be successfully implemented in commercial products. These algorithms can be implemented in any element of the web architecture and can use a wide variety of information as input. This affects their structure, data system, computational resources and accuracy. The knowledge of the input information and the understanding of how it can be handled to make predictions can help to improve the design of current prediction engines, and consequently prefetching techniques. This paper analyzes fifty of the most relevant algorithms proposed along 15 years of prefetching research and proposes a taxonomy where the algorithms are classified according to the input data they use. For each group, the main advantages and shortcomings are highlighted. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
