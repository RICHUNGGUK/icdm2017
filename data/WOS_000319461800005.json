However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. In this paper, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online to address this difficulty. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly supervised bootstrapping approach for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large collection of online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1-measure of 82.5 percent in comparative question identification and 83.3 percent in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. Additionally, our ranking results show highly relevance to user's comparison intents in web.", "paper_title": "Comparable Entity Mining from Comparative Questions", "paper_id": "WOS:000319461800005"}
