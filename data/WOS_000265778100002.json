Rankings of library classification categories using the h-, g-and R-index are shown to be statistically equivalent. Moreover these indices seem to have the same discriminating power, as measured by the Gini concentration index. We further present best fitting Zipf-Mandelbrot functions for the h-distributions of classifications in different libraries.", "paper_title": "Properties of Hirsch-type indices: the case of library classification categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000265778100002"}
