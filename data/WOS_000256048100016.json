And, under what interpretations can modem mathematics and the theory of computer science be kept as completely as possible? Design/methodology/approach - The paper is a conceptual discussion. Findings - The paper lays out the set theoretical foundation for the mathematical system of potential infinities. Originality/value - This work is the non-logical axiomatic part of the mathematical system of potential infinities: the axiomatic set theoretic system. At the end, the problem of consistency of this axiomatic set theory is discussed.", "paper_title": "Mathematical system of potential infinities (IV) - set theoretic foundation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100016"}
