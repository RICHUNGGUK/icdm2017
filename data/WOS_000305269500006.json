We then focus on the recently introduced half-lattice paths for the M(p, 2p +/- 1) characters, reformulating them in such a way that the two cases may be treated uniformly. That the generating functions of these half-lattice paths are indeed M(p, 2p +/- 1) characters is proved by describing weight preserving bijections between them and the corresponding RSOS lattice paths. Here, theM (p, 2p - 1) case is derived for the first time. We then apply the methods of Bressoud and Warnaar to these half-lattice paths to derive fermionic expressions for the Virasoro characters x(1,2)(p,2p +/- 1) that differ from those obtained from the RSOS paths.
