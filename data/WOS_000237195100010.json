A modified MOS-transistor-only folding block contributes to a small chip area. At the input stage, offset averaging reduces the input capacitance and the distributed track-and-hold circuits are proposed to improve signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio (SNDR). An INL/DNL of 0.77 LSB/0.6 LSB was measured. An SNDR figure of 43.7 dB is achieved at 4 MHz input frequencies when operated at full speed of 200 MHz. The chip is realized in a standard digital 0.18 mu m CMOS technology and consumes a total power of 181 mW from 3.3 V power supply. The active area is 0.25 mm(2).", "paper_title": "An 8-bit 200-MSample/s folding and interpolating ADC in 0.25 mm(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000237195100010"}
