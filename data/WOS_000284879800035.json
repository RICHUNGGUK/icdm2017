Under overload, SIP networks suffer from congestion collapse due to its ineffective overload control mechanism. In this paper we propose a backpressure-based SIP overload control mechanism called Bassoon. It consists of two parts: the first part is a provably optimal load balancing algorithm that ensures full utilization of the available network resources. The second part is an end-to-end load control algorithm that intelligently throttles excessive traffic at the edge of the network. We show that, by combining optimal load balancing and end-to-end load control, Bassoon effectively controls overload in SIP networks and outperforms existing schemes in terms of goodput, fairness and responsiveness.", "paper_title": "SIP Overload Control: A Backpressure-based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800035"}
