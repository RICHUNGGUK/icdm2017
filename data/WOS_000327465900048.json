However, according to our experiments, RSS signatures are not suitable as the unique annotations (like Fingerprints) of recorded locations. In this study, we investigate the characteristics of RSS (e.g., how the RSS values change as time goes on and between consecutive positions?). On this basis, we design LuPI (Locating using Prior Information) that exploits the characteristics of RSS: with user motion, LuPI uses novel sensors integrated in smartphones to construct the RSS variation space (like radio map) of a floor plan as prior information. The deployment of LuPI is easy and rapid since little human intervention is needed. In LuPI, the calibration of \"radio map\" is crowd-sourced, automatic and scheduled. Experimental results show that LuPI achieves comparable location accuracy to previous approaches, even without the statistical information of site survey.", "paper_title": "Locating using Prior Information: Wireless Indoor Localization Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900048"}
