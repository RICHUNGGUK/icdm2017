The least positive integer k for which there exists an equitable coloring of a graph G with k colors is said to be the equitable chromatic number of G and is denoted by chi=(G). The least positive integer k such that for any k' >= k there exists an equitable coloring of a graph G with k'colors is said to be the equitable chromatic threshold of G and is denoted by chi(=)* (G). In this paper, we investigate the asymptotic behavior of these coloring parameters in the probability space G(n,p) of random graphs. We prove that if n(-1/5+epsilon) < p < 0.99 for some 0 < epsilon, then almost surely chi(G(n,p)) <= X=(G(n,p)) = (1 + o(1))chi(G(n,p)) holds (where chi(G(n,p)) is the ordinary chromatic number of G(n,p)). We also show that there exists a constant C such that if C/n < p < 0.99, then almost surely chi (G(n,p)) <= chi=(G(n,p)) <= (2 + o(1))chi (G(n,p)). Concerning the equitable chromatic threshold, we prove that if n(-(1-epsilon)) < p < 0.99 for some 0 < epsilon, then almost surely chi(G(n,p)) X(=)*(G(n,p)) <= (2 + o(1))chi(G(n,p)) holds, and if log 1+ epsilon/n < p < 0.99 for some 0 < epsilon, then almost surely we have chi(G(n,p)) <= chi(=)*(G(n,p)) = O(epsilon)(chi(G(n,p))).
