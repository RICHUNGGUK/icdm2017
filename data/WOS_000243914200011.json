We show that a much larger class of deformations than the affine transforms can be compensated analytically within filtered back projection algorithms in 2D parallel beam and fan beam dynamic tomography. We present numerical experiments on the Shepp and Logan phantom showing that nonaffine deformations can be compensated. A generalization to 3D cone beam tomography is proposed.", "paper_title": "Compensation of some time dependent deformations in tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000243914200011"}
