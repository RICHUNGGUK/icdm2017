The estimators are evaluated under different conditions regarding (i) sample size, varying between N=50 and 3200, (ii) distributional assumption of the latent variables and the disturbance terms, namely normal, and heavy tailed (t), and (iii) the complexity of the model. For the assessment of the five estimators we use overall performance, relative bias, MSE and coverage of confidence intervals. The analysis reveals substantial differences in the performance of the five asymptotically equal estimators. Most diversity was found for t distributed, i.e. heavy tailed, data.", "paper_title": "The small sample performance of estimators of the standard errors of structural equation models", "paper_id": "WOS:000315188300005"}
