Experiments using hundreds of textures show that they achieve higher quality than the commonly used S3TC at the same compression ratio or (for RGBA images) similar quality to S3TC at twice the compression ratio. In hardware implementations a large part of decompression hardware can be shared with existing common systems, minimizing the amount of additional hardware needed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
