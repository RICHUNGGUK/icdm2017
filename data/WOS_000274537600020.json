Therefore, this paper presents an accurate random telegraph signal (RTS) noise analysis model and a novel quantitative evaluation method in motion picture for the visual sensory evaluation of CIS. In this paper, two main works will be introduced. One is that the exposure process of a video camera is simulated, in which a Gaussian noise and an RTS noise in pinned-photodiode CMOS pixels are modeled in time domain and spatial domain; the other is that a new video quality evaluation method for RTS noise is proposed. Simulation results obtained reveal that the proposed noise modeling for CIS can approximate its physical process and the proposed video quality evaluation method for RTS noise performs effectively as compared to other evaluation methods. Based on the experimental results, conclusions on how the spatial distribution of an RTS noise affects the quality of motion picture are carried out.", "paper_title": "A Novel Modeling and Evaluating for RTS Noise on CMOS Image Sensor in Motion Picture", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537600020"}
