Basically, in their method the solutions of all systems of linear crisp equations formed by the a-levels are calculated. We propose in this paper a new method for solving systems of linear fuzzy equations based on a practical algorithm using parametric functions in which the variables are given by the fuzzy coefficients of the system. We show that our algorithm is much more efficient than the method of Buckley and Qu.", "paper_title": "Solving systems of linear fuzzy equations by parametric functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000247285300005"}
