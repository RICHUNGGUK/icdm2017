The formal separation between resolved and unresolved field is obtained by wavelet threshold filtering that is inherent to the adaptive wavelet collocation numerical method. A new explicit wavelet filtering strategy is introduced and tested, by considering two different filtering levels: the physical level, which controls the turbulence model, and the numerical level that is responsible for the accuracy of numerical simulations. The theoretical basis for wavelet-based adaptive large-eddy simulation with explicit filtering and consistent dynamic modeling is given. Numerical experiments are presented for unsteady homogeneous turbulence, demonstrating the existence of grid-independent solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
