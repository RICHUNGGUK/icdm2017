We examine the existing literature and implementations in this area, focusing on the design choices made, and we propose an architecture for the design of Bandwidth Brokers that combines an adaptive admission control algorithm for increased utilization of network resources and a mechanism for reducing the complexity overhead that intends to be both simple and effective. Specifically, we present a novel architecture for the admission control module that aims at achieving a satisfactory balance between maximizing the resource utilization for the network provider and minimizing the overhead of the module. We complement our theoretical discussion with extensive experimental simulations for the proposed Bandwidth Broker components and analysis of the results. The simulations study the possible configurations of the proposed algorithm and also compare it with alternative admission control policies.
