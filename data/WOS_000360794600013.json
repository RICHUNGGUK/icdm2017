In this paper, we present a novel approach for optimizing condition-based maintenance policies for such assets by modelling their deterioration as a multiple dependent deterioration path process. The aim of the policy is to replace the malfunctioned component and mitigate accelerated deterioration at minimal impact to the business. The maintenance model provides guidance on determining inspection and maintenance strategies to optimize asset availability and operational cost.", "paper_title": "A Condition-Based Maintenance Model for Assets With Accelerated Deterioration Due to Fault Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360794600013"}
