The science portals have played an important role in developing computing environments of such cyberinfrastructure. And discipline-specific problem solving environments can be used productively, suitable for the study and development of scientific and technical applications. In this paper, we present a simple, web-based computational portal framework for integrating numerical response from thousands of large-scale earthquake engineering computational simulations. This system facilitates access and use of the high performance computing (HPC) resource by the researchers and provides an administratively and technologically streamlined environment for uploading input model files, creating the job script, editing the input model file, specifying HPC job parameters, querying running job status, and storing output data. Our web-based science portal can be used to promote an efficient and effective simulation environment to help scientists as well as educators in their daily activities and speed up the scientific discovery process. The underlying numerical simulation platform is an open-source object-oriented framework for finite element analysis, Open System for Earthquake Engineering Simulation, funded by the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research Center, and used by the proposed science portal to perform simulation applications in earthquake engineering.
