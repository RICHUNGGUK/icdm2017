Understanding the best use of podcasting during distance learning is basic for instructional design. This pilot study compared online reading to a supplementary podcast to determine graduate nursing students' preferences and usage. Results indicated that students did not download the podcast to a mobile device but multitasked while listening. The podcast and the readings were equally supported as important by nursing students. Podcasting in distance-accessible courses may engage students by providing a human voice and thus a better virtual connection. Podcasting is only one method of knowledge acquisition; distance learning courses should consider providing multiple learner-centered delivery methods, given the variety of learning styles.", "paper_title": "Podcasting as an Instructional Supplement to Online Learning A Pilot Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000292876200003"}
