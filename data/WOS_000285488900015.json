Visual knowledge structure reasoning method integrates two types of knowledge reasoning: the knowledge logical relation reasoning and the knowledge structure reasoning. The knowledge logical relation reasoning implements knowledge consistency checking and the implicit associations reasoning between knowledge points. We propose a Knowledge Unit Circle Search strategy for the knowledge structure reasoning. It implements the semantic implication extension, the semantic relevant extension and the semantic class belonging confirmation. Moreover, the knowledge structure reasoning results are visualized using ITM Toolkit. A prototype system of visual knowledge structure reasoning has been implemented and applied to the massive knowledge organization, management and service for education.", "paper_title": "Visual Knowledge Structure Reasoning with Intelligent Topic Map", "paper_id": "WOS:000285488900015"}
