Architecting such an SIS in which strategic decisions are made continuously can be well performed by employing an axiomatic design approach by which basic constituents of an agent based SIS are determined. People may decide differently in the same situation not because they are logical but because they sometimes decide emotionally. Here architecting an SIS based on emotional agents which contribute in strategic decision making has been proposed in a model based on axiomatic design theory to consider critical points such as emotional decision making and flexibility which results in agile SIS.", "paper_title": "Axiomatic agent based architecture for agile decision making in strategic information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000351238800009"}
