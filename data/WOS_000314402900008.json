However, even the best method is not able to cope with real world situations. In this paper, a robust method is proposed such that the performance of the face recognition system is still highly reliable even if the face undergoes large head rotation. Our proposed method considers local regions from half side of face rather than using the holistic face approach since in the former approach the \"linearity\" of features within the limited region is somewhat preserved regardless of the pose variation. Discrete wavelet transform is then utilized onto these patches in order to form face feature vectors. We train our recognizer using linear regression algorithm to interpret the relationship between a face vector for a specific pose and its corresponding frontal face feature vector. We demonstrate that our proposed method is able to recognize a non-frontal face with high accuracy even under low-resolution image by relying only on single frontal face in the database.", "paper_title": "VARIANT POSE FACE RECOGNITION USING DISCRETE WAVELET TRANSFORM AND LINEAR REGRESSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000314402900008"}
