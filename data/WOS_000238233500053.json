It is based on a digit-recurrence algorithm for computing the Euclidean norm and an on-line division (on-line reciprocal computation) algorithm. These algorithms are modified, so that the reciprocal of the Euclidean norm is computed by performing on-line division where the divisor is the partial result of Euclidean norm computation. Division, square-rooting, and reciprocal square-root computation, which are important operations,in 3-D graphics, can also be performed using a circuit based on the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Hardware algorithm for computing reciprocal of Euclidean norm of a 3-D vector", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500053"}
