The proposed system not only circulates anonymous e-coins but also protects the profits of the Merchant and the Consumer during a transaction. An e-coin, consisting of a secret value c and a public value c' = h(c) where h() is a secure one-way hash function with collision resistant property, is generated by its owner. The public value of a legal e-coin is published on the bulletin board of Issuer. Only the owner who releases the secret values of the published e-coins can spend money. Instead of Bank, Issuer has to be on-line to verify. and replace the public values of the Consumer's e-coins with the Merchant's while the Consumer pays money to the Merchant in a transaction. Such a replacement represents that the coins are passed from one person to another.", "paper_title": "Anonymous and transferable coins in pay-fair ecommerce", "paper_id": "WOS:000242877700016"}
