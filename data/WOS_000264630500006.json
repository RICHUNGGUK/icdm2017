The proposed method considers the collaborations between parts and derives a probability propagation framework by encoding the spatial coherence in a Bayesian formulation. To resolve this formulation, a TBP particle-filtering method is introduced. Unlike existing methods that only use the spatial-coherence relationship for particle-weight estimation, our method further applies this relationship for state prediction based on system dynamics. Thus, the part-based information can be utilized efficiently, and the tracking performance can be improved. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the factored-likelihood and particle reweight methods, which only use spatial coherence for weight estimation.", "paper_title": "Tracking by Parts: A Bayesian Approach With Component Collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500006"}
