In order to couple numerical modelling schemes with inversion or control algorithms, the size of such models needs to be highly reduced. The identification method is a way to build low-order models that fit with the original ones. The laminar flow over a backward-facing step is used as a test case. Presented solutions are found to be in good agreement with experimental and numerical results found in the literature. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
