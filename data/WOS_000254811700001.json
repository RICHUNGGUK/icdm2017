Gradually varied, steady, supercritical flow is assumed as the initial condition. An unsteady flow is created by increasing the downstream depth. One-dimensional, unsteady Saint-Venant equations are solved by using the MacCormack and the dissipative two-four explicit finite difference schemes. The steady flow solution is obtained by treating the time variable as an iteration parameter and letting the solution converge to the steady state. The abrupt drop is treated as an interior boundary and solved by the method of characteristics. The results are compared with experimental and analytical studies.
