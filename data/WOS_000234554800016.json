Good performance is required from 0 degrees to 90 degrees angle of attack because the turbine is operated in the oscillating airflow produced with wave energy. Furthermore, very interesting and complex flows are experimentally observed by the oil film method for large angles of attack where the performance is strongly influenced, especially, the self-starting. This paper tries to analyze the mechanism of these three-dimensional flows around the turbine with the flow visualization and the numerical analysis, focusing on the off-design condition.", "paper_title": "Flow on blades of wells turbine for wave power generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000234554800016"}
