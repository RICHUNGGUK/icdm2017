Optimized geometries of the halogen bonding complexes indicate that angles C-1-I center dot center dot center dot X are basically linear (178-180A degrees) and angles I center dot center dot center dot X-M mainly range from 90 to 150A degrees. The strength of these metal-influenced halogen bonds alters with different metal centers, metal-bound halogen atoms and the substitutes on phosphine ligands. Electrostatic potential and natural bond orbital analysis show that both of the electrostatic and orbital interactions make a contribution to the formation of halogen bonds, while the electrostatic term plays a dominant role. AIM analysis suggests that, for trans-[M(F)(2-C5NF4)-(PR3)(2)] (M = Ni, Pd, Pt) monomers, the formed halogen bonding complexes are stabilized by local concentration of the charge of intermediate character, while for the metal monomers containing chlorine and bromine, a typical closed-shell interaction exist. These results prove that the structures and geometries of these halogen bonding complexes can be tuned by changing the halogen atoms and metal centers, which may provide useful information for the design and synthesis of new functional materials.", "paper_title": "A theoretical study on the halogen bonding interactions of C6F5I with a series of group 10 metal monohalides", "paper_id": "WOS:000323283100036"}
