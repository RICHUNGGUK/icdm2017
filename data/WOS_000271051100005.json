The Immersed Finite Element Method is adopted for this study to conveniently incorporate various geometrical shapes of arteries without remeshing. Our computational results provide detailed quantitative analysis on the blood flow pattern, wall shear stress, particle residence time, and oscillatory shear index. The analysis of these parameters leads to a better understanding of blood clot formation and its localization in a stenosed and a stented carotid artery. A healthy artery is also studied to establish a baseline comparison. This analysis will assist in developing treatments for diseased arteries and novel stent designs to reduce restenosis.
