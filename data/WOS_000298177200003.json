The reuse of existing optical cable networks allows our ladder and grid networks to introduce duplicate routes for the shared portions of PONs by using a few optical fibers with simple structures. It automatically builds alternative optical paths in response to the wavelengths of optical line terminal and optical network units (ONUs) at both ends of the network. Our simulation achieved network capacities of 1.25 Gb/s x 500 ONUs and 10 Gb/s x 64 ONUs by applying 48 and 16 WDMs, respectively, to the networks. We think that these results show sufficient scalability; in particular, the ladder network composed of simple WDM components is a promising architecture for resilient access networks.", "paper_title": "Resilient FTTH Architecture With Ladder and Grid Network Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000298177200003"}
