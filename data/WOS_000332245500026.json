SPIM has lower torque pulsation compared to a three-phase IM and using SPIM, the power rating of inverter legs can be reduced. This paper offers a high performance intelligent controller for speed automatic control of a SPIM. A brain emotional learning based intelligent controller (BELBIC) is proposed as the speed controller. This emotional controller has simple structure with high auto learning feature and it is independent of parameters variations. A direct vector control in rotor flux frame based on space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) is used to decouple flux and torque control of the SPIM like a conventional three-phase machine. In this work, the d-axis current and speed reference signals are accurately tracked. An overview of the BELBIC is provided. A comparison with the conventional PI controller and Sliding Mode Control (SLMC) points out the superiority of the proposed BELBIC in speed response and torque ripple. Experimental results indicate that the BELBIC achieves a good speed regulation with a less control effort and torque ripple.", "paper_title": "Automatic speed control of an asymmetrical six-phase induction motor using emotional controller (BELBIC)", "paper_id": "WOS:000332245500026"}
