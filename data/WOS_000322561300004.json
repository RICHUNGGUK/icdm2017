The main contribution is the maximization of the (DA) while characterizing the asymptotic stability region by a Lyapunov Function. Such result is obtained using a Genetic Algorithm (GA). A theoretical proof of the validity of the obtained domain is developed. An illustrative example ends the paper.", "paper_title": "Enlarging the Domain of Attraction in Nonlinear Polynomial Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322561300004"}
