The proposed method is suited for the special demands of tasks of the airport snow shovelling. The robots have to keep a compact formation of variable shapes during moving into the locations of their deployment and for the autonomous sweeping of runways surfaces. These tasks are solved in two independent modes of the airport snow shoveling. The moving and the sweeping modes provide a full-scale solution of the trajectory planning and coordination of vehicles applicable in the specific airport environment. Nevertheless, they are suited for any multi-robot application that requires complex manoeuvres of compact formations in dynamic environment. The approach encapsulates the dynamic trajectory planning and the control of the entire formation into one merged optimization process via a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) based methodology. The obtained solution of the optimization includes a complete plan for the formation. It respects the overall structure of the workspace and actual control inputs for each vehicle to ensure collision avoidance and coordination of team members. The presented method enables to autonomously design arbitrary manoeuvres, like reverse driving or turning of compact formations of car-like robots, which frequently occur in the airport sweeping application. Examples of such scenarios verifying the performance of the approach are shown in simulations and hardware experiments in this article. Furthermore, the requirements that guarantee a convergence of the group to a desired state are formulated for the formation acting in the sweeping and moving modes.", "paper_title": "Trajectory Planning and Control for Airport Snow Sweeping by Autonomous Formations of Ploughs", "paper_id": "WOS:000325184900007"}
