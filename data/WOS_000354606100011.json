We first present a continuous time model based on time slots for single docks, which is enhanced by reformulating the time assignment constraints. Next, we present a model based on event points to handle parallel docks. A discrete time is also presented based on a single commodity fixed-charge network flow problem (FCNF). All the models are solved for multiple randomly generated instances of different problems to compare their computational efficiency, and to illustrate the solutions obtained. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
