The gap is smaller than that obtained by simply generalizing the approach given by Aharonov and Regev. The main technical ingredient used in this paper is the discrete Laplace distribution on lattices which may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "A polynomial time algorithm for GapCVPP in l(1) norm", "paper_id": "WOS:000332351000009"}
