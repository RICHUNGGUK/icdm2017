This paper presents the interaction between defective products and optimal control of production rate, lead time and inventory. Our aim is to minimize the expected discounted overall cost due to maintenance activities, inventory holding and backlogs. Through Condition-Based Maintenance, we monitor in a real time the manufacturing system's health by describing N operational states. We consider two maintenance states of a machine controlled by two decision variables: production and maintenance rates. The optimal policy is characterized by the dynamic programming solution to a piecewise deterministic optimal control problem. A numerical illustration and a sensitive analysis are developed with a set of parameters calibrated on an existing manufacturing system.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous control of maintenance and production rates of a manufacturing system with defective products", "paper_id": "WOS:000301605000017"}
