Our solution focuses on minimizing communication and computational demands of the method which are dependent on a nonparaxiality parameter. Performance tests carried out on different types of parallel systems behave according theoretical predictions and show that our proposal exhibits a better behavior than those solutions based on the use of conventional parallel fast Fourier transform implementations. The application of our design is illustrated in a particularly demanding scenario: the study of dark solitons at interfaces separating two defocusing Kerr media, where it is shown to play a key role.
