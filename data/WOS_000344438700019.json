They are often used in manufacturing large sized products. In this paper, we proposed a bi-objective mathematical model to maximize the production rate and to distribute the workload of a two-sided assembly line with zone constraints. Harmony Search (HS) is proposed to solve and balance the problem. The HS uses the heuristic representation to encode the generated harmony element. Non-dominated sorting is implemented in the HS in order to obtain a set of diverse Pareto optimal solutions. Numerical examples are given to evaluate the proposed method. Comparison between the proposed HS and NSGA-II reveals that the proposed method has a better ratio and convergence for small and medium size problems, and has better solution spread for large size problems.
