Previous models typically generate words and phrases related to the original query, but do not consider how these words and phrases would fit together in actual queries. In this article, a novel framework is proposed that models reformulation as a distribution of actual queries, where each query is a variation of the original query. This approach considers an actual query as the basic unit and thus captures important query-level dependencies between words and phrases. An implementation of this framework that only uses publicly available resources is proposed, which makes fair comparisons with other methods using TREC collections possible. Specifically, this implementation consists of a query generation step that analyzes the passages containing query words to generate reformulated queries and a probability estimation step that learns a distribution for reformulated queries by optimizing the retrieval performance. Experiments on TREC collections show that the proposed model can significantly outperform previous reformulation models.", "paper_title": "Modeling Reformulation Using Query Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000319209200001"}
