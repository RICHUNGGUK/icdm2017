A question arises: How to design the cache architecture to prevent a performance bottleneck caused by data accesses? This work studies a reconfigurable cache architecture that can be dynamically configured for meeting the individual demand of running applications. Using a self-developed cache simulator, we first examined how different cache organization and configuration influence the parallel execution of OpenMP applications. The experimental results show that applications benefit from a flexible cache with reconfigurability. This motivated us to go a step further and develop a hardware prototype of this novel architecture.", "paper_title": "Performance advantage of reconfigurable cache design on multicore processor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255878600005"}
