For the offline MRBP problem, the previous best known approximation ratio is 6/5 (= 1.2) achieved by the classical First-Fit-Increasing (FFI) algorithm (Boyar et al. in Theor. Comput. Sci. 362(1-3): 127-139, 2006). In this paper, we give a new FFI-type algorithm with an approximation ratio of 80/71 (approximate to 1.12676). For the offline LBC problem, it has been shown in Lin et al. (COCOON, pp. 340-349, 2006) that the classical First-Fit-Decreasing (FFD) algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of 71/60 (approximate to 1.18333). In this paper, we present a new FFD-type algorithm with an approximation ratio of 17/15 (approximate to 1.13333). Our algorithms are based on a pattern-based technique and a number of other observations. They run in near linear time (i.e., O(n log n)), and therefore are practical.", "paper_title": "Improved Approximation Algorithms for Maximum Resource Bin Packing and Lazy Bin Covering Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000274140400003"}
