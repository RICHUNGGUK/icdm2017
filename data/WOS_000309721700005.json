The core of the anthropomorphic controller is a hierarchical control system. It is composed of a top controller and a low level controller. The top controller has been designed both to interpret the amputee's intensions through electromyography (EMG) signals recognition and to provide the subject-prosthesis interface control with electro-cutaneous sensory feedback (ESF), while the low level controller is responsible for grasp stability. The control strategies include the EMG control strategy, EMG and ESF closed loop control strategy, and voice control strategy. Through EMG signal recognition, 10 types of hand postures are recognized based on support vector machine (SVM). An anthropomorphic closed loop system is constructed to include the customer, sensory feedback system, EMG control system, and the prosthetic hand, so as to help the amputee perform a more successful EMG grasp. Experimental results suggest that the anthropomorphic controller can be used for multi-posture recognition, and that grasp with ESF is a cognitive dual process with visual and sensory feedback. This process while outperforming the visual feedback process provides the concept of grasp force magnitude during manipulation of objects.", "paper_title": "An anthropomorphic controlled hand prosthesis system", "paper_id": "WOS:000309721700005"}
