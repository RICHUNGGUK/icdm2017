Across three studies, 823 college student bloggers completed an online survey. In study one (n=176), exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis techniques tested four potential models. Study two (n=291) cross-validated the final factor structure obtained in the fourth model with a separate sample. Study three (n=356) tested the discriminant and predictive validity of the measure by comparing it to the self-consciousness scale. The Blogging Privacy Management Measure (BPMM) is a multidimensional, valid, and reliable construct. Future research could explore the influence of family values about privacy on blogging privacy rule management.", "paper_title": "Blogging, Communication, and Privacy Management: Development of the Blogging Privacy Management Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000270250900012"}
