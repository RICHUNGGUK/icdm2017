It is important to consider that instructional materials can be designed with various types of learning materials, and that the degree to which learning performance is enhanced depends on the type of learning materials provided to the learner. Therefore, this study develops a problem-solving learning system (PSLS) based on animated game-based materials and problem-solving theory; the-study also conducts an in-depth analysis of the relationship between learning materials and personal traits. PSLS consists of a series of solution-inferring tasks that can be utilized to train learners in problem solving. The participants in this study consisted of 134 university students who were asked to analyze the differences in learning performance and learners' self-perception of difficulty when using various learning materials. Moreover, eight teachers were included in this study in order to examine the effectiveness of PSLS. Results show that both gender and learning styles influence not only learning performance but also self-perception of difficulty levels with animated game-based materials in certain scenarios. In addition, the participants showed a 95% probability of obtaining above-average user satisfaction, which suggests that PSLS can be a good vehicle for providing problem-solving activities.
