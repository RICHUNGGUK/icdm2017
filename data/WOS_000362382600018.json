Probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) has been identified as an effective method for dimensional reduction. However, PPCA is a linear method, which cannot deal with nonlinear data distribution. To cope with this problem and enhance the performance of soft sensor model, a new nonlinear dimensional reduction method, weighted probabilistic principal component analysis (WPPCA), is proposed in this paper. By assigning different weights for training samples according to their similarities to the testing sample, nonlinear features can be extracted properly for regression modeling. For performance evaluation of the proposed method, detailed illustrations of a numerical example and an industrial process are provided. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
