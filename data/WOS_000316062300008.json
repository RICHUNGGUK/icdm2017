These scenarios are recorded using the audio-visual robot head POPEYE, equipped with two cameras and four microphones, two of which being plugged into the ears of a dummy head. All the recordings were performed in a standard room with no special equipment, thus providing a challenging indoor scenario. This data set provides a basis to test and benchmark methods and algorithms for audio-visual scene analysis with the ultimate goal of enabling robots to interact with people in the most natural way. The data acquisition setup, sensor calibration, data annotation and data content are fully detailed. Moreover, three examples of using the recorded data are provided, illustrating its appropriateness for carrying out a large variety of HRI experiments. The Ravel data are publicly available at: http://ravel.humavips.eu/.", "paper_title": "RAVEL: an annotated corpus for training robots with audiovisual abilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000316062300008"}
