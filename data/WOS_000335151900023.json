We consider a 16-ary quadrature amplitude constellation labeled with a Gray labeling. It is shown that the asymptotic loss in terms of pairwise error probability, for any two codewords caused by the bit-wise decoder, is bounded by 1.25 dB. The analysis also shows that the asymptotic loss is zero for a wide range of linear codes, including all rate-1/2 convolutional codes.", "paper_title": "On the Asymptotic Performance of Bit-Wise Decoders for Coded Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900023"}
