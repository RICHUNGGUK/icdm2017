Many authenticated key agreement protocols have been proposed to meet the great challenges of information security. The two-party key agreement protocol can be classified into two categories: implicit and explicit key authentications. This paper investigates the issue on authenticated two-party key agreement protocol over an insecure public network and extends the existing implicit authenticated key agreement protocol into the explicit one by introducing the authenticators. The advantage of this explicit protocol is that it does not need any fixed public key infrastructure. Furthermore, this explicit protocol is provably secure in the random oracle under the Computation Gap Diffie-Hellman assumption.
