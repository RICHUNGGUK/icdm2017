The management of the availability periods of shared resources causes a problem because it is achieved by the scheduling systems, which assume a local environment where all resources are on the same site. Therefore, distributed scheduling with shared resources is an important research topic. In this communication, we introduce the architecture and behaviour of DSCEP framework (Distributed, Supervisor, Customer, Environment, and Producer) under shared resources situation with disturbances. We are using a simple example of manufacturing system to illustrate the ability of DSCEP framework to solve the shared resources scheduling problem in complex systems.", "paper_title": "Towards a distributed multi-agent framework for shared resources scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000341501800019"}
