In this work we apply tools from complexity science to characterise two Telefonica Espana transport network systems: the optical fiber network and the SDH transport network. We compare both cases and derive its most important properties. Remarkably, our results show that in both cases several features of heterogeneous, hierarchical complex networks arise.
