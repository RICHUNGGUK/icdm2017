The design procedures of the fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno model of TRMS are detailed. Based on the derived fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno model, parallel distributed fuzzy LQR controller are designed to control the positions of the pitch and yaw angles in TRMS. The stability of the TRMS system with the proposed fuzzy controllers is discussed. Moreover, simulation results are included to indicate the effectiveness of the presented parallel distributed fuzzy LQR controllers for the TRMS. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
