Similarly, a set A is nontrivial for the polynomial exponential time class EXP = DTIME(2(poly)) if A is an element of EXP and the sets from EXP which can be reduced to A are not from a single level DTIME(2(nk)) of the polynomial exponential hierarchy (see [2]). Here we compare the strength of the nontriviality notions with respect to the underlying reducibilities where we consider the polynomial-time variants of many one, bounded truth-table, truth-table, and Turing reducibilities. Surprisingly, the results obtained for E and EXP differ. While the above reducibilities yield a proper hierarchy of nontriviality notions for E, nontriviality for EXP under many-one reducibility and truth-table reducibility coincides.
