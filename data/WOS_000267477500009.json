Design/methodology/approach - The stress concentration factor is determined as a ratio between maximum stress (determined in the fillet radius by photoelastic and finite element methods), and nominal stress (calculated by a common standard formulas). In order to specify the geometric parameters (height and thickness) of gears, both standard Deutsches Institut fur Normung (DIN)/Japanese Gear Manufactures Association (JGMA), and five other non-standard approaches are used. Findings - The results show that the stress concentration factor increases by decreasing the pressure angle. In addition, the values which are obtained by finite element analyses exhibit more uniformity than photoelastic method. Practical implications - An accurate determination of stress concentration factors will limit both over and under design of the gears. Originality/value - The results show that one of the suggested non-standard approaches gives the highest stress concentration factor than the standard approaches.", "paper_title": "The pressure angle effects of spur gears on stress concentration factor", "paper_id": "WOS:000267477500009"}
