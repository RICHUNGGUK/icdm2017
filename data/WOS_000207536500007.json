High-energy synchrotron radiation was used to induce the deposition of gold nanoparticles from a gold-salt solution onto different surf aces. By controlling the deposition parameters (dose, solution, surfactants, and stabilizer polymer concentrations), the distribution and average size of the nanoparticles can be influenced. The distribution of the deposited particle heights and diameters at low doses suggests there is a mechanism of growth of the particles after nucleation on the surface.", "paper_title": "Controlled X-Ray Induced Gold Nanoparticles Deposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000207536500007"}
