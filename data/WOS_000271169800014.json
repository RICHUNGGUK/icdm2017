The main problem we are interested in is periodicity of two-dimensional words satisfying some local conditions. Let A be a matrix of order n. The function phi : Z(2) -> R-n is a generalized centered function of radius r with the matrix A if Sigma(y is an element of z2:0<vertical bar y-x vertical bar <= r) phi(y) = phi(x)A for every x is an element of Z(2), where for x = (x(1),x(2)),y = (y(1),y(2)) we have vertical bar y - x vertical bar = vertical bar y(1) - x(1)vertical bar + vertical bar y(2) - x(2)vertical bar. We prove that every generalized centered function of radius r > 1 with a finite number of values is periodic. For r = 1 the existence of non-periodic generalized centered functions depends oil the spectrum of the matrix A. Similar results are obtained for the infinite triangular and hexagonal grids.
