An evolution-communication P system with nested membrane structure is the core component of the algorithm. The feasible cluster centers are represented by means of objects, and three types of membranes are considered: evolution, local store, and global store. Based on the designed membrane structure and the inherent communication mechanism, a modified differential evolution mechanism is developed to evolve the objects in the system. Under the control of the evolution-communication mechanism of the P system, the proposed fuzzy clustering algorithm achieves good fuzzy partitioning for a data set. The proposed fuzzy clustering algorithm is compared to three recently-developed and two classical clustering algorithms for five artificial and five real-life data sets. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
