In this scenario, a critical issue still remains to be addressed: the reliability of resources, whether they can be recommended as useful and the reliability of peers, whether it is possible to trust them as providers. We propose to integrate these concepts with e-learning, proposing a model for searching for personalised and useful learning paths suggested by reliable (trusted) peers. We performed simulations on the Merlot data set enhanced with information extracted from Advogato, Epinions and Ariadne data sets, testing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
