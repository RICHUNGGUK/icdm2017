To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to address real life-size instances of this problem. The model integrates the balancing of empty vehicles, the cost of handling freight in intermediate terminals, the costs associated with moving freight using the selected services, and the penalty costs of not being able to deliver freight. A metaheuristic is presented and computational results are reported on a set of large new problem instances.", "paper_title": "A metaheuristic for stochastic service network design", "paper_id": "WOS:000281241200002"}
