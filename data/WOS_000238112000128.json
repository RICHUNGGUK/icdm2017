Based on the pre-defined instruction/operator sets, a hierarchical RBF neural network can be created and evolved by using tree-structure based evolutionary algorithm. This framework allows input variables selection, over-layer connections for the various nodes involved. The HRBF structure is developed using an evolutionary algorithm and the parameters are optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm. Empirical results on benchmark classification problems indicate that the proposed method is efficient.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical radial basis function neural networks for classification problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000128"}
