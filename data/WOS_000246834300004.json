Nevertheless, a new trend indicates a shift towards more enhanced cards with networking capabilities. We propose revising the usual focus on smart card authentication protocol designs, as well as highlighting the need to adapt to new trends. Our main objective is to define an authentication model that uses the card as a stand-alone supplicant in a mutual end-to-end authentication schema. We also propose a protocol architecture which allows us to integrate the smart card within the network in the authentication plane. Finally, this new approach to network smart cards authentication processes is applied to a practical electronic payment scenario. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
