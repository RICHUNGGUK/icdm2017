To reach the desired performances at the application level, the network-on-chip (NoC) router should implement per it handling strategy with wide granularity. This purpose requires an enhanced internal architecture that ensures from one hand a specific management according to a service classification and from the other hand, it enhances the routing process. In this context, this paper proposes a new mechanism for QoS management in NoC. This mechanism is based on the use of central memory where its are in-queued according to their class of service. This scheme enables an optimal it scheduling phase and provides more capabilities to drop low important its when the router shows congestion state symptoms. The paper presents, also, a protocol structure that fills with this architecture and introduces a signaling mechanism to make efficient the QoS management through the proposed architecture. The circuit performances and its adaptability to achieve QoS with low power processing and high bandwidth in on chip multiprocessor systems will be studied in this paper.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT SCHEME FOR CONGESTION CONTROL IN NETWORK-ON-CHIP WITH QoS CONSIDERATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000341242900001"}
