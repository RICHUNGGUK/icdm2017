Those calculations are made on a simplified model which takes into account the characteristic quantities which arise from an accurate asymptotic analysis of the nonlinear Schrodinger-Poisson system. After a summary of the existing theoretical results, the asymptotic model is explicitly adapted to physically realistic situations and numerical results are shown in various cases.
