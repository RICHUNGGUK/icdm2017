The fluid flow is analyzed through the lattice Boltzmann method and the structural response by the finite element method. The time discontinuous Galerkin method is used to integrate the structural dynamics in time, and an explicit coupling strategy with the same time-step for the fluid and the solid is employed. Numerical results are compared to analytical and experimental findings for rigid and compliant wedges. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
