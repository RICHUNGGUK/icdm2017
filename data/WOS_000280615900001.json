In 2005, Nam et al. proposed a GKA protocol for imbalanced wireless networks in which an imbalanced wireless network consists of many mobile nodes with limited computing capability and a powerful node with less restriction. In 2007, Tseng showed that Nam et al.'s protocol is not a contributory GKA, while he also proposed a new GKA protocol. However, neither GKA protocol is concerned with dynamic member joining/leaving. This is an important functionality of GKA, especially for a wireless network environment. In this paper, we propose a dynamic group key agreement protocol for imbalanced wireless networks, and show that it requires less computation cost for dynamic member joining/leaving as compared to the previously proposed protocols. We also show that the proposed protocol is provably secure against passive attacks under the decision Diffie-Hellman problem and the hash function assumptions. Furthermore, by the pre-shared two-party key between a mobile node and the powerful node in the existing imbalanced wireless networks, we propose a generalized GKA protocol that requires only several hash functions.
