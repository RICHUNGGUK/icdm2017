In this paper, we propose a robust approach to the modeling bottom-up visual attention. The main contributions are twofold: 1) We use a principal component analysis (PCA) to transform the RGB color space into three principal components, which intrinsically leads to an opponent representation of colors to ensure good saliency analysis. 2) A practicable framework for modeling visual attention is presented based on a region-level reliability analysis for each feature map. And then the salient map can be robustly generated for a variety of nature images. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can characterize the human perception well.", "paper_title": "Modeling bottom-up visual attention for color images", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100059"}
