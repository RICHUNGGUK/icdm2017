Reputation is about evaluating an agent's actions and other agents' opinions about those actions, reporting on those actions and opinions, and reacting to that report, thus creating a feedback loop. This social mechanism has been successfully used to classify agents within normative systems. The systems rely on the feedbacks given by the members of the social network in which the RMS operates. Reputation can thus be seen as an endogenous and self produced indicator, created by the users for the users' benefit. This implies that users' participation and collaboration is a key factor for the effectiveness a RMS. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
