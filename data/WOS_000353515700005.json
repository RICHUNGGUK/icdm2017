We focus on the maximal totally real subfield Q(zeta(p)r + zeta(-r)(p)) of the cyclotomic field Q(zeta(p)r), r >= 1. Our construction has applications to coset encoding of algebraic lattice codes for block fading channels, and in particular for block fading wiretap channels.", "paper_title": "Construction A of Lattices Over Number Fields and Block Fading (Wiretap) Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700005"}
