Threshold values for changing different search range are chosen from average SAD of designated region of block and finally by effectively switching from different search range, unwanted computation are eliminated. As local characteristics of the motion is utilized for selecting the search range, the proposed algorithm achieves several times faster than the exhaustive search with negligible performance degradation. For QCIF, CIF WQVGA, 720p and 1080p size videos the proposed method attains 54 % reduction of computational complexity, while maintaining video quality.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Search Window for High Efficiency Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000350369600004"}
