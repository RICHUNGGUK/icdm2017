But increasing the number of antennas induces the higher hardware costs and computational burden. To overcome those problems, it is effective to select antennas appropriately among all available ones. In this paper, a new antenna selection method is proposed. The transmit antennas are selected so as to maximize the channel capacity using the genetic algorithm (GA) which is the one of the general random search algorithm. The results show that the proposed GA achieves almost the same performance as the optimal selection method with less computational amount.", "paper_title": "Antenna selection using genetic algorithm for MIMO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500049"}
