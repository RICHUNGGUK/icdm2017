However, Chord has often been criticized on its careless of routing locality. A routing efficiency enhancement protocol on top of Chord is illustrated in this paper, which is called PChord. PChord aims to achieve better routing efficiency than Chord by exploiting proximity of the underlying network topology. The simulation shows that PChord has achieved lower RDP per message routing.", "paper_title": "PChord: Improvement on Chord to achieve better routing efficiency by exploiting proximity", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800019"}
