A novel index, the average sensitivity factor, SF(i), derived from the mathematical formulation of neural network is proposed to quantify the result of the sensitivity analysis. The SF(i) is a robust index of sensitivity analysis for the MLP model and can be used in the other problems not just in the recognition of field liquefaction problem. A well-trained MLP model is first developed to discriminate between the cases of liquefaction and non-liquefaction. Excellent performance and good generalization is achieved, with the higher recognition rate 98.9% in the training phase, 91.2% in testing phase and 96.6% on the overall cases. Using this model, the SF(i) values are then calculated and reveal that peak ground acceleration (PGA) is the most sensitive factor in both the liquefaction and non-liquefaction cases. Earthquake parameters (M(w) and PGA), the stress state parameters of the soil layer (r(d), sigma(v) and sigma(v)'). and the soil resistance parameters (SPT-N, C(N), C(E) and FC) play approximately equal roles. The seismic demand factors (M(w), PGA, r(d), sigma(v), and sigma(v)') is more sensitive than the liquefaction resistance capacity factors (SPT-N, C(N), C(E), and FC) in the two-class liquefaction recognition problem.
