The main points of our study can de summarized in two questions: a) given prices p(k) and rate of interest r(k) in period k is it always possible to find a set of quasi-equilibrium prices for period k + 1 when the wage rate is p(0)(k + 1)? b) if this is not the case what sufficient conditions can be found in order to guarantee the existence of a vector of quasi-equilibrium prices in period k + 1? In this paper we show that for some economies that behave according to the Leontief price model assumptions there are no Walrasian quasi-equilibrium prices and therefore no equilibrium prices. We also show that with some assumptions regarding matrices A and B it is possible to find vectors of labour costs per unit of production that make possible the existence of quasi-equilibrium prices.", "paper_title": "Positive solutions of a discrete-time system and the Leontief price-model", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400009"}
