We present a heuristic analysis of the algorithm which indicates that the DLP in degree 0 class groups of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus 3 can be solved in an expected time of (O) over tilde (q). This heuristic result relies on one heuristic assumption which is studied experimentally. We also present experimental data which show that a variant of the algorithm is faster than the Rho method even for small group sizes, and we address practical limitations of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Index calculus in class groups of non-hyperelliptic curves of genus three", "paper_id": "WOS:000258960700005"}
