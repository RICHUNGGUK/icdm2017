We show how probability densities, being functions, can be represented and reasoned with naturally and directly in higher-order logic, an expressive formalism not unlike the (informal) everyday language of mathematics. We give efficient inference algorithms and illustrate the general approach with a diverse collection of applications. Some learning issues are also considered.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic modelling, inference and learning using logical theories", "paper_id": "WOS:000267660900006"}
