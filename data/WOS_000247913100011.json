After several years of studying various immersive applications and immersidata sets, the authors developed An Immersidata Management System, a framework consisting of four connected modules. AIMS treats immersidata as several multidimensional sensor data streams and addresses the challenges involved in its acquisition, storage, query, and analysis.", "paper_title": "Immersidata analysis: Four case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000247913100011"}
