Aging directly affects those physiological and behavioral traits which are characterized in biometric measurements, and a practical biometric system must be designed to account for age-induced changes. However, age can also have very positive implications, for example as a source of further identification information. This paper reviews research to understand how age factors impinge on biometric systems and uses this to synthesize a system infrastructure to unify implementation principles. We present new results to show how multiagent structures can provide an effective framework for this purpose, enhancing performance in both identification and predictive scenarios.", "paper_title": "Selective Review and Analysis of Aging Effects in Biometric System Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000354532400002"}
