The minimization of the time spent in this journey is a common objective for this problem. This paper provides a comprehensive presentation of this problem emphasizing its practical aspects. We develop a general mixed integer programming formulation that addresses the common case of incomplete hub network where the volume between two hubs is not large enough to justify the use of a dedicated transport. The developed model is illustrated through a real-world case. The obtained solution includes a decrease in the average time spent by the parcels (from pickup to delivery) by 19% in comparison to the existing practiced parcel schedule.", "paper_title": "Parcel Distribution Timetabling Problem with Incomplete Hub Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000364790100002"}
