These efforts have been developed in different communities with a wide range of different applications in mind. In this paper we review the theory and applications of these approaches and discuss their strengths and weaknesses. We conclude the paper with a discussion of issues to consider when using these methods in computational experiments, and suggest directions for future research.", "paper_title": "Statistical optimum estimation techniques for combinatorial optimization problems: a review and critique", "paper_id": "WOS:000339822100004"}
