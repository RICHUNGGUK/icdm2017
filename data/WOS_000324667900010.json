In this article, we present an approach allowing a hardware/software codesign of applications in which implementation can be chosen at run time depending on available resources. We propose a platform supporting this flow and describe its different implementations used to prove the feasibility of our approach. This platform allows the underlying hardware to be virtualized in order to have a generic architecture that can be used to run applications. Partial dynamic reconfiguration is used over Xilinx Virtex 5 boards to enhance reconfiguration capabilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
