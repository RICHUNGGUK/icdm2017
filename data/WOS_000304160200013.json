In this paper, we propose a novel method, which is by combining learning vector quantization (LVQ) technique and SVM classifier, to improve annotation accuracy and speed. Affinity propagation algorithm-based LVQ technique is used to optimize the training set, and a few number of optimized representative feature vectors are used to train SVM. This approach not only meets the small sample size characteristic of SVM, but also greatly accelerates the training and annotating process. Comparative experimental studies confirm the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Combining LVQ with SVM technique for image semantic annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160200013"}
