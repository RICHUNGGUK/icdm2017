House of quality (HOQ) is used to translate customer requirements (CRs) into eachstage of a product development in QFD. In the conventional QFD model, constant coefficients are employed to present the relationships between \"What matrix\" and \"How matrix\" and among \"How matrixes\". In order to break the hindrance of the representation of simple linear function in the structure of HOQ, an integrative approach considering Kano model into QFD planning are employed, and processes are performed in uncertain and vague environments. Therefore, a fuzzy multi-objective model (FMOQFD-Kano) is proposed to reconcile the tradeoff between customer satisfaction and cost. Not only customer satisfaction is taken into account, but also cost is considered in the proposed model. Moreover, a fuzzy solution approach is applied to solve the model for preferred solutions under different alpha levels, which can give decision-maker more choices to cater for uncertain environment. An example is presented to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A FUZZY MULTI-OBJECTIVE MODEL OF QFD PRODUCT PLANNING INTEGRATING KANO MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000262087000002"}
