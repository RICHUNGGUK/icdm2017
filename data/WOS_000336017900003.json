People now face the problem of storing them compactly while supporting fast pattern searching. One compression scheme called relative Lempel-Ziv compression uses textual substitutions from a reference text to represent each string in S as a concatenation of substrings from a reference string R. This basic scheme gives a good compression ratio when every string in S is similar to R, but does not provide any pattern searching functionality. Here, we describe a new data structure based on relative Lempel-Ziv compression that is space-efficient and also supports fast pattern searching. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
