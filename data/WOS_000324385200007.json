With the frequency domain analysis of subpixel-based downsampling, we discover special characteristics of the luma-chroma color transform choice for monochrome images. With these, we model the anti-aliasing filter design for subpixel-based monochrome image downsampling as a human visual system-based optimization problem with a two-term cost function and obtain a closed-form solution. One cost term measures the luminance distortion and the other term measures the chrominance aliasing in our chosen luma-chroma space. Simulation results suggest that the proposed method can achieve sharper down-sampled gray/font images compared with conventional pixel and subpixel-based methods, without noticeable color fringing artifacts.", "paper_title": "Luma-Chroma Space Filter Design for Subpixel-Based Monochrome Image Downsampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000324385200007"}
