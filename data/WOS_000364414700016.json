Although their efficacy was investigated numerically in many works, their theoretical ground is not investigated sufficiently, since we do not have a theoretical framework to evaluate them. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for evaluating kernel regressors with multiple kernels. On the basis of the framework, we analyze the generalization errors of the ensemble kernel regressor and the multiple kernel regressor, and give a sufficient condition for the ensemble kernel regressor to outperform the multiple kernel regressor in terms of the generalization error in noise-free case. We also show that each kernel regressor can be better than the other without the sufficient condition by giving examples, which supports the importance of the sufficient condition.", "paper_title": "Ensemble and Multiple Kernel Regressors: Which Is Better?", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414700016"}
