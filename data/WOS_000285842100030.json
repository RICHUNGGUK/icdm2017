Based on this condition, we propose several alternative definitions of generic network codes, which give interpretations of such codes from different perspectives. We also present a unified framework for specifying and constructing different classes of linear network codes. Finally, using the insight obtained from the unified framework, we show that the proofs of some existing results regarding generic network codes can be greatly simplified.", "paper_title": "A Unified Framework for Linear Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100030"}
