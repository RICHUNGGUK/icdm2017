The Kolmogorov structure function divides the smallest program producing a string in two parts: the useful information present in the string, called sophistication if based on total functions, and the remaining accidental information. We formalize a connection between sophistication (due to Koppel) and a variation of computational depth (intuitively the useful or nonrandom information in a string), prove the existence of strings with maximum sophistication and show that they are the deepest of all strings.", "paper_title": "Sophistication Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000265566300008"}
