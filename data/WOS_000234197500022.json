Reducing flicker of a sequence improves its visual quality and can be an essential first treatment before ulterior manipulations. This paper presents an axiomatic analysis of the problem, which leads to a global and fast method of \"de-flicker,\" based on the scale-space theory. The stability of this process, called scale-time equalization, is ensured by the scale-time framework. Results on different sequences are given and show great visual improvement.", "paper_title": "Movie and video scale-time equalization application to flicker reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000234197500022"}
