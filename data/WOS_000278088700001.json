From the point of view of practice, the chaotic synchronization of hybrid state on complex networks was investigated in this paper. Compared with general synchronization method, a new error dynamic system was constructed. And the controller which is determined by the error of hybrid states and hybrid matrix was designed. The theoretical analysis and proof were given, as well as numerical simulations. The results indicate that our method is effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "CHAOTIC SYNCHRONIZATION OF HYBRID STATE ON COMPLEX NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088700001"}
