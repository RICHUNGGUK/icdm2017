Our infrastructure is based on a deep embedding of the Multiway Decision Graphs (MDGs) theory in HOL. MDGs generalize Reduced Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (ROBDDs) to represent and manipulate a subset of first-order logic formulae. The MDGs embedding is based on the logical formulation of an MDG as Directed Formulae (DF). Then, the MDGs operations are defined and the correctness proof of each operation is provided. The MDG reachability algorithm is then defined as a conversion that uses our MDG theory within HOL. Finally, a set of experimentations over benchmark circuits has been conducted to ensure the applicability and to measure the performance of our approach.", "paper_title": "An Abstract Reachability Approach by Combining HOL Induction and Multiway Decision Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000264619600010"}
