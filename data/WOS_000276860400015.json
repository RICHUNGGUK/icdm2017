The problem of sorting by block-interchanges is to find a minimum series of block-interchanges for sorting one chromosome into another. In this paper, we present an O(n + delta log delta) time algorithm for solving the problem of sorting by block-interchanges, which improves a previous algorithm of O(delta n) time proposed by Lin et al. (2005) [14], where n is the number of genes and delta is the minimum number of block-interchanges required to sort a chromosome. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
