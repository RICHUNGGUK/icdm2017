Paper pieces are spatially arranged by using an anisotropic L-p Poisson disk sampling. The shape of paper pieces is adaptively varied by changing the value of p. We demonstrate with experiments that edges and details in an input image are preserved by the pieces according to the anisotropy of their shape.", "paper_title": "Anisotropic Lp Poisson Disk Sampling for NPR Image with Adaptively Shaped Pieces", "paper_id": "WOS:000320013600019"}
