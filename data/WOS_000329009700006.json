Results show that strengthening effects are controlled by these factors and flexural strength would be overestimated if partial interaction is not properly addressed. A parametric study has been carried out and optimized values for these factors are proposed. This study reveals the influence of partial interaction to the overall performance and the proposed value for the two factors is of great significance in simplifying the design procedure of BSP beams.
