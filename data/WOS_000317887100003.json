Based on this fact, analyzing the properties of the system, which has unknown mathematical model, directly by using the measured data, has become feasible. In this paper, some data-based methods are proposed for state stability analysis of a class of nonlinear discrete-time systems. We also discuss the problem of finding the domain of attraction of the equilibrium point, using these data-based methods. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
