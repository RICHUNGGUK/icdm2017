This shared-use feature is crucial for analyzing interactive driving behaviors in future smart cities. The lab's novelty is two-fold: it outputs a semantically enriched graphical navigation network using free map data as input, and it includes a navigation segment agent that coordinates a multiagent traffic simulator. This simulator, which is based on the navigation network, supports the integration of user-controlled vehicles.", "paper_title": "Tokyo Virtual Living Lab Designing Smart Cities Based on the 3D Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000328945700005"}
