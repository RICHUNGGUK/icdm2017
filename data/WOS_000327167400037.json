In this paper a novel and robust method for recognition of complicated PRI Modulations is presented. This method uses specifications such as distribution related to members of sequences obtained from first and second order derivation of TOAs around a constant value and continuity of these sequences to recognize the PRI modulation. Some numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the effectiveness of proposed method. Simulation results show high robustness of proposed method against noise (spurious and missing pulses) and unwanted jitter.", "paper_title": "A Robust Method for Recognition of Complicated Pulse Repetition Interval Modulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400037"}
