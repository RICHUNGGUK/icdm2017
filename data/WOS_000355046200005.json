However, the relatively low stiffness of the robot can seriously affect its positioning accuracy and its machining quality. In this paper, a posture optimization method is presented, aiming at increasing the stiffness of the robot in machining applications. First, a performance index is proposed to evaluate the stiffness of the robot with a given posture after an in-depth study of the relationship between the translational displacement of the robot end effector and the force applied on it. The index is then demonstrated to be a frame invariant. By maximizing the index, a robot posture optimization model is further established and solved by a novel solution method based on the Jacobian matrix. Finally, experimental results achieved on a KUKA KR360-2 robot verify the correctness of the stiffness performance index, and the application of the posture optimization method in a robotic drilling system shows its effectiveness.
