This approach is perfectly valid when simulating on large study areas. However, the use of vector representation of space becomes more useful in small extensions since they represent land use covers in a more realistic way. In this regard, a new vector CA-based prototype is presented making use of cadastral parcels and cellular space is combined with graph theory to get a better operability. Neighbourhood factors are defined more flexibly since every parcel is different from the rest. Accessibility, suitability and zoning were computed and added to the prototype's transition rules. A little municipality within the Community of Madrid, one of the most dynamic spaces in terms of urban growth over the last decades, was selected to test the prototype. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
