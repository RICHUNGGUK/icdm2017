It was hypothesized that a similar relationship exists for integrated cognitive-motor tasks such as speech where the uncertainty with which actions are initiated may increase when the feedback loop is interrupted or dampened. To investigate this, the Lombard effect was exploited to explore the acoustic impact of background noise on speech during tasks increasing in automaticity. Fifteen healthy adults produced five speech tasks bearing different levels of automaticity (e.g., counting, reading, unprepared monologue) during habitual and altered auditory feedback conditions (Lombard effect). Data suggest that speech tasks relatively free of meaning or phonetic complexity are influenced to a lesser degree by a compromised auditory feedback than more complex paradigms (e.g., contemporaneous speech) on measures of timing. These findings inform understanding of the relative contribution speech task selection plays in measures of speech. Data also aid in understanding the relationship between task automaticity and altered speech production in neurological conditions where dual impairments of movement and cognition are observed (e.g., Huntington's disease, progressive aphasia).
