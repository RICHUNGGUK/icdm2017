DCAS systems are collaborative in that the beams from multiple radars are actively coordinated in a sense-and-respond manner to achieve greater sensitivity, precision and resolution than possible with a single radar. DCAS systems are adaptive in that the radars and their associated computing and communications infrastructure are dynamically reconfigured in response to changing weather conditions and end-user needs. This paper describes an end-to-end DCAS architecture and evaluates the performance of the system in an operational testbed with actual weather events and end-user considerations driving the system. Our results demonstrate how the architecture is capable of real-time data processing, optimisation of radar control and sensing of the atmosphere in a manner that maximises end-user utility.", "paper_title": "Closed-loop architecture for distributed collaborative adaptive sensing of the atmosphere: meteorological command and control", "paper_id": "WOS:000280104700002"}
