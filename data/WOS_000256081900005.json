Then with (gamma) over bar in an extension degree n field over this small field, we present a deterministic algorithm for computing the zeta function of the curve E (gamma) over bar by using Dwork deformation in rigid cohomology. The time complexity of the algorithm is O( n(2.667)) and it needs O(n(2.5)) bits of memory. A slight adaptation requires only O( n(2)) space, but costs time (O) over tilde( n(3)). An implementation of this last result turns out to be quite efficient for n big enough.", "paper_title": "Point counting in families of hyperelliptic curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000256081900005"}
