In this paper, a topology optimization procedure for maximum stiffness is applied to structural elements made of micropolar (Cosserat) solids. Some special problems are dealt with and particular attention is given to models that refer to structural interfaces. The results are in good agreement with the real behavior of some biological tissues.", "paper_title": "Optimal topologies for micropolar solids", "paper_id": "WOS:000242329000004"}
