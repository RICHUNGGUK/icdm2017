The combination of Cognitive radio (CR) and UWB provides a feasible method for this problem. But current cognitive ultra-wideband (C-UWB) is difficult to fulfill spectral mask and cannot be flexible to avoid the spectrum. In this paper, we apply Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to UWB pulse waveform design. We convert the waveform design problem into a constraint problem with multi-band chirp signals, and subsequently apply PSO intelligence algorithm to this optimization problem. Our waveform not only meets the FCC spectral mask, with 91.5% of spectrum utilization, but also avoids other licensed bands effectively. Simulation results show that our proposed C-UWB pulse waveform performs better than other conventional UWB pulse such as Gaussian pulses, orthogonal Hermite pulses, B-spline pulses, in terms of spectrum efficiency.", "paper_title": "Cognitive UWB Pulse Waveform Design Based on Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000309894300010"}
