It aims to extend the availability, personalization and friendliness of the meteorological information by means of a reusable easy-to-use friendly oral natural language interface. This interface takes advantage of the improvements in speech processing, dialogue handling and the great growth of mobile telephony. After the description of the functionalities of the system and its architecture, we present in detail the features of the dialogue manager. The main goals we have considered are: to provide the right information and to design a friendly interface.", "paper_title": "Architecture and dialogue design for a voice operated information system", "paper_id": "WOS:000236963200007"}
