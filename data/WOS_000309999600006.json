However, the number and diversity of terms developed in linguistics, psychology, and the behavioural sciences may seem confusing for scholars who are not versed in the subtleties of conceptual analysis and theoretical developments. Indeed, different disciplines sometimes use the same term to mean different things or, conversely, use different terms to mean the same thing. The goals of this article are to present an overview of the different concepts developed in the various disciplines that studied animal and human communication, and to understand the differences and commonalities between concepts emerging from these disciplines. We conclude that such an understanding will greatly improve the efficiency of pluridisciplinary research projects, for the advancement of SSP requires that we look at the complexity of communication from different angles.", "paper_title": "Conceptual analysis of social signals: the importance of clarifying terminology", "paper_id": "WOS:000309999600006"}
