Given that a simple link failure or a node failure on the physical topology can cause a significant loss of information, an important challenge is to make the routing of the virtual topology on to the physical topology survivable. This problem is known as survivable virtual topology mapping (SVTM) and is known to be an NP-complete problem. So far, this problem has been optimally solved for small instances by the application of integer linear programming and has been sub-optimally solved for more realistic instances by heuristic strategies such as ant colony optimization and genetic algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the application of differential evolution (DE) to solve the SVTM problem and enhancements based on DE are proposed as well. Three algorithms based on DE are developed. The enhanced variants have better convergence rate, get better quality of solutions and require few control parameters. We present the impact of these parameters on the system's performance improvement. Algorithms are evaluated in different test bench optical networks, as NSFnet and USA, demonstrating that the enhanced DE algorithm overcomes the other two, for small instances. The three algorithms reach a 100 survivable mapping for small instances. The three algorithms also find positive survivable mappings and reduce the network wavelength links. Results show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Survivable virtual topology mapping in IP-over-WDM networks using differential evolution optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000344002500012"}
