In this paper we present a possible extension of this theory to interval-valued fuzzy set theory. We introduce the cardinality of interval-valued fuzzy sets as a mapping from the set of interval-valued fuzzy sets with finite support to the set of closed subintervals of [0, +infinity[. We study some properties of these cardinalities using t-norms, t-conorms and negations on the lattice El (the underlying lattice of interval-valued fuzzy set theory). In particular, the valuation property, the subadditivity property, the complementarity rule and the cartesian product rule will be discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
