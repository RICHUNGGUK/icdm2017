In order to make the appraisal scientifically, we need an index system and a evaluation model. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, an index system for evaluation of the scientific and technical strength of provincial region has been presented with grey system theory and Delphi Method. A new evaluation model based on trigonal whitenization. weight function is formulated. A positive study with evaluation of the scientific and technical strength of Jiangsu Province is conducted. Findings - It is concluded from the positive study that the scientific and technical strength of Jiangsu Province comes out top in China. Research limitations/implications - But there are some sticking points that interfere with the scientific and technical strength of Jiangsu Province, such as its shortage of talented person and capital, etc. should be addressed. Practical implications - It will be helpful to China and other countries. Originality/value - Application of new evaluation methodology.", "paper_title": "On index system and mathematical model for evaluation of scientific and technical strength", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500030"}
