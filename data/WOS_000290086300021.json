In grid computing environments, it should be guaranteed that efficient and secure authenticated broadcasting technologies have been applied for users and servers. In addition, it should be ensured that resources and data are not provided by an attacker. The main purpose of a broadcasting cryptosystem is to establish a secure communication channel from a sender to a group of legal receivers. Recently, several broadcasting cryptosystems have been proposed based upon various cryptographic techniques. However, many researchers pointed out the several security weaknesses in the many previously proposed broadcasting cryptosystems. This paper proposes a new secure broadcasting cryptosystem that can withstand various security attacks and is applicable to grid computing environment. As a result, the proposed broadcasting cryptosystem not only has advantages of the broadcasting cryptosystem, but also is more secure and practical compared with previous related broadcasting cryptosystems.
