We propose 'p-stable', a distributed Multi-phase Maximum Weighted Matching algorithm. We also apply channel bundles to effectively improve stability in the network, and prove the problem NP-hard. The time complexity is O(Delta(3) + (log* n)(2)), and overhead complexity is O(Delta x (Delta + n) + n(alpha) + log n), with Delta denoting maximum number of node degree in an n nodes network. Simulation results show that p-stable design effectively improves network stability, especially upon the existence of large number of unreliable channels.", "paper_title": "On the channel usability of Wireless Mesh Networks: when stability plays with you", "paper_id": "WOS:000294885800007"}
