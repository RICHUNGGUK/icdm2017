This assumption, however, may not hold in many practical face recognition systems as different types of misclassification could lead to different losses. Motivated by this concern, this paper proposes a cost-sensitive subspace analysis approach for face recognition. Our approach uses a cost matrix specifying different costs corresponding to different types of misclassifications, into two popular and widely used discriminative subspace analysis methods and devises the cost-sensitive linear discriminant analysis (CSLDA) and cost-sensitive marginal fisher analysis (CSMFA) methods, to achieve a minimum overall recognition loss by performing recognition in these learned low-dimensional subspaces. To better exploit the complementary information from multiple features for improved face recognition, we further propose a multiview cost-sensitive subspace analysis approach by seeking a common feature subspace to fuse multiple face features to improve the recognition performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Cost-Sensitive Subspace Analysis and Extensions for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000318597400008"}
