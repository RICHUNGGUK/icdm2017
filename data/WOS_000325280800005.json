We generalize this result to the context of frames and bases. In particular, we show that the only effective sequences which are Riesz bases are orthonormal bases. Moreover, we consider the infinite system of linear algebraic equations Ax = b and characterize the (bounded) matrices A for which the Kaczmarz algorithm always converges to a solution.", "paper_title": "KACZMARZ ALGORITHM AND FRAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000325280800005"}
