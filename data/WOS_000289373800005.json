In 20, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a feasible polygon of size N and give an algorithm to construct one, if it exists. When AT is not known, we give an algorithm to find the maximum and minimum sizes of a feasible polygon. In 3D, when the directions are covered by a single plane we show that a feasible polyhedron can be constructed from a feasible polygon. We also give an algorithm to construct a feasible polyhedron when the directions are covered by two planes. Finally, we show that the problem becomes NP-hard when the directions are covered by three or more planes.", "paper_title": "RECONSTRUCTING CONVEX POLYGONS AND CONVEX POLYHEDRA FROM EDGE AND FACE COUNTS IN ORTHOGONAL PROJECTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289373800005"}
