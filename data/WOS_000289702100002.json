In this paper we investigate a cost efficient camera sensor deployment strategy based on random deployment of homogeneous sensors to monitor and/or surveillance a region of interest. We assume that there are costs associated with the sensors as well as with the deployments and our goal is to minimize the total cost while satisfying the desired coverage requirement. We consider two cases which assume the sensing field is obstacle free or with obstacles, and we develop analytical methods to derive the expected coverage of a single sensor as well as the joint coverage for a given number of homogenous camera sensors. Following this we propose an adaptive sensor deployment strategy, which deploys different number of sensors in each iteration, based on our analytical method. We then evaluate the expected cost of our deployment strategy by deriving expressions for the number of deployments and the number of sensors deployed during each deployment as a function of the probability distributions of joint coverage by sensors. We carry out simulation studies to validate the analytical results. Simulation studies are also used to demonstrate that our deployment strategy leads to near optimal values of sensors and deployments and hence achieves the overall low cost. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
