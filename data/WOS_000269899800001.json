Scaling of CMOS logic technology from 32 to 22 nm node meets more critical issues and needs some significant changes of the technology, as well as integration of the advanced processes. This paper will review the key processing technologies which can be potentially integrated into 22 nm and beyond technology nodes, including double patterning technology with high NA water immersion lithography and EUV lithography, new device architectures, high K/metal gate (HK/MG) stack and integration technology, mobility enhancement technologies, source/drain engineering and advanced copper interconnect technology with ultra-low-k process.", "paper_title": "Challenges of 22 nm and beyond CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000269899800001"}
