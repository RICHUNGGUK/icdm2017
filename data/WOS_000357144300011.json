In both procedures, optimal relaxation parameters are computed (speeding up the convergence of the iterative coupling) and non-matching discretizations at common interfaces are allowed (enabling more versatile adaptive approaches). A single unified iterative loop is considered in order to deal with all the focused iterative solutions simultaneously (i.e., nonlinear analysis, adaptive analysis and coupling analysis), rendering a very efficient methodology. At the end of the paper, numerical results are presented, illustrating the good performance of the proposed technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
