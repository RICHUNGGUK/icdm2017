The approach uses the scale normalized Laplacian operator to extract the interest points in the incomplete image pyramid. A new local descriptor is presented in the approach to compute the feature vector of each interest point. The descriptor is made up with several subregions like the SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) descriptor, meanwhile, it chooses the mean values of different color components in each subregion as the feature vector's elements to differentiate color objects better and reduce the descriptor's dimension. Through the experiment, the detected interest points are robust to many image transformations and the approach is indicative of needing less computation than other interest point detecting algorithms. The research discloses that the approach can obtain both superior stability and real-time performance at the same time.", "paper_title": "A quick scale-invariant interest point detecting approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000276149200013"}
