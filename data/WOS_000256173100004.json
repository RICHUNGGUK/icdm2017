We present proof of the abundance of Concept Lattices as proposed in Formal Concept Analysis both in the theory of frames and in its present-day incarnation, the FrameNet resource, by constructing several types of these. We further argue for the adequacy of such lattices in representing linguistic data with contributions that range from data-visualization to the fine-tuning of some frame-theoretical concepts. We argue finally that FrameNet is better thought of as being a lexical resource rather than an ontology, but we make the case throughout the article for Concept Lattices being a linguistically adequate, formally effective intermediate representations from which knowledge representation languages may draw knowledge-rich, linguistic facts from FrameNet at their convenience.", "paper_title": "Extracting frame-semantics knowledge using lattice theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000256173100004"}
