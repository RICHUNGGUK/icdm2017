We then propose how to increase the capacity by improving the MAC protocol design and parameter setting. We also quantify the effectiveness of different approaches and derive the appropriate MAC protocol parameters such as the duration of contention period and contention free period in a superframe. Simulation results are given to demonstrate the accuracy of the analysis. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
