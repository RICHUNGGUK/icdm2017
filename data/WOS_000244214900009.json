An induced-path partition of a graph is a collection of vertex-disjoint induced paths that cover all vertices of the graph. The induced-path-partition problem is to determine the minimum cardinality of an induced-path partition of a graph. This paper presents an O(vertical bar V vertical bar+vertical bar E vertical bar)-time algorithm for the induced-path-partition problem on graphs whose blocks are complete graphs, cycles or complete bipartite graphs.
