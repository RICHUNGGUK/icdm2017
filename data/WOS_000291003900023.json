Without the need of channel estimation, it directly generates the a posteriori probabilities (APPs) of data symbols by very efficient computation. With the increase of iterations, the proposed algorithm gradually achieves near-optimal performance, while its complexity is only linear in the number of subcarriers.", "paper_title": "Iterative Soft Joint Detection Algorithm for OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900023"}
