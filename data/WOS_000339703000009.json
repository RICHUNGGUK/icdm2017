K nearest neighbors classifier is used. The technique is language independent. It has been applied to four document collections in English, Chinese and Serbian: Reuters-21578 newswire articles, 20-Newsgroups, Tancorp and Ebart. The evaluation was done by using the micro- and macro-averaged F-1 function. The results obtained confirm that the presented technique, although very simple, in the case of Tancorp and 20-Newsgroups corpora achieves better results than other n-gram based techniques. As compared to other state-of-the-art methods, it performs better than \"bag-of-words\" K nearest neighbors classifier and in the case of 20-Newsgroups corpus it works even better than \"bag-of-words\" Support vector machines classifier. It can be successfully used in a variety of related problems.", "paper_title": "A variant of n-gram based language-independent text categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000339703000009"}
