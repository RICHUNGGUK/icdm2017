Our approach does not require any prior knowledge about the geometry of a face and can produce faithful geometric models of any star-shaped object. We use a cylindrical representation, which enables us to efficiently process the 3-D mesh by applying 2-D filters. We use the first frame as a reference and incrementally build the model by registering each subsequent cloud of 3-D points to the reference using the ICP (Iterative Closest Point) algorithm implemented on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit). The registered point clouds are merged into a single image through a cylindrical representation. The noise from the sensor and from the pose estimation error is removed with a temporal integration and a spatial smoothing of the successively incremented model. To validate our approach, we quantitatively compare our model to laser scans, and show comparable accuracy.(1) (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
