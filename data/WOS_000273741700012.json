Insights into the routes for drug resistance in these pathogens are critical for developing more effective antibacterial drugs. A systems-level analysis of the genes, proteins, and interactions involved is an important step to gaining such insights. This paper discusses some of the computational challenges that must be surmounted to enable such an analysis; viz., unreliability of bacterial interactome maps, paucity of bacterial interactome maps, and identification of pathways to bacterial drug resistance.", "paper_title": "Protein Interactome Analysis for Countering Pathogen Drug Resistance", "paper_id": "WOS:000273741700012"}
