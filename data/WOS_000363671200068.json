In this paper, we present Magic Decorator, a system that automatically generates material suggestions for 3D indoor scenes. To achieve this goal, we introduce local material rules, which describe typical material patterns for a small group of objects or parts, and global aesthetic rules, which account for the harmony among the entire set of colors in a specific scene. Both rules are obtained from collections of indoor scene images. We cast the problem of material suggestion as a combinatorial optimization considering both local material and global aesthetic rules. We have tested our system on various complex indoor scenes. A user study indicates that our system can automatically and efficiently produce a series of visually plausible material suggestions which are comparable to those produced by artists.", "paper_title": "Magic Decorator: Automatic Material Suggestion for Indoor Digital Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200068"}
