Both diagnostic methods confirm one another. But sometimes there are more expressive changes in one method than in another, e.g during HV it is a more prominent deoxyhemoglobin (CO2Hb) increase than an alpha frequency band increase in EEG curves. On the other side, very marked alpha frequency decreasing in EEC during eyes open is followed by only a weak oxyhemoglobin (O2Hb) rise Synchronous activities are clearly visible during psychic test: increasing O2Hb in NIRS and increasing delta frequency band in EEC spectrum. Decreasing alpha with increasing theta activity during relaxation and somnolence is accompanied by decreasing O2Hb and prominent increasing CO2Hb. Inter individually differences are often but not big. We suggest both methods are good tools for attention and psychic states control.", "paper_title": "SIMULTANEOUS RECORDING OF ELECTRIC AND METABOLIC BRAIN ACTIVITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000281702900008"}
