By simply positing into the cloud, it gains fast access to business applications or infrastructure resources with reduced Capital Expenditures (CAPEX). Dramatic increase in amount of information's are placed into the cloud by individuals and industries, security issues are vital concern in mobile computing (MCC) and impends fast deployment of applications on the cloud. This work discus the different security issues that arises about how safe the mobile cloud computing environment is and provides a unified reliable security mechanism. There are two different types of the cloud users are: On-demand and Optimistic. On-demand is a non-preemptible for flexible leases given a user accessing to the resources within an interactive time of making the request and makes the resources available for an agreed-upon period of time, user can deploy any virtual machine (VM) compatible with the system. Optimistic is preemptible and pre-set contract gives a user access to resources at an indeterminate time and make resources available to the user for an insufficient amount of time. After that, this resources are initially (pre)-defined for the user by the cloud admin, that is the user cannot provide his or her own virtual machine (VM) based on defined access control for security.", "paper_title": "Securing Mobile Cloud Environment with Unified Reliable Encryption Algorithm, Security Key and Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000366969200016"}
