The main contributions of our WLTSVM are: (1) a graph based under-sampling strategy is introduced to keep the proximity information, which is robustness to outliers, (2) the weight biases are embedded in the Lagrangian TWSVM formulations, which overcomes the bias phenomenon in the original TWSVM for the imbalanced data classification, (3) the convergence of the training procedure of Lagrangian functions is proven and (4) it is tested and compared with some other TWSVMs on synthetic and real datasets to show its feasibility and efficiency for the imbalanced data classification.
