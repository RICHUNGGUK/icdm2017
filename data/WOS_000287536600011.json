For the analyses, the sacrum, coxal bone, and the cancellous and cortical bones of a femur are modelled using finite elements based on X-ray computed tomographic images taken from a 27-year-old woman. From the results, it is found that a collar with perfect calcar contact prevents stem subsidence and decreases the proximal-lateral gap and the lateral stem tilting. Therefore, it can impart reasonable biomechanical stability for total hip arthroplasty. However, its low load transmission ability and increased stem tilting effect due to the imperfect contact between the collar and the calcar are found to be serious problems that need to be solved. Results of clinical follow-up are presented for supporting the computational results.", "paper_title": "The biomechanical effect of the collar of a femoral stem on total hip arthroplasty", "paper_id": "WOS:000287536600011"}
