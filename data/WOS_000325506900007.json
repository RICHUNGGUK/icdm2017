A product incidence matrix A = CCT or (A) over tilde = C-T C is defined and used to further improve the relations among PNs, linear inequalities and matrix analysis. Thus, based on Cramer's Rule, a new approach for the study of the solution of a linear system is given in terms of certain sub-determinants of the coefficient matrix and an efficient algorithm is proposed to compute these sub-determinants. The paper extends the common necessary and/or sufficient conditions for conservativeness and consistency in previous papers and some examples are designed to explain the conclusions finally.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF PETRI NETS BASED ON PRODUCT INCIDENCE MATRIX", "paper_id": "WOS:000325506900007"}
