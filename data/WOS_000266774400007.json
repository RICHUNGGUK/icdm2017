Since this type of problem is solved so frequently, it is important to craft an approach that is as efficient as possible. Based upon past research, it is generally accepted that several efficient implementations of the Dijkstra algorithm are the fastest at optimally solving the 'one-to-one' shortest path problem (Cherkassky et al. 1996). We show that the most efficient state-of-the-art implementations of Dijkstra can be improved by taking advantage of network properties associated with GIS-sourced data. The results of this paper, derived from tests of different algorithmic approaches on real road networks, will be extremely valuable for application developers and researchers in the GIS community.", "paper_title": "Finding shortest paths on real road networks: the case for A*", "paper_id": "WOS:000266774400007"}
