During the last decade the so-called data-driven models are becoming more and more common. These models rely upon the methods of computational intelligence and machine learning, and thus assume the presence of a considerable amount of data describing the modelled system's physics (i.e. hydraulic and/or hydrologic phenomena). This paper is a preface to the special issue on Data Driven Modelling and Evolutionary Optimization for River Basin Management, and presents a brief overview of the most popular techniques and some of the experiences of the authors in data-driven modelling relevant to river basin management. it also identifies the current trends and common pitfalls, provides some examples of successful applications and mentions the research challenges.", "paper_title": "Data-driven modelling: some past experiences and new approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000252671400002"}
