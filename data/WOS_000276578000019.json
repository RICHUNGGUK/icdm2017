Thus, how to design a practical and reliable payment system becomes a significant issue. However, most payment systems, including electronic credit card, electronic cash and electronic check, have the deadlock problem on transactions. To solve this problem, the previous payment systems focus on the way of transacting synchronously online. Nevertheless, this solution is not efficient. In this paper, we Propose an efficient payment system by using electronic bill of lading. Compared with other payment systems, the proposed scheme can solve the deadlock problem without synchronized transaction online. In addition, this scheme is constructed with simplicity, only using several hash functions and one modular-exponentiation computation, which makes it efficient and practical. Moreover, the proposed scheme provides a new method of payment in e-commerce.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT PAYMENT SCHEME BY USING ELECTRONIC BILL OF LADING", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000019"}
