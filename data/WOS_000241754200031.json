This includes offering an online knowledge base of all-embracing case studies, structured according to the Zachman framework. Supported by collaborative group-ware, students not only get the opportunity to consult and compare solutions for the case studies, but also actively discuss and contribute to alternative solutions. In this Problem Based Learning (PBL)-context, students are able to influence and understand the development of a certain process through interactive computerized animations and demos.", "paper_title": "Knowledge integration in information systems education through an (Inter)active platform of analysis and modelling case studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000241754200031"}
