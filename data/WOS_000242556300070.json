The algorithm combines a multi-parent crossover operator with the complete local search. The multi-parent crossover operator can enables individual to draw closet to each optimal solution,thus the population will be divided into subpopulations automatically, meanwhile, the local search is adopted to enable individual to converge to the nearest optimal solution which belongs to the same attractor. By this way, each individuals can converge to a global optima, then the population can maintain all global optima. Comparing with other algorithms, it has the following advantages.(1) The algorithm is very simple with little computation complexity.(2) Proposed algorithm needs no additional control parameter which depends on a special problem. The experiment results show that PCEA is very efficient for the optimization of multimodal functions, usually it can obtain all the global optimal solutions by running once of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Population climbing evolutionary algorithm for multimodal function global optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300070"}
