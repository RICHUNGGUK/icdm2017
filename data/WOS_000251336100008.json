These properties ensure certain simple form for the measurements involved in realizing an unambiguous unitary quantum channel. Error correction and unambiguous error correction with nonzero probability are discussed in terms of unambiguous unitary quantum channels. We not only re-derive the well-known condition for a set of errors to be correctable with certainty, but also obtain a necessary and su cient condition for the errors caused by a noisy channel to be correctable with any nonzero probability. Dense coding with a partially entangled state can also be viewed as an unambiguous unitary quantum channel when all messages are required to be transmitted with equal probability of success, the maximal achievable probability of success is derived and the optimum protocol is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Unambiguous unitary quantum channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000251336100008"}
