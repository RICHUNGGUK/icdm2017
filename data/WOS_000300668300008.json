The delays are time-varying, and the uncertainties are norm-bounded that enter into all the parameters of network and control. The aim of this paper is not only to establish easily verifiable conditions under which the pinning synchronous solution of stochastic neural network is globally asymptotically stable but also to give a feasible way to offset the limitation of network itself in order to reach synchronization. In addition, a specific neurobiological network is also introduced, and some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed criteria.", "paper_title": "Pinning a stochastic neural network to the synchronous state", "paper_id": "WOS:000300668300008"}
