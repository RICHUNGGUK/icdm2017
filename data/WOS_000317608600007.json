Encryption and watermarking are two complementary techniques that are used for safeguarding multimedia data like audio, video and images. These methods serve two different purposes; encryption helps in making the media unintelligible, while watermarking helps in providing copyright information in it. In this paper a combination of both encryption and watermarking is incorporated on audio files with this aim in view. Discrete Wavelet Transformation (DWT) is performed on audio files up to third level which gives rise to a binary tree like structure. The areas for watermark embedding and encryption are selected among the wavelet coefficients in the leaf nodes of the tree. Detailed experimentation is carried out with analysis of SNR values, that leads to the determination of degree of degradation of the audio quality after encryption. Such controlled degradation can be used for safe distribution of audio contents over public networks, whereby only the authorized users can have access to the high quality contents, while other users can only access a lower quality version.", "paper_title": "Partial encryption and watermarking scheme for audio files with controlled degradation of quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000317608600007"}
