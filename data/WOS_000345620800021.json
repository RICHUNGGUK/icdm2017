In this process, a computable number of consumers and the services that they can select are not difficult to handle. However, when there is a large consumer base and the services that the consumers can select have multiple shared and distinct characteristics, measurement and segmentation in polynomial time are extremely difficult. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a biologically systematic computational method that would be appropriate for the segmentation of consumer and service characteristics. We also demonstrate the application of this biologically systematic computational method to a services marketing problem model.", "paper_title": "Consumer and Service Characteristic Segmentations in Services Marketing Using a Biologically Systematic Computational Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000345620800021"}
