The soundness of the typing system is reduced to that of a well known typing system with intersection types for the ordinary lambda-calculus. The completeness of the typing system is obtained from subject expansion at root position. Next we use our result to analyze the characterisation of strong normalisability for three classes of intuitionistic terms: ordinary lambda-terms, Lambda J-terms (lambda-terms with generalised application), and lambda x-terms (lambda-terms with explicit substitution). We explain via our system why the type systems in the natural deduction format for Lambda J and lambda x known from the literature contain extra, exceptional rules for typing generalised application or substitution; and we show a new characterisation of the beta-strongly normalising lambda-terms, as a corollary to a PSN-result, relating the lambda-calculus and the intuitionistic sequent calculus. Finally, we obtain variants of our characterisation by restricting the set of assignable types to sub-classes of intersection types, notably strict types. In addition, the known characterisation of the beta-strongly normalising lambda-terms in terms of assignment of strict types follows as an easy corollary of our results.", "paper_title": "Characterising Strongly Normalising Intuitionistic Terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000312724500004"}
