It is shown that global fuzzy stabilizers can be constructed in a nonconservative way by means of a relatively simple approach. The existence of such controllers depends on the fuzzy controllability conditions, which are derived in a straightforward way. The main advantage of the proposed approach is that the convergence of the closedloop system can be imposed arbitrarily. Some examples are given in order to illustrate the validity of the method. Finally, the proposed controller is applied on an underactuated system known as \"pendubot\" and the results are compared with an stabilizer designed on the basis of LMIs.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the Fuzzy Controllability Property and Stabilization for a Class of T-S Fuzzy Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000352279600004"}
