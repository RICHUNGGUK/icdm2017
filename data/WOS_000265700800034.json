It fuses an enhanced gray level image and an illumination-invariant geometric image at the feature-level. To further improve the recognition performance under large variations in attributions such as poses and expressions, discriminant features are extracted from source images using the wavelet transform-based method. Features are adaptively fused to reconstruct the final face sample. Then FLD is used to generate a supervised discriminant space for the classification task. Experiments show that the bimodal method outperforms conventional methods under complex conditions.", "paper_title": "An Illumination Invariant Bimodal Method Employing Discriminant Features for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000265700800034"}
