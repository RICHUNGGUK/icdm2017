In 2004, Yang and Yeh evaluated H(G,x) for certain graphs of chemical interest, and posted an open problem for evaluating the Hosoya polynomial of the circumcoronene C-r of order r. In this paper, we solve this problem and give analytical expressions associated with r. The topological indices-Wiener index and hyper-Wiener index of C-r can also be obtained from H (C-r, x) through this work.", "paper_title": "Hosoya Polynomials of Circumcoronene Series", "paper_id": "WOS:000324154300018"}
