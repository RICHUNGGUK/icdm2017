Given an irregular mesh sequence, we construct a semi-regular mesh structure for the first frame and then map it to subsequent frames based on the hierarchical motion estimation. The regular structure of the resulting mesh sequence facilitates the application of advanced coding schemes and other signal processing techniques. To encode the mesh sequence compactly, we develop an embedded coding scheme, which supports signal-to-noise ratio and temporal scalability modes. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides significantly better compression performance than the static mesh coder, which encodes each frame independently.", "paper_title": "Semi-regular representation and progressive compression of 3-D dynamic mesh sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800007"}
