In this paper, the fuzzy rule based system (FARSJUM) is introduced for especially sparse hierarchical problems to make decisions similar to AHP. The system is previously developed by the authors in sparse judgment matrices and in this paper an enhancement of the system in sparse hierarchical problems is brought. Numerical example is brought to show the applicability of the method and its advantages.", "paper_title": "Applying FARSJUM intelligent system to derive priorities in sparse hierarchical problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329975000008"}
