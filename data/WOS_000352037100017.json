The so-called most regular binary sequences (MRBSs) are used to allocate the limited network channels. To further reduce unnecessary transmissions, an event-triggered transmitter is introduced at each plant. Under the hybrid event-time-triggered transmission strategy, a sufficient stability condition is derived for each plant. Then, a unified co-design framework is presented with which the scheduling functions (i.e., the MRBSs), the event-triggering condition and the controller gains can be determined simultaneously. The main results are established using piecewise Lyapunov functional method and average dwell time technique. The effectiveness of the co-design method is demonstrated by a numerical example.
