Most studies have focused on the emergence of Saussurean codes (i.e., codes characterized by an arbitrary one-to-one correspondence between meanings and signals). In this contribution, we argue that the standard evolutionary language game framework cannot explain the emergence of compositional codes-communication codes that preserve neighborhood relationships by mapping similar signals into similar meanings-even though use of those codes would result in a much higher payoff in the case that signals are noisy. We introduce an alternative evolutionary setting in which the meanings are assimilated sequentially and show that the gradual building of the meaning-signal mapping leads to the emergence of mappings with the desired compositional property.", "paper_title": "Evolving compositionality in evolutionary language games", "paper_id": "WOS:000251376600005"}
