The kinetic information indicates that the electron energy probability function (EEPF) evolves from a three-temperature distribution in RF atmospheric-pressure discharges into a Druyvesteyn type distribution as the driving frequency increases. In microwave helium microplasma, the power delivered to the electrons in the bulk increases, and as a result, the EEPF becomes closer to a Maxwellian distribution. Although the results obtained with fluid models that a Maxwellian energy distribution function are not capable of capturing nonlocal effects in high pressure discharge, the appropriate fluid models will be a good selection to investigate particular problems because of their short simulation time. In addition, since frequent ion-neutral collisions limit the energy acquired by the ions as they transit the sheath, the average ion energy near the electrodes is found to be significantly lowered at atmospheric pressure.
