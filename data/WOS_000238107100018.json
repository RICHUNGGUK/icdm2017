The system defines a \"double\" Client-Server structure which permits to incorporate new client systems in real-time using the Internet. We have used this distributed architecture system, to develop a tool to measure the computer performance characteristics of several computer architecture systems. The computer performance is tested by a free library called PAPI (Performance API), which allows us to access to internal status registers of several CPU families in several Operating Systems. As this testing has to be done in real CPUs, we have to create a new system to provide this functionality. The structure proposed has only one entry point to the whole system, the Master Server, and several different Architecture Client Servers. We present the network system description and the usage of PAPI for performance testing.", "paper_title": "Distributed architecture system for computer performance testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100018"}
