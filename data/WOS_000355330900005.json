This analysis method only requires the drawing of a controlling flow graph that is based on the circuit schematic diagram of active networks. Therefore, it is both straightforward and intuitive to use such an approach. First, second-order active RC networks are analyzed and designed by using this method. Additionally, state feedback circuits are designed based on linear system theory. Finally, the experiment results show that the pole assignment can be realized to meet the requirements of stability and dynamic performance, which were set out in the design of the state feedback.", "paper_title": "An Analysis and Design of the Structural Controllability of Active Networks Over F(z)", "paper_id": "WOS:000355330900005"}
