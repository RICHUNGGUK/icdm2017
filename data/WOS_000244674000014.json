For low voltage and high frequency operation, the number of internal nodes is minimized to avoid the generation of parasitic poles and the number of stacked transistors between VDD and GND is limited to two. The frequency response of the filter is automatically tuned by a simple self tuning circuit. The measured dynamic range of the filter is 47 dB while dissipating 5 mA.", "paper_title": "Low-voltage and high-frequency Gm-opamp-C filter with automatic self frequency tuning", "paper_id": "WOS:000244674000014"}
