We address the problem of assigning channels to communication links in the network with the objective of minimizing the overall network interference. Since the number of radios on any node can be less than the number of available channels, the channel assignment must obey the constraint that the number of different channels assigned to the links incident on any node is at most the number of radio interfaces on that node. The above optimization problem is known to be NP-hard. We design centralized and distributed algorithms for the above channel assignment problem. To evaluate the quality of the solutions obtained by our algorithms, we develop a semidefinite program and a linear program formulation of our optimization problem to obtain lower bounds on overall network interference. Empirical evaluations on randomly generated network graphs show that our algorithms perform close to the above established lower bounds, with the difference diminishing rapidly with increase in number of radios. Also, ns-2 simulations, as well as experimental studies on testbed, demonstrate the performance potential of our channel assignment algorithms in 802.11-based multiradio mesh networks.", "paper_title": "Minimum Interference Channel Assignment in Multiradio Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260130700005"}
