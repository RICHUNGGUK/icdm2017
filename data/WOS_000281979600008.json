Instead of traditional fuzzy entropy, which uses the probabilistic discrimination of attributes to obtain attribute weights, we utilize the IF entropy to assess objective weights based on the credibility of the input data. We examine various measures for IF entropy with respect to hesitation degree, probability, non-probability, and geometry to calculate the attribute weights. A comparative analysis of different measures to generate attribute rankings is illustrated with both computational experiments as well as analyses of Pearson correlations, Spearman rank correlations, contradiction rates, inversion rates, and consistency rates. The experimental results indicate that ranking the outcomes of attributes not only depends on the type of IF entropy measures but is also affected by the number of attributes and the number of alternatives.
