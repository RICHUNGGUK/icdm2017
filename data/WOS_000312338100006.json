The structural similarity of PBDE to some dioxin-like compounds suggested that they may share similar toxicological effects: they might activate the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) signal transduction pathway and thus might have adverse effects on wildlife and humans. In this study, in silico computational workflow combining molecular docking and three-dimensional quantitative structureactivity relationship (3D-QSAR) was performed to investigate the binding interactions between PBDEs and AhR and the structural features affecting the AhR binding affinity of PBDE. The molecular docking showed that hydrogen-bond and hydrophobic interactions were the major driving forces for the binding of ligands to AhR, and several key amino acid residues were also identified. The CoMSIA model was developed from the conformations obtained from molecular docking and exhibited satisfactory results as q 2 of 0.605 and r 2 of 0.996. Furthermore, the derived model had good robustness and statistical significance in both internal and external validations. The 3D contour maps generated from CoMSIA provided important structural features influence the binding affinity. The obtained results were beneficial to better understand the toxicological mechanism of PBDEs.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Ah receptor binding affinities of polybrominated diphenyl ethers via in silico molecular docking and 3D-QSAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000312338100006"}
