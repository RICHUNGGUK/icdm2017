Although it is able to provide better networking ability, the technical differentiation will make the management be more difficult. Especially when the security issues are considered, it is very necessary and important to develop some proper mechanisms for such a convergence environment. In this paper, we propose a secure authentication mechanism for third-generation telecommunication (3G) and wireless local area network integrated networks. The proposed scheme is developed based on TS 33.234 and improves the network security with radio frequency identification tags. The analysis shows that the proposed scheme not only provides more functions but also satisfies more secure considerations for authentication in 3G network and wireless local area network convergence environment.
