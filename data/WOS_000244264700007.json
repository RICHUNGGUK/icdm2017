The proposed IA employs two special mutation operators, hypermutation and hypermacromutation to allow effective searching, and an aging mechanism which is a new immune inspired operator that is devised to enforce diversity in the population during evolution. When cast as an optimization problem, the PSP can be seen as discovering a protein conformation with minimal energy. The proposed IA was tested on well-known PSP lattice models, the HP model in two-dimensional and three-dimensional square lattices', and the functional model protein, which is a more realistic biological model. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed IA is very competitive with the existing state-of-art algorithms for the PSP on lattice models.", "paper_title": "An immune algorithm for protein structure prediction on lattice models", "paper_id": "WOS:000244264700007"}
