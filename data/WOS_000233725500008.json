However, in the majority of published methods, little effort has been made to minimize classifier complexity. In view of the small number of samples available in most gene expression data sets, there is a strong motivation for minimizing the number of free parameters that must be fitted to the data. In this paper, a method is introduced for evolving (using an evolutionary algorithm) simple classifiers involving a minimal subset of the available genes. The classifiers obtained by this method perform well, reaching 97% correct classification of clinical outcome on training samples from the breast cancer data set published by van't Veer, and up to 89% correct classification on validation samples from the same data set, easily outperforming previously published results.", "paper_title": "Improving the prediction of the clinical outcome of breast cancer using evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000233725500008"}
