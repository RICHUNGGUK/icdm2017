PAUDA requires <80 CPU hours to analyze a dataset of 246 million Illumina DNA reads from permafrost soil for which a previous BLASTX analysis (on a subset of 176 million reads) reportedly required 800 000 CPU hours, leading to the same clustering of samples by functional profiles.", "paper_title": "A poor man's BLASTX-high-throughput metagenomic protein database search using PAUDA", "paper_id": "WOS:000329059700006"}
