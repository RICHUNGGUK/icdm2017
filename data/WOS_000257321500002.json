The clique-transversal number, denoted tau(C) (G), is the minimum cardinality of a clique-transversal set in G. In this paper we present an upper bound and a lower bound on tau(C) (G) for a connected cubic graph G and characterize the extremal cubic graphs achieving the lower bound. Also, we show that every connected claw-free cubic graph G is weakly 2-colorable, this implies that it has clique-transversal number at most one-half its order.", "paper_title": "Clique-transversal number in cubic graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257321500002"}
