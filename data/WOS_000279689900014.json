Pair-wise error probability (PEP) is an important factor for studying the reliability of a communication system. However, the existing scheme only gives the final result of PEP and the corresponding Chernoff upper bound (CUB) is obtained through magnification, which is not of universal significance for this kind of problems. In this paper, we employ the log-likelihood ratio of probability density functions of the received signals conditioned on the two possibly transmitted signals and by virtue of moment generating function we give the details in deriving the final precise residue expression for PEP and its CUB. At last, we verify the above results by simulations.", "paper_title": "Pair-wise error probability and its Chernoff upper bound for unitary space-time code", "paper_id": "WOS:000279689900014"}
