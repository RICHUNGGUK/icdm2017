The proposed AMP scheme sets three threshold values, denoted by P (n) , L and H, for the playout controller to start playback and dynamically adjust the playout rate based on the buffer fullness. In the preroll period, the playout can start only when the buffer fullness n is not less than the dynamic playback threshold P (n) , which is determined by the jitters of incoming video frames. In the playback period, if the buffer fullness is below L or over H, the playout rate will slow down or speed up in a quadratic manner. Otherwise, the playback speed depends on the instantaneous frame arrival rate, which is estimated by the proposed arrival process tracking algorithm. We employ computer simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed AMP scheme, and compare it with several conventional AMP mechanisms. Numerical results show that our AMP design can shorten the playout delay and reduce both buffer underflow and overflow probabilities. In addition, our proposed AMP also outperforms traditional AMP schemes in terms of the variance of distortion of playout and the playout curve. Hence, the proposed arrival process-controlled AMP is really an outstanding design.", "paper_title": "Arrival process-controlled adaptive media playout with multiple thresholds for video streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000309341800003"}
