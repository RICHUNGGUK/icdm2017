This paper reports on a study that investigated the relationship between public libraries and social capital that involved administered questionnaires and conducting interviews with patrons in three branch libraries in a medium-sized city in Ontario. Findings show a strong relationship between indicators of social capital and library use. Interviews with frequent library users also indicate the important social benefits that respondents gained from their use of the library.", "paper_title": "A Place Where Everybody Knows Your Name?
