We study the (generalized) joint linear complexity of a class of nonlinear pseudorandom multisequences introduced by the first two authors as well as the linear complexity of its coordinate sequences. We prove lower bounds which are much stronger than in the case of single sequences since the multidimensional case brings in new and favourable effects.", "paper_title": "ON THE GENERALIZED JOINT LINEAR COMPLEXITY PROFILE OF A CLASS OF NONLINEAR PSEUDORANDOM MULTISEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000280383000005"}
