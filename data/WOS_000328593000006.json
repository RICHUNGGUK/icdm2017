From the point of view of the simulation software, OPC support is a bonus that enhances the communication capability between simulation models. In this paper, we describe the development issues for incorporating OPC support into the EcosimPro (c) modelling and simulation software. The result of this project is a commercially available plug-in that transforms an EcosimPro (c) model into an OPC server ready to exchange data with other subsystems. Possibilities of the new functionality of the tool are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
