In fact, there is a no-go theorem that prevents the construction of an efficient Wolff-type embedding algorithm. In this paper, we construct an efficient cluster algorithm for ferromagnetic SU(N)-symmetric quantum spin systems. Such systems provide a regularization for CP(N - 1) models in the framework of D-theory. We present detailed studies of the autocorrelations and find a dynamical critical exponent that is consistent with z = 0. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
