A novel concept of remote programming and control of a flexible manufacturing cell has been developed. Its important feature is the flexibility of the interface between remote users and manufacturing equipment. The system architecture facilitates creating this interface by the users. They can easily design and upload the web pages (also voice-activated ones), which are later used for man-machine communication. Thus the users can adapt the interface to their individual needs. A mechanism for automatic incorporation of speech communication into the web pages has been developed. It is based on voice commands being the equivalent to submit buttons, checkboxes and other web page components. The method of remote programming and control described in this paper has been implemented in the remote laboratory at Warsaw University of Technology. However, the experience gained through the usage of this system can also be a basis for development of industrial systems for monitoring and control of the manufacturing cells in remote locations.", "paper_title": "Remote programming and control of the flexible machining cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000352345300009"}
