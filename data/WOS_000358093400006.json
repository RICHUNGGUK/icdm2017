The main idea is to use iterative ADP technique to obtain the iterative control law which makes all the agents track a given dynamics and simultaneously makes the iterative value function reach the Nash equilibrium. In the developed heterogeneous multi-agent differential graphical games, the agent of each node is different from one another. The dynamics and performance index function for each node depend only on local neighborhood information. A cooperative policy iteration algorithm is presented to achieve the optimal distributed synchronization control law for the agent of each node, where the coupled Hamilton-Jacobi equations for optimal synchronization control of heterogeneous multi-agent differential games can be avoided. Convergence analysis is developed to show that the iterative value functions of heterogeneous multi-agent differential graphical games can converge to the Nash equilibrium. Two simulation examples are given to show the effectiveness of the developed optimal control scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
