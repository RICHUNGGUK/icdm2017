With IFPRs, people can express their opinions over different pairs of alternatives from positive, negative and hesitative points of view. This paper presents a comprehensive survey on decision making with IFPRs with the aim of providing a clear perspective on the originality, the consistency, the prioritization, and the consensus of IFPRs. Finally, some directions for future research are pointed out. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
