However, making this adaptation is not a simple process; it implies the study and conjunction of technical and pedagogical aspects. This article was written from the point of view of a designer who, without being an expert on the cognitive elements, tries to design e-learning systems that include an adaptation for them. This article attempts to provide the answers to some design questions as a starting point to further develop e-learning platforms. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
