To this end, first we will introduce the concept of c-fuzzy random variables. Then, the traditional definition of usual stochastic orderings were extended for c-fuzzy random variables. Also, the upshifted hazard rate orderings and upshifted mean residual life orderings as well as the relationship between them has been studied in this context. In order to illustrate the proposed approach, some practical examples are given.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy stochastic ordering for C-Fuzzy random variables and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000347407500017"}
