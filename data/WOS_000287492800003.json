In this study, the mechanical mixed-mode response of the cement-bone interface is investigated, taking into account the effects of the well-defined microstructure that characterises the interface. Computed tomography-based plain strain finite element analyses models of the cement-bone interface are built and loaded in multiple directions. Periodic boundaries are considered and the failure of the cement and bone fractions by cracking of the bulk components are included. The results compare favourably with experimental observations. Surprisingly, the analyses reveal that under shear loading no failure occurs and considerable normal compression is generated to prevent interface dilation. Reaction forces, crack patterns and stress fields provide more insight into the mixed-mode failure process. Moreover, the cement-bone interface analyses provide details which can serve as a basis for the development of a cohesive law.", "paper_title": "Mixed-mode loading of the cement-bone interface: a finite element study", "paper_id": "WOS:000287492800003"}
