The cellular automaton (CA) traffic flow simulation technique is adopted to develop the analytical basis of the framework. Based on the traffic flow simulation results, the live load on a long-span bridge from the stochastic traffic is studied with a focus on the static component. Parametric studies of major variables of the framework, such as the length of the connecting roadways, the speed limit, and the vehicle combination, are conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
