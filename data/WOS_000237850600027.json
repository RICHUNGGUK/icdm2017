This method has been extended in Castano and Kunoth, 2005 to include regularization in terms of Sobolev and Besov norms. In this paper, we develop within this least-squares approach some statistical robust estimators to handle outliers in the data. Our wavelet scheme yields a numerically fast and reliable way to detect outliers.", "paper_title": "Robust regression of scattered data with adaptive spline-wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000237850600027"}
