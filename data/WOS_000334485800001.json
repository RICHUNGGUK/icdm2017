We address the problem of finding graphs for which a small proportion of initial active vertices is likely to eventually make all vertices active. We study the problem on a ring of n vertices augmented with a \"central\" vertex u. Each vertex in the ring, besides being connected to u, is connected to its r closest neighbors to the left and to the right. We prove that if vertices are initially active with probability p > 1/4 then, for large values of r, percolation occurs with probability arbitrarily close to I as n -> infinity. Also, if p < 1/4, then the probability of percolation is bounded away from 1. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
