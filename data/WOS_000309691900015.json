This paper proposes an enhanced WiMAX DBA (Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation) algorithm using a reserved 2-tier Max-Min Fair Sharing Policy (2tMMFS_reserved-DBA) to improve the system performance than our previous 2tMMFS-DBA one. First, the algorithm reserves 10% of the total bandwidth for rtPS application before bandwidth reservations are set for nrtPS and BE applications. Next, the max-min fair sharing policy sets connection demands for bandwidth requests and QoS provisioning. The IEEE 802.16 MAC header is modified for piggybacking SS (Subscriber Station) queue status messages to help base stations determine bandwidth allocation. 2tMMFS_reserved-DBA prioritizes bandwidth provisioning. Simulation shows the proposed dynamic provisioning scheme 2tMMFS_reserved-DBA works better QoS quality for rtPS, even for nrtPS applications to satisfy the bandwidth requirements for different classes of traffic with equal or improved system throughput.", "paper_title": "WiMAX DBA Algorithm Prioritizes Bandwidth Provision by Using a Reserved 2-Tier Max-Min Fair Sharing Policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000309691900015"}
