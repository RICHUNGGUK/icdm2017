We designed the DB-LLG to communicate with users who can conduct interactive conversations with game characters in various immersive environments. From the pilot test, we found that several technologies were identified as essential in the construction of the DB-LLG such as dialog management, hint generation, and grammar error detection and feedback. We describe the technical details of our system POSTECH immersive English study (Pomy). We evaluated the performance of each technology using a simulator and field tests with users.", "paper_title": "POSTECH Immersive English Study (POMY): Dialog-Based Language Learning Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784400016"}
