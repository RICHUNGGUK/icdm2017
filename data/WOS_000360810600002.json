In this paper, a novel measurement-based approach is adopted to investigate these issues, where the real measured data of the reference signal received power in a macro-pico co-channel deployment are collected. Then the mobility performance in terms of the HO failure rate and ping-pong rate is simulated with various ICIC schemes in the same reality environment. This has been made possible by modeling the possible HO failure events based on evaluating the downlink received signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio from reference signal received power. The simulation results indicate that range expansion together with ICIC can have positive or negative influences on macro-to-pico, pico-to-macro, pico-to-pico and macro-to-macro HOs in the Heterogeneous Network. The existing static ICIC or mobility-based ICIC cannot handle the intra-layer (pico-to-pico and macro-to-macro) interference, thus limiting their abilities to improve the mobility performance. Motivated by this, a dynamic-ICIC-aided HO procedure is proposed. The proposed HO enhancement method is more flexible and effective in mitigating both the inter-layer and intra-layer interference, outperforming the existing methods significantly.
