Service-oriented systems can change greatly after deployment, hampering their quality and reliability. Their service bindings can change, and providers can modify the internals of their services. Monitoring is critical for these systems to keep track of behavior and discover whether anomalies have occurred. The Service-Centric Monitoring Language (SECMOL), a general monitoring specification language, clearly separates concerns between data collection, data computation, and data analysis, allowing for high flexibility and scalability. SECMOL also presents a concrete projection of the model onto three monitoring frameworks.", "paper_title": "Comprehensive Monitoring of BPEL Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000277183900008"}
