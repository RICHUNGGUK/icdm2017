Because of the larger power density and the heterogeneous thermal conductance in different silicon layers of 3D NoC, the thermal problems of 3D NoC become more exacerbated than that of 2D NoC and become a major design constraint for a high-performance system. To control the system temperature under a certain thermal limit, many Dynamic Thermal Managements (DTMs) have been proposed. Recently, for emergent cooling, the full throttling scheme is usually employed as the system temperature reaches the alarming level. Hence, the conventional reactive DTM suffers from significant performance impact because of the pessimistic reaction. In this paper, we propose a throttle-based proactive DTM (T-PDTM) scheme to predict the future temperature through a new Thermal RC-based temperature prediction (RCTP) model. The RCTP model can precisely predict the temperature with heterogeneous workload assignment with low constant computational complexity. Based on the predictive temperature, the proposed T-PDTM scheme will assign the suitable clock frequency for each node of the NoC system to perform early temperature control through power budget distribution. Based on the experimental results, compared with the conventional reactive throttled-based DTMs, the T-PDTM scheme can help to reduce 11.4 similar to 80.3 percent fully throttled nodes and improves the network throughput by around 1.5 similar to 211.8 percent.", "paper_title": "RC-Based Temperature Prediction Scheme for Proactive Dynamic Thermal Management in Throttle-Based 3D NoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206700020"}
