In particular, the conservation laws of energy and momentum are considered, along with those that arise from linear symmetries. Numerical methods that preserve these conformal conservation laws are presented in detail, providing a framework for proving a numerical method exactly preserves the dissipative properties considered. The conformal methods are compared analytically and numerically to standard conservative methods, which includes a thorough inspection of numerical solution behavior for linear equations. Damped Klein-Gordon and sine-Gordon equations, and a damped nonlinear Schrodinger equation, are used as examples to demonstrate the results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
