Under open boundaries, the interaction of separating pedestrian flow interlaced in a T-shaped structure was simulated, using a modified multi-field cellular automaton updating synchronously. The free-jammed phase transition diagram of pedestrian flow and principles of the pedestrian interference were obtained. The movement of pedestrians is free flow in the low entrance density. While it is a complete jammed flow with the entrance density increasing to a certain level and little difference existing between the left moving probability and the right moving probability. Thus, the dominant factor in influencing pedestrian flow is the interference of opposite pedestrian flows due to changing movement directions. And it is changing to an incomplete jammed flow with this difference increasing. Thus, the dominant factor is changing to the interference of the coincident pedestrian flow and the limitation of the bottleneck.", "paper_title": "INTERACTIONS OF PEDESTRIANS INTERLACED IN T-SHAPED STRUCTURE USING A MODIFIED MULTI-FIELD CELLULAR AUTOMATON", "paper_id": "WOS:000317624000006"}
