This letter presents several techniques to improve excitation modeling within the WI framework. We propose both the time domain and frequency domain zero padding techniques to reduce the spectral distortion inherent in the synthesized excitation signal. Furthermore, we apply non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to obtain a low-dimensional representation of the excitation signals. From a number of experiments, including a subjective listening test, the proposed method has been found to enhance the performance of the conventional excitation modeling techniques.", "paper_title": "Statistical Approaches to Excitation Modeling in HMM-Based Speech Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000315243600023"}
