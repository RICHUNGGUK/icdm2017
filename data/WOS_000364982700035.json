In which, reversible data hiding (RDH) is paid more attention since it is capable to recover original host images after revealing the secret data. However, there always is tradeoff between embedding capacity and image quality. The more secret data is embedded, the lower image quality is obtained. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a new RDH scheme to embed a large amount of secrets without causing dramatically damage to images. We develop an optimal exploiting modification direction matrix to modify the difference histogram. By carefully selecting image regions and using the optimal EMD table, the output image quality can be preserved while the embedding capacity of the scheme can be significantly enhanced. Experimental results demonstrated that our scheme outperforms previous schemes in terms of embedding capacity and image quality. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
