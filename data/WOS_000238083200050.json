Clustering was done without the usual document co-occurrence information. Our clustering algorithm, CPCL (Classification by Preferential Clustered Link) is based on general lexico-syntactic relations which do not require prior domain knowledge or the existence of a training set. Results show that CPCL performs well in terms of cluster homogeneity and shows good adaptability for handling large and sparse matrices.", "paper_title": "Phrase clustering without document context", "paper_id": "WOS:000238083200050"}
