Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes to integrate a control-based approach, currently used in automation domain, for the solving of non-linear mechanical problem. More precisely, a fuzzy logic controller is designed to create a link between the normal gaps identified between the bodies and the normal contact pressures applied at the interface. Findings - With this new strategy, the initial non-linear problem can be decomposed into a set of reduced linear problems solved using the finite element method. A projection built from the modal bases of each component in contact is considered to reduce computational time. Moreover, the proposed numerical applications highlight an interesting compromise between computation time and precision of contact data. Research limitations/implications - Currently, the proposed Fuzzy Logic Controller for Contact method has been developed for a frictionless contact problem in the case of 2D numerical applications. Therefore, as obtained results are very interesting, it will be possible to expand on these works in a future works for more complex problems including friction, 3D model and transient dynamic responses by adding other controllers. Originality/value - In conclusion, this paper highlights the interest of studying a contact problem by considering automation approaches and defines the basis of future multidisciplinary works.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of frictionless contact problems using fuzzy control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000355829900002"}
