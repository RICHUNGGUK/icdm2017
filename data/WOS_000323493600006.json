An experiment with 5 Gbits/s ACO-OFDM upstream transmission has been carried out to investigate its performance. Meanwhile, a 2-ONU upstream transmission scheme utilizing ACO-OFDM has also been proposed, and important issues such as optical beat interference and symbol delay are studied.", "paper_title": "Novel Modulation Scheme Based on Asymmetrically Clipped Optical Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing for Next-Generation Passive Optical Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000323493600006"}
