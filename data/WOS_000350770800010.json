The aluminum nitride thin film is used as a piezoelectric layer. The Mason model of air-gap TFBAR (AGR) resonators is established in advanced design system to investigate the relationship between electrical impedance and physical parameters. The simulation results illustrate the effect of the area of parallel unit and the number of resonators on the performance of the BAW filters. By changing the series-parallel unit series and area ratio, the pass band of the BAW filter can reach 1556-1566 MHz, and the out-of-band rejection and the insertion loss can reach 47.5 dB and 3.0 dB, respectively.", "paper_title": "Design of Bulk Acoustic Wave Filters for Beidou Receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000350770800010"}
