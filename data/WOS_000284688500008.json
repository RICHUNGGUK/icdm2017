In a scenario in which knowledge workers perform their duties in knowledge-intensive organisations, mentoring has emerged as an efficient practice for the development of these personnel. On the other hand, the convergence of information technology (IT) and communication technologies and the rapid evolution of the internet has been one of the most influential factors in human resources management, and the advent of semantic technologies presents novel opportunities for the improvement of personnel development, including semantics. This study presents a solution based on semantic technologies which utilises different personal and professional data to carry out pair matching of mentors and proteges.", "paper_title": "Shaping human capital in software development teams: the case of mentoring enabled by semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000284688500008"}
