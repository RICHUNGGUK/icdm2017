The proposed scheme may find applications for sharing secrets with excess bits, especially in the scenarios where resources are strictly limited and the requirement of verification is demanding. Existing ways of combiner verification always just rely on exponentiation or only by hiring one-way hash function, which cannot thwart the stolen share attack, spoofing attack or discriminate an imposter who fraudulently obtains the access privileges from the genuine participant. Nonetheless, these problems can be tackled by the unique property of biometrics in our paper. Most importantly, unlike most counterpart schemes, no other random numbers are used to protect the secret pieces, hence, our scheme is simpler and more efficient, and the computation cost is relatively low.
