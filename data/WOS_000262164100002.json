In this paper, we first provide a general description of NoC architectures and applications. Then, we enumerate several related research problems organized under five main categories: Application characterization, communication paradigm, communication infrastructure, analysis, and solution evaluation. Motivation, problem description., proposed approaches, and open issues are discussed for each problem from system, microarchitecture, and circuit perspectives. Finally, we address the interactions among these research problems and put the NoC design process into perspective.", "paper_title": "Outstanding Research Problems in NoC Design: System, Microarchitecture, and Circuit Perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164100002"}
