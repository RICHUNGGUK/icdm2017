To enable quantitative evaluation of bone changes, either bone gain or loss, accurate alignment between the baseline and follow-up scans of the same individual is necessary. The major difficulties in achieving efficient and automatic registration of the HR-pQCT data are the large data size, deformations in the nonskeletal structures, and the complexity of the trabecular bone geometry. In this paper, we propose an automatic surface-based approach for fast and accurate registration of the HR-pQCT data, where the rigid registration is applied on the surfaces of the bony structures extracted from the grayscale HR-pQCT. The bony structure segmentation is performed via an automatic method that can adaptively determine the thresholds for separating the bony structure from the background and nonskeletal tissues. Experimental results performed on ten pairs of baseline and follow-up wrist scans of five adolescents and five elderly patients with osteoporosis showed the advantage of the proposed method in the high degree of automation, while the resultant parameters describing bone mineral density and trabecular architecture after registration were comparable with the outputs of the scanner's software. This automatic and accurate matching procedure may contribute to the clinical application and research of HR-pQCT.", "paper_title": "Fast and Accurate 3-D Registration of HR-pQCT Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000282474800019"}
