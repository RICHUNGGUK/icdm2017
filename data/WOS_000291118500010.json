In recent years, determining the best supplier in the supply chain has become a key strategic consideration. However, these decisions usually involve several objectives or criteria, and it is often necessary to compromise among possibly conflicting factors. Thus, the multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) becomes a useful approach to solve this kind of problem. Considering both tangible and intangible criteria, this study proposes integrated fuzzy techniques for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and multi-choice goal programming (MCGP) approach to solve the supplier selection problem. The advantage of this method is that it allows decision makers to set multiple aspiration levels for supplier selection problems. The integrated model is illustrated by an example in a watch firm.
