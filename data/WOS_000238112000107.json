These jillion nerve connections will be pruned and the dendrites of neurons can change their conformation in infants' proceeding cognition process. Simulating this pruning process, a new neural network structure evolution algorithm is proposed based on e and in projections in information geometry and model selection criterion. This structure evolution process is formulated in iterative e, in projections and stopped by using model selection criterion. Experimental results prove the validation of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A neural network structure evolution algorithm based on e, m projections and model selection criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000107"}
