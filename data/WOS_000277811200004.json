It generates a curve or patch sequence with finer and finer precision, and the limit of the sequence interpolates the data points. The progressive-iterative approximation brings more flexibility for shape controlling in data fitting. In this paper, we design a local progressive-iterative approximation format, and show that the local format is convergent for the blending curve with normalized totally positive basis, and the bi-cubic B-spline patch, which is the most commonly used patch in geometric design. Moreover, a special adjustment manner is designed to make the local progressive-iterative approximation format is convergent for a generic blending patch with normalized totally positive basis. The local progressive-iterative approximation format adjusts only a part of the control points of a blending curve or patch, and the limit curve or patch interpolates the corresponding data points. Based on the local format, data points can be fit adaptively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
