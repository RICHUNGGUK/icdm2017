We propose a methodology which incorporates trend-weighting into the fuzzy time-series models advanced by S.M. Chen and Hui-Kuang Yu. By using actual trading data of Taiwan Stock Index (TAIEX) and the enrolment data of the University of Alabama, we evaluate the accuracy of our trend-weighted, fuzzy, time-series model by comparing our forecasts with those derived from Chen's and Yu's models. The results indicate that our model surpasses in accuracy those suggested by Chen and Yu.", "paper_title": "Trend-weighted fuzzy time-series model for TAIEX forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000052"}
