The proposed algorithms are designed to work in networks where the mobile nodes possessing collision detection capabilities. Our first broadcast algorithm accomplishes broadcast in O(nlog n) for networks where topology changes are infrequent. We also present an O(nlog n) worst case time broadcast algorithms that is resilient to mobility. For networks where topology changes are frequent, we present a third algorithm that accomplishes broadcast in O(triangle center dot n log n+n center dot vertical bar M vertical bar) in the worst case scenario, where vertical bar M vertical bar is the length of the message to be broadcasted and triangle the maximum node degree. We then extend one of our broadcast algorithms to develop an O(Dn log n + D(2)) algorithm for gossiping in the same network model.", "paper_title": "Deterministic broadcast and gossiping algorithms for ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238835700001"}
