In this paper, a correlation-aware QoS routing algorithm (CAQR) is proposed to efficiently deliver visual information under QoS constraints by exploiting the correlation of visual information observed by different camera sensors. First, a correlation-aware inter-node differential coding scheme is designed to reduce the amount of traffic in the network. Then, a correlation-aware load balancing scheme is proposed to prevent network congestion by splitting the correlated flows that cannot be reduced to different paths. Finally, the correlation-aware schemes are integrated into an optimization QoS routing framework with an objective to minimize energy consumption subject to delay and reliability constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed routing algorithm achieves efficient delivery of visual information under QoS constraints in wireless video sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Correlation-Aware QoS Routing With Differential Coding for Wireless Video Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000308990600008"}
