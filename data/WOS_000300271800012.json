According to this model, the network nodes move around the obstacles in a way that resembles how humans bypass physical obstructions. A recursive procedure is executed by each node at its current position to determine the next intermediate destination point until the final destination point is reached. The proposed mobility model is validated using real-life trace data and studied using both mathematical analysis and simulations. Furthermore, the model is extended to incorporate several operational aspects of ad hoc networks in mission critical scenarios, where it is best applicable. These extensions include hierarchical node organization, distinct modes of node activity, event-based destination selection and impact of the physical obstacles on signal propagation. The model is implemented as an add-on module in Network Simulator (ns-2). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
