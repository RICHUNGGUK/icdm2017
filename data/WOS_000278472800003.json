With the use of h-likelihood, we illustrate that the standard likelihood procedures, developed for inference about fixed unknown parameters, can be used for inference about random effects. We show that the necessary standard error for the prediction interval of the random effect can be computed from the Hessian matrix of the h-likelihood. We also show numerically that the h-likelihood provides a prediction interval that maintains a more precise coverage probability than the BLUP method.", "paper_title": "Orthodox BLUP versus h-likelihood methods for inferences about random effects in Tweedie mixed models", "paper_id": "WOS:000278472800003"}
