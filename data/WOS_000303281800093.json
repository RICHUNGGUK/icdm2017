This paper presents a context-aware system that provides reminding messages for elders based on fuzzy linguistic model in order to properly deliver a reminder in an appropriate time and way. By separating the user activity contexts and contexts utilized to trigger a reminder, it is much easier for the elderly or their care givers to schedule and maintain reminders. We first adopt a fuzzy linguistic model to determine the prompting level based on the interrupt degree of user current activity and the urgent level of to-be-prompt reminder. An adaptive mapping strategy is then presented to transfer the prompting level into machine-readable parameters. Finally, the proposed approach is verified through our system prototype and experiments. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
