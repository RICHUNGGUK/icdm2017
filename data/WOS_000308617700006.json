However, distributions of earthquakes (seismicity) can be used to forecast an earthquake hazard. These distributions in space, time, and magnitude can be studied in a variety of ways. The Regional Earthquake Likelihood Models (RELM) test compares the different approaches.", "paper_title": "Forecasting Earthquakes: The RELM Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000308617700006"}
