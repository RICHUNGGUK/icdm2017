This causes their life time to be determined by their ability to use the available energy in an effective and frugal manner. In most of the earlier sensor network applications, the main requirement consisted mainly of data collection but transmitting all of the raw data out of the network may be prohibitively expensive (in terms of communication) or impossible at given data collection rates. In the last decade, the use of the database paradigm has emerged as a feasible solution to manage data in a WSN context. There are various sensor network query processors (SNQPs) (implementing in-network declarative query processing) that provide data reduction, aggregation, logging, and auditing facilities. These SNQPs view the wireless sensor network as a distributed database over which declarative query processor can be used to program a WSN application with much less effort. They allow users to pose declarative queries that provide an effective and efficient means to obtain data about the physical environment, as users would not need to be concerned with how sensors are to acquire the data, or how nodes transform and/or transmit the data. This paper surveys novel approaches of handling query processing by the current SNQP literature, the expressiveness of their query language, the support provided by their compiler/optimizer to generate efficient query plans and the kind of queries supported. We introduce the challenges and opportunities of research in the field of in-network sensor network query processing as well as illustrate the current status of research and future research scopes in this field.
