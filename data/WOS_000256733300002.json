Provided potentials are not made too soft, two of the soft core models are found to work well in terms of successfully reproducing mesophases and in providing considerable improvements in computational speed over other commonly used coarse-grained models. In Monte Carlo simulations a soft-core spherocylinder model in which a cut and shifted Lennard-Jones potential is truncated with a linear tangential potential is found to be particularly effective; while for molecular dynamics a better model is provided by a DPD-like quadratic potential. Here, computational speed-ups of 20-30x are seen in equilibration times in comparison to the well-known soft repulsive spherocylinder (SRS) model. The quadratic potential is used in an additional set of coarse-grained simulations of a liquid crystal with a flexible chain, which exhibits spontaneous formation of a nematic phase. The use of different types of interaction sites is also illustrated by the simulation of a spherocylinder with two \"tails\" formed from spheres. Here, varying the hardness of the sphere-spherocylinder interaction potential allows the formation of a smectic-A phase which exhibits microphase separation. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
