A generic classification framework has been designed and implemented as an R package in an object oriented style. Its design places emphasis on parallel processing, reproducibility and extensibility. Finally, a comprehensive set of performance measures are available to ease post-processing. Taken together, these important characteristics enable rapid and reproducible benchmarking of alternative classifiers.", "paper_title": "ClassifyR: an R package for performance assessment of classification with applications to transcriptomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625300025"}
