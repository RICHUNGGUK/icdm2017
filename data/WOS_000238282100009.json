First, the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model is employed to approximate the probe system. Next, based on the fuzzy model, a fuzzy observer-based mixed PDC fuzzy controller is discussed in accordance with the definition of stability in the sense of Lyapunov. Robust stability and disturbance rejection technique are also proposed in the following design of guidance control.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy output tracking control and its application to guidance control for lunar gravity-turn", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100009"}
