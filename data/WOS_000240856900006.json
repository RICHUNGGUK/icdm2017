Let G be a planar graph such that vertical bar R vertical bar vertices of G are red and vertical bar B vertical bar vertices of G are blue. A bichromatic point-set embedding of G on R boolean OR B is a crossing-free drawing of G such that each blue vertex is mapped to a point of B, each red vertex is mapped to a point of R, and each edge is a polygonal curve. We study the curve complexity of bichromatic point-set embeddings; i.e., the number of bends per edge that are necessary and sufficient to compute such drawings. We show that O(n) bends are sometimes necessary. We also prove that two bends per edge suffice if G is a 2-colored caterpillar and that for properly 2-colored caterpillars, properly 2-colored wreaths, 2-colored paths, and 2-colored cycles the number of bends per edge can be reduced to one, which is worst-case optimal.", "paper_title": "On embedding a graph on two sets of points", "paper_id": "WOS:000240856900006"}
