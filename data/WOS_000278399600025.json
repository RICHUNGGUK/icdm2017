Dead transitions may exist when there are no DMS and the net model is in livelock states. A new liveness condition is developed based on the so-called max*-controlled siphons to replace that of the restrictive max-controlled siphons. A deadlock control policy is further proposed for (WSPR)-P-3 (weighted (SPR)-P-3 (systems of simple sequential processes with resources)) by adding control nodes and arcs for elementary siphons only, reducing significantly the number of monitors compared with existing methods. A counter example is shown to indicate that Li's characteristic P-vector must be weighted. The controlled model for (WSPR)-P-3 is proposed and its liveness property is proved.", "paper_title": "Weighted Characteristic P-vector and Deadlock Control of (WSPR)-P-3", "paper_id": "WOS:000278399600025"}
