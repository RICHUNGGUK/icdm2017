This letter proposes the self-interference pricing based full-duplex precoding (FDP-SIP) algorithm that applies pricing-based precoding at the transmitter to suppress the self-interference prior to the receiver low-noise amplifier (LNA) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to avoid overloading while ensuring the receiver linearity. The proposed FDP-SIP algorithm can be implemented without the need of active cancellation at the receiver. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FDP-SIP algorithm using both channel models and measured data. In particular, based on the measured data, FDP-SIP algorithm provides the sum-rate nearly 1.8 times that of an optimized half-duplex (HD).", "paper_title": "Self-Interference Pricing-Based MIMO Full-Duplex Precoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700001"}
