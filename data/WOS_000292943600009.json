The development of 4K image equipment such as cameras, displays, and playback systems has made easy viewing of 41< video possible. Video frame rates have also become higher, enabling 4K-60 fps progressive (60p) video streams to be transmitted over IP networks. However, problems remain in increasing video image resolution to 8K or more so as to build systems in which many people collaborate at the same time. This paper describes a video transmission system that attains image resolution of 8K-60p or higher by synchronizing multiple 4K transmission systems we have developed. Since 8K-60p transmission over IP networks has extremely high traffic rates, schemes for achieving robust transmission such as forward error correction (FEC) must also have very high rates. We have also developed techniques for attaining reliable transmission, i.e., the use of low-density generator matrix (LDGM) codes to achieve high throughput FEC, application-layer multicasting, and monitoring network status at multiple points.
