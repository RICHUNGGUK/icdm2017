This work studies the resource virtualization and service encapsulation of a logistics center, and focuses on the technologies of resource expression and service encapsulation. After the resources of a logistics center are encapsulated in web services, how to find the \"best\" concrete web service among many is a critically important issue. This work considers service selection as an optimization problem and establishes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based web service selection model with quality of service (QoS) constraints. It can be used to address the horizontal adaptation issues from the composite web services. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model are verified by several experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
