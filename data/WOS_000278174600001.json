It models the geometric continuity conditions of parametric surfaces in polar coordinates and presents a mechanism of converting a Cartesian parametric surface into its polar coordinate form. The basic idea is first to reparameterize the parametric blendees into the form of polar coordinates. Then they are blended simultaneously by a basis function in the complex domain. To extend its compatibility, we also propose a method of converting polar coordinate blending surface into N NURBS patches. One application of this technique is to fill N-sided holes. Examples are presented to show its feasibility and practicability. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
