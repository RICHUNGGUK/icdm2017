They are shared by the ZP proteins, which constitute the extracellular coat of animal eggs. Except from ZP3, constituting the primary sperm receptor, the ZP proteins possess, in addition to their C-terminal ZP domains, N-terminal extensions, which are thought to play an important role in the species-specific gamete recognition. Here, we show that these extensions are made of single or multiple copies of a small globular domain, which can be significantly related to the N-terminal region of ZP domains (ZP-N domains). This finding brings new insights into the molecular evolution of ZP proteins, which may have evolved around a common ZP-N architecture, and more generally into the noticeable sequence diversity of ZP-N domains, which can be found as isolated subunits or tightly associated with ZP-C domains to form complete, canonical ZP domains.", "paper_title": "Isolated ZP-N domains constitute the n-terminal extensions of zona pellucida proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000249248400001"}
