The security is exactly guaranteed via the entanglement of the GHZ quantum system. In the process of quantum teleportation, the server Charlie prepares the GHZ states and the users exploit the four local unitary operations corresponding to the keys shared aforehand to encrypt/decrpt for the initial messages. One legal user can communicate with another on the network securely as they may perform a quantum privacy application on the encrypted quantum states transmitted in quantum channel. Its intrinsic efficiency is high as almost all the instances are useful and each GHZ state can carry two different encrypted single-qubit states. To reconstruct these transmitted messages, the users exploit Bell measurement and perform local operations with respect to the shared keys in NQKD, which will improve its security in a noise quantum channel.", "paper_title": "ENCRYPTION-BASED NETWORKING QUANTUM TELEPORTATION WITH TRIPLET GREENBERGER-HORNE-ZEILINGER STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000282436200003"}
