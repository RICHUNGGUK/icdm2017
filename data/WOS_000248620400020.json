This approach is based on the measurements of external controls and estimates an absolute target level for each gene and condition pair, as opposed to working with log-ratios as a relative measure of expression. Moreover, this method makes no assumptions regarding the distribution of gene expression divergence.", "paper_title": "CALIB: a Bioconductor package for estimating absolute expression levels from two-color microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000248620400020"}
