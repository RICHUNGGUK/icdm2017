However, almost all the conventional topical Web crawlers focus on building crawlers using different classifiers, which needs a lot of labeled training data that is very difficult to labelmanually. This paper presents a novel approach called clustering-based topical Web crawling which is utilized to retrieve information on a specific domain based on link-context and does not require any labeled training data. In order to collect domain-specific content units, a novel hierarchical clustering method called bottom-up approach is used to illustrate the process of clustering where a new data structure, a linked list in combination with CFu-tree, is implemented to store cluster label, feature vector and content unit. During clustering, four metrics are presented. First, comparison variation (CV) is defined to judge whether the closest pair of clusters can be merged. Second, cluster impurity (CIP) evaluates the cluster error. Then, the precision and recall of clustering are also presented to evaluate the accuracy and comprehensive degree of the whole clustering process. Link-context extraction technique is used to expand the feature vector of anchor text which improves the clustering accuracy greatly. Experimental results show that the performance of our proposed method overcomes conventional focused Web crawlers both in Harvest rate and Target recall.", "paper_title": "Clustering-based topical Web crawling using CFu-tree guided by link-context", "paper_id": "WOS:000339817700004"}
