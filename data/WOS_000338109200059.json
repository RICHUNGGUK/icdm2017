We present a user-friendly protein docking server, based on the rigidbody docking programs ZDOCK and M-ZDOCK, to predict structures of protein-protein complexes and symmetric multimers. With a goal of providing an accessible and intuitive interface, we provide options for users to guide the scoring and the selection of output models, in addition to dynamic visualization of input structures and output docking models. This server enables the research community to easily and quickly produce structural models of protein-protein complexes and symmetric multimers for their own analysis.", "paper_title": "ZDOCK server: interactive docking prediction of protein-protein complexes and symmetric multimers", "paper_id": "WOS:000338109200059"}
