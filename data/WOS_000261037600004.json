The objective is simultaneous maximization of fundamental frequency and minimization of cost. Number of surface and core layers made of high-stiffness and low-stiffness materials, respectively, and fiber orientations are the design variables. Optimal stacking sequences are given for hybrid graphite/epoxy-glass/epoxy laminated plates with different aspect ratios and number of plies. The results obtained by ant colony optimization are compared to results obtained by a genetic algorithm and simulated annealing. The effectiveness of the hybridization concept for reducing the weight and keeping the fundamental frequency at a reasonable level is demonstrated. Furthermore, it is shown that the proposed ant colony algorithm outperforms the two other heuristics.", "paper_title": "An ant colony optimization approach to multi-objective optimal design of symmetric hybrid laminates for maximum fundamental frequency and minimum cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000261037600004"}
