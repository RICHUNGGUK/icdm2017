The approach of prior studies cannot be directly employed in this situation since the boundary curves cease to be real-analytic at those points. In addition to a careful re-examination of the properties of the medial axis still valid in the current setting, we present a detailed investigation of the medial axis near the points of infinite curvature that will serve as a theoretical foundation of future studies on its exact computation.
