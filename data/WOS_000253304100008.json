Experimental results show that the proposed method can be used to achieve an edge location accuracy of 0.16 pixel for straight lines with noise and 0.23 pixel for curves with noise. It can therefore be concluded that the proposed method is an efficient approach to satisfy the stringent requirements for higher edge location accuracies in such fields as medical image analysis and satellite remote sensing.
