Instead, all content is represented as single character 'atoms' which are placed along an arbitrary number of dimensions. This approach addresses some of the issues with node-based hypermedia. The article describes the basic mechanics of Atomic Data Structure, and how hypermedia behaviours can be obtained.", "paper_title": "Atomic hypermedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000234431900002"}
