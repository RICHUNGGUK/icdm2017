In this work, fluorescence imaging and [F-18]FDG-PET were both employed to monitor tumor response to Au nanorod-indocyanine green (AuNR-ICG) conjugates mediated therapy in a subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 mouse xenograft model. Serial fluorescence and [F-18]FDG-PET images following the antitumor treatment were obtained and quantitative analysis revealed significant decreases in fluorescence intensity and metabolic activity in tumors treated with AuNR-ICG conjugates under near infrared laser irradiation. The results suggest that the combination of fluorescence and [F-18]FDG-PET imaging can provide a noninvasive tool to assess the tumor response to antitumor therapy on a molecular scale.", "paper_title": "Monitoring of Tumor Response to Au Nanorod-Indocyanine Green Conjugates Mediated Therapy With Fluorescence Imaging and Positron Emission Tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000324763600006"}
