Consequently, an evident trend is to offer learners with the equivalent of practical learning experiences, whilst supporting creativity for both teachers and learners. Current market surveys showed surprisingly that the Wii remote controller (Wiimote) is more widely spread than standard PCs and is the most used computer input device worldwide, which given its collection of sensors, accelerometers and bluetooth technology, makes it of great interest for HCI experiments in e-Learning/e-Teaching. In this paper we discuss the importance of gestures for teaching and describe the design and development of a low-cost demonstrator kit based on Wiimote enhancing the quality of the lecturing with gestures.", "paper_title": "NINTENDO WII REMOTE CONTROLLER IN HIGHER EDUCATION DEVELOPMENT AND EVALUATION OF A DEMONSTRATOR KIT FOR E-TEACHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000284193100008"}
