Design/methodology/approach - A survey questionnaire was used. The hierarchical regression analysis was employed to analyze the 545 valid questionnaires collected (valid return rate: 54.5 percent) from construction industry employees in Taiwan. Findings - The results indicate that ISQ directly improves OP. Particularly, TR has a moderating effect on the relationship between ISQ and OP. TR can enhance the positive influence ISQ has on OP. Research limitations/implications - Data sources for this study were restricted by the respondents' cognition and experience regarding ISQ and OP. Biases may exist among respondents. In addition, the collected data were related to the Taiwan construction industry, which may differ from operating environments and characteristics of other industries and cities. The management implications are explained in the Conclusion. Practical implications - This study provides meaningful information for managers of the construction industry. Management can use TR to influence the relationship between ISQ and OP and to further improve OP to meet future challenges. Originality/value - Under the trend of market segmentation and the challenge of customized consumer requirements, brand management and product planning of the construction industry have become key factors of land value. The results of this study indicate that organization ISQ improves OP and personal TR is the moderator that influences the relationship between ISQ and OP to improve OP.", "paper_title": "Technology readiness as moderator for construction company performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000318207100005"}
