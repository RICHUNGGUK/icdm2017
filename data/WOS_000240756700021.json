These BP equations were used to tune the parameters of the antecedent type-2 membership functions as well as the consequent part of the interval type-2 fuzzy neural networks (T2FNNs). These incorrect equations would have led to erroneous results, and hence this might affect the comparisons and findings presented by Wang et al. This comment will highlight the correct BP tuning equations for the T2FNN.", "paper_title": "Comments on \"Dynamical optimal training for interval type-2 fuzzy neural network (THNN)\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700021"}
