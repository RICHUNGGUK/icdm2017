MN can handover relatively faster in PMIPv6 than in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) because it actively uses link-layer attachment information and reduces the movement detection time, and eliminates duplicate address detection procedure. However, the current PMIPv6 cannot prevent packet loss during the handover period. We propose the Smart Buffering scheme for seamlessness in PMIPv6. The Smart Buffering scheme prevents packet loss by proactively buffering packets that will be lost in a current serving mobile access gateway (MAG) by harnessing network-side information only. It also performs redundant packet elimination and packet reordering to minimize duplicate packet delivery and disruption of connection-oriented flows. To fetch buffered packets from a previous MAG, a new MAG discovers the previous MAG by using a discovery mechanism without any involvement of an MN. We verified the effectiveness of Smart Buffering via simulation with various parameters.
