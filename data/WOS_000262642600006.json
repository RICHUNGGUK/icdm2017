As a consequence, we show that it is decidable to determine whether a constraint satisfaction problem is first-order definable: we show the general problem to be NP-complete, and give a polynomial-time algorithm in the case of cores. A slight modification of this algorithm provides, for first-order definable CSP's, a simple poly-time algorithm to produce a solution when one exists. As an application of our algebraic characterisation of first order CSP's, we describe a large family of L-complete CSP's.", "paper_title": "A CHARACTERISATION OF FIRST-ORDER CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262642600006"}
