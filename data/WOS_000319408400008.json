However, the introduction of video raises new challenges. The transmission of video and imaging data requires both energy efficiency and quality of service (QoS) assurance in order to ensure the efficient use of sensor resources as well as the integrity of the collected information. To this end, this paper proposes a joint power, rate and lifetime management algorithm in WVSNs based on the network utility maximization framework. The optimization problem is always nonconcave, which makes the problem difficult to solve. This paper makes progress in solving this type of optimization problems using particle swarm optimization (PSO). Based on the movement and intelligence of swarms, PSO is a new evolution algorithm to look for the most fertile feeding location. It can solve discontinuous, nonconvex and nonlinear problems efficiently. First, since chaotic mapping enjoys certainty, ergodicity and the stochastic property, the paper introduces chaos mapping into PSO with adaptive inertia weight factor to avoid the disadvantage of original PSO of easily getting to the local optimal solution in the later evolution period and keep the rapid convergence performance. Second, based on the distribution characteristics of the actual network, we decompose the resource control problem into a number of sub-problems using the hierarchical thought, where each user corresponds to a subsystem which is solved using the proposed CPSO3 method. Through the cooperative coevolution theory, these sub-optimization problems interact with each other to obtain the optimum of the system. Numerical examples show that our algorithm can guarantee fast convergence and fairness within a few iterations. Besides, it is demonstrated that our algorithm can solve the nonconvex optimization problems very efficiently. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
