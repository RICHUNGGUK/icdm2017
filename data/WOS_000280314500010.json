(2001, Semigroup forum, 62, 249-278) [4] are presented. By an ordered monoid, we always mean a totally ordered monoid. All the problems are related to the class of ordered commutative monoids which are homomorphic images of ordered free commutative monoids.", "paper_title": "Solutions to Some Open Problems on Totally Ordered Monoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000280314500010"}
