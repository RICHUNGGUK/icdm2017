We report experimental results for two types of data: synthetic data to visualize the behavior of the algorithms and publicly available eight data sets. The new methods have been tested against 23 other decision-tree construction algorithms based on benchmark data sets. Empirical results indicate that our approach achieves better classification accuracy compared to other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Cline: A new decision-tree family", "paper_id": "WOS:000253272100014"}
