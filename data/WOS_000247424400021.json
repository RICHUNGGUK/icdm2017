A single-degree-of-freedom stall flutter model with torsional oscillation is considered subject to nonlinear aerodynamic loads in the dynamic stall regime and nonlinear structural stiffness. The analysis of the deterministic aeroelastic response demonstrated that the problem is sensitive to variations in structural natural frequency and structural nonlinearity. The effect of uncertainties in these parameters is studied. Arbitrary polynomial chaos is employed in which appropriate expansion polynomials are constructed based on the statistical moments of the uncertain input. The arbitrary polynomial chaos results are compared with Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
