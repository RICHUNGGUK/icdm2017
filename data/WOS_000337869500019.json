For such CPINAR(1) processes, explicit results are derived for joint moments, for the k-step-ahead distribution as well as for the stationary distribution. It is shown that a CPINAR(1) process is strongly mixing with exponentially decreasing weights. This result is utilized to design a test for overdispersion in INAR(1) processes and to derive its asymptotic power function. An application of our results to a real-data example and a study of the finite-sample performance of the test are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
