Upon these optimization frameworks, a suite of optimization subproblems:a program partitioning and network resource allocation problem, we propose a distributed vehicular sensing platform, called VeSense where mobile users in vehicles publish/access sensor data via a cloud computing-based distributed P2P overlay network. The key objective is to satisfy the vehicular sensing application's quality of service requirements by modeling each subsystem: mobile clients, wireless network medium, and distributed cloud services. By simulations based on experimental data, we present the proposed system can achieve up to 37 times more energy-efficient and 73 times faster compared to a standalone mobile application, in various vehicular sensing scenarios applying a realistic mobility model.
