Given q >= 0, the q-limited search number, s(q)(G), of a graph G is the smallest number of searchers required to capture an invisible fugitive in G, when the searchers are allowed to know the position of the fugitive at most q times. The search parameter s(0)(G) corresponds to the pathwidth of a graph G, and s(infinity)(G) to its treewidth. Determining s(q)(G) is NP-complete for any fixed q >= 0 in general graphs and s(0) (T) can be computed in linear time in trees, however the complexity of the problem on trees has been unknown for any q > 0. We introduce a new variant of graph searching called restricted non-deterministic. The corresponding parameter is denoted by rs(q) and is shown to be equal to the non-deterministic graph searching parameter s(q) for q = 0, 1, and at most twice sq for any q >= 2 (for any graph G). Our main result is a polynomial time algorithm that computes rs(q)(T) for any tree T and any q >= 0. This provides a 2-approximation of s(q)(T) for any tree T, and shows that the decision problem associated to S-1 is polynomial in the class of trees. Our proofs are based on a new decomposition technique for trees which might be of independent interest. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
