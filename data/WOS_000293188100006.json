In this paper, we address the construction of POR protocol on the standard model of interactive proof systems. We propose the first interactive POR scheme to prevent the fraudulence of prover and the leakage of verified data. We also give full proofs of soundness and zero-knowledge properties by constructing a polynomialtime rewindable knowledge extractor under the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. In particular, the verification process of this scheme requires a low, constant amount of overhead, which minimizes communication complexity.", "paper_title": "Zero-knowledge proofs of retrievability", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100006"}
