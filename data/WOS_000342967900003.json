This provides an assessment of the current business value of IT However, given IT investments are long-term and given that contemporary firms evolve in highly dynamic environments, it is also important to consider the alignment of IT applications that are under development. These applications affect the future business value of IT This paper rethinks the notion of alignment to include IT applications in development. It conceptualizes the notion of IT project portfolio alignment and develops and tests a model that measures portfolio alignment in a bottom-up process based on individual IT projects. Several formulation methods are proposed and compared.", "paper_title": "Aligning IT for Future Business Value: Conceptualizing IT Project Portfolio Alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000342967900003"}
