Employing weak cross-Kerr nonlinear interactions and Homodyne measurement, two individual photons entangle together based on the bus function of coherent states. Assisted by optical elements mainly including polarization beam splitters, the entanglement of the signal photons is converted from the spatial mode to the polarization mode. The application of classical feed forward provides the high-efficiency to the preparation of Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states, Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, and four-photon cluster-type polarization-entangled states. With regard to the four-photon cluster-type state, it can be generated in two distributed nodes with less experimental requirements, integrating the features of three logical gates.", "paper_title": "A GENERATION SCHEME OF THE DISTRIBUTED FOUR-PHOTON CLUSTER-TYPE POLARIZATION-ENTANGLED STATES EXPLOITING THE INTEGRATION OF ENTANGLEMENT GATES AND THE CONTROLLED PHASE GATE", "paper_id": "WOS:000331244200003"}
