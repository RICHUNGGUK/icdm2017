Such an architecture faces two main problems: how to efficiently control each processing element (PE) in the system, and how to facilitate inter-PE communication without the overheads of traditional shared-memory coherent memory. In this article, we explore solving these problems using triggered instructions and latency-insensitive channels. Triggered instructions completely eliminate the program counter (PC) and allow programs to transition concisely between states without explicit branch instructions. Latency-insensitive channels allow efficient communication of inter-PE control information while simultaneously enabling flexible code placement and improving tolerance for variable events such as cache accesses. Together, these approaches provide a unified mechanism to avoid overserialized execution, essentially achieving the effect of techniques such as dynamic instruction reordering and multithreading. Our analysis shows that a spatial accelerator using triggered instructions and latency-insensitive channels can achieve 8x greater area-normalized performance than a traditional general-purpose processor. Further analysis shows that triggered control reduces the number of static and dynamic instructions in the critical paths by 62% and 64%, respectively, over a PC-style baseline, increasing the performance of the spatial programming approach by 2.0x.", "paper_title": "Efficient Control and Communication Paradigms for Coarse-Grained Spatial Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000361156500004"}
