However, there is no one internet dataset that collects all the sequences that have been investigated for their amyloidogenicity. Therefore, we have created the AmyLoad website which collects the amyloidogenic sequences from all major sources. The website allows for filtration of the fragments and provides detailed information about each of them. Registered users can both personalize their work with the website and submit their own sequences into the database. To maintain database reliability, submitted sequences are reviewed before making them available to the public. Finally, we re-implemented several amyloidogenic sequence predictors, thus the AmyLoad website can be used as a sequence analysis tool. We encourage researchers working on amyloid proteins to", "paper_title": "AmyLoad: website dedicated to amyloidogenic protein fragments", "paper_id": "WOS:000362846600031"}
