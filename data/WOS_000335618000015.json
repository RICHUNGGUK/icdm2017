Two studies were conducted during the 2010-2011 and the 2011-2012 school years, targeting 26 teachers from elementary schools (grades 1-2), and their students (N = 517) from six English school boards in Quebec, Canada. Analyses of covariance showed that students using both tools performed significantly better (p < .001) compared to controls in reading and written expression as measured by standardized tests.
