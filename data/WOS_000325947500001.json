Time warping or curve registration aims at eliminating the phase variation, typically by applying transformations, the warping functions tau(n), to the function arguments. We propose a warping method that jointly estimates a decomposition of the warping function in warping components, and amplitude components. For the estimation routine, adaptive MCMC calculations are performed and implemented in C rather than R to increase computational speed. The R-C interface makes the program user-friendly, in that no knowledge of C is required and all input and output will be handled through R. The R package MRwarping contains all needed files.", "paper_title": "Warping Functional Datain Rand C via a Bayesian Multi resolution Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000325947500001"}
