In this paper, the time domain steady solutions of oscillators are perturbed with traditional regular method; the periodic time-varying Jocobian modulus matrices are decomposed with Sylvester theorem, and on the resulting space spanned by periodic vectors, the conditions under which the oscillator holds periodic steady states with any perturbations are analyzed. In this paper, stochastic calculus is applied to disclose the generation process of phase noise and calculate the phase jitter of the oscillator by injecting a pseudo sinusoidal signal in frequency domain, representing the white noise, and a 5 correlation signal in time domain into the oscillator. Applying the principle of frequency modulation, we learned how the power-law and the Lorentzian spectrums are formed. Their relations and the Lorentzian spectrums of harmonics are also worked out. Based on the periodic Jacobian modulus matrix, the simple algorithms for Floquet exponents and phase noise are constructed, as well as a simple case is demonstrated. The analysis difficulties and the future directions for the phase noise of oscillators are also pointed out at the end.", "paper_title": "Phase noise analysis of oscillators with Sylvester representation for periodic time-varying modulus matrix by regular perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000249266300006"}
