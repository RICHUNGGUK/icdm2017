It introduces new opportunities to prune the search space, and a technique based on dynamic programming to check the independence between groups. The proposed new algorithm yields one order less measured number of convexity checks than the related work for the same inputs and outputs.", "paper_title": "Optimisations Techniques for the Automatic ISA Customisation Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900016"}
