Several research works, often validated through analytical and simulative analysis, have attempted to evaluate the benefits of substituting TCP with SCTP, both for signaling and data transfer. In this work, we present a traffic generation and performance analysis tool to test SCTP on real networks. We study the performance of SCTP on real heterogeneous (wired/wireless) scenarios, providing results in terms of throughput and jitter, and comparing its performance against TCP and UDP over the same conditions. Our experimental analysis shows that the current performance of SCTP (operating on a Linux platform) does not justify the use of SCTP as a simple substitute for TCP.
