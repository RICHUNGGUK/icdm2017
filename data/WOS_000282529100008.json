During the execution of the project, the baseline schedule may become infeasible due to activity duration and resource disruptions. We propose and evaluate a number of dedicated exact reactive scheduling procedures as well as a tabu search heuristic for repairing a disrupted schedule, under the assumption that no activity can be started before its baseline starting time. We report on promising computational results obtained on a set of benchmark problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
