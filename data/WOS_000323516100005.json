However, the escape routing for staggered pin arrays, which is a key component of PCB routing, is significantly different from that for grid arrays. This paper presents a routing algorithm for the escape routing for staggered-pin-array PCBs. We first analyze the properties of staggered pin arrays, and propose an orthogonal-side wiring style that fully utilizes the routing resource of the staggered pin array. A linear programming/integer linear programming-based algorithm is presented to solve the staggered-pin-array escape routing problem. Experimental results show that our approach successfully routes all test cases efficiently and effectively.", "paper_title": "Escape Routing for Staggered-Pin-Array PCBs", "paper_id": "WOS:000323516100005"}
