In the proposed PSO-based MA (PSOMA), a novel encoding scheme is developed, and an effective local search based on Simulated Annealing (SA) with adaptive meta-Lamarckian learning strategy is proposed and incorporated into PSO. Simulation results based on well-known benchmarks and comparisons with some existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed hybrid algorithm for TSP.", "paper_title": "An effective PSO-based memetic algorithm for TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300149"}
