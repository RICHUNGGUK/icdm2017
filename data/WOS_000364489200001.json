An improvement based on attack analysis is proposed in this paper. The improved method takes full advantage of the data transmitted at various stages of the protocol. By guaranteeing the freshness of authentication messages, the authenticity of the generator of authentication messages, and the completeness of the authenticator, the improved protocol can resist various passive and active attacks. The forward secrecy of the improved protocol is proved under a Katz-Yung (KY) model. Compared with existing methods, the improved protocol is more effective and applicable.", "paper_title": "An Improved ID-Based Group Key Agreement Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000364489200001"}
