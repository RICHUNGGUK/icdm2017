In this paper we present and analyze two versions of an approach based on the scatter search metaheuristic technique for the automatic generation of software test cases using a branch coverage adequacy criterion. The first test case generator, called TCSS, uses a diversity property to extend the search of test cases to all branches of the program under test in order to generate test cases that cover these. The second, called TCSS-LS, is an extension of the previous test case generator which combines the diversity property with a local search method that allows the intensification of the search for test cases that cover the difficult branches. We present the results obtained by our generators and carry out a detailed comparison with many other generators, showing a good performance of our approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
