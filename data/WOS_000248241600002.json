Design, modeling, fabrication, and characterization of the CPW series switch are presented. An example CPW series capacitive switch with insertion loss less than 0.5 dB in the frequency range of 13-18 GHz and isolation better than 10 dB up to 18 GHz is discussed. The switch provides a minimum insertion loss of about 0.1 dB at the self-resonance frequency of 16 GHz and a maximum isolation of about 42 dB at 1 GHz.", "paper_title": "MEMS capacitive series switch fabricated using PCB technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000248241600002"}
