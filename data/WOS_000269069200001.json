The study also sought the participants' perspective of this experience by eliciting their reflections on the learning experience. Participant perceptions of the role of the 'on-line tutor' in this e-learning environment were also examined. The research adopted a qualitative approach through video-taped observation of the participants as they engaged with the resource. The resulting video data was analysed employing an inductive process of analysis. Semistructured interviews were also conducted with individual participants after the learning sessions were completed. Qualitative analysis of the interview transcriptions provided the participant perspective. Triangulation between the data validated researcher interpretations of the findings. Results revealed (a) all participants successfully engaged with the musical task in the e-learning environment, (b) five learning activities emerged from the analysis of the video data that were interpreted as: 'instruction', 'copying', 'practising', 'playing' and 'evaluating', (c) four 'participant perspective' themes emerged from the interview data that were interpreted as: 'activities', 'feelings', 'evaluation' and 'difficulties' (d) participants sought different levels of interaction with the on-line tutor' who was found to adopt the role of 'remote facilitator'.
