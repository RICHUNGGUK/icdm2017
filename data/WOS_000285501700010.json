Formal validations, security analyses, and computer implementations are discussed to demonstrate the correctness and feasibility of our algorithms. As compared to the schemes developed in conventional visual cryptography, our design delivers three significant advantages: (1) it is capable of sharing multiple (instead of only one or two) secret images in two shares; (2) it does not result in any extra pixel expansion so that the sizes of the secret image and the encrypted shares are exactly the same; and (3) it is simple and easy to implement. These advantages broaden the potential applicability and flexibility of visual secret sharing schemes.", "paper_title": "Visual Multiple-Secret Sharing by Circle Random Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000285501700010"}
