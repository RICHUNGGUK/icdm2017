Many algorithms have been proposed to tackle this problem, but their performance is not satisfactory because handling uncertainty incurs high processing cost. To accelerate such computation, we utilize GPUs (Graphics Processing Units). Our previous work accelerated an existing algorithm with a single GPU. In this paper, we extend the work to employ multiple GPUs. Proposed methods minimize the amount of data that need to be communicated among GPUs, and achieve load balancing as well. Based on the methods, we also present algorithms on a GPU cluster. Experiments show that the single-node methods realize near-linear speedups, and the methods on a GPU cluster of eight nodes achieve up to a 7.1 times speedup.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Frequent Itemset Mining on a GPU Cluster", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100017"}
