These ensembles are known to contain codes that asymptotically almost meet the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. It is shown that in these ensembles there exist codes which can correct a number of errors that grows linearly with the code length, when decoded with a low-complexity iterative decoder, which requires a number of iterations that is a logarithmic function of the code length. The results are supported by numerical examples, for various choices of the code parameters.", "paper_title": "Low-complexity error correction of Hamming-code-based LDPC codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000268246600002"}
