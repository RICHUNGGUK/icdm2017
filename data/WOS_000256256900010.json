A CDN is a technology used to efficiently distribute electronic content throughout an existing Intenet Protocol network. The problem consists of replicating content on the proxy servers and routing the requests for the content to a suitable proxy server in a CDN such that the total cost of distribution is minimized. An upper bound on end-to-end object transfer time is also taken into account. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear integer programming formulation which is linearized in three different ways. Two algorithms, one based on Benders decomposition and the other based on Lagrangean relaxation and decomposition, are described for the solution of the problem. Computational experiments are conducted by comparing the proposed linearizations and the two algorithms on randomly generated Internet topologies. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
