This article outlines some of the most important issues that still need to be addressed to ensure substantial progress in the field, namely (1) development and adoption of virtuous data collection and sharing practices, (2) shift in the focus of interest from individuals to dyads and groups, (3) endowment of artificial agents with internal representations of users and context, (4) modelling of cognitive and semantic processes underlying social behaviour and (5) identification of application domains and strategies for moving from laboratory to the real-world products.", "paper_title": "Open Challenges in Modelling, Analysis and Synthesis of Human Behaviour in Human-Human and Human-Machine Interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000357695700001"}
