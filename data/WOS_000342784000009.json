In this paper, a modified FTA approach, making full utilization of the existing safety analysis result, is put forward to achieve runtime safety analysis. The procedures of the approach are given in detail. This approach could be widely used in safety engineering of critical systems.", "paper_title": "A Modified FTA Approach to Achieve Runtime Safety Analysis of Critical Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784000009"}
