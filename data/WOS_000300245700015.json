These search algorithms use a population of solutions to maintain an acceptable diversity level during the process, thus their correct distribution is crucial for the search. This paper introduces a new population meta-heuristic called \"variable mesh optimization\" (VMO), in which the set of nodes (potential solutions) are distributed as a mesh. This mesh is variable, because it evolves to maintain a controlled diversity (avoiding solutions too close to each other) and to guide it to the best solutions (by a mechanism of resampling from current nodes to its best neighbour). This proposal is compared with basic population-based meta-heuristics using a benchmark of multimodal continuous functions, showing that VMO is a competitive algorithm.", "paper_title": "Variable mesh optimization for continuous optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300245700015"}
