The authors pointed out the inadequacy of solving SRAP instances using their integer programming formulation and commercial linear programming solvers. Similar experiences with IP models for SRAP are reported in [1]. In this article we reformulate SRAP as a set partitioning model with an additional knapsack constraint. This new formulation has an exponential number of columns and, to solve it, we implemented a branch-and-price/column generation algorithm. Extensive computational experiments showed that the new algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than standard branch-and-bound codes running on compact IP models introduced earlier. Instances taken from [1,7], which could not be solved there in hours of computation were solved here to optimality in just a few seconds.
