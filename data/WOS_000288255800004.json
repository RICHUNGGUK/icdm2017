Particularly, ecosystems are specified by means of multienvironment P systems composed of a finite number of environments, each of them having an extended P system with active membranes. The semantics is of a probabilistic type and it is implemented by assigning each rule of the system a probabilistic constant which depends on the environment and the run time. As a case study, two real ecosystems are described: scavenger birds in the Catalan Pyrenees and the zebra mussel (Dreissena Polymorpha) in Ribarroja reservoir (Spain).", "paper_title": "A computational modeling for real ecosystems based on P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800004"}
