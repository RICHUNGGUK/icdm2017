Overall performance in this context is a function not only of individual applications, but also of their interactions as they contend for both internal and external resources. Researchers must describe modern computer usage in terms of scenarios consisting of numerous I/O streams, timing information, and parallel tasks that enter and leave the system, rather than in terms of programs executing in isolation from the physical world and each other. Such use represents a new style of computing, which the authors call scenario-oriented to contrast it with other well-established computing styles such as general-purpose and application-specific.", "paper_title": "A new era of performance evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000249202600013"}
