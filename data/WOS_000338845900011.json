The proposed system can effectively reconstruct human faces in 3D using an approach robust to lighting conditions, and a fast method based on a Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) algorithm to estimate the depth. The reconstruction system is built by first creating 3D facial mapping from a personal identity vector of a face image. This mapping is then applied to real-world images captured with a built-in camera on a mobile device to form the corresponding 3D depth information. Finally, the facial texture from the face image is extracted and added to the reconstruction results. Experiments with an Android phone show that the implementation of this system as an Android application performs well. The advantage of the proposed method is an easy 3D reconstruction of almost all facial images captured in the real world with a fast computation. This has been clearly demonstrated in the Android application, which requires only a short time to reconstruct the 3D depth map.", "paper_title": "Rapid Implementation of 3D Facial Reconstruction from a Single Image on an Android Mobile Device", "paper_id": "WOS:000338845900011"}
