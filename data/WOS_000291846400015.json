Indeed, the latter comprise various middleware modules (e.g., data collection and filtering, generation of business events, integration with enterprise applications), which must be deployed and configured independently. In this paper we introduce APDL (AspireRFID Process Description Language), an XML based specification for describing and configuring RFID solutions. Using APDL one can minimize the steps and effort required to integrate and configure an RFID solution, since it unifies all the configuration parameters and steps comprising an RFID deployment. APDL supports several configuration parameters defined in the scope of the EPCglobal architecture and related standards. However, it extends beyond the EPCglobal architecture, to a wider class of RFID solutions. Furthermore, APDL is amendable by visual tools, which obviates the need to carry out low-level programming tasks in order to deploy an RFID solution. These tools are also presented and evaluated in the paper. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
