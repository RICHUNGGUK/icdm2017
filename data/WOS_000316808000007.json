Three different schemes, FH's, Guo's and MMP's schemes, for a curved boundary condition at second-order accuracy are used in the study and compared in detail. The multiple-relaxation-time (MRT) is adopted for better stability. In order to deal with the moving body boundary, a certain momentum is added to reflect the interaction between the fluid and the solid; and a refill method for new wetted nodes moving out from solid nodes has been proposed. The described method is applied to simulate static and moving cylinders in shallow waters. The corresponding experiments are further performed for validation of the present model. It is found that all of the three schemes produce similar results that agree well with the experimental data for the static cylinder. However, for the moving boundary, MMP's scheme performs best. Overall, the proposed modeling approach is able to simulate both, static and moving cylinders in shallow water flows at acceptable accuracy.", "paper_title": "MODELING MOVING BOUNDARY IN SHALLOW WATER BY LBM", "paper_id": "WOS:000316808000007"}
