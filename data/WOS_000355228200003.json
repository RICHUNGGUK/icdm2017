In this context, this paper reports on a study on how to make an existing algorithm, named (CE)-E-3 (from consensus between classification and clustering ensembles), more convenient by automatically tuning its main parameters. The (CE)-E-3 algorithm is based on a general optimisation framework that takes as input class membership estimates from existing classifiers, and a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the new (target) data to be classified, in order to yield a consensus labelling of the new data. To do so, two parameters have to be defined a priori by the user: the relative importance of classifier and cluster ensembles, and the number of iterations of the algorithm. We propose a differential evolution (DE) algorithm, named dynamic DE ((DE)-E-2), which is a computationally efficient alternative for optimising such parameters. (DE)-E-2 provides better results than DE by dynamically updating its control parameters. Moreover, competitive results were achieved when comparing (DE)-E-2 with three state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "A differential evolution algorithm to optimise the combination of classifier and cluster ensembles", "paper_id": "WOS:000355228200003"}
