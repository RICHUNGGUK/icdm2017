This conjecture was verified for periodic words by Brlek and Reutenauer themselves. Using their results for periodic words, we have recently proved the conjecture for uniformly recurrent words. In the present article we prove the conjecture in its general version by a new method without exploiting the result for periodic words. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
