In this paper, we develop a new method which incorporates dimensionality reduction into a direct density-ratio estimation procedure. Our key idea is to find a low-dimensional subspace in which densities are significantly different and perform density-ratio estimation only in this subspace. The proposed method, D-3-LHSS (Direct Density-ratio estimation with Dimensionality reduction via Least-squares Hetero-distributional Subspace Search), is shown to overcome the limitation of baseline methods.
