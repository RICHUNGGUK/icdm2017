Unfortunately, the bursty nature of the Internet traffic and ever changing network conditions present a problem in identifying the best choices of replicas. Suboptimal replica choices result in increased response latency and reduced system performance. In this work we present GeoPerf, a tool that tries to automate testing of geo-distributed replica selection algorithms. We used GeoPerf to test Cassandra and MongoDB, two popular data stores, and found bugs in each of these systems.", "paper_title": "Toward Automated Testing of Geo-Distributed Replica Selection Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200009"}
