One of the most important but costly operations is the similarity join that combines similar points from multiple datasets. In this paper, we examine the problem of processing K-nearest neighbor similarity join (KNN join). KNN join between two datasets, R and S, returns for each point in R its K most similar points in S. We propose a new index-based KNN join approach using the iDistance as the underlying index structure. We first present its basic algorithm and then propose two different enhancements. In the first enhancement, we optimize the original KNN join algorithm by using approximation bounding cubes. In the second enhancement, we exploit the reduced dimensions of data space. We conducted an extensive experimental study using both synthetic and real datasets, and the results verify the performance advantage of our schemes over existing KNN join algorithms.
