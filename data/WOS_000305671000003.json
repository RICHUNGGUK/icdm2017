We apply the computer algebra system Singular to decompose algebraic varieties and finally find a condition under which polynomial functions have quadratic iterative roots of quadratic polynomial form. This condition is equivalent to, but simpler than Schweizer and Sklar's and more convenient than Strycharz-Szemberg and Szemberg's. We further find all polynomial functions which have cubic iterative roots of the quadratic polynomial form and compute all those iterative roots. Moreover, we find all 2-dimensional homogeneous polynomial mappings of degree 2 which have iterative roots of the polynomial form and obtain expressions of some iterative roots.
