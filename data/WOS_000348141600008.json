This paper presents a design paradigm in which we optimize both assignment of a network node to a bus and slot multiplexing of a FlexRay network system under hard real-time constraints so that we can minimize the cost of wire harness for the FlexRay network system. We present a cost minimization problem as a non-linear model. We developed a network synthesis tool which was based on simulated annealing. Our experimental results show that our design paradigm achieved a 50.0% less cost than a previously proposed approach for a virtual cost model.", "paper_title": "Minimization of the Fabrication Cost for a Bridged-Bus-Based TDMA System under Hard Real-Time Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141600008"}
