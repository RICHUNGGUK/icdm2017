Nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) indices were used to characterize the aromaticity of the studied molecules. The tetraoxa[8]circulene molecules were found to consist of two antiaromatic perimeters (according to the Huckel \"4n\" antiaromaticity rule) that include 8 and 24 pi-electrons. Conversely, NICS calculations demonstrated the existence of a common pi-extended system (distributed like a flat ribbon) in the studied tetraoxa[8]circulene molecules. Thus, these symmetrical tetraoxa[8]circulene molecules provide examples of diatropic systems characterized by the presence of induced diatropic ring currents.", "paper_title": "Nucleus-independent chemical shift criterion for aromaticity in pi-extended tetraoxa[8]circulenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200035"}
