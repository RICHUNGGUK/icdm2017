Recent results proved hardness for a number of variants, when parameterized by the support size. We complement those results, by identifying three cases in which the problem becomes fixed-parameter tractable. Our results are based on a graph-theoretic representation of a bimatrix game, and on applying graph-theoretic tools on this representation.", "paper_title": "Parameterized Two-Player Nash Equilibrium", "paper_id": "WOS:000314692200005"}
