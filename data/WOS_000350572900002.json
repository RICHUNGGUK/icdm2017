Current smartphones enable users to easily install various applications that are purchased from the online market using their phone. In addition, the openness of the Android system even allows users to choose from various online markets. Because such openness also invokes critical threats such as malware and illegal use, several online markets employ strong authentication techniques. However, such methods can also inconvenience valid users. In this paper, we discuss such problems and propose the concept of an authentication model that makes purchased applications available in most cases.", "paper_title": "Authentication of mobile applications through various local distributors", "paper_id": "WOS:000350572900002"}
