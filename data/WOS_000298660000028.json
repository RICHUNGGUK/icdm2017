Governing equations have been obtained using coupled dynamic thermoelastic equation and the energy equation with parabolic approximation of temperature distribution through thickness of the shell. The governing equations have been solved using the Galerkin finite element method with Kantrovich approximation for space and time domains. An illustrative example was solved using the present method. Displacement, force, moments, and stress fields have been extracted for the illustrative example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
