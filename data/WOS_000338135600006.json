Node criticalities are typically computed using the complementary path delay. An alternative approach to compute the criticality using the circuit delay has been recently proposed. In this paper, we discuss in detail, the use of circuit delay to compute node criticalities and show that the criticality thus found is not equal to the conventional measure found using complementary path delay. However, there is a monotonic relationship between them and the two measures can be used interchangeably. We derive new bounds for the global criticality and propose a pruning algorithm based on these bounds to improve the accuracy and speed of computation. The use of this pruning technique results in a significant speedup in criticality computations. We obtain an order of magnitude average speedup for ISCAS benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Statistical Criticality Computation Using the Circuit Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000338135600006"}
