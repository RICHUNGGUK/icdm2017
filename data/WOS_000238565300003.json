This method is shown to be globally convergent under some assumptions. It is new feature that the proof of global convergence of this method is very simple without proving so-called Property (*) given by Gilbert and Nocedal for general unconstrained optimization problems. Our numerical results show that this method is efficient for the given test problems.", "paper_title": "A nonlinear conjugate gradient method based on the MBFGS secant condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238565300003"}
