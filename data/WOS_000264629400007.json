This paper proposes static timing analysis that takes power supply noise into consideration where the dependence of noise on input vectors and spatial and temporal correlations are handled statistically. We construct a statistical model of power supply voltage that dynamically varies with spatial and temporal correlation, and represent it as a set of uncorrelated variables. We demonstrate that power-voltage variations are highly correlated and adopting principal component analysis as an orthogonalization technique can effectively reduce the number of variables. Experiments confirmed the validity of our model and the accuracy of tinting analysis. We also discuss the accuracy and CPU time in association with the reduced number of variables.", "paper_title": "Statistical Timing Analysis Considering Spatially and Temporally Correlated Dynamic Power Supply Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000264629400007"}
