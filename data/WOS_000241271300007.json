Recently, a variety of co-evolution-based methods have been investigated toward this goal. In this study, we introduced a partial correlation coefficient as a new measure for the degree of co-evolution between proteins, and proposed its use to predict protein-protein interactions. Results: The accuracy of the prediction by the proposed method was compared with those of the original mirror tree method and the projection method previously developed by our group. We found that the partial correlation coefficient effectively reduces the number of false positives, as compared with other methods, although the number of false negatives increased in the prediction by the partial correlation coefficient.", "paper_title": "Partial correlation coefficient between distance matrices as a new indicator of protein-protein interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271300007"}
