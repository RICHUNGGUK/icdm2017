However, the current connect number, sampling rate, and signal types of sensors are generally restricted by the device. Meanwhile, in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, each sensor connected to the device is required to write complicated and cumbersome data collection program code. In this paper, to solve these problems, a new method is proposed to design a reconfigurable smart sensor interface for industrial WSN in IoT environment, in which complex programmable logic device (CPLD) is adopted as the core controller. Thus, it can read data in parallel and in real time with high speed on multiple different sensor data. The standard of IEEE1451.2 intelligent sensor interface specification is adopted for this design. It comprehensively stipulates the smart sensor hardware and software design framework and relevant interface protocol to realize the intelligent acquisition for common sensors. A new solution is provided for the traditional sensor data acquisitions. The device is combined with the newest CPLD programmable technology and the standard of IEEE1451.2 intelligent sensor specification. Performance of the proposed system is verified and good effects are achieved in practical application of IoT to water environment monitoring.", "paper_title": "A Reconfigurable Smart Sensor Interface for Industrial WSN in IoT Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800055"}
