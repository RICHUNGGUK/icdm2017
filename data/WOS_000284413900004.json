First, the linearising control law is derived for the nominal diesel plant. It achieves tracking of suitable references (corresponding to low emissions and fuel consumption) for both the air-fuel ratio and the fraction of the recirculated exhaust gas. The engine model used for control design is formulated as a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model, and a fuzzy estimation algorithm is used to identify the plant parameters. Then, the identified parameters are used to adapt the controller online. The simulated diesel engine is a medium duty Caterpillar 3126B with six cylinders, equipped with a variable geometry turbocharger and an exhaust gas recirculation valve. The proposed controller design is based on the reduced third-order mean value model and implemented as a closed-form DFL control law on the full-order model. The resulting controllers, with and without adaptation, are assessed through simulations with a software-in-the-loop architecture using dSpace simulator. The adaptive controller, in particular, exhibits good control performance, ensuring global stability and tracking of output references with zero steady state offset.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear airpath control of modern diesel powertrains: a fuzzy systems approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000284413900004"}
