This paper presents an efficiently constructible f-sensitivity distance oracle that given a triplet (s,t,F), where s and t are vertices and F is a set of forbidden edges such that |F|a parts per thousand currency signf, returns an estimate of the distance between s and t in G(V,Ea-F). For an integer parameter ka parts per thousand yen1, the size of the data structure is O(fkn (1+1/k) log (nW)), where W is the heaviest edge in G, the stretch (approximation ratio) of the returned distance is (8k-2)(f+1), and the query time is O(|F|a <...log (2) na <...log log na <...log log d), where d is the distance between s and t in G(V,Ea-F). Our result differs from previous ones in two major respects: (1) it is the first to consider approximate oracles for general graphs (and thus obtain a succinct data structure); (2) our result holds for an arbitrary number of forbidden edges. In contrast, previous papers concern f-sensitive exact distance oracles, which consequently have size Omega(n (2)). Moreover, those oracles support forbidden sets F of size |F|a parts per thousand currency sign2. The paper also considers f-sensitive compact routing schemes, namely, routing schemes that avoid a given set of forbidden (or failed) edges. It presents a scheme capable of withstanding up to two edge failures. Given a message M destined to t at a source vertex s, in the presence of a forbidden edge set F of size |F|a parts per thousand currency sign2 (unknown to s), our scheme routes M from s to t in a distributed manner, over a path of length at most O(k) times the length of the optimal path (avoiding F). The total amount of information stored in vertices of G is O(kn (1+1/k) log (nW)log n). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result obtaining an f-sensitive compact routing scheme for general graphs.", "paper_title": "f-Sensitivity Distance Oracles and Routing Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000303530100008"}
