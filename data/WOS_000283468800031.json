Efficient methods for water analysis need to be developed in order to achieve higher water qualities. The common methods for chemical oxygen demand (COD) determination of waste water, such as the dichromate titration method and a flow injection, are time-consuming and complex. Therefore, near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, which offers a number of advantages over traditional chemical methods, was employed in this work to determine COD and pH in waste water rapidly. Calibration models for COD and pH were established by correlating the reference data (obtained from the analysis with the dichromate titration method) with the data of NIR spectra using a partial least-squares (PLS) regression. The results indicate that the performance of PLS regression models are good to predict COD and pH value, with high correlation coefficients and low root mean square error. The COD PLS model using raw spectra gives the best prediction. The pH PLS model using first derivative and 4 latent variables has the best prediction. The results suggest that NIR spectroscopy is an alternative method, relative to the traditional chemical methods, for the rapid analysis of COD and pH value in waste water.", "paper_title": "A NEW METHOD TO RAPIDLY DETERMINE QUALITY OF WASTE WATER", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468800031"}
