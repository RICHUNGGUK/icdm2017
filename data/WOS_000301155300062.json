In this paper, an effective coevolutionary differential evolution with harmony search algorithm (CDEHS) is proposed to solve the reliability-redundancy optimization problem by dividing the problem into a continuous part and an integer part. In CDEHS, two populations evolve simultaneously and cooperatively, where one population for the continuous part evolves by means of differential evolution while another population for the integer part evolves by means of harmony search. After half of the whole evolving process, the integer part stops evolving and provides the best solution to the other part for further evolving with differential evolution. Simulations results based on three typical problems and comparisons with some existing algorithms show that the proposed CDEHS is effective, efficient and robust for solving the reliability-redundancy optimization problem.
