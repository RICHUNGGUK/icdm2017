The advantages of the local descriptors are the resistance to the local geometric and photometric errors and the robustness to the expression variations. In this paper, the authors propose a new local descriptor called the histogram of gradient phases (HGP), which has some intriguing properties compared with the existing local descriptors such as the histogram of orientated gradients and DAISY for face recognition under the unconstrained conditions. In contrast with the histogram of the oriented gradient descriptor, the orientation histogram is computed from the estimated gradient phase distributions instead of weighting the votes of the gradient magnitudes. In this paper, the phase distributions are estimated by means of the gradient phases and the variances are decided by the estimated gradient signal-to-noise ratios of the pixels in a local region. The HGP descriptor which takes the confidence of the gradient phase into account is more discriminative and less sensitive to the normalisation process than most local descriptors, which significantly degrade without a proper normalisation. The simulation results show that the proposed HGP descriptor achieves a better performance and is more robust than the existing local descriptors.", "paper_title": "Histogram of gradient phases: a new local descriptor for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000348194100009"}
