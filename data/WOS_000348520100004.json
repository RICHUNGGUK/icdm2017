The time delays existing in 2-D systems are assumed to be infinitely distributed in the discrete-time domain. Factors leading to incomplete observations include delayed and missing measurements, sensor quantization and saturations. A uniform mathematical model is employed to describe the phenomenon of incomplete observations. Our attention is focused on the design of a linear state estimator for the discussed 2-D systems, such that for all admissible sensor failures, possible infinite distributed time delays and incomplete observations, the error dynamics is mean-square asymptotically stable, and the steady-state error of the estimation is not more than a prescribed level [GRAPHICS] . The flexibility of the proposed approach is confirmed by a numerical simulation.", "paper_title": "Reliable H-infinity state estimation for 2-D discrete systems with infinite distributed delays and incomplete observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100004"}
