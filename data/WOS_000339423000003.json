One of the most recent methods to be developed is the flux reconstruction approach, which allows various well-known high-order schemes to be cast within a single unifying framework. Whilst a connection between flux reconstruction and the more widely adopted discontinuous Galerkin method has been established elsewhere, it still remains to fully investigate the explicit connections between the many popular variants of the discontinuous Galerkin method and the flux reconstruction approach. In this work, we closely examine the connections between three nodal versions of tensor-product discontinuous Galerkin spectral element approximations and two types of flux reconstruction schemes for solving systems of conservation laws on quadrilateral meshes. The different types of discontinuous Galerkin approximations arise from the choice of the solution nodes of the Lagrange basis representing the solution and from the quadrature approximation used to integrate the mass matrix and the other terms of the discretization. By considering both linear and nonlinear advection equations on a regular grid, we examine the mathematical properties that connect these discretizations. These arguments are further confirmed by the results of an empirical numerical study.
