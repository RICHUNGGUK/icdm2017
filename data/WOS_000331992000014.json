The study had two major objectives: (i) to create a correlation between the unbinding force profiles and the inhibition activities of these compounds expressed as IC50 values; (ii) to investigate the unbinding mechanism and to reveal atomistic insights, which could help identify accessory binding sites and transient interactions. Overall, we carried out 1.35 mu s of cumulative SMD simulations. We showed that SMD could qualitatively discriminate binders from nonbinders, while it failed to properly rank series of inhibitors, particularly when IC50 values were too similar. From a mechanistic standpoint, SMD provided useful insights related to transient and dynamical interactions, which could complement static description obtained by X-ray crystallography experiments. In conclusion, the present study represents a further step toward a systematic exploitation of SMD and other dynamical approaches in structure-based drug design and computational medicinal chemistry.", "paper_title": "Steered Molecular Dynamics Simulations for Studying Protein-Ligand Interaction in Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 5", "paper_id": "WOS:000331992000014"}
