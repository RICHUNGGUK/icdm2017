Under the hypothesis that the derivative of the function associated with the least square problem satisfies a majorant condition, a local convergence analysis is presented. This analysis allows us to obtain the optimal convergence radius and the biggest range for the uniqueness of stationary point, and to unify two previous and unrelated results. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
