This role-based framework is designed to meet the following objectives: (1) provide the user community with a tool to manage their allocations and optimize their resource utilization; (2) provide operational staff with the ability to monitor and tune resource performance; (3) provide management with a tool to monitor utilization, user base, and performance of resources; and (4) provide metrics to help measure scientific impact. Although initially focused on the XSEDE program, XSEDE Metrics on Demand can be adapted to any high-performance computing environment. The framework includes a computationally lightweight application kernel auditing system that utilizes performance kernels to measure overall system performance. This allows continuous resource auditing to measure all aspects of system performance including filesystem performance, processor and memory performance, and network latency and bandwidth. Metrics that focus on scientific impact, such as publications, citations and external funding, will be included to help quantify the important role high-performance computing centers play in advancing research and scholarship.
