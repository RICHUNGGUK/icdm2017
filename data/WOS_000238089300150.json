The game is played by using finger shadow cast by a projector to move a ball rendered by a computer. We use a camera to track the movement of the finger shadow. A simple algorithm to move this ball was developed, which depends on the position of the shadow in the camera picture. The algorithm consist of three parts: the recognition of the shadow, the calculation of the ball by using transformation matrices, and the recognition of the collision between the ball and the shadow and consequential the direction of the ball-movement.", "paper_title": "Computer interaction by camera tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300150"}
