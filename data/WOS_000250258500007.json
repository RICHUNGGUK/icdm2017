For this purpose, the study based on 75 user survey data shows that individual external quality subcharacteristics are positively associated with user satisfaction as defined in 'quality in use'. This study also investigates the external quality subcharacteristics that strongly influence user satisfaction. Our results provide guidance for the revision of the Standard as well as supporting management decisions (i.e., resource allocation) aimed at improving software product quality.
