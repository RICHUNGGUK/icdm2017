The accelerator is meant to address the MIMO decoding bottlenecks associated with the convergence of multiple high-speed wireless standards onto a single device. It is scalable in the number of antennas, bandwidth, modulation format, and most importantly, present and emerging decoder algorithms. It features a Harvard-like architecture with complex vector operands and a deeply pipelined fixed-point complex arithmetic processing unit. When implemented on a Xilinx Virtex-4 LX200FF1513 field-programmable gate array (FPGA), the design occupied 43% of overall FPGA resources. The accelerator shows an advantage of up to three orders of magnitude (1000 times) in power-delay product for typical MIMO decoding operations relative to a general purpose DSP. When compared to dedicated application-specific IC (ASIC) implementations of mmse MIMO decoders, the accelerator showed a degradation of 340%-17%, depending on the actual ASIC being considered. In order to optimize the design for both speed and area, specific challenges had to be overcome. These include: definition of the processing units and their interconnection; proper dynamic scaling of the signal; and memory partitioning and parallelism.", "paper_title": "A MIMO Decoder Accelerator for Next Generation Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000283548500004"}
