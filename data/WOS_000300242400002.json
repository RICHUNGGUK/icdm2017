We consider three different notions of fairness, namely proportionality, envy-freeness, and equitability for allocations of divisible and indivisible goods and chores. We present a series of results on the price of fairness under the three different notions that quantify the efficiency loss in fair allocations compared to optimal ones. Most of our bounds are either exact or tight within constant factors. Our study is of an optimistic nature and aims to identify the potential of fairness in allocations.", "paper_title": "The Efficiency of Fair Division", "paper_id": "WOS:000300242400002"}
