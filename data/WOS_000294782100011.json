Because of the large number of genes and the complex nature of biological networks, various analysis methods have been proposed. One such method is \"gene shaving,\" a procedure which identifies subsets of the genes with coherent expression patterns and large variation across samples. Since combining genomic information from multiple sources can improve classification and prediction of diseases, in this paper we proposed a new method, \"ICA gene shaving\" (ICA, independent component analysis), for jointly analyzing gene expression and copy number data. First we used ICA to analyze joint measurements, gene expression and copy number, of a biological system and project the data onto statistically independent biological processes. Next, we used these results to identify patterns of variation in the data and then applied an iterative shaving method. We investigated the properties of our proposed method by analyzing both simulated and real data. We demonstrated that the robustness of our method to noise using simulated data. Using breast cancer data, we showed that our method is superior to the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) gene shaving method for identifying genes associated with breast cancer.", "paper_title": "Integrated Analysis of Gene Expression and Copy Number Data on Gene Shaving Using Independent Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000294782100011"}
