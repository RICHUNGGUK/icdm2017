The present article explains how the notion of \"Object with Effective Homology\" on the contrary allows the user to recursively obtain all the components of the Serre and Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequences, when the data are objects with effective homology. In particular the computability problem of the higher differentials is solved, the extension problem at abutment is also recursively solved. Furthermore, these methods have been concretely implemented as an extension of the Kenzo computer program. Two typical examples of spectral sequence computations are reported. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
