FCT-Conference, Poznan, Poland, Lecture Notes in Computer Science 56. pp. 171-176 (1977)). It showed that for the case vertical bar X vertical bar >= 2, the set along with Q((i)) = {f(i) vertical bar f is an element of Q}, i >= 2 are all disjunctive. Since then these disjunctive sets are often be quoted. Following Shyr and Thierrin showed that the half sets Q(ev) = {f is an element of Q vertical bar vertical bar f vertical bar = even} and Q(od) = Q\\Q(ev) of Q are disjunctive, Chien proved that each of the set Q(p,r) = {u is an element of Q vertical bar vertical bar u vertical bar equivalent to r (mod p)}, 0 <= r < p is disjunctive, where p is a prime number. In this paper, we generalize this property to that all the languages Q(n,r) = {u is an element of Q vertical bar vertical bar u vertical bar equivalent to r (mod n)}, 0 <= r < n are disjunctive languages, where n is any positive integer. We proved that for any n >= 1, k >= 2, (Q(n,0))(k) are all regular languages. Some algebraic properties related to the family of languages {Q(n,r) vertical bar n >= 2, 0 <= r < n} are investigated.", "paper_title": "Some properties of the disjunctive languages contained in Q", "paper_id": "WOS:000286625600001"}
