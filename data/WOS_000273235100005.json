A probabilistic formulation of the SLAM problem is introduced, and a solution based on the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF-SLAM) is shown. Important issues of convergence, consistency, observability, data association and scaling in EKF-SLAM are discussed from both theoretical and practical points of view. Major extensions to the basic EKF-SLAM method and some recent advances in SLAM are also presented.", "paper_title": "SIMULTANEOUS LOCALIZATION AND MAPPING: A FEATURE-BASED PROBABILISTIC APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000273235100005"}
