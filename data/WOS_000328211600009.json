For the discrete analytic method, the sensitivity equations are obtained by taking analytic derivatives of the discretized equilibrium equations with respect to the shape design parameters. For the CSE method, the equilibrium equations are firstly differentiated to form a set of linear continuous sensitivity equations and then discretized for solving the shape sensitivities. The sensitivity equations can be derived by taking the material derivatives (total form) or the partial derivatives (local form) of the equilibrium equations. The total form CSE method is shown for the first time to be equivalent, after finite element discretization, to the discrete analytic method for nonlinear second-order differential equations of a particular form with design dependent loads when they use the same: (1) finite element discretization, (2) numerical integration of element matrices, (3) design velocity fields that are linear with respect to the design variable and (4) shape functions for domain transformation and for design velocity field calculations. The shape sensitivity equations for three-dimensional geometric nonlinear elastic structures and linear potential flow are derived by using both total form CSE and discrete analytic method to show the equivalence of the two methods for these specific examples. The accuracy of shape sensitivity analysis is verified by potential flow around an airfoil and a joined beam with an airfoil under gust load. The results show that analytic sensitivity results are consistent with the complex step results.", "paper_title": "Equivalence of continuum and discrete analytic sensitivity methods for nonlinear differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000328211600009"}
