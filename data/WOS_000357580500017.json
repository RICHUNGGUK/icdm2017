The speed at which both keepers and violators of secure networks are evolving is relatively close. Nowadays, network infrastructures contain a large number of event logs captured by Firewalls and Domain Controllers (DCs). However, these logs are increasingly becoming an obstacle for network administrators in analyzing networks for malicious activities. Forensic investigators mission to detect malicious activities and reconstruct incident scenarios is extremely complex considering the number, as well as the quality of these event logs. This paper presents the building blocks for a model for automated network readiness and awareness. The idea for this model is to utilize the current network security outputs to construct forensically comprehensive evidence. The proposed model covers the three vital phases of the cybercrime management chain, which are: 1) Forensics Readiness, 2) Active Forensics, and 3) Forensics Awareness.", "paper_title": "Cyberspace Forensics Readiness and Security Awareness Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000357580500017"}
