The demand captured from each user by the facility will be proportional to the users buying power and inversely proportional to a function of the user-facility distance. Uncertainty exists on the buying power (weight) of the users. This is modeled by assuming that a set of scenarios exists, each scenario corresponding to a weight realization. The objective is to locate the facility following the Savage criterion, i.e., the minimax-regret location is sought. The problem is formulated as a global optimization problem with objective written as difference of two convex monotonic functions. The numerical results obtained show that a branch and bound using this new method for obtaining bounds clearly outperforms benchmark procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
