For convenience, most of those devices are small and of limited power and computation capacity. In this paper, we propose a robust user authentication and key agreement scheme suitable for ubiquitous computing environments. The main merits include: (1) a security-sensitive verification table is not required in the server; (2) the password can be chosen and changed freely by the clients and cannot be derived by the privileged administrator of the server; (3) all well-known security threats are solved in our proposed scheme; (4) the scheme does not have a serious time-synchronization problem; (5) the client and the server can establish a common session key; (6) the scheme is practical and efficient; (7) the scheme can preserve the privacy of the client's secret key even if the secret information stored in a smart card is compromised.
