The objective is to minimize the maximum congestion which is equal to the maximum product of the weight of a link and the number of times that the link is passed by the embedding. In this paper, we design a polynomial time approximation scheme for this problem.", "paper_title": "A polynomial time approximation scheme for embedding a directed hypergraph on a weighted ring", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969100011"}
