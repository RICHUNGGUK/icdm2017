We consider the problem of determining the minimum cost bandwidth assignment of a network, while guaranteeing a reliability level of the solution. If the optimal bandwidth assignment and routing of traffic demands are accomplished, the reliability criterion requires that network flows remain feasible with high probability, regarding that the performance of microwave links is prone to variations due to external factors, e.g., weather. We introduce a chance-constrained programming approach to tackle this problem and we present reformulations to standard integer linear programming models, including a budget-constrained formulation. To improve the solving performance, we propose new valid inequalities and a primal heuristic. Computational results present a performance analysis of the valid inequalities and the heuristic. Further, the outperformance of the novel model compared to more traditional approaches is documented.", "paper_title": "Chance-Constrained Optimization of Reliable Fixed Broadband Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343127300017"}
