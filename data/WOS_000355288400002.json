The references are meant to be employed in high-performance trajectory tracking and dynamic positioning applications. The path planning problem is not in the scope of this work. A reference model that synthesises references concerning a single Degree-of-Freedom (DoF) motion is initially described. Then, the use of the synthesised references as the parametrisation for other references concerning multiple DoF motion along curvature-continuous paths is exploited. Results from computer simulations and full-scale sea trials, both based on the NTNU's ROV Minerva, are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Path Generation for High-Performance Motion of ROVs Based on a Reference Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000355288400002"}
