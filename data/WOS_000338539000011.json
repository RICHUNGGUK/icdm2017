We first present a new stochastic soft-capacitated model called The 2-Stage Soft Capacitated Facility Location Problem and solve it via an approximation algorithm by reducing it to linear-cost version of 2-stage facility location problem and dynamic facility location problem. We then present a novel robust model of soft-capacitated facility location, The Robust Soft Capacitated Facility Location Problem. To solve it, we improve the approximation algorithm proposed by Byrka et al. (LP-rounding algorithms for facility-location problems. CoRR, 2010a) for RFTFL and then treat it similarly as in the stochastic case. The improvement results in an approximation factor of alpha + 4 for the robust fault-tolerant facility location problem, which is best so far.", "paper_title": "Approximating soft-capacitated facility location problem with uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000338539000011"}
