The imported SAT format files are used to produce the finite element mesh for MSC.PATRAN. Based on the Monte-Carlo random sample principle, the material heterogeneity of cement composites with randomly distributed fibers is described by the WEIBULL distribution function. In this paper, a concept called \"soft region\" including micro-defects, micro-voids, etc. is put forward for the simulation of crack propagation in fiber-reinforced cement composites. The performance of the numerical model is demonstrated by several examples involving crack initiation and growth in the composites under three-dimensional stress conditions: tensile loading; compressive loading and crack growth along a bi-material interface.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional numerical simulation and cracking analysis of fiber-reinforced cement-based composites", "paper_id": "WOS:000291712200005"}
