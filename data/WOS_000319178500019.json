Given planar MRI images before and after IV contrast medium injection, BreDAn generates kinematic graphs, color maps of signal increase and decrease and finally detects high risk breast areas. The advantage of BreDAn, which has been validated and tested successfully, is the automation of the radiodiagnostic process in an accurate and reliable manner. It can potentially facilitate radiologists' workload. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
