However, existing approaches have a major shortcoming, as they assume the server is trustworthy and require complete disclosure of sensitive location information by the user. In this work, we propose a novel framework and a set of protocols to solve this problem. Specifically, in our scheme, a user provides a service provider with role and location tokens along with a request. The service provider consults with a role authority and a location authority to verify the tokens and evaluate the policy. However, none of the servers learn the requesting user's identity, role, or location. In this paper, we define the protocols and the policy enforcement scheme, and present a formal proof of a number of security properties.", "paper_title": "Privacy-Preserving Enforcement of Spatially Aware RBAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000306557900002"}
