In the case of ac motor drives, in contrast to conventional vector control where the inverter is not taken into consideration by the controller, the proposed control integrates the inverter model and the inverter states. It allows obtaining faster torque dynamics than vector control algorithms. The main design specifications are a reduced switching frequency and simple hardware implementation. A predictive sliding mode controller has been developed, designed as finite-state machine, and implemented with a FPGA. This new logic FPGA torque and speed controller has been developed, analyzed, and experimentally verified.", "paper_title": "A Switching Control Strategy for the Reduction of Torque Ripple for PMSM", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900007"}
