In this context, employing also models from previous authors' work, the paper derives analytical models for the estimation of channel utilization and media access delay for IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks in finite load conditions with and without exposed terminals. The simulation results show that the analytical estimated channel utilization and media access delay metrics are fairly accurate.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of exposed terminal effect in IEEE 802.11 ad hoc networks in finite load conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800037"}
