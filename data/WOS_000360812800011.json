This paper presented a PID Controller with Double Loops (PCDL) to control the tilt angle and velocity of a two-wheeled robot. The angle controller is the regular negative feedback, while the velocity control is the positive feedback. The Double Loops work cooperatively to endow the system with strong anti-interference ability. The stability of the whole system is analyzed and the criterion of the system stability is developed. The simulation and experiments showed that the two-wheeled robot can self-balance and move at an expected velocity and the system has strong anti-interference ability.", "paper_title": "A Controller Combining Positive Velocity Feedback with Negative Angle Feedback for a Two-Wheeled Robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000360812800011"}
