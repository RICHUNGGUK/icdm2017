This paper is concerned with the stabilization of genetic regulatory networks with leakage delays. Some novel conditions for stabilizing the GRNs are obtained based on Lyapunov method. The sampled-data controller is designed by solving linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Two numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.
