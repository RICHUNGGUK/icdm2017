In this paper, we provide a complete description of Yao's protocol, along with a rigorous proof of security. Despite the importance of Yao's protocol to the theory of cryptography and in particular to the field of secure computation, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that an explicit proof of security has been published.", "paper_title": "A Proof of Security of Yao's Protocol for Two-Party Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000264963100002"}
