To withstand a car's battery large voltage variations, from 5 V to 40 V, the circuit features an embedded pseudo-regulator providing a stable bias current for the bandgap core. High-voltage (HV) MOS count has been kept low thus allowing the design of a compact BGR with an area of 0.118 mm(2). The BGR has been designed to operate in automotive extended temperature range (-40 degrees C to 150 degrees C) and it provides a stable voltage of 1.21 V, which is also used as reference for a cascade 3.7 V linear regulator. Measurements carried on fabricated IC samples prove the effectiveness of the BGR design in terms of supported input voltage variations and operating temperature range, temperature drift, line regulation and PSRR performance.", "paper_title": "BANDGAP VOLTAGE REFERENCE IC FOR HV AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS WITH PSEUDO-REGULATED BIAS AND SERVICE REGULATOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000316902600006"}
