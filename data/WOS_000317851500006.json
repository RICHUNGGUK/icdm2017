As far as proposed layered model, at each layer of hierarchy, it concerned two components that were used are sparse coding and pooling operation. While the sparse coding was used to solve increasingly complex sparse feature representations, the pooling operation by comparing sparse outputs was used to measure the match between a stored prototype and the input sub-image. It is recommended that value of the best matching should be kept and discarding the others. The proposed model is implemented and tested taking into account two ranges of recognition tasks i.e. image recognition and speech recognition (on isolated word vocabulary). Experimental results with various parameters demonstrate that proposed scheme leads to extract more efficient features than other methods.", "paper_title": "HIERARCHICAL SPARSE METHOD WITH APPLICATIONS IN VISION AND SPEECH RECOGNITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000317851500006"}
