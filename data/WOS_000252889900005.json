Explicit estimations of the ultimate bounds are derived. The results presented in this paper contain all the existing results as special cases. In particular, the critical cases, b -> 1(+) and a -> 0(+), for which the previous methods failed, have been solved using a unified formula.", "paper_title": "Globally exponentially attractive sets of the family of Lorenz systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000252889900005"}
