This technique has been applied to the design and implementation of a 6-bit 0.13 mu m CMOS flash Analog-to-Digital converter for Ultra-Wide Band applications. Simulation results show 5.76-bit at 1 GS/s with a power consumption of only 182 mW, validated with experimental measurements carried out with 3-bit circuit tiles of the 6-bit flash A/D converter.
