It can be widely used in many applications such as encrypting large data efficiently. In the literature, the problem of cheating is under consideration in secret sharing. Recently, Horng et al. pointed out that cheating is possible in k-out-of-n VC schemes, and presented two kinds of the cheating prevention schemes for protecting honest participants. One of them is the authentication based cheating prevention scheme. In this paper, we analyze the definition of cheating prevention and propose a new authentication based cheating prevention scheme. This scheme is constructed with Naor-Shamir's VC scheme. Finally, we give the security analysis to prove that the proposed scheme is immune to cheating. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
