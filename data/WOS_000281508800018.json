By using the method of \"quasi-order <=\", two of the present authors [8] claimed to have proved this conjecture by showing that T < P.(2, 6, n 9) for all trees T of order n with T is not an element of {P(n), P(n)(2, 2, n - 5), P(n)(2, 4, n - 7) P(n)(2, 6, n-9)}, where P(n), P(n)(2, 2, n - 5) and P(n)(2, 4, n - 7) are known to be the trees of order n with the first, second and third greatest energies. In this paper, we show that the trees T(n)(2, 2 vertical bar 2, 2) and P(n)(2, 6, n - 9) are quasi-order incomparable, thus the above result T < P(n)(2, 6, n-9) is not true for T = T(n)(2, 2 vertical bar 2, 2). In this sense, the conjecture proposed in [6] has not been settled yet, and it cannot be settled by only using the quasi-order method.", "paper_title": "On a Conjecture on the Tree with Fourth Greatest Energy", "paper_id": "WOS:000281508800018"}
