Roughly speaking, for a given degree of freedom a solution associated with adaptive, locally refined and locally adjusted meshes is more accurate than the solution given by uniform meshes. In this work, we answer the question which meshes are better conditioned. We found, for approximately same degree of freedom (same size of matrix), it is easier to solve a system of equations associated with an adaptive mesh.", "paper_title": "Which meshes are better conditioned: Adaptive, uniform, locally refined or locally adjusted?", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400014"}
