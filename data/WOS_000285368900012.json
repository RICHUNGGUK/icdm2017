The method used is the mode superposition. It consists in exciting, with two actuators, two standing waves space shifted of a quarter wavelength and time shifted of a quarter period. Thanks to an analytical model giving the general solution of the flexural wave, we define the ideal conditions ensuring the best quality of this wave across the beam. Then, through an optimization process, we get the excitation parameters, actuator positions and driving frequency, that allow to approach at most these conditions. (C) 2010 IMACS.
