Illegal copying digital content abuses become a serious problem. Because the mobile devices are more portable and individualized than personal computers, anyone can access the network resources at anytime from anywhere. However, valuable digital contents without proper protection make the content vulnerable to unauthorized copying, modification and re-distribution, causing revenue losses to service providers. Thus, constructing an effective Digital Right Management (DRM) system has become an important issue. On the basis of the mobile device, we propose an efficient digital rights management protocol. We apply symmetrical cryptosystem, asymmetrical cryptosystem, digital signature and one-way hash function mechanisms in our scheme. To overcome the computing resource weakness problem of mobile devices, we also integrate digital certificate, hardware information and one time password mechanisms such that the security, persistent protection, integrity, authentication, track usage of DRM work, changeable access right, integration and portability issues will be assured. In this way, the mobile user can access the digital content securely in the enterprise via authorization mechanism. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
