It is shown that the use of certain prior structures, with improper priors on the shape parameters, lead to improper posteriors. These results imply that the posteriors associated to some of the asymmetric exponential power models studied in Naranjo et al. (2014) are improper. Alternative improper priors, inspired by the structure of the independence Jeffreys prior, as well as vague proper priors are pointed out.", "paper_title": "Letter to the Editor: on the use of improper priors for the shape parameters of asymmetric exponential power models", "paper_id": "WOS:000361831500014"}
