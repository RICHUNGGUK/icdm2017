Mainstream approaches, however, failed to support dynamic, self-managed compositions that would empower even non-technical users to build their own orchestrations. Indeed, because of the changeable world in which they are embedded, service compositions must be able to adapt to changes that may happen at run-time. Unfortunately, mainstream SOC languages, like BPEL and BPMN, make it quite hard to develop such kind of self-adapting orchestrations. We claim that this is mostly due to the imperative programming paradigm they are based on. To overcome this limitation we propose a radically different, strongly declarative approach to model service orchestration, which is easier to use and results in more flexible and self-adapting orchestrations. An ad-hoc engine, leveraging well-known planning techniques, interprets such models to support dynamic service orchestration at run-time.", "paper_title": "DSOL: a declarative approach to self-adaptive service orchestrations", "paper_id": "WOS:000306128400002"}
