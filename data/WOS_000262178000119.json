Most of the conventional techniques for fault signal analysis in a mechanical system are based chiefly oil the difference of signal amplitude ill the time and frequency domains. Unfortunately, ill Some conditions the performance is limited, such its when analysis signals are non-stationary. In the present study, the Wigner-Ville distribution is proposed for sound emission signal features classification, because it provides high resolution of instantaneous energy density both in time and frequency domains. Meanwhile, the instantaneous power spectrum is presented to obtain high-energy density when the engine fault condition Occurs. These features of signals ire classified using the probability neural network. To examine the efficiency of the probability neural network, both back-propagation and radial basis function neural networks are used in comparison with fault classification. The experimental results showed in three networks can achieve high recognition rate with feature extraction using Wigner-Ville distribution method. It also suggested the probability neural network call complete training in all extremely short time. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
