Their work kicked off a flood of research on semantics and type theory for object-oriented programming, which continues to this day. Despite 25 years of research, there is still widespread confusion about the two forms of data abstraction, abstract data types and objects. This essay attempts to explain the differences and also why the differences matter.", "paper_title": "On Understanding Data Abstraction, Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000271211300033"}
