Phys. Soc. Jpn. 70, 2793 (2001); 70, 3747 (2001)], has been studied on the basis of the local occupation probability method. However, in this work, based on the novel theoretical analysis and computer simulations, we have studied this crossroad traffic model again and presented the same phase diagrams of traffic flow in the case of various maximum vehicle velocities. We have also derived the flow formulas in all regions in the phase diagrams, which are in good agreement with computer simulation results. Compared with the previous local occupation probability method, our analytical way is simpler and may be widely used for other traffic bottlenecks research.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL METHOD TO ANALYZE PHASE DIAGRAMS FOR TRAFFICS ON THE CROSSROAD", "paper_id": "WOS:000309682000005"}
