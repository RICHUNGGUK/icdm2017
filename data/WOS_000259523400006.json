This feature alters the classical on-off pattern typically used to model the traffic generated by codecs with a Silence Suppression scheme. Therefore, the traffic generated due to CNG leads to severe inaccuracies in the dimensioning analysis done through traditional models based on multiplexing on-off sources like MMPP or fluid model. This paper addresses the VoIP dimensioning issue. First, we extend the traditional MMPP and fluid analytical models to include those traffic sources which perform the CNG feature. Second, we propose a simple but efficient algorithm which can be applied in dimensioning or admission control to find out the bandwidth reservation required to guarantee delay and loss in a packet-switch multiplexer node for VoIP traffic. Results are validated by simulations and VoIP traces and demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy with respect to current on-off-based approaches. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
