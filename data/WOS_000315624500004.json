Because (a) probing constitutes traffic overhead, and (b) in any typical scenario, the number of congested links is a small fraction of the total number in the network, a desirable design objective is to identify those (few) congested links using a minimum number of probes. In this paper, we make a contribution to solving this problem, by proposing a new two-stage approach for this problem. First, we develop a binary observation model linking end-to-end observations with individual link statuses and derive necessary and sufficient conditions for whether at least one link in the network is congested. Stage I of the proposed method shows that achieving 1-identifiability with a minimum number of probes is equivalent to the familiar minimum set covering problem that can be efficiently solved via a greedy heuristic. A sequential algorithm is described, leading to a significantly lowered computational complexity vis-a-vis a batch algorithm. Next, a binary splitting algorithm originally developed in group testing is used to identify the location of the congested links. The proposed scheme is evaluated by simulations in OPNET and experiments on the PlanetLab testbed to validate the advantages of our 2-stage approach vis-a-vis a conventional (batch) algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Two-Stage Approach for Network Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000315624500004"}
