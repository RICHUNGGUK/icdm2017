In the proposed method, the divisional efficiencies (within an organization) and the overall efficiency of the organization are formulated as separate objective functions in the multi-objective programming model. Compared with conventional DEA where the intermediate processes and products are ignored, this work measures the organization's overall efficiency without neglecting the efficiencies of its subunits. Two case studies demonstrate the proposed NDEA-MOP's utility in measuring the efficiencies of an organization with concerning interactive internal process. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
