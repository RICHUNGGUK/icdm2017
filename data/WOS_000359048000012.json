Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, by recently developed preconditioner Hermitian/Skew-Hermitian Separation (HSS) and the parallel implementation of GMRES, the author develops a quick solver, HSS-pGMRES-tFVM, for fast solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. Findings - Computational results show that, the quick solver HSS-pGMRES-tFVM significantly increases the solution speed for saddle point problem from incompressible Navier-Stokes equation than the conventional solvers. Originality/value - Altogether, the contribution of this paper is that the author developed the quick solver, HSS-pGMRES-tFVM, for fast solving incompressible Navier-Stokes equation.", "paper_title": "Quick finite volume solver for incompressible Navier-Stokes equation by parallel Gram-Schmidt process based GMRES and HSS", "paper_id": "WOS:000359048000012"}
