Many students need help to develop these skills, to learn how to manage and evaluate their learning process in order to improve it. We designed an organizer with metacognitive support to help users to meet their learning goals. Here, we propose: 1) embedding learning strategies to support metacognitive learning; 2) a learning strategies recommender; 3) our vision of a learning analytics module for learners to support learning awareness and the reflection process; and 4) our solution for recommendations based on tag relationships, tag enrichment, and folksonomies.", "paper_title": "Proposal of a Learning Organization Tool With Support for Metacognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000365098000002"}
