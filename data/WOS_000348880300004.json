The input image is analyzed both in the spatial and in the frequency domain, in order to extract information on the local amplitude contrast, and on the local behavior of the image, synthesized by considering the phase of some selected transform coefficients. These two pieces of information are used to generate a bi-dimensional contrast-phase histogram, used as feature vector associated with the image. After an appropriate feature selection, a trained linear-kernel SVM classifier makes the final live/fake decision. Experiments on the publicly available LivDet 2011 database, comprising datasets collected from various sensors, prove the proposed method to outperform the state-of-the-art liveness detection techniques.
