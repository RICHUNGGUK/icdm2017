The purpose of this study is to develop an intelligent resource allocation model using genetic algorithm and fuzzy inference for reducing lateness of orders with specific due dates. While the genetic algorithm is responsible for arranging and selecting the sequence of orders, the fuzzy inference module conveys how resources are allocated to each order. Experimental results showed that the proposed model has solved the capacity allocation problem efficiently. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
