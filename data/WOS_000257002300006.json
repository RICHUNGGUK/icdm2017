Park, S. Sahni, Maximum lifetime broadcasting in wireless networks, IEEE Transactions on Computers 54 (9) (2005) 1081-1090] that has an objective of increasing the chances of doing a sequence of broadcasts. We present an optimal generalized solution algorithm running in improved optimal O(vertical bar V vertical bar + vertical bar E vertical bar) time, where V stands for a set of nodes and E stands for a set of links in the network. Our approach is applicable in an omnidirectional antenna model and can be used to solve the problem of multicasting traffic so as to maximize the lifetime of the network [A. Orda, B.-A. Yassour, Maximum-lifetime routing algorithms for networks with omnidirectional and directional antennas, in: Proc. ACM MOBIHOC, 2005] and a data gathering problem [K. Kalpakis, K. Dasgupta, P.
