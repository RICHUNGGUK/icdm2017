The Schrodinger equation is discretized by a time-splitting spectral method, and the quantum waveguides are fed by a mono-energetic incoming plane wave pulse. The resulting algorithm is extremely efficient due to the Fast Fourier Transform implementation of the spectral scheme. Numerical convergence rates for a one-dimensional scattering problem are calculated. The transmission rates of a two-dimensional T-stub quantum waveguide and a single-branch coupler are numerically computed. Moreover, the transient behavior of a three-dimensional T-stub waveguide is simulated. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
