It is desirable to individuals that any machines outside the workplace provide a uniform and consistent desktop computing environment. This paper proposes a system called a mobile personalized virtual computing environment (MOVE), which aims to present users with their own uniformly consistent desktop computing environment - including customized software, personal data and other utilities - on any computers attached to the network and to make local computing resources in their familiar workplaces accessible to this computer, enabling users working anywhere to be as if they were at their own familiar workplace without the constraints of mobility and geographical location. A virtual-machine-based method for the MOVE is proposed, and a distributed virtual disk is discussed to be the storage system for the MOVE. With the network facility equipped with a network of virtual machines and a virtual private network, private network resources in users' familiar workplaces can be accessible to the virtual computing environment.
