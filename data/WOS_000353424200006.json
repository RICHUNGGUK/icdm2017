It is reached when the disphenoids have their four triangular faces congruent to a triangle with squared sidelengths ratios 1:3-root 2/2:3. To our knowledge it is the first time that a maximal chirality three dimensional set is characterized in the non labeled case.", "paper_title": "The Most Chiral Disphenoid", "paper_id": "WOS:000353424200006"}
