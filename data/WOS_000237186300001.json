It is a potentially debilitating condition especially for senior citizens. There is growing interest for quantitative ultrasound to measure bone mineral density. However, understanding of ultrasound-bone interaction is limited. Simulating ultrasound propagation of bone can help us better understand ultrasound-bone interaction and provide insight into bone architecture. In this study a mathematical model for the propagation of sound in bone is presented. Results demonstrate the suitability of the proposed modeling approach and the model's capability to reproduce conditions in the lab.
