The best known are the von Neumann entropy vertical bar(rho) := -trace(rho log rho) and a generalization of the Kull-back-Leibler distance S(p vertical bar vertical bar sigma) := trace(rho log rho-rho log sigma), refered to as quantum relative entropy and used to quantify distance between states of a quantum system. The purpose of this paper is to explore I and S as regularizing functionals in seeking solutions to multivariable and multidimensional moment problems. It will be shown that extrema can be effectively constructed via a suitable homotopy. The homotopy approach leads naturally to a further generalization and a description of all the solutions to such moment problems. This is accomplished by a renormalization of a Riemannian metric induced by entropy functionals. As an application, we discuss the inverse problem of describing power spectra which are consistent with second-order statistics, which has been the main motivation behind the present work.", "paper_title": "Relative entropy and the multivariable multidimensional moment problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000236126000019"}
