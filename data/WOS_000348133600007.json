Generally, increasing the size of a WMN leads to higher wireless interference and longer packet delays. We examine the partitioning of a large WMN into several smaller WMN clusters, whereby each cluster is served by an optical network unit (ONU) of the PON. Existing WMN throughput-delay analysis techniques considering the mean load of the nodes at a given hop distance from a gateway (ONU) are unsuitable for the heterogeneous nodal traffic loads arising from clustering. We introduce a simple analytical queuing model that considers the individual node loads to accurately characterize the throughput-delay performance of a clustered FiWi network. We verify the accuracy of the model through extensive simulations. We employ the model to examine the impact of the number of clusters on the network throughput-delay performance. We find that with sufficient PON bandwidth, clustering substantially improves the FiWi network throughput-delay performance.", "paper_title": "A simple analytical throughput-delay model for clustered FiWi networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000348133600007"}
