Bias in the lower cerebellum and pons in HRRT brain images have been reported. The two main sources of the problem with MAP-TR are poor bone/soft tissue segmentation below the brain and overestimation of bone mass in the skull. Method: We developed the new transmission processing with total variation (TXTV) method that introduces scatter correction in the mu-map reconstruction and total variation filtering to the transmission processing. Results: Comparing MAP-TR and the new TXTV with gold standard CT-based attenuation correction, we found that TXTV has less bias as compared to MAP-TR. We also compared images acquired at the HRRT scanner using TXTV to the GE Advance scanner images and found high quantitative correspondence. TXTV has been used to reconstruct more than 4000 HRRT scans at seven different sites with no reports of biases. Conclusion: TXTV-based reconstruction is recommended for human brain scans on the HRRT.", "paper_title": "Attenuation Correction for the HRRT PET-Scanner Using Transmission Scatter Correction and Total Variation Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000324251000005"}
