However, for new practitioners that approach the field, this amount of information might seem overwhelming. Therefore, the purpose of this work is to help in guiding new practitioners get a general idea on the state of the field and to determine possible research lines. To do so, we first perform a literature review of the field in the last decade by means of an online search. The articles retrieved are sorted using a classification framework that we propose, and the different categories are revised and analyzed. The information in this review is extended and supported by the results obtained by a survey that we have designed and conducted among the practitioners. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
