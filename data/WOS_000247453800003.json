The bandwidth of the communication medium and the timely arrival of the frames necessitate a tight resource allocation. Given the dynamic environment where videos are started and stopped and electro-magnetic perturbations affect the bandwidth of the wireless medium, a framework is needed that reacts timely to the changes in network load and network operational conditions. This paper describes a hierarchical framework, which can handle the dynamic network resource allocation in a timely manner. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
