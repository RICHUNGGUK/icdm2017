As an example, the human P2X7 (h-P2X7) receptor subunit and a series of novel 4,5-diarylimidazoline inhibitors [Merriman et al., Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett., 15, 435 (2005)] is used. GRNN ignores relevant and add noisy descriptors although the goodness-of-fit criterion is large. Therefore, GRNN is considered as supplementary tool which cannot replace the traditional QSAR methodology. Simultaneous one-regression/one-observation leaving-out resampling shows that the h-P2X7 inhibitory activity of 4,5-diarylimidazolines depends on electronic, steric and hydrogen-bonding properties of the substituents. Diagnostic statistic examines the validity of the results. The inhibitors are probably bound to sites that are located mainly in the subdomains 344-347 and 370-375 of h-P2X7.", "paper_title": "Subset selection and docking of human P2X7 inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000253605000004"}
