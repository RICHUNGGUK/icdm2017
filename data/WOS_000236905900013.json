In this paper a method for detecting hyperlinks, e.g. formula links, from mathematical OCR output is described. We also experimentally demonstrated the effectiveness of the method. By using the method we implemented a prototype system of a mathematical knowledge browser that helps people read mathematical articles.", "paper_title": "Mathematical knowledge browser with automatic hyperlink detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905900013"}
