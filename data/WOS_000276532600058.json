(1) Using spline, we can easily obtain more accurate results than those obtain by the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network. (2) If the model is nonlinear with a disturbance term, we obtain that the checking error is very large even though the training error is small. If the model is chaotic with a disturbance term, we obtain that both the training error and checking error are very large. (3) Using a sequential algorithm as in the generalized dynamic fuzzy neural network, we would always be trapped at the local minima rather than the global minimum. Therefore we use the non-uniform self-selective coder instead and show how it works by an empirical example. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
