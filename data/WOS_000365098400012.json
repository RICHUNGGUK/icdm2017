Therefore, any resource that involves an improvement in their practical training is an issue of interest to the academia. eLab3D is an electronics remote laboratory based on a configurable hardware and 3-D virtual world, that allows students to carry out real experiments with analog electronic circuits. This paper provides a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities Threats analysis of remote laboratories compiled from recent publications and presents some relevant results of the use of eLab3D in real educational contexts, the teachers' assessment of its potential and the students' perceived satisfaction.", "paper_title": "Remote Laboratory eLab3D: A Complementary Resource in Engineering Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000365098400012"}
