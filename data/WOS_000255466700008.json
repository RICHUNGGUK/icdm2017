We consider the counting problems of propositional circumscription for several subclasses with respect to the structure of the formula. We prove that the counting problem of propositional circumscription for dual Horn, bijunctive, and affine formulas is #P-complete for a particular case of Turing reduction, whereas for Horn and 2affine formulas it is in FP. As a corollary, we obtain also the #P-completeness result for the counting problem of hypergraph transversal. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
