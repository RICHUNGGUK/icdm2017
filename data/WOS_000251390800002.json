If psi(center dot) in L-2(R) is a wavelet, then {D-m T-n psi(center dot)}((m, n)is an element of Z2) is an orthonormal basis for the Hilbert space L-2(R) but the reversed set {(TDm)-D-n psi(center dot)}((n, m)is an element of Z2) is not. In this paper we investigate the role of the reversed functions (TDm)-D-n psi(center dot) in wavelet theory. As a consequence, we exhibit an orthogonal decomposition of L-2(R) into T-reducing subspaces upon which part of the bilateral shift T consists of a countably infinite direct sum of bilateral shifts of multiplicity one, which mirrors a well-known decomposition of the bilateral shift D.", "paper_title": "Reversed wavelet functions and subspaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000251390800002"}
