[2] show, via algebraic methods, that a regular hyperbolic fibration of PG(3, q) with constant back half gives rise to a flock of a quadratic cone in PG(3, q), and conversely. In this paper a geometric construction for q even of the flock from the hyperbolic fibration, and conversely, will be described. A proof will be given that this geometric construction indeed corresponds to the known algebraic one.", "paper_title": "A geometric construction of the hyperbolic fibrations associated with a flock, q even", "paper_id": "WOS:000236201800012"}
