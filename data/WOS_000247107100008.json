Customers' availability requirements are met by adjusting the availability of the protection paths with different sharing options. Information required for calculating the availability of both the working, and protection paths can be collected along the specific working, and protection paths, thus avoiding the requirement for flooding. This makes our algorithms scalable for a large network. Our algorithms work consistently against both single, and multiple failures. Furthermore, we propose extensions for the existing signaling protocols to demonstrate that our proposed algorithms require minimum changes to the existing protocols. Simulation results show that our proposal performs better than the conventional Dedicated Path Protection schemes in terms of Call Acceptance Rate, and Total Bandwidth Consumption. Finally, by comparing simulation results to analytical results for a simplified network, we provide some insights into the correctness, and efficiency of our proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "A scalable path protection mechanism for guaranteed network reliability under multiple failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000247107100008"}
