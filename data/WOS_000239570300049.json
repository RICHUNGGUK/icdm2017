Their instruction sets must be carefully tailored to provide high performance as well as to meet non-functional constraints such as silicon area and power consumption. Traditionally, evaluation of different candidate instruction sets is all carried out through simulation. However, the growing design complexity and time-to-market pressure have rendered simulation increasingly infeasible. In this paper, we present an instruction level modeling method that can rapidly evaluates several important aspects of a selected instruction set. Experimental results show that we can prune a large number of candidate instruction sets with the model, accelerate design space exploration and alleviate the pressure on simulation.", "paper_title": "A fast instruction set evaluation method for ASIP designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300049"}
