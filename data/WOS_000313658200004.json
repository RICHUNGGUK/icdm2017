The starting point is the use of the variational (BV,G (p) ,L (2)) decomposition; a given image faL (2)(Omega) is decomposed into a sum of u (0)+v (0)+r (0), where (u (0),v (0))a(BV(Omega),G (p) (Omega)) is the minimizer of an energy functional E(f,lambda (0);u,v) and r (0) is the residual (i.e. r (0)=f-u (0)-v (0)). In this decomposition, v (0) represents the fixed scale texture of f, which is measured by the parameter lambda (0). To achieve a multiscale representation, we proceed to capture essential textures of f which have been absorbed by the residuals. Such a goal can be achieved by iterating a refinement decomposition to the residual of the previous step, i.e. r (i) =u (i+1)+v (i+1)+r (i+1), where (u (i+1),v (i+1)) is the minimizer of E(r (i) ,lambda (0)/2 (i+1);u,v). In this manner, we can obtain a hierarchical representation of f. In addition, we discuss some theoretical properties of the hierarchical (BV,G (p) ,L (2)) decomposition and give its numerical implementation. Finally, we apply this hierarchical decomposition to the multiscale texture extraction. The performance of this method is demonstrated with both synthetic and real images.", "paper_title": "Multiscale Texture Extraction with Hierarchical (BV,G(p),L-2) Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000313658200004"}
