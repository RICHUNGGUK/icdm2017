The starting point of our approach is to equip each gamma-level set of C with a uniform probability distribution, then the probabilistic correlation coefficient between its marginal probability distributions is interpreted as an index of interactivity between the gamma-level sets of A and B. Then we define the index of interactivity between A and B as the weighted average of these indexes over the set of all membership grades. This new index of interactivity is meaningful for the whole family of joint possibility distributions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
