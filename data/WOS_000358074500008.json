The security of web browsing can be evaluated by quantifying the side-channel information leaks. However, most of the current leak quantification measures focus on web applications and may be impractical in web browsing due to their time complexity. Although the revised models were proposed to simplify computations, their assumptions may not be suitable for web browsing. In this paper, the problem of website fingerprinting is analyzed from the viewpoint of pattern classification. The data complexity measures, which quantify the difficulty of separating classes in a classification problem, are applied to describe the leak quantification. The performance of these data complexity measures in representing information leaks is discussed and compared with the existing approaches. This comparative analysis is realized conceptually and through experiments by using two website fingerprinting countermeasures: traffic morphing and BuFLO. Moreover, the parameter selection model based on the leak quantification is proposed to estimate suitable parameters for the website fingerprinting countermeasure. The experimental results confirm that the countermeasures with parameters selected according to the data complexity measures are more secure than other leak quantification measures.", "paper_title": "Quantification of side-channel information leaks based on data complexity measures for web browsing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358074500008"}
