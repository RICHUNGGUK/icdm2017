There is thus a greater demand for cognition-enhancing (nootropic) drugs. Some such drugs are already available, but many display serious side-effects. We have designed, synthesized and tested a number of novel chemical entities that are predicted by the PASS software to be potential nootropic agents. The results have been subjected to QSAR (quantitative structure-activity relationship) analysis, and good QSAR correlations, with external validation, have been obtained, which can be used predictively to guide design of additional potential cognition-enhancers.", "paper_title": "QSAR Investigation of New Cognition Enhancers", "paper_id": "WOS:000271539000005"}
