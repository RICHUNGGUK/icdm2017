The new quasi-Newton iterative learning control scheme using the rank-one update to derive the recurrent formula has numerous benefits, which include the approximate treatment for the inverse of the system's Jacobian matrix. The rank-one update-based ILC also has the advantage of extension for convergence domain and hence guaranteeing the choice of initial value. The algorithm is expressed as a very general norm optimization problem in a Banach space and, in principle, can be used for both continuous and discrete time systems. Furthermore, a detailed convergence analysis is given, and it guarantees theoretically that the proposed algorithm converges at a superlinear rate. Initial conditions which the algorithm requires are also established. The simulations illustrate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "New quasi-Newton iterative learning control scheme based on rank-one update for nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000331981900003"}
