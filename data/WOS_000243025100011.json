To address this need, we have developed a WSN emulator, VMNet. VMNet emulates networked sensor nodes at the level of CPU clock cycles and executes the binary code of real applications directly. It emulates the radio channel with loss and noise as well as emulates the peripherals in sufficient detail. Moreover, VMNet takes parameter values from the real world and logs detailed runtime information of emulated nodes. Consequently, the application performance, both in response time and in power consumption, is reported realistically in VMNet, as demonstrated by our comparison studies with real sensor networks.", "paper_title": "VMNet: Realistic emulation of wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243025100011"}
