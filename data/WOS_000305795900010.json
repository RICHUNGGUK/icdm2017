Most of existing learning to rank approaches are based on the assumption that each object is independently and identically distributed. Although this assumption simplifies ranking problems, the implicit interconnections between objects are ignored. In this paper, a graph based ranking framework is proposed, which takes advantage of implicit correlations between objects. Furthermore, the derived relational ranking algorithm from this framework, called GRSVM, is developed based on the conventional algorithm RankSVM-primal. In addition, generalization properties of different relational ranking algorithms are analyzed using Rademacher Average. Based on the analysis, we find that GRSVM can achieve tighter generalization bound than existing relational ranking algorithms in most cases. Finally, a comparison of experimental results produced by improved and conventional algorithms shows the superior performance of the former.", "paper_title": "A RELATIONAL RANKING METHOD WITH GENERALIZATION ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305795900010"}
