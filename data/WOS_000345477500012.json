In this study, a comprehensive model of an optically accessible, single-cylinder light-duty diesel engine was developed for engine combustion research. The computational model includes the realistic combustion chamber and ducts geometries. Variable orientation throttles in the intake ducts were modeled to reproduce variable swirl generation. Full induction stroke calculations were run over a portfolio of intake swirl conditions, and validated against extensive measurements featuring global intake swirl ratios, in-cylinder particle image velocimetry (PIV)-measured velocity fields and swirl centers. The results showed good agreement with the experiments, and the model was used to understand the effects of different swirl generation strategies on the in-cylinder flow field. The implications of using simplified sector mesh geometries on the predictiveness of in-cylinder flow and turbulence quantities are described. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
