Robustness is one of the most important properties for the yacht steering autopilot. This paper develops a new method of tuning PD controllers by using an H-infinity control strategy. It is well known that the H-infinity control design normally yields a controller which is much more robust against disturbances. Hence the proposed PD tuning method via the H-infinity theory enhances the robustness of the PD autopilot for the yacht steering control.", "paper_title": "Yacht adaptive self-tuning PID control: An H-infinity approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000021"}
