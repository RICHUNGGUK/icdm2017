Although there are many efficient soft shadow algorithms, most of them focus on the one-side light source situation, where a planar light source is on the outside of the scene. In fact, in many situations, such as games, light sources are omnidirectional. They may be surrounded by a number of 3D objects. This paper proposes a soft shadow algorithm for the omnidirectional situation. We develop a concentric spherical representation to model the behaviour of omnidirectional light sources. To provide better rendering results, a novel summed area table based filtering scheme for spherical functions is proposed. In addition, we utilize unicube mapping, which samples the spherical space more uniformly, to further improve the filtering quality.", "paper_title": "Concentric Spherical Representation for Omnidirectional Soft Shadow", "paper_id": "WOS:000334853000014"}
