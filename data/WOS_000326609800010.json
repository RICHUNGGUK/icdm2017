For this reason, proper estimation and evaluation of energy that is required to execute data center workloads became an important research problem. In this paper we present a Data Center Workload and Resource Management Simulator (DCworms) which enables modeling and simulation of computing infrastructures to estimate their performance, energy consumption, and energy-efficiency metrics for diverse workloads and management policies. We discuss methods of power usage modeling available in the simulator. To this end, we compare results of simulations to measurements of real servers. To demonstrate DCworms capabilities we evaluate impact of several resource management policies on overall energy-efficiency of specific workloads executed on heterogeneous resources.
