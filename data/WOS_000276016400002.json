The algorithm used by HPL, enhanced by a set of tuning options, is more effective than that found in the ScaLAPACK library. Retrofitting these algorithms, such as look-ahead processing of pivot elements, into ScaLAPACK is considered as a major undertaking. Moreover, HPL is configured as a benchmark, but only for real-valued coefficients. We therefore developed software to convert HPL for use within an application program that generates complex coefficient linear systems. Although HPL is not normally perceived as a part of an application, our results show that the modified HPL software brings a significant increase in the performance of the solver when simulating the highest resolution experiments thus far configured, achieving 87.5 TFLOPS on over 20 000 processors on the Cray XT4.
