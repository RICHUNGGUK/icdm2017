The infection information is also denoted by a Bit-String including 0 and 1. The degree of getting an infection is rested with the matching degree between the Bit-String of the individual and the Bit-String of infection information. Thus, we define the Hamming Distance with age. The infection rules among individuals is described by Cellular Automata on the lattice with L*L. We discuss the existence and extinction for a certain infection on the process of evolution.", "paper_title": "Infection model based on Hamming Distance with age", "paper_id": "WOS:000243701900012"}
