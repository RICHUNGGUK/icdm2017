More than two million pilgrims gather in Saudi Arabia annually during the Hajj season, and it is compulsory for them to perform a series of actions in the mosque. In the court area, pilgrims perform one of the most important rituals of Hajj, called Tawaf, which consists of seven laps of circular movement around the Kaabah, which is situated in the centre of the court. After the Tawaf, pilgrims pray in the court and leave from one of several doors. In this paper, we present a cellular automata model for the simulation of the pilgrims' circular Tawaf movement. We also use a discrete-event model to simulate the actions and behaviours of the pilgrims. The proposed models are used in a software platform to simulate the actions and movements of pilgrims in the area. We then present an example application of the model in predicting whether specific changes to the architecture could increase the throughput of the system. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
