They are used for the analysis, design, construction, and verification of software applications and fit well into the model-driven paradigm. Although many business process languages have emerged in the last couple of years, they are in general not used for supporting the integration of existing information systems. In many cases, they are applied for designing an integrated system from scratch but less emphasis has been placed on integrating existing business process models which would be a natural consequence from a model-driven point of view. In this article we identify inter-process dependencies for the integration of existing business processes and investigate their support from a modelling perspective by currently available business process modelling languages and from an enforcement perspective by an event driven architecture.", "paper_title": "Modelling and Enforcement of Inter-Process Dependencies with Business Process Modelling Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000296906600004"}
