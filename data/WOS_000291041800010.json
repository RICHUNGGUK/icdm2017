Calculations at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) level of theory predict the existence of four conformers for sulfanilamide depending on the orientation of p-amino and amide groups. Focusing on the sulfonamide moiety, amide NH(2) and SO(2) groups could exist either in an eclipsed or staggered arrangement. Gas-phase results predict the eclipsed conformer to be most stable but opposite to what has been rationalized previously, no stabilizing hydrogen bonds between those groups has been found through NBO analysis. When solvent effect is taken into account through the IEF-PCM method, staggered conformer is preferred; in fact, eclipsed conformation changed when explicit solvent molecules were included. Conformational analysis of all derivatives has shown two global minima which are specular images. Five out of the seven derivatives studied adopted a particular minimum energy conformation with very similar geometries.", "paper_title": "Theoretical studies on sulfanilamide and derivatives with antibacterial activity: conformational and electronic analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000291041800010"}
