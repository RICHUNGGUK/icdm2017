Throughout the study, the ratio of jets separation distance (d) and jet width (w) is kept at d/w = 1, and the Reynolds number based on jet width is considered as Re = 10,000. The velocity ratio, V-r = u(w)/u(0), is varied by varying the inlet velocity of the wall jet (u(w)) consistently while the inlet velocity of the offset jet (u(0)) is retained as a reference velocity. Computational results reveal that when the velocity ratio lies in the range 0.78 <= V-r <= 1.34, a periodic vortex shedding phenomenon occurs close to the nozzle plate similar to what would be expected in the region behind a two-dimensional bluff body immersed in a fluid. On the contrary, this periodic phenomenon ceases if V-r <= 0.77 and V-r >= 1.35. Unsteady time-marching simulations show that for V-r = 0.77 and 1.35, two stable counter rotating vortices form close to the nozzle plate. The velocity signals, within the range for which the periodic vortex shedding occurs, exhibit a trend of pure sinusoidal oscillation. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the velocity signals provides the vortex shedding frequency corresponding to the Strouhal number that gradually increases with the progressive increase in velocity ratio.
