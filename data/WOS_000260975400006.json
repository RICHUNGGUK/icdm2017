This paper shows that in CQ(n) with f(v) faulty vertices and f(e) faulty edges there exists a fault-free path of length l between any two distinct fault-free vertices for each l satisfying 2(n-1) - 1 <= L <= 2(n) - f(v) - 1 provided that f(v) + f(e) <= n - 3, where the lower bound of l and the upper bound of f(v) + f(e) are tight for some n. Moreover, this result improves the known result that CQn is (n - 3)-Hamiltonian connected. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
