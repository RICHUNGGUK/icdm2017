It has been mainly applied to single-input single-output (SISO) systems, where each node is equipped with a single antenna. In this paper, we propose it power-controlled channel access protocol for MIMO-capable wireless LANs with two antennas per node. Our protocol, called E-BASIC, extends the classic CSMA/CA access scheme by allowing for dynamic adjustment of the transmission mode and the transmission power on it per-packet basis so as to minimize the total energy consumption. By transmission mode we mean one of the four possible transmit/receive antenna configurations: 1 x 1 (SISO), 2 x 1 (MISO), 1 x 2 (SIMO) and 2 x 2 (MIMO). Depending on the transmitter-receiver distance, any of the four modes can be the optimal one in terms of minimizing the total energy consumption. We Study the performance of E-BASIC in both ad hoc and access point topologies. We also incorporate E-BASIC in the design of it power-aware routing (PAR) scheme that selects minimum-energy end-to-end paths. Our adaptive designs are first conducted assuming fixed-rate transmission, but later extended to multi-rate systems. To account for the energy-throughput tradeoff in our designs, we impose it constraint oil the average packet delivery time. Simulations indicate that the proposed adaptations achieve a significant reduction in the overall energy consumption relative to non-adaptive MIMO systems.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient protocols for wireless networks with adaptive MIMO capabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000274214700015"}
