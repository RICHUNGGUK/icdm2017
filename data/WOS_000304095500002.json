Instead the responses of binocular energy neurons are gain-modulated by oculomotor signals. The network can handle the full six degrees of freedom of binocular gaze and operates directly on image pairs of possibly varying contrast. Furthermore, we show that in the absence of an oculomotor signal the same architecture is capable of estimating the epipolar geometry directly from the population response. The increased complexity of the scenarios considered in this work provides an important step towards the application of computational models centered on gain modulation mechanisms in real-world robotic applications. The proposed network is shown to outperform a standard computer vision technique on a disparity estimation task involving real-world stereo images.", "paper_title": "HEAD-CENTRIC DISPARITY AND EPIPOLAR GEOMETRY ESTIMATION FROM A POPULATION OF BINOCULAR ENERGY NEURONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000304095500002"}
