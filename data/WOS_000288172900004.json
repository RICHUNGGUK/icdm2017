In the control algorithm, any explicit leader does not exist in the formation team and it is required that each spacecraft communicate only with its neighbors and therefore the required communication loads of the whole formation is greatly reduced. The proposed control strategies allow that each spacecraft can track its desired position and attitude and simultaneously the whole group moves to the desired formation and obtain its desired relative attitudes with its neighbors. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controllers.", "paper_title": "Formation control for networked spacecraft in deep space: with or without communication delays and with switching topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000288172900004"}
