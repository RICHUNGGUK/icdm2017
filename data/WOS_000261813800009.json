However, many modern information applications spread dynamic data objects and process complex queries for retrieving multiple data objects. Particularly, the information servers dynamically generate data objects that are dependent and can be associated into a complete response against complex queries. Accordingly, the study in this paper considers the problem of scheduling dynamic broadcast data objects in a clients-providers-servers system from the standpoint of data association, dependency, and dynamics. Since the data broadcast problem is NP-hard, we derive the lower and the upper bounds of the mean service access time. In light of the theoretical analyses, we further devise a deterministic algorithm with several gain measure functions for the approximation of schedule optimization. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is able to generate a dynamic broadcast schedule and also minimize the mean service access time to the extent of being very close to the theoretical optimum.", "paper_title": "Online Scheduling Sequential Objects with Periodicity for Dynamic Information Dissemination", "paper_id": "WOS:000261813800009"}
