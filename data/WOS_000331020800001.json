From the model, we can derive five performance metrics to describe the robustness, security and efficiency of the botnet. Additionally, we analyze the relationship between the performance metrics and the model feature metrics of the botnet, and it is helpful to study the botnet under different model feature metrics. Furthermore, the proposed model can be easily applied to other types of botnets. Finally, taking the robustness and security into consideration, an optimization scheme for designing an optimal P2P botnet is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
