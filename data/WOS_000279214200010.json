In the two operating modes, the ADC features different sampling frequency (125 and 250 MHz) and power consumption (9.4 and 22.8 mW). Considering a signal bandwidth of 60 MHz in both operating modes, as required by the Gigabit Ethernet standard, the ADC achieves a SNDR always larger than 39.4 dB at 125 MHz and 38.7 dB at 250 MHz (6.25-bit and 6.13-bit ENOB, respectively), with a FoM of 0.84 pJ/conv at 125 MHz and 2.2 pJ/conv at 250 MHz. The ENOB achieved is mainly limited by clock jitter. The ADC is fabricated with a 90-nm CMOS technology, with an active area of 1.25 x 0.65 mm(2).", "paper_title": "A 90-nm CMOS, 8-bit pipeline ADC with 60-MHz bandwidth and 125-MS/s or 250-MS/s sampling frequency", "paper_id": "WOS:000279214200010"}
