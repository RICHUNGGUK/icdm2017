This is in particular interesting when access to one or more of the above resources is significantly more expensive than the others. We apply new algebraic approach based on Matrix Theory to simplify the algorithms and the proofs of their correctness. We improve the arithmetic complexity of the problem and argue that it is almost optimal. Then we prove tight bound for the minimal number of equivalence queries and almost (up to log factor) tight bound for the number of membership queries.", "paper_title": "On optimal learning algorithms for multiplicity automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000239587900016"}
