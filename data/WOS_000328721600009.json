The singularity of GSP has been studied by many scholars, but their works mainly focused on finding the methods to divide the cases of singularity or searching the solutions with Jacobian matrices. On the other hand, this paper studies the singularities of 6-UCU parallel manipulator caused by not only the active joints but also passive universal joints. Two types of singularity are derived based on a degree of freedom method by using screw theory. Singularity detection is essential to certify the absence of singularity within a prescribed workspace or a reachable workspace for a practical use of the 6-UCU parallel manipulator. Algorithms are proposed by using evolutionary strategy to detect the singularity in the desired or reachable workspace of the 6-UCU parallel manipulator. Case studies are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed singularity detection methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
