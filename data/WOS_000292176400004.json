It uses statistical language-classification technology for mapping from a user's text input to system responses. NPCEditor provides a user-friendly editor for creating effective virtual humans quickly. It has been deployed as a part of various virtual human systems in several applications.", "paper_title": "NPCEditor: Creating Virtual Human Dialogue Using Information Retrieval Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000292176400004"}
