This paper assesses progress toward these goals by evaluating MU I target novelty and propensity for undergoing biochemically or therapeutically relevant modulations and the degree of chemical diversity and biogenic bias inherent in the MLI screening set. Our analyses suggest that while MLI target selection has not yet been fully optimized for biochemical diversity, it covers biologically interesting pathway space that complements established drug targets. We find the MU I screening set to be chemically diverse and to have greater biogenic bias than comparable collections of commercially available compounds. Biogenic enhancements such as incorporation of more metabolite-like chemotypes are suggested.", "paper_title": "Characterizing the Diversity and Biological Relevance of the MLPCN Assay Manifold and Screening Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000292010100002"}
