By representing the quality of the current channel state information as P-alpha for the signal-to-noise ratio P and some constant alpha >= 0, we characterize the optimal degrees of freedom region for this more general two-user MISO broadcast correlated channel. The essential ingredients of the proposed scheme lie in the quantization andmulticast of the overheard interferences, while broadcasting new private messages. Our proposed scheme smoothly bridges between the scheme recently proposed by Maddah-Ali and Tse with no current state information and a simple zero-forcing beamforming with perfect current state information.", "paper_title": "Degrees of Freedom of Time Correlated MISO Broadcast Channel With Delayed CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000312896600019"}
