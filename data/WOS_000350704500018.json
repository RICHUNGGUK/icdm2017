The connected graph of order n with smallest EEr-value is the n-vertex path. The second smallest such graph is the (n - 1)-vertex path with a pendent vertex attached at position 2. The tree with third smallest EEr is the (n -1)-vertex path with a pendent vertex attached at position 3, conjectured to be also the connected graph with third smallest EEr Based on a computer-aided search, we established the structure of a few more trees with smallest EEr.", "paper_title": "Graphs with Smallest Resolvent Estrada Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000350704500018"}
