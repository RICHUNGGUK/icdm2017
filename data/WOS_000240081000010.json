However, if the multicast packet can be transmitted at higher transmission rates than 2Mbps in a multi-rate WLAN such as IEEE 802.11b, we can achieve higher throughput gain and lower transmission delay than those at 2Mbps transmission rate. In this paper, we propose a new multicast routing protocol in multirate wireless ad hoc networks. In the proposed protocol, we design a multicast mesh creation method considering multiple transmission rates between any two nodes in the ad hoc networks. We also design a multicast mesh maintenance scheme when the transmission rate between two nodes comprising a multicast mesh is changed because of node mobility. The performance of the proposed protocol is compared with ODMRP using ns2 simulation, and the proposed protocol shows higher packet delivery ratio and lower end-to-end delay than the ODMRP.", "paper_title": "An efficient multicast routing protocol in multi-rate wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000010"}
