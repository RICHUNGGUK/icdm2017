The sequence families are nested, that is, Omega(r) is contained in Omega(r+1), which provides design flexibility with respect to family size and maximum correlation. The sequences in Omega(r) are derived from a combination of multiplicative and additive characters of a prime field. Estimates on hybrid character sums are then used to bound the maximum correlation. This construction generalizes Omega(0), which was previously proposed by Scholtz and Welch. Sequence family Omega(2) is closely related to a recent design by Wang and Gong, who bounded its maximum correlation using methods from representation theory and asked for a more direct proof of this bound. Such a proof is given here and an improvement of the bound is provided.", "paper_title": "Sequence Families With Low Correlation Derived From Multiplicative and Additive Characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100032"}
