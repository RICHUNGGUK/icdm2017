The mandatory certification implies a worst-case delay analysis of all the flows transmitted on the AFDX network. Up to now, this analysis is done thanks to a tool based on a Network Calculus approach. The more recent Trajectory approach has been proposed for the computation of worst-case response time in distributed systems. This paper shows how the worst-case delay analysis of the AFDX can be improved using an optimized Trajectory approach. The Network Calculus and the Trajectory approaches are compared on a real avionics AFDX configuration. Moreover, an evaluation of an upper bound of the pessimism of each approach is proposed.", "paper_title": "Improving the Worst-Case Delay Analysis of an AFDX Network Using an Optimized Trajectory Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000283984900006"}
