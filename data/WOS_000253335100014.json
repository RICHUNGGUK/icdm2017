Fingerprint enhancement is essential to ensure the robustness of fingerprint identification with respect to the image quality. Gabor filtering is the most popular method in fingerprint enhancement. To overcome the limitations of traditional Gabor filter and promote fingerprint enhancement performance, the Log-Gabor filter is introduced in this paper. The design method and implementation scheme of Log-Gabor filter in fingerprint enhancement are described in detail. The enhancement performance is assessed on standard fingerprint databases. Experimental results show that the proposed Log-Gabor filtering method can effectively improve the fingerprint image quality and promote the reliability of fingerprint identification.
