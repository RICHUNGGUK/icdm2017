In addition to contributing to the stability of mine workplaces, CPB greatly benefits the environment by minimizing surface tailings disposal. Hence, it has become one of the most commonly used ways in mine backfilling around the world. Temperature can significantly affect the mechanical properties of cemented backfill. A source of heat in CPB is produced by binder hydration. Hence, a FLAC based numerical model is developed to predict and analyse the heat developed by hydrating CPB structures. To validate the model, results of the developed model are compared with three case studies (mathematical, laboratory, and field investigations). The validation results show a good agreement between the developed model and these cases. The effects of stope geometry, thermal properties of both rock and CPB, filling rate, binder content and initial boundary conditions are also investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
