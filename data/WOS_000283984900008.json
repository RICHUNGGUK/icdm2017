The GENESYS MPSoC offers a stable set of domain-independent core services (e.g., common time, message-based communication, and configuration). On top of the core services, higher level services can be implemented by domain-independent and domain-specific system components that customize the platform to the needs of the specific application domain. Through its cross-domain applicability, the GENESYS MPSoC supports the wide reuse of components and realizes the benefits of the economies of scale of the semiconductor technology. Furthermore, the GENESYS MPSoC contributes towards the solution of prevalent technological challenges such as complexity management, robustness, and technology obsolescence. This paper presents the GENESYS MPSoC and provides insights from a prototype implementation, which demonstrates that such a cross-domain MPSoC can be built with today's technology.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Domain Multiprocessor System-on-a-Chip for Embedded Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283984900008"}
