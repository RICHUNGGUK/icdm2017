Fitting a new driver into the Linux kernel requires a 'noospheric' strategy as well as an engineering strategy, because the code is part of the open-source development process, not its end. This article recounts the technology and the development process followed for a 'fast and intelligent' driver extension to the existing Linux software RAID subsystem. The development adapts the kernel RAID subsystem for use in the context of network-attached storage.
