One of the technically challenging issues is that we use only top-view camera images to protect privacy. The shape features over the frames are extracted by bag-of-features (BoF) using histogram of oriented gradients (HoG) vectors. In order to enhance the classification accuracy, a two-staged classification framework is presented. Multiple classifiers are trained by changing the parameters in the first stage. The outputs from the first stage is further trained and classified in the second stage classifier. The experiments using 60-minute video captured at Haneda Airport, Japan, show that the accuracies for the gender classification and the bag-possession classification were 95.8% and 97.2%, respectively, which is a significant improvement from our previous work.", "paper_title": "Human Attribute Analysis Using a Top-View Camera Based on Two-Stage Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000318054200029"}
