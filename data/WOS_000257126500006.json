In this work, we tried to find a routing strategy over dynamic satellite systems to better utilize the capacity of the network. The satellite networks are not affected by natural disasters, therefore they can be used widely during and after disasters. The Minimum Flow Maximum Residual (MFMR) routing algorithm over the Routing Set boundaries is proposed in order to better utilize the capacity of the system by distributing the load over the shortest path alternatives of the system. We assumed the satellite network as having finite states and formulated the problem by using Finite State Automation concept along with earth-fixed cell strategy by using a virtual satellite network model. The routing problem in satellite networks is previously studied in the literature and it is conjectured that the problem is NP-Hard. The online and offline problems are stated and the MFMR algorithm is described in detail. The algorithm is compared with alternatives by simulating the network on Opnet Modeler. Finally, the performance analysis of different scenarios is given in this work.", "paper_title": "Minimum flow maximum residual routing in LEO satellite networks using routing set", "paper_id": "WOS:000257126500006"}
