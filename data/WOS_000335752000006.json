Inf. Theory, 25:1-7, 1979) of a graph G=(V,E) can be defined as the maximum of the sum of the entries of a positive semidefinite matrix X, whose trace Tr(X) equals 1, and X (ij) =0 whenever {i,j}aE. This function appears as a subroutine for many algorithms for graph problems such as maximum independent set and maximum clique. We apply Arora and Kale's primal-dual method for SDP to design an algorithm to approximate the I-function within an additive error of delta > 0, which runs in time , where I=I(G) and M (e) =O(n (3)) is the time for a matrix exponentiation operation. It follows that for perfect graphs G, our primal-dual method computes I(G) exactly in time O(I (2) n (5)logn). Moreover, our techniques generalize to the weighted Lovasz I-function, and both the maximum independent set weight and the maximum clique weight for vertex weighted perfect graphs can be approximated within a factor of (1+I mu) in time O(I mu (-2) n (5)logn).", "paper_title": "An SDP Primal-Dual Algorithm for Approximating the Lovasz-Theta Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000335752000006"}
