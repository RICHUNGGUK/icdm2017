These structures are assumed as basic computational units of the neuron, capable of realizing the various mathematical operations. The well structured higher order neurons have shown improved computational power and generalization ability. However, these models are difficult to train because of a combinatorial explosion of higher order terms as the number of inputs to the neuron increases. In this paper we present a neural network using new neuron architecture i.e., generalized mean neuron (GMN) model. This neuron model consists of an aggregation function which is based on the generalized mean of all the inputs applied to it. The resulting neuron model has the same number of parameters with improved computational power as the existing multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. The capability of this model has been tested on the classification and time series prediction problems.", "paper_title": "Neural network learning with generalized-mean based neuron model", "paper_id": "WOS:000233517800010"}
