Even though the correlations between all the ranked lists are very high, there are considerable individual differences between the rankings as can be seen by visual inspection, showing that the correlation measure is not sensitive enough. Thus we also compute other measures, Spearman's footrule and the M-measure that are more sensitive to the differences between the rankings in the sense that the range of values is larger than the range of correlation values when comparing the JIF ranking to the rankings induced by the h-type indices.
