auditory interfaces for visually impaired and blind computer users Two different auditory interfaces in spatial and non spatial condition were proposed to represent the hierarchical menu structure of a simple word processing application In the horizontal interface, the sound sources or the menu items were located in the horizontal plane on a virtual ring surrounding the user s head while the sound sources in the vertical Interface were aligned one above the other in front of the user In the vertical interface the central pitch of the sound sources at different elevations was changed in order to improve the otherwise relatively low localization performance in the vertical dimension The interaction with the interfaces was based on a standard computer keyboard for input and a pair of studio headphones for output Twelve blind or visually impaired test subjects were asked to perform ten different word processing tasks within four experiment conditions Task completion times navigation performance, overall satisfaction and cognitive workload were evaluated The initial hypothesis i e that the spatial auditory interfaces with multiple simultaneous sounds should prove to be faster and more efficient than non-spatial ones, was not confirmed On the contrary-spatial auditory interfaces proved to be significantly slower due to the high cognitive workload and temporal demand The majority of users did in fact finish tasks with less navigation and key pressing, however they required much more time They reported the spatial auditory interfaces to be hard to use for a longer period of time due to the high temporal and mental demand especially with regards to the comprehension of multiple simultaneous sounds The comparison between the horizontal and vertical Interface showed no significant differences between the two It is important to point out that all participants were novice users of the system therefore it is possible that the overall performance could change with a more extensive use of the interfaces and an increased number of trials or experiments sets Our interviews with visually impaired and blind computer users showed that they are used to sharing their auditory channel in order to perform multiple simultaneous tasks such as listening to the radio, talking to somebody using the computer etc As the perception of multiple simultaneous sounds requires the entire capacity of the auditory channel and total concentration of the listener, it does therefore not enable such multitasking (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title":
