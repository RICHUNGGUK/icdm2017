First, to optimize the transmission performance, conventional transmission line analysis scheme is creatively adopted to the IBC design to characterize the body channel. Second, switched-capacitor filters based on sampling rate boosting technique are adopted for higher accuracy and lower power consumption. Third, a novel RFE topology is proposed to further enhance the IBC performance. The new RFE is designed and fabricated in a standard 180-nm CMOS process. Measurement results show that the RFE can successfully transmit data spanning the whole human body, around 180 cm, which is one of the longest transmission distances reported in related literatures. Furthermore, it reaches a maximum data rate of 2.5 Mb/s with a bit error rate less than 1e-7 and consumes 5.4 mW from a 1.8 V supply. The proposed RFE compares favorably to similar reported works.", "paper_title": "A 5.4-mW 180-cm Transmission Distance 2.5-Mb/s Advanced Techniques-Based Novel Intrabody Communication Receiver Analog Front End", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300008"}
