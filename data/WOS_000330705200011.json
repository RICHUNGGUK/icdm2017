The proposed mixed-effects random forest' (MERF) is implemented using a standard RF algorithm within the framework of the expectation-maximization algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed MERF method provides substantial improvements over standard RF when the random effects are non-negligible. The use of the method is illustrated to predict the first-week box office revenues of movies.", "paper_title": "Mixed-effects random forest for clustered data", "paper_id": "WOS:000330705200011"}
