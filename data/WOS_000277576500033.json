We adopt an Equivalent Transformation Framework (ETF) as the base of our study. In an ETF, a set of rules that defines correct computations is generated from a problem specification described by a set of definite clauses. A correct program that executes the actual computation defined by the rule set is then generated. This paper discusses program generation for distributed memory parallel computers from a set of rules within ETF. For distributed parallel processing, we extract a part of a computation, characterized by a general concept called \"specialization\" in ETF from the computation defined by the set of rules. Specialization is a kind of atom operation that includes unification in logic programming. In this paper, we present a parallel processing program generation framework based on specialization, its theoretical background, and its implementation. The correctness of the program generated is also discussed.", "paper_title": "PARALLEL PROCESSING FRAMEWORK BASED ON DISTRIBUTED COMPUTATION OF SPECIALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500033"}
