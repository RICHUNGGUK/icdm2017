Modeling the distribution of the correlation noise via a Gaussian mixture, with discrete or continuous mixing variable, provides a unified signal model able to describe a wide class of distributions, useful in the context of practical applications. The Wyner-Ziv rate-distortion function associated with this signal model cannot, in general, be obtained in analytical form. This paper contributes a method for its analysis, by providing computable upper and lower bounds.", "paper_title": "Rate-Distortion Bounds for Wyner-Ziv Coding With Gaussian Scale Mixture Correlation Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000345511400009"}
