Normally, a greedy strategy is applied due to the difficulty of directly solving the l(1)-norm maximization problem, which is, however, easy to get stuck in local solution. In this paper, we propose a robust 2DPCA with non-greedy l(1)-norm maximization in which all projection directions are optimized simultaneously. Experimental results on face and other datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Robust 2DPCA With Non-greedy l(1)-Norm Maximization for Image Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000353152700020"}
