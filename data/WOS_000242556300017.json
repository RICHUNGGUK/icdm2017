The methodology integrates the advantages of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Orthogonal Design Scheme (ODS). OSACO is based on the following principles: a) each independent variable space (IVS) of CFO is dispersed into a number of random and movable nodes; b) the carriers of pheromone of ACO are shifted to the nodes; c) solution path can be obtained by choosing one appropriate node from each IVS by ant; d) with the ODS, the best solved path is further improved. The proposed algorithm has been successfully applied to 10 benchmark test functions. The performance and a comparison with CACO and FEP have been studied.", "paper_title": "Continuous function optimization using hybrid ant colony approach with orthogonal design scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300017"}
