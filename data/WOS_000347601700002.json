In particular, we investigate and present the minimum set of messages whose delivery must be guaranteed to ensure the equivalence of this model to asynchronous wait-free shared-memory. Delivery guarantees were investigated in the past at the other extreme - delivery guarantees that ensure consensus. Because message failure is a more refined type of fault than processor crash failure, we were able to use in this paper an extremely simple message-passing model to characterize exactly what is computable in wait-free read-write shared memory. We use a synchronous complete network where in each round a subset from a defined family of subsets of messages, must be successfully delivered. With this model we obtain an extremely simple derivation of the Herlihy-Shavit condition that equates the wait-free read-write model with a subdivided-simplex. We show how each step in the computation inductively takes a subdivided-simplex and further subdivides it in the simplest way possible, making the characterization of read-write wait-free widely accessible.
