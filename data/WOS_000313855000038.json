The statistical confidence intervals of traditional principal component analysis (PCA) based T-2 and SPE diagnostics rely upon the assumption that the operating data follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution approximately and therefore may not be able to determine the faulty variables in multimode non-Gaussian processes accurately. As an alternative solution, the proposed BIGMC method first identifies the multiple Gaussian modes corresponding to different operating conditions and then integrates the Mahalanobis distance based variable contributions across all the Gaussian clusters through Bayesian inference strategy. The derived BIGMC index is of probabilistic feature and includes all operation scenarios with posterior probabilities as weighting factors. The Tennessee Eastman process (TEP) is used to demonstrate the utility of the proposed BIGMC method for fault diagnosis of multimode processes. The comparison of the single-PCA and multi-PCA based contribution approaches shows that the BIGMC method can effectively identify the leading faulty variables with superior diagnosis capability.
