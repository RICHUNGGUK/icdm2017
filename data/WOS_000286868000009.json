An, intense laser can be filtered to make a faint one to be used for production of a single photon which is necessary in our scheme. The optical devices used are conventional ones such as interferometer, mirrors, beam-splitters, phase-shifters and photo-detectors. We also provide a detailed analysis on the effects of possible imperfections and decoherence showing that our scheme is robust against such effects.", "paper_title": "GENERATION OF CLUSTER-TYPE ENTANGLED COHERENT STATES USING WEAK NONLINEARITIES AND INTENSE LASER BEAMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000286868000009"}
