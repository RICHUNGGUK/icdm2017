This flow is supposed to be laminar, viscous and incompressible. For description of this type of flow the model of the Navier-Stokes equations could be used. One can find steady solution of unsteady system by using multistage Rungue-Kutta method together with time dependent artificial compressibility method. Some results are presented for a channel with angular bypass in 2D and 3D. One could use results of this problem in the field of the cardiovascular research.
