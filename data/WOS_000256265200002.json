I reject this claim, along with Elkan's 'paradox% oil the grounds that it is rooted in an unfounded distinction between controllers and expert systems. But a rejection of Elkan's 'paradox' does not automatically license the use of fuzzy logic, and the burden is oil the fuzzy community to give a positive account of why fuzzy logic should be used to model vagueness and uncertainty. I begin this task in the second half of the paper, where I evaluate the correctness of using fuzzy logic to model vagueness and two kinds of uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Elkan's 'paradox' and the correctness of fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000256265200002"}
