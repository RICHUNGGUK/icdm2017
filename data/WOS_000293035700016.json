In this paper, we introduce a new cost model for searching multi-dimensional data in mobile P2P environment and propose a novel multi-dimensional mobile P2P search framework called MIME. MIME models the physical node layout in a two-dimensional plane and keeps records of the locations of the nodes to construct a proximity-aware P2P overlay. MIME is able to employ two different split schemes for the construction of the overlay. We propose query processing techniques for such P2P overlay. In addition, we employ a novel expanding method for tuning the performance of KNN queries in MIME. We also discuss two adaptive features incorporated into MIME to support mobility: an update algorithm that makes dynamic updates to the overlay, and a cache mechanism that reduces the load of data migration during the updates. The experimental results show that the proposed techniques are effective, and that MIME achieves significant performance improvements in Point, Range, and KNN queries compared to the conventional system.
