This paper proposes a new method for knowledge reduction in information systems. First, two families of closed sets C-r and C-R are defined, where r and R are equivalence relations defined on the attribute set and its power set, respectively. The properties of C, and CR are also discussed. The necessary and sufficient condition for C-r = C-R is then given and employed to construct an approach to attribute reduction in information systems. It is also proved that under the condition C, = CR, the proposed approach to knowledge reduction is equivalent to the well-accepted one in reference [W.X. Zhang, Y. Leung, W.Z.
