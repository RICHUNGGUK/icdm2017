This work proposes a design that largely relies on passive transmission-gate multiplexers. Many variations are suggested that can inherently generate a thermometer coded output or one-hot encoded output. The proposed structure has area and power that increases with order n (2) for a n number of inputs. A folding technique is then suggested that reduces the area/power to order n log(n). The folded passive linear counter also has a cell-based structure that aids in layout and makes it possible to be added to a digital standard cell library.", "paper_title": "A multiplexer-based digital passive linear counter (PLINCO)", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700016"}
