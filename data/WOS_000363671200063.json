Our method allows to automatically correct these variations, thus producing an 'idealized' version of the image in which the resemblance between recurring structures is stronger. Alternatively, it can be used to magnify these variations, thus producing an exaggerated image which highlights the various variations that are difficult to spot in the input image. We formulate the estimation of deviations from perfect recurrence as a general optimization problem, and demonstrate it in the particular cases of geometric deformations and color variations.", "paper_title": "Revealing and Modifying Non-Local Variations in a Single Image", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200063"}
