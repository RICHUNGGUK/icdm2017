The particular cases of B = empty set and #B = 1 are of special interest and have some links with graph theory. We also consider the corresponding question for the least common multiple of the elements. We establish NP-completeness and approximation results for these problems by relating them to the Set Cover Problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
