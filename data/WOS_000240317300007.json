This problem is called the group testing in hypergraphs, which has been found to have many applications in molecular biology, such as the interactions between bait proteins and prey proteins, the complexes of eukaryotic DNA transcription and RNA translation. In this paper, we present a general construction for constructions of nonadaptive algorithms for group testing in hypergraphs.", "paper_title": "Construction of d(H)-disjunct matrix for group testing in hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240317300007"}
