Next, the decoder architecture and the state diagram of finite state machine (FSM) are designed. In addition, the power model of test vectors is analyzed, and the power consumption of scanned-in vectors is roughly evaluated. The six largest ISCAS'89 benchmark circuits verify the proposed coding method has a shorter codeword.
