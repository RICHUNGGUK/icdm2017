This general model, which is the interconnection of a linear delayed dynamic system and a bounded static nonlinear operator, covers several well-known neural networks, such as Hopfield neural networks, cellular neural networks (CNNs), bidirectional associative memory (BAM) networks, and recurrent multilayer perceptrons (RMLPs) with or without delays. Using the drive-response concept, time-delay feedback controllers are designed to synchronize two identical chaotic neural networks as quickly as possible. The control design equations are shown to be a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) which can be easily solved by various convex optimization algorithms to determine the optimal control law and the optimal exponential synchronization rate. Detailed comparisons with existing results are made and numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the established synchronization laws. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
