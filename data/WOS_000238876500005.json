The role was initially defined by us, but evolved in these two organisations. We conducted interviews with usability designers, project managers and a user representative. Our main research question was whether or not the introduction of a usability designer has been successful in terms of changes in the systems development process and the impact the role has had on products, projects and organisations. To some extent, the role has met our expectations and intentions for instance, in helping the usability designers shift their focus towards design, and assume some kind of \"users' advocate\" role. But in other ways, the role \"failed\". The usability designers in our study are still facing the kind of problems and obstacles that usability professionals have always had to deal with.
