We propose a two-phase approach to solve the problem. In the first phase, we propose a coarse-grained task parallelization algorithm called RDAG to transform a periodic dependent task graph into a set of independent tasks by exploiting the periodic feature of streaming applications. In the second phase, we propose a scheduling algorithm, GeneS, to optimize energy consumption. GeneS is a genetic algorithm that can search and find the best schedule within the solution space generated by gene evolution. We conduct experiments with a set of benchmarks from E3S and TGFF. The experimental results show that our approach can achieve a 24.4% reduction in energy consumption on average compared with the previous work.", "paper_title": "Overhead-Aware Energy Optimization for Real-Time Streaming Applications on Multiprocessor System-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000289069700002"}
