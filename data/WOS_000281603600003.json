Mobile clients can access replicas of desired data from parallel, mobile grid nodes. These offer effective, efficient and reliable ways of using a variety of superior resources, such as the remaining energy, the bandwidth and the stability of connection in the nodes. The simulations presented here show that the RARS performs excellently and in the transmission time and the survival rate of the mobile nodes it exceeds all other approaches.", "paper_title": "RARS: a Resource-Aware Replica Selection and co-allocation scheme for mobile grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000281603600003"}
