In this paper, we propose a multi-granularity oriented service organization and recommendation approach in consideration of users' role, requested goal, and service execution process. Based on modeling the Role (R), Goal (G), Process (P), and Services (S) models that are related to a specific domain problem (SDP), we use the dependency relationships among RGPS elements to realize on-demand service organization. Four kinds of service recommendation algorithms are designed according to different representations of users' requirements. Then the services with different granularity and partnerships are provided to users. In addition, the corresponding services evolution algorithms are designed to make the organized services adapt to dynamic changing environments. Finally, we conduct experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
