FROGi is implemented on top of the OSGi platform. Motivation for this work is twofold. On one hand FROGi provides an extensible component model to OSCi developers and eases bundle providing. FROGi-based bundles are still compatible with legacy OSGi bundles that offer third party services. On the other hand, FROGi benefits from the deployment infrastructure provided by OSGi which simplifies conditioning and packaging of Fractal components. With FROGi, it is possible to automate the assembly of a Fractal component application. Partial or complete deployment is also supported as well as performing continuous deployment and update activities.", "paper_title": "FROGi: Fractal components deployment over OSGi", "paper_id": "WOS:000241358100018"}
