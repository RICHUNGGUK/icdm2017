We point out the equivalence of constructions between them, i.e., from PN functions, one can obtain optimal universal hash families and vice versa. As an application of our construction, a message authentication code is proposed, which provides better resistance to substitution attack than a known construction given by Cadet et al. in 2006. More generally, the connections between functions with given differential uniformity and some universal hash families are studied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
