The Min-Power Bidirectional (resp., Unidirectional) k-Node Connectivity problem seeks a range assignment of minimum total power subject to the constraint that the produced bidirectional (resp. unidirectional) topology is k-vertex connected. Similarly, the Min-Power Bidirectional (resp., Unidirectional) k-Edge Connectivity problem seeks a range assignment of minimum total power subject to the constraint the produced bidirectional (resp., unidirectional) topology is k-edge connected. The Min-Power Bidirectional Biconnectivity problem and the Min-Power Bidirectional Edge-Biconnectivity problem have been studied by Lloyd et al. [23]. They show that range assignment based the approximation algorithm of Khuller and Raghavachari [ 18], which we refer to as Algorithm KR, has an approximation ratio of at most 2(2 - 2/n)(2 + 1/n) for Min-Power Bidirectional Biconnectivity, and range assignment based on the approximation algorithm of Khuller and Vishkin [19], which we refer to as Algorithm KV, has an approximation ratio of at most 8(1 - 1/n) for Min-Power Bidirectional Edge-Biconnectivity. In this paper, we first establish the NP-hardness of Min-Power Bidirectional (Edge-) Biconnectivity. Then we show that Algorithm KR has an approximation ratio of at most 4 for both Min-Power Bidirectional Biconnectivity and Min-Power Unidirectional Biconnectivity, and Algorithm KV has an approximation ratio of at most 2k for both Min-Power Bidirectional k-Edge Connectivity and Min-Power Unidirectional k-Edge Connectivity. We also propose a new simple constant-approximation algorithm for both Min-Power Bidirectional Biconnectivity and Min-Power Unidirectional Biconnectivity. This new algorithm applies only to Euclidean instances, but is best suited for distributed implementation.", "paper_title": "Range assignment for biconnectivity and k-Edge Connectivity in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237835400002"}
