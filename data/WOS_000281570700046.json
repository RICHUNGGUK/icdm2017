The procedure, a modification of an inverse subspace iteration procedure, uses adaptively determined Chebyshev polynomials to approximate the required application of the inverse operator on the subspace. The method is robust, converges with acceptable rapidity, and can easily handle operators with eigenvalues of multiplicity greater than one. Numerical results are shown that demonstrate the utility of the procedure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
