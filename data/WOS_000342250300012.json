Supplier selection can best be described as a highly complex process, due to the involvement of many, sometimes conflicting, qualitative and quantitative criteria. The objective is to select the most suitable supplier(s) that meet a company's specific needs. This paper investigates supplier selection in the airline retail industry. We discuss a number of issues that make airline retail complex and distinguish it from conventional retail. The supplier selection problem is solved by means of a two-phased methodology. In the first phase, a conjunctive screening method is used, which aims to reduce the initial set of potential suppliers prior to the comprehensive final choice phase. In the second phase, a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used, in which suppliers are evaluated against the main criteria and sub-criteria. By combining the decision-maker's preferences, using the developed methodology will eventually result in a ranking of suppliers that makes it possible to select the most suitable supplier(s). The proposed methodology is applied to one of the largest airlines in Europe, the Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM), and the results are discussed extensively in this paper. We conclude by proposing avenues for future research regarding the general applicability and further extensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
