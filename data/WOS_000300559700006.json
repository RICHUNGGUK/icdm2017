While the CS literature has mostly focused on problems involving 1-D signals and 2-D images, many important applications involve multidimensional signals; the construction of sparsifying bases and measurement systems for such signals is complicated by their higher dimensionality. In this paper, we propose the use of Kronecker product matrices in CS for two purposes. First, such matrices can act as sparsifying bases that jointly model the structure present in all of the signal dimensions. Second, such matrices can represent themeasurement protocols used in distributed settings. Our formulation enables the derivation of analytical bounds for the sparse approximation of multidimensional signals and CS recovery performance, as well as a means of evaluating novel distributed measurement schemes.", "paper_title": "Kronecker Compressive Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700006"}
