We refined DeLone and McLean's IS success model to examine the relative importance of ERP system quality, information quality, and service quality to post-implementation success, with users' satisfaction, users' individual benefits, and a very critical yet seldom investigated variable, users' extended use of ERP systems, as the outcome variables. Our research model was empirically examined with data from 151 ERP users. We found that service quality, in conjunction with system quality and information quality, significantly affects ERP post-implementation success in terms of user satisfaction. More importantly, service quality was found to significantly interact with information quality and system quality to promote an ERP system's post-implementation success by increasing employees' extended use.
