The electric machine, which has lap stator winding and surface permanent magnets, has been designed for islanded-use purposes. The study takes into consideration the open-circuit type faults. It was analyzed the operation under healthy, one-phase open-circuited and two-phase open-circuited (adjacent and non-adjacent) conditions respectively. The results derive from FEM-based simulations and experimental tests.", "paper_title": "Study on the Fault-Tolerance Concept of the Five-Phase Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator", "paper_id": "WOS:000340868100013"}
