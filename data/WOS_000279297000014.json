It is shown that QOSTFCs can provide significantly better error performance, compared to the conventional MB-OFDM UWB (without STFCs) and to the orthogonal STFCs (OSTFCs) of the same order, at the same data rate, without increasing the total transmission power. Another form of the enhancement would be that QOSTFCs can provide higher data rates with the same error performance, compared to OSTFCs. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
