However, a comprehensive understanding about the state-of-the-art is still required. Goal: This paper aims at classifying and performing a thematic analysis of the current literature. Method: For this, we have followed well-established empirical guidelines to define and perform a systematic mapping study. Results: Some studies (14 out of 40) provide generic model comparison techniques, rather than specific ones for UML diagrams. Conclusion: Fine-grained techniques are still required to support ever-present and complex model comparison tasks during the evolution of design models.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Design Models: A Systematic Mapping Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000372155400028"}
