We derive several families of facet-defining inequalities via sequence-independent lifting techniques. We then show that these sets have a polyhedral structure that is similar to that of a certain fixed-charge single-node flow set. As a result, we also obtain new facet-defining inequalities for the single-node flow set that generalize well-known lifted flow cover inequalities from the integer programming literature.", "paper_title": "Lifted inequalities for mixed-integer bilinear covering sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000336278500015"}
