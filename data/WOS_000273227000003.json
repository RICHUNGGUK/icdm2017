It is responsible for superior performance, reliability and range. In this tutorial, we provide a brief introduction to multiple antenna techniques. We describe the two main classes of those techniques, spatial diversity and spatial multiplexing. To ground our discussion, we explain how they work in 802.11n NICs in practice.", "paper_title": "802.11 with Multiple Antennas for Dummies", "paper_id": "WOS:000273227000003"}
