The major issue in large-scale distributed systems is to prevent the phenomenon of a communication bottleneck or a single point of failure. Conventional approaches may not be able to apply directly to such environments due to restricted queries and varied resource characteristics. Alternatively, a fully decentralized resource discovery service based on an unstructured overlay, which relies only on the information of resource attributes and characteristics, may be a feasible solution. One major challenge of such service is to locate desired and suitable resources without the global knowledge of distributed sharing resources. As a consequence, the more nodes the resource discovery service involves, the higher the network overhead incurs. In this paper, we proposed a direction-aware strategy which can alleviate the network traffic among unstructured information systems for distributed resource discovery service. Experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach achieves higher success rate at low cost and higher scalability.", "paper_title": "Direction-aware resource discovery in large-scale distributed computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000325022800014"}
