In our model, a vertex i is assigned a fitness x(i), drawn from a given probability distribution function f(x). During network evolution, with rate p we add a vertex j of fitness x(j) and connect to an existing vertex i of fitness x(i) selected preferentially to a linking probability function g(x(i), x(j)) which depends on the fitnesses of the two vertices involved and, with rate 1 - p we create an edge between two already existed vertices with fitnesses x(i) and x(j), with a probability also preferential to the connection function g(x(i), x(j)). For the proper choice of g, the resulting networks have generalized power-laws, irrespective of the fitness distribution of vertices.", "paper_title": "MUTUAL SELECTION IN NETWORK EVOLUTION: THE ROLE OF THE INTRINSIC FITNESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274267700009"}
