This model takes into account that experts have different backgrounds and knowledge levels, allowing to use different preference representations as fuzzy preference relations or linguistic preference relations with multigranular linguistic information. Furthermore, we allow to introduce some changes on the alternatives of the problem at every stage of the decision process. To do that: i) a mobile implementation is proposed to reduce the number of changes and ii) a mechanism to insert/remove alternatives is included in the model. Finally, our new decision model incorporates a feedback mechanism that sends recommendations to the experts in order to quickly obtain a high consensus level.", "paper_title": "A MOBILE GROUP DECISION MAKING MODEL FOR HETEROGENEOUS INFORMATION AND CHANGEABLE DECISION CONTEXTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209497000004"}
