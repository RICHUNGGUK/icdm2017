This paper presents a healthcare system based on cloud computing and robotics, which consists of wireless body area networks, robot, software system and cloud platform. This system is expected to accurately measure user's physiological information for analysis and feedback, which is assisted by the robot integrated with various sensors. In order to improve the practicability of multi-media transmission in the healthcare system, this paper proposes a novel scheme to deliver real-time video contents through an improved UDP-based protocol. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated with experimental study based on a real testbed.", "paper_title": "Robot and cloud-assisted multi-modal healthcare system", "paper_id": "WOS:000361897200021"}
