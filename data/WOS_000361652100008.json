This is particularly an issue when the network is dynamic and is defined by events that occur over time. We present an example of such a scenario in the analysis of edit networks in Wikipedia-the networks of editors interacting on Wikipedia pages. We propose the prediction of article quality as a task that allows us to quantify the informativeness of alternative network views. We present three fundamentally different views on the data that attempt to capture structural and temporal aspects of the edit networks. We demonstrate that each view captures information that is unique to that view and propose a strategy for integrating the different sources of information.", "paper_title": "Integration of multiple network views in Wikipedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000361652100008"}
