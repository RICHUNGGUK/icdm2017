Recent research has attempted to address these issues by employing remote servers, such as clouds and peer mobile devices. For mobile devices deployed in dynamic networks (i.e., with frequent topology changes because of node failure/unavailability and mobility as in a mobile cloud), however, challenges of reliability and energy efficiency remain largely unaddressed. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to address these challenges in an integrated manner for both data storage and processing in mobile cloud, an approach we call k-out-of-n computing. In our solution, mobile devices successfully retrieve or process data, in the most energy-efficient way, as long as k out of n remote servers are accessible. Through a real system implementation we prove the feasibility of our approach. Extensive simulations demonstrate the fault tolerance and energy efficiency performance of our framework in larger scale networks.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Fault-Tolerant Data Storage and Processing in Mobile Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000365329600003"}
