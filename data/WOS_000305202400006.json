However, it does not currently provide an object-oriented design method for design of a product's software system. Also, function structure is limited in identifying supporting mechanisms for individual physical components. The proposed integrated function structure and object-oriented design framework improves the function structure approach, and provides methods of generating variant and common components for the product family. This framework integrates the function structure, object model, and system architecture to explore the development of products requiring the interplay of physical and software elements concurrently. Many classes of products could benefit from this approach. We present in this paper a virtual prototyping tool for conceptual design leveraging on the proposed framework and demonstrating its usage and advantages. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
