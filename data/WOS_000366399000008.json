The tradeoff between the FD and half-duplex (HD) modes for relay selection techniques is also analyzed, where the former suffers from the impact of residual self-interference, but the latter requires more channel resources than the former (i.e., two orthogonal channels are required). Furthermore, the impact of optimal power allocation (OPA) on the proposed relay-selection scheme is analyzed. Particularly, the exact closed-form expressions for outage probability of the proposed scheme over Rayleigh fading channels are derived, followed by validating the proposed analysis using simulation. Numerical results show that the proposed FD based scheme outperforms the HD based scheme by more than 4 dB in terms of coding gain, provided that the residual self-interference level in the FD mode can be substantially suppressed to the level that is below the noise power.", "paper_title": "Power Allocation for Opportunistic Full-Duplex based Relay Selection in Cooperative Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000008"}
