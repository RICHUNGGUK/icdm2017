This new graphic algorithm is a vital part of a complex system called DMD (detection measure and description), which was recently proposed by the authors. The benefit of this algorithm over previous versions is its ability to operate in real time to satisfy the needs of augmented reality simulation. The performance speed (in frames per second) of six volume-rendering algorithms was determined for models with and without semi-transparent pixels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
