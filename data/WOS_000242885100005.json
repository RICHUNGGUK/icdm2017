Lower bounds and optimal algorithms for every s >= 1 are given, where s is the speed ratio of two machines. Both the overall competitive ratio and the competitive ratio for s>1+root 5/2 are strictly smaller than those of the optimal algorithms of the corresponding semi-online scheduling problem with known optimal value. It indicates that two related semi-online problems are different.", "paper_title": "Semi-online machine covering on two uniform machines with known total size", "paper_id": "WOS:000242885100005"}
