This approach is in the spirit of the recently proposed Markov logic networks for machine learning. Its purpose is to learn the soft-constraint logic rules for labeling the components of a scene. In our approach, FOIL (First Order Inductive Learner) is applied to learn the logic rules for MLN and then gradient ascent search is utilized to compute weights attached to each rule for softening the rules. This approach also benefits from the architecture of ToK, in reasoning whether a component in a scene has the right characteristics in order to fulfil the functions a label implies, from the logic point of view. One significant advantage of the proposed approach, rather than the previous versions of ToK, is its automatic logic learning capability such that the manual insertion of logic rules is not necessary. Experiments of labeling the identified components in buildings, for building scene interpretation, illustrate the promise of this approach.", "paper_title": "LEARNING LOGIC RULES FOR THE TOWER OF KNOWLEDGE USING MARKOV LOGIC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295128400005"}
