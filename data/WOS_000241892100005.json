The advantages of the proposed scheme for the designed lock is that it can be implemented in the noisily broadcasting channel. Based on physics of the quantum system, the secret messages are broadcasted to the legal users in the noisy environments with unconditionally security.", "paper_title": "Secure broadcasting using the secure quantum lock in noisy environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100005"}
