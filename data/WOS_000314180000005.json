Our scheme is unidirectional and single-hop. The security of our scheme is under the reasonable complexity assumptionthe decisional bilinear DiffieHellman assumption in bilinear groups. There are no proxy re-encryption schemes achieving chosen-ciphertext security in the standard model without a strong unforgeable one-time signature in the literature.
