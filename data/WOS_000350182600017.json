The purpose of this paper is to incorporate risk into bank efficiency and to provide a snapshot of the efficiency profile of the Greek banking industry. Efficiency is measured by means of a satisficing data envelopment analysis (DEA) model in which the financial risk is proxied by credit risk provisions and by the participation of banks in the Private Sector Involvement (PSI), a controllable and an uncontrollable factor by the bank management, respectively. The results of the proposed probabilistic DEA model derived through the Monte-Carlo simulation are compared with the results of the respective deterministic model. As the constructed stochastic frontier screens further some of the 'best-in-class' banks, the merit of the proposed metric is evident. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
