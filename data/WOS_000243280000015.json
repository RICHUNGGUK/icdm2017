Up to now, several adder designs using QCA technology have been proposed. However, it was found that not all of the designs function properly. This paper analyzes the reasons of the failures and proposes adders that exploit proper clocking schemes.", "paper_title": "The robust QCA adder designs using composable QCA building blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243280000015"}
