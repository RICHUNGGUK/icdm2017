The relevance of this contribution is twofold. First, it combines the expressive power and flexibility of Sequencing Graphs, and the interoperability capabilities of IMS. Second, it shows some important limitations of IMS specifications (focusing on Learning Design) for the sequencing of learning activities.", "paper_title": "Authoring Courses with Rich Adaptive Sequencing for IMS Learning Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754400005"}
