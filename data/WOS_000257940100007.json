Translation of multipole expansion in spherical harmonics is the most important operation of the fast multipole method and the fast Fourier transform (FFT) acceleration of this operation is among the fastest methods of improving its performance. The technique relies on highly optimized implementation of fast Fourier transform routines for the desired expansion sizes, which need to incorporate the knowledge of symmetries and zero elements in the input arrays. Here a method is presented for automatic generation of such, highly optimized, routines.", "paper_title": "Automatic generation of FFT for translations of multipole expansions in spherical harmonics", "paper_id": "WOS:000257940100007"}
