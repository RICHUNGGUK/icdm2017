Solid state qubits are frequently affected by random telegraph noise due to bistable impurities of different nature coupled to the device. In this paper, we investigate the possibility to achieve an efficient universal two-qubit gate in the presence of random telegraph noise by periodic dynamical decoupling. We find an analytic form of the gate error as a function of the number of applied pulses valid when the gate time is much shorter then the telegraphic process correlation time. The analysis is further supplemented by exact numerical results demonstrating the feasibility of a highly-efficient universal two-qubit gate.", "paper_title": "Dynamical decoupling of random telegraph noise in a two-qubit gate", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807900009"}
