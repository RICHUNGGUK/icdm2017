The local evaluation tool has the form of a multivariate probability density of gray levels in a suitably chosen search window. First, the density function in the form of Gaussian mixture is estimated from data obtained by scanning of the mammogram with the search window. Then we evaluate the estimated mixture at each position and display the corresponding log-likelihood value as a gray level at the window center. The resulting log-likelihood Image closely correlates with the structural details of the original mammogram and emphasizes unusual places. We assume that, in parallel use, the log-likelihood Image may provide additional Information to facilitate the identification of malignant lesions as untypical locations of high novelty.", "paper_title": "Computer-Aided Evaluation of Screening Mammograms Based on Local Texture Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000264397100007"}
