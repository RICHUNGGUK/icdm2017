Our aim is to reconstruct an accurate shape of a human foot from multiple camera images, which can capture dynamic behavior of the object. In this paper, a foot-shape database is used for accurate reconstruction of human foot. By using Principal Component Analysis, the foot shape can be represented with new meaningful variables. The dimensionality of the data is also reduced. Thus, the shape of object can be recovered efficiently, even though the object is partially occluded in some input views. To demonstrate the proposed method, two kinds of experiments are presented: reconstruction of human foot in a virtual reality environment with CG multi-camera images, and in real world with eight CCD cameras. In the experiments, the reconstructed shape error with our method is around 2 mm in average, while the error is more than 4 mm with conventional volume intersection method.", "paper_title": "Human foot reconstruction from multiple camera images with foot shape database", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827000016"}
