Two factors have a major influence on the stiffness; firstly the boundary condition through the gear rim size included in the stiffness calculation and secondly the size of the contact. In the FE calculation the true gear tooth root profile is applied. The meshing stiffnesses of gears are highly non-linear, it is however found that the stiffness of an individual tooth can be expressed in a linear form assuming that the contact width is constant.
