An infrastructure of signals, protocols, interfaces and a controller is exposed to perform safe hardware/software reconfigurations. This infrastructure is part of the Tornado framework that includes other elements such as a multi-context assembler for a reconfigurable processor or a custom design flow developed for the Wishbone IP-Core interconnection specification. We present two applications where the presented control system has been applied, and it is compared with other available approaches. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
