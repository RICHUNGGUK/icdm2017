In this method, both the geometry and the physical field are represented by bivariate splines in Bernstein-Bezier form over the triangulation. We describe a set of procedures to construct a parametric domain and its triangulation from a given physical domain, construct C-r-smooth basis functions over the domain, and establish a rational Triangular Bezier Spline (rTBS) based geometric mapping that C-r-smoothly maps the parametric domain to the physical domain and exactly recovers the NURBS boundaries at the domain boundary. As a result, this approach can achieve automated meshing of objects with complex topologies and allow highly localized refinement. Isogeometric analysis of problems from linear elasticity and advection-diffusion analysis is demonstrated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
