Such data are common in many practical inspection environment. Anaverage run length unbiased (ARL-unbiased) control scheme is developed when the in-control scale parameter is known. The performance of the proposed control charts are investigated in terms of the ARL and standard deviation of the run length. The effects of parameter estimation on the proposed control charts are also evaluated. Then, we consider the design of theARL-unbiased control charts when the in-control scale parameter is estimated. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the implementation of the proposed control charts.", "paper_title": "ARL-unbiased control charts for the monitoring of exponentially distributed characteristics based on type-II censored samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000340874500017"}
