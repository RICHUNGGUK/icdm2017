The constraint sets are given by (not necessarily convex) inequalities, and we do not assume linear independence of gradients to active constraints. The achieved results enable us to state several versions of sharp necessary optimality conditions in optimization problems with equilibria governed by such GEs. The advantages are illustrated by means of examples.", "paper_title": "On regular coderivatives in parametric equilibria with non-unique multipliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000311675300006"}
