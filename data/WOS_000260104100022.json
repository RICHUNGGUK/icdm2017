First, this paper analyzes emergency events, finds the reasons why they happen, and classifies them into two main factors, natural factors and human factors. Based on the special characteristics of accidents of hazardous materials and the mechanisms of emergency management, this paper then presents an emergency response capacity indices system by using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). The indexing system selects three stages and eleven response capabilities relevant to establishing Systems of assessment of emergency response capacity as research subjects and develops a theoretical model for assessment of emergency response capability in hazardous materials transportation in China. In this model, a fuzzy mathematics methodology of assessment is used for describing and computing the subjects, thereby ranking the importance of various emergency response capability factors. An example is given to demonstrate the application of this assessment measure. Comparison of the comprehensive assessment results of emergency response capabilities with the computed scores reveals both the advantages and disadvantages of the enterprise concerning emergency response capability objectively. It is also indicated that the assessment indices system contributes to rebuild and enhance these weak emergency response capabilities.", "paper_title": "FUZZY ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPABILITY IN HAZARDOUS MATERIALS TRANSPORTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000260104100022"}
