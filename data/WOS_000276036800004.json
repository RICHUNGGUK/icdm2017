The proposed multimode 128 x 32 b multiplier provides throughput rates of 441 and 511 Mb/s for 256-b operands over GF(P) and GF(2(n)) at a clock rate of 100 MHz, respectively. With 21 930 additional gates for Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), the multiplier is extended to provide 1.28-, 1.06-, and 0.91-Gb/s throughput rates for 128-, 192-, and 256-b keys, respectively. The comparison result shows that the proposed integration architecture outperforms others in terms of performance and efficiency for both AES and MM that is essential in most public-key cryptosystems.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Multimode Multiplier Supporting AES and Fundamental Operations of Public-Key Cryptosystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276036800004"}
