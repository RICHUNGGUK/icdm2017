This emerging area is illustrated through a taxonomy that classifies the mobile crowdsourcing field and through three new applications that optimize location-based search and similarity services based on crowd-generated data. Such applications can be deployed on Smart Lab, a cloud of more than 40 Android devices deployed at the University of Cyprus that provides an open testbed to facilitate research and development of smartphone applications on a massive scale.", "paper_title": "Crowdsourcing with Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000308123100007"}
