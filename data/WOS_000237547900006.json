Design/methodology/approach - The business operation requirements and RFD) acceptance of distinct roles in the printing supply chain are explored via interviews and questionnaires. The printing supply chain is classified into six fundamental models and RFID application scenarios for the six models are also provided. Findings - The ideal approach for RED application in the printing supply chain is the item-tagging mechanism. Practical implications - The decision maker can refer to the cost and efficiency look-up tables to quickly evaluate the feasibility for RFD) implementation. Originality/value - This paper provides useful reference information for enterprises to evaluate the RFID implementation in the supply chain.", "paper_title": "Quantitative performance evaluation of RFID applications in the supply chain of the printing industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000237547900006"}
