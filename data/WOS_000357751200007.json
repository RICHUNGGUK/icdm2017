By constructing the suitable sliding mode surface with fractional-order derivative, a single-state sliding mode controller is designed to realize the asymptotical stability of synchronization error system. Compared with the existing results, the main results in this paper are more reasonable and rigorous. Simulation results show the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed sliding mode control method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
