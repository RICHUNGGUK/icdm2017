In the CR networks, there exist two traditional spectrum-sharing technologies called spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay. A new hybrid overlay/underlay paradigm has also been discussed in the literature. In this work, we create a unified spectrum sensing and throughput analysis model, which is suitable for overlay, underlay, and hybrid overlay/underlay paradigms in the CR networks. In the proposed model, the energy detection scheme is employed for the spectrum sensing in the network in which the co-channel interference is present among primary users and secondary users (SUs). The SUs' throughput in the proposed CR system model is then analyzed. The simulations are also carried out for demonstrating the performance of overlay, underlay, and hybrid overlay/underlay paradigms.
