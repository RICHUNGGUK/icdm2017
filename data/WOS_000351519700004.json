However, due to noisy and redundant features in high-dimensional data, it is not a trivial job to construct a well-structured graph on high-dimensional samples. In this paper, we take advantage of sparse representation in random subspaces for graph construction and propose a method called Semi-Supervised Classification based on Subspace Sparse Representation, SSC-SSR in short. SSC-SSR first generates several random subspaces from the original space and then seeks sparse representation coefficients in these subspaces. Next, it trains semi-supervised linear classifiers on graphs that are constructed by these coefficients. Finally, it combines these classifiers into an ensemble classifier by minimizing a linear regression problem. Unlike traditional graph-based semi-supervised classification methods, the graphs of SSC-SSR are data-driven instead of man-made in advance. Empirical study on face images classification tasks demonstrates that SSC-SSR not only has superior recognition performance with respect to competitive methods, but also has wide ranges of effective input parameters.", "paper_title": "Semi-supervised classification based on subspace sparse representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351519700004"}
