This navigator can be optimized for any user-defined objective function through the use of an evolutionary algorithm. The motivation of this research is to develop an efficient methodology for general goal-directed navigation in generic indoor environments as opposed to learning specialized primitive behaviors in a limited environment. To this end, a modular NN has been employed to achieve the necessary generalization capability across a variety of indoor environments. Herein, each NN module takes charge of navigating in a specialized local environment, which is the result of decomposing the whole path into a sequence of local paths through clustering of all the possible environments. We verify the efficacy of the proposed algorithm over a variety of both simulated and real unstructured indoor environments using our autonomous mobile robot platform.", "paper_title": "An optimized modular neural network controller based on environment classification and selective sensor usage for mobile robot reactive navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253522700009"}
