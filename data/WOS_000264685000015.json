Traditional Gaussian beam type methods for the Schrodinger equation are based on the Lagrangian ray tracing. Based on the first Eulerian Gaussian beam framework proposed in Leung et al. [S. Leung, J. Qian, R. Burridge, Eulerian Gaussian beams for high frequency wave propagation, Geophysics 72 (2007) SM61-SM76], we develop a new Eulerian Gaussian beam method which uses global Cartesian coordinates, level-set based implicit representation and Liouville equations. The resulting method gives uniformly distributed phases and amplitudes in phase space simultaneously. To obtain semi-classical solutions to the Schrodinger equation with different initial wave functions, we only need to slightly modify the summation formula. This yields a very efficient method for computing semi-classical solutions to the Schrodinger equation. For instance, in the one-dimensional case the proposed algorithm requires only O(sNm(2)) operations to compute s different solutions with s different initial wave functions under the influence of the same potential, where N = O(1/h), h is the Planck constant, and m << N is the number of computed beams which depends on h weakly. Numerical experiments indicate that this Eulerian Gaussian beam approach yields accurate semi-classical solutions even at caustics. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
