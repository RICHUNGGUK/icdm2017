Currently, all known direct (not non-linear) solutions to the uncalibrated structure from motion problem solve for a projective reconstruction that is related to metric by some unknown homography, and hence a necessary step in obtaining a metric reconstruction is the subsequent estimation of the rectifying homography, known as autocalibration. Although autocalibration is a well-studied problem, previous approaches have relied upon heuristic objective functions, and have a reputation for instability. We propose a maximum likelihood objective and show that it can be implemented robustly and efficiently and often provides substantially greater accuracy, especially when there are fewer views or greater noise.
