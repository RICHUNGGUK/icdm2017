Although global popularity is useful for general queries, we find that global popularity is not as useful for queries in which the global population has less knowledge of. By examining the many different communities that appear within a Web page graph, we are able to compute the popularity or authority from a specific community. Multiresolution popularity lists allow us to observe the popularity of Web pages with respect to communities at different resolutions within the Web. Multiresolution popularity lists have been shown to have high potential when compared against PageRank. In this paper, we generalize the multiresolution popularity analysis to use any form of Web page link relations. We provide results for both the PageRank relations and the In-degree relations. By utilizing the multiresolution popularity lists, we achieve a 13 percent and 25 percent improvement in mean average precision over In-degree and PageRank, respectively.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution Web Link Analysis Using Generalized Link Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000295180500007"}
