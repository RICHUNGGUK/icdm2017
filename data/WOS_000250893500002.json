The wavelet transforms are constructed via lifting steps, where the prediction and update filters are derived from various types of interpolatory and quasi-interpolatory splines. The transforms use finite and infinite impulse response (IIR) filters and are implemented in a fast lifting mode. We analyze properties of the generated scaling functions and wavelets. In the case when the prediction filter is derived from a polynomial interpolatory spline of even order, the synthesis scaling function and wavelet are splines of the same order. We formulate conditions for the IIR filter to generate an exponentially decaying scaling function.", "paper_title": "Wavelet transforms generated by splines", "paper_id": "WOS:000250893500002"}
