To cope with these problems, a Hierarchical Multiple Models Adaptive Feedforward Decoupling Controller (HMMAFDC) is presented in this paper. The controller is composed of multiple fixed controller models and two adaptive controller models. Multiple models are used to improve the transient response of the wind tunnel. Hierarchical structure is presented to reduce the number of the fixed models greatly. To the optimal model selected by the switching index, the interactions of the system are viewed as measurable disturbance and eliminated using the feedforward strategy. It not only decouples the system dynamically but also places the poles of the closed loop system arbitrarily. The significance of the proposed method is that it is applicable to a MIMO system with a much small number of models. The global convergence is obtained. Finally, several simulation examples in a wind tunnel experiment are given to show both effectiveness and practicality.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical multiple models adaptive feedforward decoupling controller applied to wind tunnel system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400036"}
