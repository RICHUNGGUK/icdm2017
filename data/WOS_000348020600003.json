This allocation procedure is shown to be extremely effective when solving very large facility location problems in the Euclidian space. Our method basically aggregates demand points where it eliminates aggregation-based allocation error, and disaggregates them if necessary. The method is assessed first on the allocation problems and then embedded into the search for solving a class of discrete facility location problems namely the p-median and the vertex p-center problems. We use randomly generated and TSP datasets for testing our method. The results of the experiments show that the quadtree-based approach is very effective in reducing the computing time for this class of location problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
