The implementation adapts a CHRG parser we designed for Property Grammars [1], which views linguistic constraints as properties between sets of categories and solves them by constraint satisfaction, can handle incomplete or erroneous text, and extract phrases of interest selectively. We endow it with concept and relation extraction abilities as well.", "paper_title": "Semantic property grammars for knowledge extraction from biomedical text", "paper_id": "WOS:000240061200038"}
