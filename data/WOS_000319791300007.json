The L(2, 1)-labeling number lambda(G) of G is the smallest number k such that G has an L(2, 1)-labeling with max{f (v) : v is an element of V(G)} = k. This paper considers the L(2, 1)-labeling number of the modular product of two graphs and it is proved that Griggs and Yeh's conjecture is true for the modular product of two graphs with minor exceptions.
