In this paper we study a generalization of this problem, where we not only assume that the chains have bounded size, but also that a weight w (i) is given for each element i in the partial order such that w(i) <= w(j) if i < j. The problem is then to partition the partial order into a minimum-weight set of chains of bounded size, where the weight of a chain equals the weight of the heaviest element in the chain. We prove that this problem is APX-hard, and we propose and analyze lower bounds for this problem. Based on these lower bounds, we exhibit a 2-approximation algorithm, and show that it is tight. We report computational results for a number of real-world and randomly generated problem instances.", "paper_title": "Partitioning a weighted partial order", "paper_id": "WOS:000254106300003"}
