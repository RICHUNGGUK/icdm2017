So there is a growing need to provide the personalized recommendation services for the customers in ubiquitous space. This paper suggests a UREC_P2P(U-RECommendation by peer-to-peer), a recommendation procedure in ubiquitous environment adopting P2P technologies combined with collaborative filtering algorithm. UREC_P2P is implemented and comparatively evaluated with a CF-based recommender system in client-server environment. The evaluation result shows that UREC_P2P has a good potential to be a preeminent and realistic solution to the recommendation problems encountered in ubiquitous environment.", "paper_title": "A peer-to-peer CF-recommendation for ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100078"}
