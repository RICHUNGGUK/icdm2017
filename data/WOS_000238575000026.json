The paper shows the suitability of the fuzzy database management system for this kind of applications when the images are characterized by fuzzy data. The synergy of these two introduced components, improves traditional image retrieval systems in three aspects: natural and automatic image description, a natural and easy query language, and high performance in query resolution.", "paper_title": "Using a fuzzy object-relational database for colour image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000026"}
