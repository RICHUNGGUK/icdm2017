Specifically, we investigate the moderating effect of IT governance on the relationship between IT investments and government performance. Drawing upon the theory of political control on bureaucracy from the political sciences literature, we hypothesize that the presence of legislative controls on IT management increases returns to IT spending, which are measured by cost efficiency. Our empirical analysis in the context of U.S. state governments shows that formal establishment of a chief information officer (CIO) position by legislation is a key prerequisite to positive returns from IT expenditures in state governments. Also, the impact of IT spending on state cost efficiency increases when a state senate approves appointment of CIO nomination than when it does not. This study contributes to the IS literature by demonstrating the importance of elected representatives as part of IT governance in the public sector organizations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
