The photograph was taken with a 35 mm format digital SLR camera in a long-time exposure of 2.5 s illuminated with a couple of continuous point lighting. Also, a selected comparison is shown for snapshots of a bouncing millimetric droplet, having volume of 10 mu L, inclined angle of 15 degrees and contact angle of 147 degrees, during the first impact between the experimental results which were recorded with a high-speed camera at 1,222 frames/s and the 3D computation (using a Volume-of- Fluid method on 330 x 70 x 35 computational grids with dt = 1.0 x 10(-4) s) which was carried out with FLUENT software. At the impact the droplet is found to deform and then dissipate the energy due to the surface tension.", "paper_title": "A bouncing droplet on an inclined hydrophobic surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000274300000003"}
