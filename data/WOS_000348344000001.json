There is an infinite number of servers. Multiple customers can be placed for service into one server, subject to general \"packing\" constraints. Service times of different customers are independent, even if served simultaneously by the same server. Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately, either into a server already serving other customers (as long as packing constraints are not violated) or into an idle server. After a service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system. We propose an extremely simple and easily implementable customer placement algorithm, called Greedy-Random (GRAND). It places each arriving customer uniformly at random into either one of the already occupied servers (subject to packing constraints) or one of the so-called zero-servers, which are empty servers designated to be available to new arrivals. One instance of GRAND, called GRAND(), where is a parameter, is such that the number of zero-servers at any given time is , where is the current total number of customers in the system. We prove that GRAND() with is asymptotically optimal, as the customer arrival rates grow to infinity and , in the sense of minimizing the total number of occupied servers in steady state. In addition, we study by simulations various versions of GRAND and observe the dependence of convergence speed and steady-state performance on the number of zero-servers.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic optimality of a greedy randomized algorithm in a large-scale service system with general packing constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000348344000001"}
