Every bit of one detector is assigned a partial matching length. As for a detector, the partial matching length of one bit means that one string is asserted to be matched by the detector, if and only if the number of the maximal continuous identical bits between them from the position of the bit to the end of strings is no less than the partial matching length, and the continuous identical bits should start from the position of the bit. The detector generation algorithm and detection algorithm of r[]-NSA are given. Experimental results showed that r[]-NSA has better detector generation efficiency and detection performance than traditional negative selection algorithm.", "paper_title": "A novel negative selection algorithm with an array of partial matching lengths for each detector", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446400012"}
