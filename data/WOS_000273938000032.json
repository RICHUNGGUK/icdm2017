At first, a systematic procedure is established for evaluating the yield competitiveness of a semiconductor fabrication factory by considering the yield learning models of all its products. Subsequently, an efficient mechanism is proposed to re-allocate capacity/resources among products, so as to enhance the competitiveness of the whole factory. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed methodology, it was applied to the practical data of three products. Experimental results showed that after capacity re-allocation, all the three products became yield competitive. Besides, the capacity re-allocation plan established by the proposed methodology was both efficient and practical. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
