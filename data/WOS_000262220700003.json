The algorithm is able to reconstruct data from half-scan (180 degrees) and short-scan (180 degrees+fan angle) acquisitions for parallel- and fan-beam geometries, respectively, as well as data from full-scan (360 degrees) acquisitions. The algorithm is a derivative, backprojection, and Hilbert transform (DBH) method, which involves the backprojection of differentiated projection data followed by an inversion of the finite weighted Hilbert transform. The kernel of the inverse weighted Hilbert transform is solved numerically using matrix inversion. Numerical simulations confirm that the DBH method provides accurate reconstructions from half-scan and short-scan data, even when there is truncation. However, as the attenuation increases, finer data sampling is required.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction From Uniformly Attenuated SPECT Projection Data Using the DBH Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000262220700003"}
