As a middleware between the message producer and message consumer, message routing system enables backend systems to efficiently acquire the interested message. A widely adopted message routing mechanism is the content-based publish-subscribe framework. Based on this paradigm, we propose a rule-based system for supporting message routing in ubiquitous computing. The novel system features in the flexibility of the message computing, which is accomplished through a set of message operators. The message consumer could select the appropriate operator and specify the operating rule to get satisfying messages.", "paper_title": "A rule-based publish-subscribe message routing system for ubiquitous computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624100001"}
