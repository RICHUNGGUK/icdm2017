The receiver blocking problem, which has not been studied in most of the MAC protocol design, can lead to severe degradation on the throughput performance. In this paper, the multiple receiver transmission (MRT) and the fast NAV truncation (FNT) mechanisms are proposed to alleviate the receiver blocking problem without the adoption of additional control channels. The adaptive receiver transmission (ART) scheme is proposed to further enhance the throughput performance with dynamic adjustment of the selected receivers. Analytical model is also derived to validate the effectiveness of the proposed ART protocol. Simulations are performed to evaluate and compare the proposed three protocols with existing MAC schemes. It can be observed that the proposed ART protocol outperforms the other schemes by both alleviating the receiver blocking problem and enhancing the throughput performance for the wireless multihop ad hoc networks.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of Adaptive Receiver Transmission Protocols for Receiver Blocking Problem in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322329900016"}
