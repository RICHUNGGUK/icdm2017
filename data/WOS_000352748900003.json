The BCI system for UAV control consists of two main subsystems responsible for decision and semi-autonomous navigation. The decision subsystem is established based on the analysis of motor imagery (MI) EEG. The improved cross-correlation method (CC) is used to accomplish the MI feature extraction and the logistic regression method (LR) is employed to complete the MI feature classification and decision. The average classification accuracy rate of the BCI system reaches to 94.36%. The semi-autonomous navigation subsystem is utilized to avoid obstacles automatically for UAV and provide feasible directions for decision subsystem. The actual indoor target searching experiment is carried out to verify the performance of this BCI system. The experiment validates the feasibility and effectiveness of this BCI system for low speed UAV control by using MI and semi-autonomous navigation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
