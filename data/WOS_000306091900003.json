We explore dissimilarities between triplets of nearest neighbors, called dissimilarity increments (DIs). We derive a statistical model of DIs for d-dimensional data (d-DID) assuming that the objects follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Empirical evidence shows that the d-DID is well approximated by the particular case d=2. We propose the application of this model in clustering, with a partitional algorithm that uses a merge strategy on Gaussian components. Experimental results, in synthetic and real datasets, show that clustering algorithms using DID usually outperform well known clustering algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
