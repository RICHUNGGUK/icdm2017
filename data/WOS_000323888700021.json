We give a PRG with seed length log n/epsilon(O(d)) fooling degree d PTFs with error at most epsilon. Previously, no nontrivial constructions were known even for quadratic threshold functions and constant error epsilon. For the class of degree 1 threshold functions or halfspaces, previously only PRGs with seed length O(log n log(2)(1/epsilon)/epsilon(2)) were known. We improve this dependence on the error parameter and construct PRGs with seed length O(log n + log(2)(1/epsilon)) that epsilon-fool halfspaces. We also obtain PRGs with similar seed lengths for fooling halfspaces over the n-dimensional unit sphere. The main theme of our constructions and analysis is the use of invariance principles to construct PRGs. We also introduce the notion of monotone read-once branching programs, which is key to improving the dependence on the error rate epsilon for halfspaces. These techniques may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "PSEUDORANDOM GENERATORS FOR POLYNOMIAL THRESHOLD FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323888700021"}
