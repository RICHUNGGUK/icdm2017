In this paper we present a variation of the natural gradient ICA, differential ICA, where the learning relies on the concurrent change of output variables. We interpret the differential learning as the maximum likelihood estimation of parameters with latent variables represented by the random walk model. In such a framework, we derive the differential ICA algorithm and, in addition, we also present the differential decorrelation algorithm that is treated as a special instance of the differential ICA. Algorithm derivation and local stability analysis are given with some numerical experimental results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
