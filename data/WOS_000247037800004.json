It is of paradigmatic importance since it bears dynamical and spectral features that establish a link between single and many-particle dynamics, with the absolute minimum of ingredients. When additionally exposed to a time-periodic external perturbation, the effective dimension of the classical phase space as well as of Hilbert space increases dramatically. This gives rise to new phenomena, which stimulate research in such remote areas as mathematical physics, semiclassics and intense-field laser-matter interactions. In the present review, we illustrate how these different areas are interconnected by three interacting particles.", "paper_title": "The driven three body Coulomb problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000247037800004"}
