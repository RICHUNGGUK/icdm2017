For nT = 2n transmit antennas, the STBCSM(n, k) scheme can achieve the flexible transmission rates. Furthermore, two rotation angles are optimized to guarantee the transmit diversity of two for STBC-SM(n, k). Owing to the orthogonality of STBC, the new design enables a low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. Simulation results are presented to verify the performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A Space-Time Block Coded Spatial Modulation From (n, k) Error Correcting Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100014"}
