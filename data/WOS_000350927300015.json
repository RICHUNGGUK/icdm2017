Big data such as massive historical medical records makes it possible for users to have self-caring services, such as to get diagnosis by themselves with similar patients' records. Developing such a self-caring service gives rises to challenges including highly concurrent and scalable medical record retrieval, data analysis, as well as privacy protection. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based framework for implementing a self-caring service named Home-diagnosis to address the above challenges. Concretely, a Lucene-based distributed search cluster is designed to support highly concurrent and scalable medical record retrieval, data analysis and privacy protection. Moreover, to speed up medical record retrieval, a Hadoop cluster is adopted for offline data storage and index building. The implementation of the Home-diagnosis service is discussed, where similar historical medical records as well as a disease-symptom lattice are obtained, to help users figure out which kind of disease they are probably infected with. Finally, a prototype system is designed and a running example is presented to demonstrate the scalability and efficiency of our proposal. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
