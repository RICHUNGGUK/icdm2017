The algorithm is based on finding the longest common sub-structures between two RNA structures and special effort is devoted for aligning the beginning and the end parts of the existing stems (base pairs) in the secondary structures of two RNAs. The results of structure alignment of different types of RNA by this algorithm are obtained, and the result of this algorithm show more consistency with the models in the evolution rather than the other existing structure alignment algorithms.", "paper_title": "RNAComp: A new method for RNA secondary structure alignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000265624300020"}
