For example, in curve driving, drivers use lateral acceleration to adjust car velocity. The same result can be found in driving simulation. However, for comparable curves, drivers drove faster in fixed-base simulators than when actually driving a car. This difference in driving behavior decreases with the use of inertial motion feedback in simulators. The literature suggests that the beneficial effect of inertial cues in driving behavior increases with the difficulty of the maneuver. Therefore, for an extreme maneuver such as a fast slalom, a change in driving behavior is expected when a fixed-base condition is compared to a condition with inertial motion. It is hypothesized that driving behavior in a simulator changes when motion cues are present in extreme maneuvers. To test the hypothesis, a comparison between No-Motion and Motion car driving simulation was done, by measuring driving behavior in a fast slalom. A within-subjects design was used, with 20 subjects driving the fast slalom in both conditions. The average speed during the Motion condition was significantly lower than the average speed during the No-Motion condition. The same was found for the peak lateral acceleration generated by the car model. A power spectral density analysis performed on the steering wheel angle signal showed different control input behavior between the two experimental conditions. In addition, the results from a paired comparison showed that subjects preferred driving with motion feedback. From the lower driving speed and different control input on the steering wheel, we concluded that motion feedback led to a significant change in driving behavior.", "paper_title": "Driver Behavior Comparison Between Static and Dynamic Simulation for Advanced Driving Maneuvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000291149300003"}
