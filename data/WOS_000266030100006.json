This HB-FRP technique can increase the interfacial bond strength several folds. In this work, a finite element (FE) model for HB-FRP strengthened beams is developed to simulate the responses of the new structural system. The interfacial behaviors between the FRP and the concrete are simulated with a shear friction model. Comparisons between the predictions from this model and the test results demonstrate the accuracy of the FE model. The mechanism of the HB-FRP system and failure modes are then studied using the proposed model.", "paper_title": "Numerical Analyses of Hybrid-Bonded FRP Strengthened Concrete Beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000266030100006"}
