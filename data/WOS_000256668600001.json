This algorithm is applied on a set of benchmark multi-objective test problems and the results are compared with that of NSGA-II (a similar algorithm). The proposed algorithm is seen to over perform the existing algorithm. More specifically, the new approach has been used to solve the deceptive multi-objective optimization problems in a better way.", "paper_title": "Non-dominated rank based sorting genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000256668600001"}
