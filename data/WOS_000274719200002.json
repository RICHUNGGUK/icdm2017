Unlike other methods that require controlled conditions, we introduce a new radiance capture method that allows the user to capture parts of the scene under different lighting conditions. A novel calibration method is presented that finds the positions of reflective spheres and their mathematically accurate projection onto the scene geometry. The resulting radiance distribution is used to estimate a diffuse reflectance for each object, computed coherently using the appropriate light probe image. Finally, the scene is relit using a novel illumination pattern.", "paper_title": "Coherent radiance capture of scenes under changing illumination conditions for relighting applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000274719200002"}
