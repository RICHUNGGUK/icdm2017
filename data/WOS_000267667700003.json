We show that this method is faster than the constrained LS method. The ratio of computation time increases as data size increases. Moreover, we show that, under an appropriate smoothness condition, the uniform convergence rate achieved by the proposed method is nearly comparable to the best achievable rate for a non-parametric estimate which ignores the shape constraint. Simulation studies show that our method is comparable to the constrained LS method in estimation error. We illustrate our method by analysing ground water level data of wells in Korea.", "paper_title": "Estimating monotone convex functions via sequential shape modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000267667700003"}
