The algorithm combines the feasible weighted least squares (FWLS) in the multianalysis with the canonical correlation regression (CCR) and utilizes the FWLS to solve the heteroscedasticity caused by the error accumulation in the process of incremental localization; in the process of estimation, the CCR is used to solve the topology problems between the original beacon nodes and new beacon nodes. The simulation results show that the method can not only effectively restrain the influence caused by the accumulative errors but also can adapt to the different node topological shapes, so as to improve the positioning accuracy of the nodes.", "paper_title": "Incremental Localization Algorithm Based on Multivariate Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000323958300001"}
