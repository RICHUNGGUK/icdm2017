The results show that an increase in amount of speech in the reference signal (expressed by the activity parameter) may result in an increase of the PESQ sensitivity to packet loss change as well as PESQ's prediction accuracy improvement. On the other hand, it seems that human brain is a bit less sensitive to loss of some parts of words than PESQ. The reasons for those findings are particularly discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
