This article shows that network coding's complexity is not an issue for current mobile devices even without hardware acceleration. We provide real-life measurements of energy savings gains of two design styles of network coding, namely, inter-and intra-session network coding using commercial platforms, including Open-Mesh routers and various mobile phones. We demonstrate that the energy per bit invested in coding/decoding operations can be several orders of magnitude smaller than that used for transmission/reception, while also maintaining processing speeds as high as several hundreds of Mb/s or even several Gb/s depending on the device and coding configuration used.", "paper_title": "LEAN AND MEAN: NETWORK CODING FOR COMMERCIAL DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000327502000009"}
