One of the main design challenges in the WSNs is energy efficiency to prolong the network operable lifetime. Generally, most of the energy is spent for radio communication between sensor nodes. Another important requirement of WSN is that it should be self-organising, i.e. sensing ranges and transmission ranges are dynamically restructured with changing topology. Moreover, sensor nodes with variable sensing and transmission ranges facilitate less energy consumption and enhance the capacity of WSN significantly. An effective approach for energy conservation is turning off extraneous nodes, while the remaining nodes stay active to provide continuous monitoring service. An efficient planning of WSN using this approach can control the energy consumption of the whole network. In this paper, by using computational geometry theoretic, we propose a general algorithmic framework for dynamic topology construction of WSN for a given environmental monitoring application.", "paper_title": "Dynamic topology construction of wireless sensor network using computational geometric approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000313883400003"}
