The ILC protocols are designed with distributed initial-state learning and it is not necessary to fix the initial value at the beginning of each iteration. A fuzzy logical system is used to approximate the nonlinearity of each follower agent. A fuzzy learning component is an important learning tool in the protocol, and combined time-domain and iteration-domain adaptive laws are used to tune the controller parameters. The protocol guarantees that the follower agents track the leader for the consensus problem and keep at a desired distance from the leader for the formation problem on [0, T]. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
