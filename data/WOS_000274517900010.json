Design/methodology/approach - The aim is to analyze the current sensor fault effects on the stator flux-oriented control according to the current input-output decoupling. This justifies the necessity of a reconfiguration control in order to satisfy the system service continuity. Also, a theoretical development of sensitivity coefficients gives an idea about control robustness toward a current sensor fault. Findings - This paper emphasizes the system performance close dependency to the current sensor outputs accuracy. Moreover, simulation results point out the operation system deterioration in case of current sensor fault, which leads in most cases to its shut down in contrast with the industrial expectations. In this paper, the suggested solution is the DFIM speed drive control reconfiguration when a current sensor fault occurs in order to ensure system service continuity. MATLAB-Simulink simulation results illustrate the system behavior before and after a current sensor fault. System performance preservation is performed after control reconfiguration. Originality/value - This solution presented in this paper is relevant, especially because of its simplicity.", "paper_title": "DFIM vector control sensitivity with current sensor faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000274517900010"}
