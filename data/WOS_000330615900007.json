The approach is based on interactive computations over complex objects called here complex granules (c-granules, for short). Any c-granule consists of a physical part and a mental part linked in a special way. We begin from the rough set approach and next we move toward interactive computations on c-granules. From our considerations it follows that the fundamental issues of intelligent systems based on interactive computations are related to risk management in such systems. Our approach is a step toward realization of the Wisdom Technology (WisTech) program. The approach was developed over years of work on different real-life projects.", "paper_title": "Perspectives on Uncertainty and Risk in Rough Sets and Interactive Rough-Granular Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000330615900007"}
