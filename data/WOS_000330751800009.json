Its speed measurement is triggered by encoder pulse signals, which simplifies the complexity of processing incapability of synchronization in the classical method, and it makes actual sampling point always occur before the periodic sampling point in relay-style, which achieves the continuous dynamic iterative measurement with high accuracy in a wide speed range. Through counting the overflow pulses of time counter by software, the minimally measurable speed can be effectively extended to an extremely low level without adding any hardware. In addition, by utilizing the information in speed measurement and subdividing dynamic position by time according to its corresponding relationship with time, Dynamic Position Subdivision Method is achieved to improve the feedback resolution of dynamic position. Finally, the experimental results show that Relay-style Digital Speed Measurement Method can obtain high accuracy than classical method in a wide speed range even though at a very low speed Dynamic Position Subdivision Method is helpful to reduce the fluctuations of the position control.
