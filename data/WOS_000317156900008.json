Lim et al. proposed a secure and efficient three-pass authenticated key agreement protocol based on elliptic curves to overcome the vulnerability of Yoon-Yoo protocol under extended Canetti-Krawczyk security model. In this letter, we show that Lim et al.'s protocol is vulnerable to leakage of responder's static private key by malicious party and cannot withstand known key security resilience attacks.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of a Secure and Efficient Three-Pass Authenticated Key Agreement Protocol Based on Elliptic Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000317156900008"}
