Existing protocols suffer from various limitations such as considerable protocol overhead, dependence on a centralized controller, and use of fixed-size channels. We introduce Ez-Channel, a novel MAC protocol that parsimoniously utilizes the OFDM sub-carriers to perform channelization and assignment of sub-channels to competing links. In addition to circumventing hidden and exposed terminal problems, Ez-Channel adapts channel assignments to the network topology. To eliminate the need for a centralized controller and to avoid an overwhelming amount of information exchange, the protocol uses a randomization technique enabling provably efficient localized decision making. Our extensive analytical and simulation studies show that Ez-Channel yields significant throughput improvements as compared to the state-of-theart protocols. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
