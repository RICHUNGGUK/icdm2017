Fused gradient field is derived from the structure tensor of inputs based on multidimensional Riemannian geometry with a Euclidean metric assumed. Afterwards, a new method is proposed for modifying the gradient field iteratively with twice average filtering and nonlinearly compressing in multi-scales. These modification operations are all done at the finest resolution. The result is obtained through solving a Poisson equation then linearly stretching to the common range. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of this method. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
