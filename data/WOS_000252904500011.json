However, the risk of wire breakage affects adversely the full potential of WEDM since the overall process efficiency is considerably reduced. The present paper discusses the results of the analyses of an exhaustive experimental database that reproduces unexpected disturbances that may appear during normal operation. The results of the analyses reveal new symptoms that allow one to predict wire breakage. These symptoms are especially related to the occurrence of an increase in discharge energy, peak current, as well as increases and/or decreases in ignition delay time. The differences observed in the symptoms related to workpiece thickness are also studied. Another contribution of this paper is the analyses of the distribution of the anticipation time for different validation tests. Based on the results of the analyses, this paper contributes to improve the process performance through a novel wire breakage monitoring and diagnosing system. It consists of two well differentiated parts: the virtual instrumentation system (VIS) that measures relevant magnitudes, and the diagnostic system (DS) that detects low quality cutting regimes and predicts wire breakage. It has been successfully validated through a considerable number of experimental tests performed on an industrial WEDM machine for different workpiece thickness. The efficiency of the supervision system has been quantified through an efficiency rate defined in this paper. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
