We apply a fully discrete wavelet Galerkin scheme for the computation of the apparent surface charge on van der Waals or solvent accessible surfaces. The molecular surface is described in parametric form as a set of four-sided spherical patches. Each patch is exactly represented as rational B,zier surface. Numerical results are reported to illustrate the approach.", "paper_title": "Wavelet BEM on molecular surfaces: parametrization and implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000269926700001"}
