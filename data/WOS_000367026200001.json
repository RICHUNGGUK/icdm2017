Business intelligence and analytics (BI&A) equips analytics experts with the technological capabilities to support decision processes with reliable information and analytic insights, thus potentially raising the quality of managerial decision making. However, the very nature of organizational derision processes imposes conflicting task requirements regarding adaptability and rigor. This research proposes ambidexterity as a theoretical lens to investigate data-centric decision support Based on an in-depth multiple case study of BI&A-supported decision processes, we identify and discuss tensions that arise from the conflicting task requirements and that pose a challenge for effective BI&A support. We also provide insights into tactics for managing these tensions and thus achieving ambidexterity. Additionally, we shed light on the relationship between ambidexterity and decision quality. Integrating the empirical findings from this research, we propose a theory of ambidexterity in decision support which explains how such ambidexterity can be facilitated and how it affects decision outcomes. Finally, we discuss the study's implications for theory and practice. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.
