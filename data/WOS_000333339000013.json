Our algorithms are designed to solve challenging puzzles, without having to impose any restrictive assumptions on the shape of the puzzle, the shapes of the individual pieces, or their intrinsic arrangement. As a demonstration, the method was successfully used to solve two commercially available puzzles. Finally we perform some preliminary investigations into scalability of the algorithm for even larger puzzles.", "paper_title": "Automatic Solution of Jigsaw Puzzles", "paper_id": "WOS:000333339000013"}
