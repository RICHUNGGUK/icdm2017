However, when processing images originating from different views, it is common that the colors between the different cameras are not well-calibrated. To solve this problem, a novel energy function-based color correction method for multiview camera setups is proposed to enforce that colors are as close as possible to those in the reference image but also that the overall structural information is well-preserved. The proposed system introduces a spatio-temporal correspondence matching method to ensure that each pixel in the input image gets bijectively mapped to a reference pixel. By combining this mapping with the original structural information, we construct a global optimization algorithm in a Laplacian matrix formulation and solve it using a sparse matrix solver. We further introduce a novel forward-reverse objective evaluation model to overcome the problem of lack of ground truth in this field. The visual comparisons are shown to outperform state-of-the-art multiview color correction methods, while the objective evaluation reports PSNR gains of up to 1.34 dB and SSIM gains of up to 3.2%, respectively.", "paper_title": "Spatio-Temporally Consistent Color and Structure Optimization for Multiview Video Color Correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000353148300001"}
