We first propose a joint solution of admission control and channel scheduling for video streams. The proposed approach guarantees that the required data rate is achieved for video streams, which is crucial for multimedia streaming applications. An efficient and light-weight multicast routing technique is also proposed to minimize the bandwidth cost of joining a multicast tree. Furthermore, we adopt the Patching technique in the application layer to improve the capacity of the video server. Overall, the quality of the video-on-demand service is dramatically improved with the help of the efficient cooperation between the techniques proposed in different layers of the network. Simulation study shows that with the proposed approach, true video-on-demand in WiMax mesh networks can be achieved under high video request arrival rate. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
