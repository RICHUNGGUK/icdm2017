In addition to the typical costs associated with vendor selection and delivery between the vendors and their assigned stores, we explicitly consider the inventory-related costs and decisions of the stores. We emphasize the relationship between facility location applications and the problem at hand, and we propose an integrated vendor selection and inventory optimization model. Also, arguing that our model creates a venue for precise incorporation of realistic capacity constraints, we model throughput and dispatch capacities, explicitly. The model is a challenging mixed integer nonlinear program for which we propose an efficient solution approach that relies on Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD). (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
