Recent developments in affective computing have provided more opportunities in the way online IL education can be delivered. However, research on how affective computing can be used in IL education is lacking. The research objectives of this study are therefore twofold: to investigate the influence of affective embodied agents (EAs) on students' motivation, enjoyment, knowledge retention and intention to use; and to uncover factors influencing their intention to use an online IL tutorial with affective EAs. To achieve these objectives, 285 university students were recruited to participate in a betweensubjects experiment (text-only, non-affective EAs, and affective EAs), including completing an IL tutorial and a post-test questionnaire. The results suggested that students benefited from the added use of an affective EA in the IL tutorials, in terms of learning motivation and enjoyment. Moreover, relevance, confidence, satisfaction, affective enjoyment, and behavioral enjoyment were found to be significant predictors for intention to use an IL tutorial with affective EM.
