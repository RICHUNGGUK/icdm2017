A lot of properties of planar polynomial differential systems are related to irreducible Darboux polynomials of the corresponding derivation: D = A(X, Y)partial derivative(x) B(X, Y)partial derivative(y). Darboux polynomials are usually computed with the method of undetermined coefficients. With this method we have to solve a polynomial system. We show that this approach can give rise to the computation of an exponential number of reducible Darboux polynomials. Here we show that the Lagutinskii-Pereira algorithm computes irreducible Darboux polynomials with degree smaller than N, with a polynomial number, relatively to d, log(H) and N, binary operations. We also give a polynomial-time method to compute, if it exists, a rational first integral with bounded degree. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
