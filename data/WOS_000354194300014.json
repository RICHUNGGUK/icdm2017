Therefore, we propose a new self-adaptive decision-making (SADM) strategy. SADM compensates for the restrictions of robot physical movement control by updating the task assignment and role assignment module using situation assessment techniques. It designs a self-adaptive role assignment model that assists the soccer robot in adapting to competition situations similar to how humans adapt in real time. Moreover, it also builds an accurate motion model for the robot in order to improve the competition ability of individual robot soccer. Experimental results show that SADM can adapt quickly and positively to new competition situations and has excellent performance in actual competition.", "paper_title": "Research on self-adaptive decision-making mechanism for competition strategies in robot soccer", "paper_id": "WOS:000354194300014"}
