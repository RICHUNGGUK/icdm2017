This paper presents a new highly automated approach for protecting Web applications against SQL injection that has both conceptual and practical advantages over most existing techniques. From a conceptual standpoint, the approach is based on the novel idea of positive tainting and on the concept of syntax-aware evaluation. From a practical standpoint, our technique is precise and efficient, has minimal deployment requirements, and incurs a negligible performance overhead in most cases. We have implemented our techniques in the Web Application SQL-injection Preventer (WASP) tool, which we used to perform an empirical evaluation on a wide range of Web, applications that we subjected to a large and varied set of attacks and legitimate accesses. WASP was able to stop all of the otherwise successful attacks and did not generate any false positives.", "paper_title": "WASP: Protecting web applications using positive tainting and syntax-aware evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253375500006"}
