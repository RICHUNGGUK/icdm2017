A new Lyapunov function and free-weighting matrix method are used for filtering design, consequently, a delay-dependent design method is first proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which produces a less conservative result. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and the benefits of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy robust H-infinity filter design for nonlinear discrete-time systems with interval time delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000306113900015"}
