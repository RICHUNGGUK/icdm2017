The problem is that it is difficult to identify relations within data containing missing values. Accordingly, we develop a kernel-based missing data imputation in this paper. This approach aims at making an optimal inference oil statistical parameters: mean, distribution function and quantile after missing data are imputed. And we refer this approach to parameter optimization method (POP algorithm). We experimentally evaluate our approach, and demonstrate that our POP algorithm (random regression imputation) is much better than deterministic regression imputation in efficiency and generating an inference on the above parameters.
