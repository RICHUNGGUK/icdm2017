This algorithm enables a scalable incremental learning of patterns from data with both numeric and nominal variables. Two different methods of combining numeric and nominal variables in calculating the distance between clusters are investigated. In one method, separate distance measures are calculated for numeric and nominal variables, respectively, and are then combined into an overall distance measure. In another method, nominal variables are converted into numeric variables, and then a distance measure is calculated using all variables. We analyze the computational complexity, and thus, the scalability, of the algorithm, and test its performance on a number of data sets from various application domains. The prediction accuracy and reliability of the algorithm are analyzed, tested, and compared with those of several other data mining algorithms.", "paper_title": "A supervised clustering and classification algorithm for mining data with mixed variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000235557900012"}
