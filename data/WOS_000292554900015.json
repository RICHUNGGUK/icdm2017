Many metabolomic experiments are designed to compare changes observed over time under two experimental conditions or groups (e. g. a control and drug-treated group) with the goal of identifying discriminatory metabolites or biomarkers that characterize each condition. A common study design consists of repeated measurements taken on each experimental unit thus producing time courses of all metabolites. We describe a statistical framework for estimating time-varying metabolic profiles and their within-group variability and for detecting between-group differences. Specifically, we propose (i) a smoothing splines mixed effects (SME) model that treats each longitudinal measurement as a smooth function of time and (ii) an associated functional test statistic. Statistical significance is assessed by a non-parametric bootstrap procedure. Results: The methodology has been extensively evaluated using simulated data and has been applied to real nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy data collected in a preclinical toxicology study as part of a larger project lead by the COMET (Consortium for Metabonomic Toxicology). Our findings are compatible with the previously published studies.", "paper_title": "A statistical framework for biomarker discovery in metabolomic time course data", "paper_id": "WOS:000292554900015"}
