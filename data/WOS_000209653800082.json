Efficiency increases for a single-stage reluctance accelerator were produced by manipulating the input current pulse supplied by a discharging capacitor. The development of a theoretical model allowed for the calculation of optimized pulse shapes. A digital pulsewidth modulated switching method was used to control the current pulse shape using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, which supplied signals to the gate of a MOSFET transistor that controlled the current to the system solenoid. An efficiency increase of 5.7% was obtained for a reluctance accelerator with an optimized current pulse shape in comparison to a capacitor discharge with no pulse shaping.", "paper_title": "Reluctance Accelerator Efficiency Optimization via Pulse Shaping", "paper_id": "WOS:000209653800082"}
