Firstly, we assumed that human experiences and techniques contained important design components so that we conducted edutainment course to acquire locomotors, which were heuristically designed. Then, we analyzed two remarkable locomotors in both virtual and real worlds. As a result, we have known that symmetrical design played an important role on dynamically stable locomotion because its design enabled to exploit its own dynamics as passive dynamics and also widened its controllability. Addition to it, the locomotors in both virtual and real worlds demonstrated similar characteristics.", "paper_title": "Investigation of reality constraints: Morphology and controller of two-link legged locomotors for dynamically stable locomotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300009"}
