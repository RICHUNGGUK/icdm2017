This information can be used to support the election of the proper classification algorithm. This paper addresses the analysis of the relationship between data complexity measures and classifiers behavior. Each one of the metrics is evaluated covering its range of values and studying the classifiers accuracy on these values. The results offer information about the usefullness of these measures, and which of them allow us to analyze the nature of the input data set and help us to decide which classification method could be the most promising one.
