We retain the use of CSMA/CA as access protocol because of its simplicity, versatility and good scalability properties. We developed CoSenS, a Collect then Send burst Scheme, on top of it to address its weaknesses while facilitating the implementation of scheduling policies. In this article, we propose a simple and scalable service differentiation solution; we implement fixed priority and earliest deadline first on top of CoSenS. The simulation analysis shows that our solution self-adapts to the traffic variation and greatly enhances end-to-end delay, reliability and deadline meet ratio for urgent traffic while not degrading best effort traffic compared to IEEE 802.15.4 original protocol and IEEE 802.15.4 implementing these scheduling policies. Additionally, CoSenS is implemented and tested on motes. The real experimentation results validated our simulation analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
