In fact, there are many lessons that can be learned from failures in the management of enterprise systems, which range from a small one (e. g., failure to install a printer driver) to a large one (e. g., nuclear power plant post-accident management). This paper, therefore, proposes that the enterprise system should be viewed as a socio-tech system. The paper presents a novel integrated approach to information modeling of socio-tech enterprise systems. In particular, the approach integrates object-orientation, systems-dynamics (as a means to represent high-level dynamics), and aspect-programming. The paper discusses an example to illustrate how the proposed approach works.", "paper_title": "Integration of System-Dynamics, Aspect-Programming, and Object-Orientation in System Information Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800001"}
