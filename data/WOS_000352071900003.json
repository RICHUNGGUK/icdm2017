The microcapsule self-healing method is a newly developed healing method for repairing cracked concrete. To investigate the optimal microcapsule parameters that will have the best healing effect in concrete, a 3D analytical probability healing model is proposed; it is based on the microcapsule self-healing method's healing mechanism, and its purpose is to predict the healing efficiency and healing probability of given cracks. The proposed model comprehensively considers the radius and the volume fraction of microcapsules, the expected healing efficiency, the parameters of cracks, the broken ratio and the healing probability. Furthermore, a simplified probability healing model is proposed to facilitate the calculation. Then, a Monte Carlo test is conducted to verify the proposed 3D analytical probability healing model. Finally, the influences of microcapsules' parameters on the healing efficiency and the healing probability of the microcapsule self-healing method are examined in light of the proposed probability model.", "paper_title": "A 3D analytical model for the probabilistic characteristics of self-healing model for concrete using spherical microcapsule", "paper_id": "WOS:000352071900003"}
