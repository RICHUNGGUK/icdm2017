During reprogramming, the number of radio transmissions should be minimized, since reprogramming time and energy depend chiefly on the number of radio transmissions. In this article, we present a multihop incremental reprogramming protocol called Zephyr that transfers the delta between old and new software versions, and lets the sensor nodes rebuild the new software using the received delta and the old software. Zephyr reduces the delta size by using application-level modifications to mitigate the effects of function shifts. Then it compares the two binary images at the byte level to generate a small delta, that is then sent over the wireless network to all the nodes. For the wide range of software change cases that we used as benchmarks, Zephyr transfers 1.83 to 1987 times less traffic through the network than Deluge (the standard nonincremental reprogramming protocol for TinyOS) and 1.14 to 49 times less traffic than an existing incremental reprogramming protocol by Jeong and Culler [2004].", "paper_title": "Efficient Incremental Code Update for Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287918100003"}
