Measurements from 2.4 to 2.6 GHz show constant PAE performance starting in 20 % level up to 24 % with a maximum output power of 23.4 dBm. The circuit is fully described with all components values and layout details for further reproduction. Performance graphs showing the active load-pull effect, sub-amplifiers behavior and constant PAE prove that it is a real DPA with all effects as known by the theory. The circuit is composed by only lumped components, each sub-amplifier has cascode topology and their input/output networks are optimized to save die area and to produce a constant PAE.", "paper_title": "Fully integrated Doherty power amplifier in CMOS 65 nm with constant PAE in Backoff", "paper_id": "WOS:000347527800010"}
