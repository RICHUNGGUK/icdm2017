The scenario provides robust and flexible QoS support by adapting the amount of resources reserved for the characteristics of the wireless channel, as well as automatic reconfiguration mechanisms of the multimedia encoding rate and error-resilient techniques to adapt to the dynamic mobile communication environment. Two new scenarios, adaptive FEC and MAC-Lite, are introduced to the proposed scheme. These enable a maximizing of the overall performance of the wireless network. The appropriate interfaces within the core network are described for performing end-to-end QoS, which deliver network meters and exchange QoS parameters with the proposed intra and inter cross-layer approaches, including context transfer during handover. Each part, extended by the proposed method can be configured by the application and be independently implemented. To evaluate the proposed scheme, the QoS components were integrated into a trial platform that was built and simulations were then performed. The results demonstrate that the communication quality was significantly improved.", "paper_title": "A customizable QoS strategy for convergent heterogeneous wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000246122900004"}
