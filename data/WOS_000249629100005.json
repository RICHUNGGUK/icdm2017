As high-compression video coding standards, H.264/AVC jointly developed by MPEG and ITU and AVS developed by the Audio Video Coding Standard Working Group of China will co-exist in the future market. Therefore, it is worthy to transcode the AVS format to the H.264/AVC format or vice versa. After an insight into the inter transcoding from AVS to H.264/AVC, a simple and effective method is proposed by reusing the mode and motion vectors to achieve high-efficient and fast transcoding. The problem in reusing the skip mode is studied and an effective method to eliminate the artifacts is proposed. Furthermore, a fast intra transcoding algorithm based on the distribution of the DCT coefficients is proposed to speed up the transcoding process. Detailed experiment results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the transcoding complexity.", "paper_title": "Effective algorithms for fast transcoding of AVS to H.264/AVC in the spatial domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000249629100005"}
