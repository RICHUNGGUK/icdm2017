The task is to find routes, geometric curves, such that the maximal traffic load in the network is minimized. In finite fixed networks, multi-path routes generally yield a lower congestion and thus allow higher throughput. In contrast, we show that in dense wireless multi-hop networks, the optimal load balancing can be achieved by a destination based single-path routing referred to as field-line routing. This is because any routing can be transformed to the corresponding field-line routing with the same or better performance, by using as paths, the field lines of the so-called destination flow associated with the original routing. The concepts are illustrated with two examples. In the case of a unit disk with unit traffic, the maximal load of 0.389 of a multi-path routing system is reduced to 0.343 by using the field-line routing. Similar improvements are also demonstrated for the unit square. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
