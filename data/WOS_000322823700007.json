COAL connects solver implementations with specific models via an extensible set of properties, without enforcing a specific standard form. This allows to exploit the problem structure and to handle large-scale problems while supporting rapid prototyping and modifications of the model. Based on predefined building blocks, a broad range of functionals encountered in image analysis can be implemented and be reliably optimized using state-of-the-art algorithms, without the need to know algorithmic details. We demonstrate the use of COAL on four representative variational problems of image analysis.", "paper_title": "COAL: a generic modelling and prototyping framework for convex optimization problems of variational image analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000322823700007"}
