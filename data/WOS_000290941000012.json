An efficient search strategy based on the motion-disparity constraint is developed, in which both the motion and disparity vectors can be obtained simultaneously with low complexity. Moreover, a credible initial predictive vector set is designed with the aid of the temporal and spatial neighboring blocks so that the coding efficiency can be further enhanced. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce more than 96% coding time compared with the JMVM full search with a negligible quality drop.", "paper_title": "A fast stereoscopic video coding algorithm based on JMVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000290941000012"}
