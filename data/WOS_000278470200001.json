The proposed pre-processing method, termed as perfect histogram matching, modifies the image histogram to match a Gaussian shaped tonal distribution in the face images such that spatially the entire set of face images presents similar facial gray-level intensities while the face content in the frequency domain remains mostly unaltered. Computationally inexpensive, the perfect histogram matching algorithm proves to yield superior results when applied as a pre-processing module prior to the conventional PCA algorithm for face recognition. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate effectiveness of the technique.", "paper_title": "Perfect histogram matching PCA for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000278470200001"}
