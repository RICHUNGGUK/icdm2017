For this purpose CMOS and or bipolar current amplifiers are used as active building blocks. The derived circuits simulate LC passive prototype filters. Second order resonators can also be obtained by following the same techniques. The presented circuits are modular in structure, thus, their electronic and layout design is very easy. Low-voltage, low-power design is also feasible. Simulation examples for all-pole filters and filters with transmission zeros are given.", "paper_title": "Analog circuit synthesis using linear and nonlinear current amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000235671900005"}
