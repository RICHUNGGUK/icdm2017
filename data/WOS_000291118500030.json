After several decades of research in scheduling problems, a variety of heuristics have been developed. The proposed algorithm is a hybrid of three frequently applied ones: the dispatching rule, the shifting bottleneck procedure, and the evolutionary algorithm. It is a two-stage algorithm, which integrates a rule-based memetic algorithm in the first stage and a re-optimization procedure of shifting bottleneck in the second. We conduct experiments using benchmark instances found in the literature to assess the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method is effective and efficient for multiobjective scheduling problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
