The proposed framework aims at finding the optimal operation point that minimizes the radio energy consumption for a desired target accuracy, or equivalently, the one that maximizes the localization accuracy for a given energy budget. To this end, the proposed approach considers the joint optimization of the localization frequency and number of RSS measurements used at each localization round and leverages practical models to predict the energy consumption and the localization accuracy for combined RSS-inertial localization systems. Simulations and real-field experiments are used to demonstrate that, for a given target accuracy, the proposed strategy entails a lower energy consumption than state-of-the-art methods available in the literature.
