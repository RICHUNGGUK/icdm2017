The proposal argues for the use of a more complete primitive, namely a weighted sum, which converts the calculation of the function values into a recursive operation defined by a two input table. The weighted sum can be tuned for different values of the weighting parameters that hold the features of the concrete evaluated function. The calculation of the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is improved by this method which provides a decrease of the operation count as well as an acceptable error bound. These results have repercussions on the compression standard JPEG, for the purposes of storage and transmission in web-based applications (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
