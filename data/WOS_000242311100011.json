We analyze the security of SAM architecture as originally proposed, pointing out some weaknesses in security and performance. To overcome them, we supply another hashing and protection schemes which strengthen the security and improve the performance of the first proposal. Finally, we present some experimental results comparing the old and new schemes.", "paper_title": "A new encryption and hashing scheme for the security architecture for microprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000242311100011"}
