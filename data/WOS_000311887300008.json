Different modelling approaches of varying complexity are available in the open literature. However, only few publications exist in which the question of the optimal modelling depth is discussed for homogeneously catalysed processes. Unlike these publications, we used experimental data in the present study to compare them with simulation results using different modelling depths for homogeneous reactive distillation processes. The nonequilibrium-stage model using the Maxwell-Stefan equations, the nonequilibrium-stage model using effective diffusion coefficients, the equilibrium-stage model including reaction kinetics, and the equilibrium-stage model assuming chemical equilibrium were investigated. The homogeneously catalysed transesterification of dimethyl carbonate with ethanol, for which pilot-scale experimental data were available, was used as a test system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
