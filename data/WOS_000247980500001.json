Our algorithms are simple and their approximation ratios improve over those previously known, in some cases by orders of magnitude. We develop a general analysis framework to bound the approximation ratios of our algorithms. This framework is based on a novel connection between random sampling and game-theoretic cost sharing.", "paper_title": "Approximation via cost sharing: Simpler and better approximation algorithms for network design", "paper_id": "WOS:000247980500001"}
