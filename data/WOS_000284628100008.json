In this paper, we show that, in spite of this similarity, these logics are not identical. Specifically, we emphasize that, while quantum logic has a special 'square root of not' operation, which is very useful in quantum computing, fuzzy logic lacks such an operation.", "paper_title": "Square root of 'not': a major difference between fuzzy and quantum logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000284628100008"}
