The Split and Aggregated TCP (SA-TCP) proposes upgrading intermediate devices (known as regional collectors or RCs) to combine meters' TCP connections and forward data over a unified TCP connection to the utility server. This paper provides a comprehensive performance analysis of the SA-TCP scheme. It studies the impact of varying various parameters on the scheme, including the impact of network link capacity, buffering capacity of RCs, propagation delay between the meters and the utility server, and finally the number of RCs utilized as SA-TCP aggregators. The performance results show that by adjusting those parameters, it is possible to tune throughput of a smart metering network to the desired amount while keeping the deployment cost minimal.
