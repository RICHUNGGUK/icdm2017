It is therefore hazardous for drivers to operate such devices while driving. In this paper a user interface interaction style for in-car user interfaces are proposed. Users interact with the in-car computer using three chording keys and chording pattern sequences are derived based on visual mnemonics. Cases are illustrated for an in-car multimedia system, a mobile phone and a GPS-navigation system. Experimental results demonstrate that the technique is easy to learn, efficient to use and require low visual attention.", "paper_title": "Near Eyes-Free Chauffeur Computer Interaction with Chording and Visual Text Mnemonics", "paper_id": "WOS:000282703300004"}
