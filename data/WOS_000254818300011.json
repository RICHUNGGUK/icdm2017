CoDiGA is characterized by good stability and quick convergence. In CoDiGA, an enhanced initial population policy and an evolution policy are proposed based on population diversity and a relation matrix coding scheme. The integration of the two policies overcomes shortcomings resulting from randomicity of genetic algorithm, such as slow convergence, great variance among the running results, soaring overhead along with increasing size of composition. The simulation results on web service selection with global QoS constraints have shown that prematurity was overcomed effectively, and convergence and stability of genetic algorithm were improved greatly.
