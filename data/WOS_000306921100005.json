However, there is not yet a proper visualization tool that is able to map the many-to-one relationship between QoS metrics and QoE, leaving researchers speechless in the cacophony of traditional two-dimensional diagrams. Although mostly employed in qualitative analysis, we found the radar chart, with a few tweaks, surprisingly suitable for the purpose. In this article, we present our adaptation of the radar chart, and demonstrate in a voice-over-IP context its use in single- and cross-application performance analysis, application recommendation, and network diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Radar Chart: Scanning for Satisfactory QoE in QoS Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000306921100005"}
