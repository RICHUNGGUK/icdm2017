The increased number of genomes being sequenced offers new opportunities for the mapping of closely related organisms. We propose here an algorithmic formalization of a genome comparison approach to marker ordering. Results: In order to integrate a comparative mapping approach in the algorithmic process of map construction and selection, we propose to extend the usual statistical model describing the experimental data, here radiation hybrids (RH) data, in a statistical framework that models additionally the evolutionary relationships between a proposed map and a reference map: an existing map of the corresponding orthologous genes or markers in a closely related organism. This has concretely the effect of exploiting, in the process of map selection, the information of marker adjacencies in the related genome when the information provided by the experimental data is not conclusive for the purpose of ordering. In order to compute efficiently the map, we proceed to a reduction of the maximum likelihood estimation to the Traveling Salesman Problem. Experiments on simulated RH datasets as well as on a real RH dataset from the canine RH project show that maps produced using the likelihood defined by the new model are significantly better than maps built using the traditional RH model.
