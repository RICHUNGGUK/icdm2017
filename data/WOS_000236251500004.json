Many approaches have been proposed. The rationale is that the genes with the same biological function or involved in the same biological process are more likely to co-express, hence they are more likely to form a cluster with similar gene expression patterns. However, most existing methods, including model-based clustering, ignore known gene functions in clustering. Results: To take advantage of accumulating gene functional annotations, we propose incorporating known gene functions as prior probabilities in model-based clustering. In contrast to a global mixture model applicable to all the genes in the standard model-based clustering, we use a stratified mixture model: one stratum corresponds to the genes of unknown function while each of the other ones corresponding to the genes sharing the same biological function or pathway; the genes from the same stratum are assumed to have the same prior probability of coming from a cluster while those from different strata are allowed to have different prior probabilities of coming from the same cluster. We derive a simple EM algorithm that can be used to fit the stratified model. A simulation study and an application to gene function prediction demonstrate the advantage of our proposal over the standard method.", "paper_title": "Incorporating gene functions as priors in model-based clustering of microarray gene expression data", "paper_id": "WOS:000236251500004"}
