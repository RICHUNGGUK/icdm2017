In this context, a new archive maintenance strategy is proposed, which maintains a set of nondominated solutions in the archive unless the archive size falls below a minimum allowable size. It makes the archive size adaptive and dynamic. We have proposed a new environmental selection strategy and a new mating selection strategy. The environmental selection strategy reduces the exploration in less probable objective spaces. The mating selection increases searching in more probable search regions by enhancing the exploitation of existing solutions. A new crossover strategy DE-3 is proposed here. ASMiGA is compared with five well-known multiobjective optimization algorithms of different types-generational evolutionary algorithms (SPEA2 and NSGA-II), archive-based hybrid scatter search, decomposition-based evolutionary approach, and archive-based micro genetic algorithm. For comparison purposes, four performance measures (HV, GD, IGD, and GS) are used on 33 test problems, of which seven problems are constrained. The proposed algorithm outperforms the other five algorithms.", "paper_title": "ASMiGA: An Archive-Based Steady-State Micro Genetic Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000346734300004"}
