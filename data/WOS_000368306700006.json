Recent studies of wildfire evacuation triggers have used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and fire-spread modeling to calculate evacuation trigger buffers around a location or community that provide a specified amount of warning time. Wildfire evacuation trigger modeling has been applied in many scenarios including dynamic forecast weather conditions, community-level evacuation planning, pedestrian evacuation, and protecting firefighters. However, little research has been conducted on household-level trigger modeling. This work explores the potential uses of wildfire evacuation trigger modeling in issuing household-level staged evacuation warnings. The method consists of three steps: 1) calculating trigger buffers for each household; 2) modeling fire-spread to trigger the evacuation of all households; and 3) ranking households by their available (or lead) time, which enables emergency managers to develop a staged evacuation warning plan for these homes. A case study of Julian, California is used to test the method's potential and assess its advantages and disadvantages. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
