There have recently been some related works to solve this problem; however, a more practical problem has not been addressed. Usually, the packages or components are designed with or without the requirement from board designers, and the boundary pins are usually fixed or advised to follow when the board design starts. In this paper, we describe this fixed ordering boundary pin routing problem, and propose a practical approach to solve it. Not only do we provide a way to address, we also further plan the wires in a better way to preserve the precious routing resources in the limited number of layers on the board, and to effectively deal with obstacles. Our approach has different features compared with the conventional shortest-path-based routing paradigm. In addition, we consider length-matching requirements and wire shape resemblance for high-speed signal routes on board. Our results show that we can utilize routing resources very carefully, and can account for the resemblance of nets in the presence of the obstacles. Our approach is workable for board buses as well.", "paper_title": "Escaped Boundary Pins Routing for High-Speed Boards", "paper_id": "WOS:000315481000005"}
