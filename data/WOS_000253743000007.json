We present a PTAS for this problem, when the underlying graph is a tree with the degrees of the vertices bounded by a constant, e.g. binary tree. We then use a result of Feige and Kogan [U. Feige, S. Kogan, Hardness of approximation of the balanced complete bipartite subgraph problem, Technical report MCS04-04, Department of Computer Science and Applied Mathematics, The Weizmann Institute of Science, 2004] to show that even on star graphs the problem is hard to approximate.
