All its components are involutional and allow very efficient combinations of encryption/decryption. The implementations proposed also allow changing the key and encrypt/decrypt (E/D) mode for every plain text, without any performance loss. In comparison with other recent block ciphers, the implementation results of ICEBERG show a significant improvement of hardware efficiency. Moreover, the key and E/D agility allow considering new encryption modes to counteract certain side-channel attacks. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
