The resulting future converged network with an expected wide variety of services and a possibly stiff competition between the different market participants as well as legal issues will bring about requirements for charging systems that demand for more flexibility, scalability and efficiency than is available in today's systems. This article surveys recent developments in charging and billing architectures comprising both standardisation work as well as research projects. The second main contribution of this article is a comparison of key features of these developments thus giving a list of essential charging and billing ingredients for tomorrow's communication and service environments.", "paper_title": "Charging and Billing in Modern Communications Networks - A Comprehensive Survey of the State of the Art and Future Requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000300515000010"}
