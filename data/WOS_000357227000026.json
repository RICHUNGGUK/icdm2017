We start by introducing network coding and its variety of applications in enhancing current traditional networks. In particular, we analyze two key protocol types, namely, state-aware and stateless protocols, specifying the benefits and disadvantages of each one of them. We also present the key security assumptions of network coding (NC) systems as well as a detailed analysis of the security goals and threats, both passive and active. Current proposed security mechanisms and schemes for NC in the literature are classified too. This paper also presents a detailed taxonomy of the different NC security mechanisms and schemes reported in the literature. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
