Then the energy of G is defined as E(G) = |lambda(1)| + |lambda(2)| + ... |lambda(n)|. Let B(n) be the class of bipartite bicyclic graphs on n vertices containing a cycle with length congruent to 2 modulo 4. In [Z. Liu, B. Zhou, Minimal energies of bipartite bicyclic graphs, MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 59 (2008) 381-396] it was an attempted to determine the graph that has the minimal energy in B(n), but left two kinds of graphs B-n(1) and B-n(2) without determining which has the minimal energy. Let G(n) be the class of tricyclic graphs C on n vertices that contain no disjoint odd cycles C-p, C-q of lengths p and q with p + q equivalent to 2 (mod 4). 16 [S. Li, X. Li, Z. Zhu, On tricyclic graphs with minimal energy, MATCH Commun. Math. Compd. Chem 59 (2008) 397-419] it was attempted to characterize the minimal and second-minimal energies of graphs in G(n), but left four kinds of graphs R-n, W-n, S-n, and Q(n) without determining their ordering. This paper is to solve the two unsolved problems completely, and obtain that in G(n), G(n)(0) and G(n)(1) have the minimal and second-minimal energy for n >= 10, respectively, and in B-n, B-n(1), has the minimal energy for n <= 31, otherwise, B-n(2), for n > 31. The methods we use is different from those previously used. One is the approximate root method and the other is the well-known Coulson integral formula.", "paper_title": "Solutions to Unsolved Problems on the Minimal Energies of Two Classes of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000296211400019"}
