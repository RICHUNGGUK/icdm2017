This gives a new proof of polytime-soundness of LAL which is considerably simpler than the standard proof based on proof nets and is entirely semantical in nature. The model construction uses a new instance of a resource monoid; a general method for interpreting systems based on Linear Logic introduced earlier by the authors.", "paper_title": "A Semantic Proof of Polytime Soundness of Light Affine Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000276746700005"}
