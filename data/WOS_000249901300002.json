The standardization equations are then used to pre-treat NIR image data to reduce the systematic errors introduced by a line-scan NIR imaging system. The method requires only easily available homogeneous standards with relatively uniform spectral response. The effectiveness of the standardization in reducing the pixel-to-pixel biases and other systematic effects is illustrated with examples, and the improved sensitivity in results obtained from a multivariate image analysis (MIA) based on multi-way principal component analysis (MPCA) is demonstrated.
