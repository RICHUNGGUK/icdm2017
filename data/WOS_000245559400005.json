Our construction involves tuples of values that are neutral with respect to the result of aggregation. Neutral tuples are useful to model situations in which information from different sources, or preferences of several decision makers, cancel each other. We examine many popular classes of aggregation operators in respect to their neutral sets, and also construct new aggregation operators with predefined neutral sets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
