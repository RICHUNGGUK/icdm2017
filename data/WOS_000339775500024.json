In the present contribution, a deterministic force model is developed in direct LBM simulations and its characteristics is analyzed and compared to a recently proposed stochastic forcing scheme. The fluctuating acoustic pressure, acoustical spectrum and sound pressure level are first evaluated on the ground of the hybrid approach and compared with the results from various numerical and analytical solutions. In this paper, we also address the effects of local time delay based on different forcing schemes on prediction of the radiated noise when Lighthill's acoustic analogy and LBM are used for computation of the turbulent flow field and acoustic field.
