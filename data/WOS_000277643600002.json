Existing video abstraction systems aim to relieve this problem by providing short versions of the original content which ease the search and navigation processes and reduce the browsing time. There are many approaches for video abstraction based on the optimal selection and presentation of a subset of fragments (keyframes, shots, etc.) from the original video attending to different criteria, usually dependent on the application scenario. Nevertheless, given the huge size and growth rate of existing video repositories there is an increasing need for providing efficient techniques. This paper presents a unified taxonomy and a generic architectural model aimed for the study of existing abstraction systems computational performance and characteristics. The taxonomy has been developed taking into account and identifying the operative characteristics of current state of the art video abstraction techniques. The proposed video abstraction architecture model characterizes the stages needed to build a generic abstraction process and establishes the basic architectural aspects and requirements for the modeling of systems with specific operative requirements.", "paper_title": "A framework for video abstraction systems analysis and modelling from an operational point of view", "paper_id": "WOS:000277643600002"}
