Accurately simulating such effects is important to convey the realistic appearance of materials such as chrome and shiny metal. In this paper, we present an efficient method for visualizing multi-bounce glossy reflections at interactive rates under environment lighting. Our main contribution is a pre-computationbased method which efficiently gathers subsequent highly glossy reflection passes modelled with a non-linear transfer function representation based on the von MisesFisher distribution. We show that our gathering method is superior to scattered sampling. To exploit the sparsity of the pre-computed data, we apply perfect spatial hashing. As a result, we are able to visualize multi-bounce glossy reflections at interactive rates at a low pre-computation cost.", "paper_title": "Pre-computed Gathering of Multi-Bounce Glossy Reflections", "paper_id": "WOS:000297317200010"}
