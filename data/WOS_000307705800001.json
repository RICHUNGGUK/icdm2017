To get a fully connected and secure network, we introduce secrecy transfer which combines random graph and random geometric graph via the propagation of acquaintanceship to produce an acquaintanceship graph G(n),(n0), a kind of random geometric graph with each edge representing an acquaintanceship between two nodes. We find that components of graph G(n,n0) that undergoes a phase transition from small components to a giant component when n(0) is larger than a threshold, the threshold for G(n,n0) to be a connected graph is derived. In addition, we present its implementation method and applications in wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Secrecy Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000307705800001"}
