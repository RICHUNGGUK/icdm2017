Our proposal generalizes tools used in other studies (Cook, 1986: Cadigan and Farrell, 2002), considering herein local influence diagnostics for a statistical model where estimation involves an estimating equation in which all observations are not necessarily independent of each other. Moreover, the measures of local influence are illustrated with some simulated data sets to assess influential observations. Applications using real data are presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
