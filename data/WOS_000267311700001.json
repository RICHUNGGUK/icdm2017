In BI, the logical implication is interpreted intuitionistically whereas it is generally interpreted classically in spatial or separation logics, as in BBI. In this paper, we aim to give some new insights into the semantic relations between BI and BBI. Then we propose a sound and complete syntactic constraints based framework for the Kripke semantics of both BI and BBI, a sound labelled tableau proof system for BBI, and a representation theorem relating the syntactic models of BI to those of BBI. Finally, we deduce as our main, and unexpected, result, a sound and faithful embedding of BI into BBI.", "paper_title": "Exploring the relation between Intuitionistic BI and Boolean BI: an unexpected embedding", "paper_id": "WOS:000267311700001"}
