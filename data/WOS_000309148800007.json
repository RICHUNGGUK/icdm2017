Design/methodology/approach - To understand a firm's evolutionary operational improvement activities holistically and deeply, the authors conducted in-depth interviews with executives from four firms in Taiwan. The grounded theory method is adopted in this study to depict the profile of the key evolutionary operational improvement activities. Findings - Based on the results of the qualitative empirical study, six major dimensions of operational improvement are identified. Further, eight empirical propositions are proposed with detailed descriptions. Research limitations/implications - The results are based on international manufacturing companies in Taiwan, and thus cannot be generalized to situations in other emerging countries and industries without further research. Practical implications - By referring to the results of this work, managers can better understand the relationships among operational improvement activities, and thus increase the chances to benefit from operational improvement initiatives. Originality/value - This paper adds to the literature by providing new empirical insights into the relationships among operational improvement activities.", "paper_title": "Exploration of the key evolutionary operational improvement activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000309148800007"}
