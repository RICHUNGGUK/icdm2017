This paper presents a framework for detecting fake regions using single view metrology and enforcing geometric constraints from shadows. In particular, we describe how to (1) estimate the region of interest's 3D measurements from a single perspective view of a scene given only minimal geometric information determined from the image, (2) determine the fake region by exploring the imaged shadow relations that are modeled by the planar homology. We also show that image forgery on the vertical plane or arbitrary plane can be detected through the measurement on such plane. Our approach efficiently extracts geometric constraints from a single image and makes use of them for the digital forgery detection. Experimental results on both the synthetic data against noise and visually plausible images demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Detecting image forgeries using metrology", "paper_id": "WOS:000302707100011"}
