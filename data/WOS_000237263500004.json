Especially Topic Maps and Published Subjects are core elements of the infrastructure of relationship management. This paper proposes an Application Framework based on Topic Maps. The Application Framework will make possible to realize subject-centric processing. Furthermore in the framework, we can express the semantic distance between topics based on a relationship cost between two nodes of the Topic Map. This paper also introduces some challenges such as software development process and semantic management. Finally, we will overview the on-going on development of the Application Framework to manage those subjects.", "paper_title": "Application framework based on topic maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000237263500004"}
