At first we provide a new distance matrix of DNA sequence based on the 3DD-Curves and construct new similarities/dissimilarities matrix by using this distance matrix of DNA sequence. As an application, we constructed a phylogenetic tree for I I species of primates, The phylogeny obtained is generally consistent with evolutionary trees constructed in previous studies.", "paper_title": "A new approach to molecular phylogeny of primate mitochondrial DNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000254695000007"}
