However, developing appropriate forecasting models for such systems can be challenging in their early stages, as the sample sizes are usually very small, and thus there is limited data available for analysis. The technique of virtual sample generation is one way to address this issue, but this method is usually not directly applied to time series data. This research thus develops a Latent Information function to analyze data features and extract hidden information, in order to learn from small data sets considering timing factors. The experimental results obtained using the Synthetic Control Chart Time Series and aluminum price datasets show that the proposed method can significantly improve forecasting accuracy, and thus is considered an appropriate procedure to forecast manufacturing outputs based on small samples.
