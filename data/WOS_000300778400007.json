Most studies use a DHT-based method to provide content lookup; however, these methods are neither able to meet the network quality requirements nor suitable for VoD streaming due to the large overhead. In this paper, we propose Mediacoop, a novel hierarchical lookup scheme combining both content and quality match to provide random jumps for P2P-VoD systems. It exploits the play position to efficiently locate the candidate suppliers with required data (content match), and performs refined lookup within the candidates to meet quality match. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that Mediacoop is able to achieve lower jump latency and control overhead than the typical DHT-based method. Moreover, we implement Mediacoop in a BitTorrent-like P2P-VoD system called CoolFish and make optimizations for such \"total cache\" applications. The implementation and evaluation in CoolFish show that Mediacoop is able to improve user experiences, especially the jump latency, which verifies the practicability of our design.", "paper_title": "Providing Hierarchical Lookup Service for P2P-VoD Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300778400007"}
