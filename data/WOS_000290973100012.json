This paper proposes a meaningful secret-sharing scheme which includes both authentication and remedy abilities that allow for detection of the corrupted area and use of the hidden information to repair the secret image with reasonable visual quality. In comparison with previous schemes, this approach results in superior visual qualities of the stego-images by an average of more than 3 dB. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
