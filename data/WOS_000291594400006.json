Either maximal-ratio combining (MRC) or cooperative MRC(C-MRC) is employed at the receiver in the presence of independent, non-identical Nakagami-m fading. Both analytical and simulation results show that C-MRC takes advantage of spatial diversity more efficiently and thus achieves the same or better performance and diversity order as compared to MRC.
