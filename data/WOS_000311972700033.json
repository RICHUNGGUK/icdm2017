With this objective in mind, we have to provide tools that work with fractal objects in the same manner as with objects of classical topology. In this article we focus on the constructing of an intermediate curve between two other curves defined by different iterative construction processes. A similar problem often arises with subdivision surfaces, when the goal is to connect two surfaces with different subdivision masks. We start by dealing with curves, willing to later generalise our approach to surfaces. We formalise the problem with the Boundary Controlled Iterated Function System model. Then we deduct the conditions that guarantees continuity of the intermediate curve. These conditions determine the structure of subdivision matrices. By studying the eigenvalues of the subdivision operators, we characterise the differential behaviour at the connection points between the curves and the intermediate one. This behaviour depends on the nature of the initial curves and coefficients of the subdivision matrices. We also suggest a method to control the differential behaviour by adding intermediate control points. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
