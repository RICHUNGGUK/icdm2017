The outcome of such experiments, e. g. the signature, is a list of differentially expressed genes. Reproducibility across independent experiments remains a challenge. We are interested in creating a method that can detect the shared signature of a group of expression profiles, e. g. a group of samples from individuals with the same disease or a group of drugs that treat the same therapeutic indication. We have developed a novel Weighted Influence - Rank of Ranks (WIMRR) method, and we demonstrate its ability to produce both meaningful and reproducible group signatures.", "paper_title": "A METHOD FOR THE DETECTION OF MEANINGFUL AND REPRODUCIBLE GROUP SIGNATURES FROM GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES", "paper_id": "WOS:000297077800006"}
