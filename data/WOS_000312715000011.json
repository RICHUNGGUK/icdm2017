The basic idea is to impose multiple zeros at the aliasing frequency to a symmetric filter and minimize the deviation of the filter satisfying the orthogonal condition to obtain a nearly-orthogonal FIR filter bank. Since multiple zeros are imposed, a scaling function may be generated from the minimized filter. With this filter, a semi-orthogonal filter bank is constructed. Methods for analyzing the correlation of the semi-orthogonal filter banks are proposed. The integer translates of the wavelet and scaling function are nearly-orthogonal. The integer translates of the wavelet at different scale are completely orthogonal. The semi-orthogonal filter bank can be efficiently implemented using the corresponding nearly-orthogonal FIR filter bank.", "paper_title": "The analysis and design of two-dimensional nearly-orthogonal symmetric wavelet filter banks", "paper_id": "WOS:000312715000011"}
