To interconnect the IPs of these heterogeneous platforms, Networks- on- Chip ( NoC) have been proposed as an efficient and scalable alternative to shared buses. NoCs can provide throughput and latency guarantees by establishing virtual circuits between source and destination. State- of- the- art NoCs currently exploit Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) to share network resources among virtual circuits, but this typically results in high network area and energy overhead with long circuit setup time. We propose an alternative solution based on Spatial Division Multiplexing (SDM). This paper describes our design of an SDM- based network, discusses design alternatives for network implementation, and shows why SDM can be better adapted to NoCs than TDM in a specific context. Our case study clearly illustrates the advantages of our technique over TDM in terms of energy consumption, area overhead, and flexibility. A comparison is also performed with a State- of- the- Art industrial reference NoC: Arteris.", "paper_title": "Concepts and implementation of Spatial Division Multiplexing for guaranteed throughput in Networks-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000257790600004"}
