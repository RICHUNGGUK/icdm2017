An extreme case is considered, where bond strength is complete lost and/or the tensile steel are exposed due to heavy corrosion over a fraction of the beam length. A compatibility condition of deformations of the RC beam with partially unbonded length is proposed. Flexural capacity of this kind of RC beam is predicted by combining the proposed compatibility condition of deformations with equilibrium condition of forces. Comparison between the model's predictions with the experimental results published in the literature shows the practicability of the proposed model. Finally, influence of some parameters on the flexural capacity of RC beam with partially unbonded length is discussed. It is concluded that the flexural capacity of the beam may not be influenced by the completely loss of bond of the whole beam span as long as the tensile steel can yield; whether or not the reduction of the flexural capacity of the beam resulting From the loss of bond over certain length may occur depends on the detailed parameters of the given beam.", "paper_title": "Predicting the flexural capacity of RC beam with partially unbonded steel reinforcement", "paper_id": "WOS:000267324800004"}
