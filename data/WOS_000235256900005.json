The wave CPG model is a mathematical model of nonlinear oscillators and generates rhythmic movements of the legs. The gait generation and the walking speed control are achieved by controlling the virtual energy of the oscillators (Hamiltonian). A real robot experiment showed the relationship to the Hamiltonian, the actual energy consumption and the walking speed, and the effectiveness of the proposed method was verified.
