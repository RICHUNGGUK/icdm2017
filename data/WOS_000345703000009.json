After introducing its basic design and parameters, including a multi-tier manual annotation scheme and error taxonomy, we focus on the more technical aspects: the transcription of hand-written source texts, process of annotation, and options for exploiting the result, together with tools used for these tasks and decisions behind the choices. To support or even substitute manual annotation we assign some error tags automatically and use automatic annotation tools (tagger, spell checker).", "paper_title": "Building a learner corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000345703000009"}
