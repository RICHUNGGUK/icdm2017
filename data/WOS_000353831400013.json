A series of carefully designed perceptual experiments on successive disparity contrast were used to build our model. Factors such as disparity, changes in disparity, and the spatial frequency of luminance contrast were taken into account. We further give a computational method to predict the response time during scene cuts in stereoscopic cinematography, which has been validated in user studies. We also consider various applications of our model.", "paper_title": "A response time model for abrupt changes in binocular disparity", "paper_id": "WOS:000353831400013"}
