Design/methodology/approach - Using case studies, the issues related to multi-scale modelling of inelastic damage mechanisms for massive structures are discussed, as well as the issues pertaining to the time integration schemes in presence of different scales in time variation of different sub-problems, brought by a particular nature of loading with a very short duration) and finally the issues related to model reduction seeking to provide an efficient and yet sufficiently reliable basis for parametric studies which are an indispensable part. of a design procedure. Findings - Several numerical simulations are presented in order to further illustrate the approaches proposed herein. Concluding remarks are stated regarding the current and future research in this domain. Originality/value - Proposed design procedure for complex massive engineering structures under impact by a large airplane provides on one side a very reliable representation of inelastic damage mechanisms and external loading represented by the solution of the corresponding contact/impact problem, and on the other side a very efficient basis obtained by model reduction for performing the parametric design studies.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear impact dynamics and field transfer suitable for parametric design studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000264968100010"}
