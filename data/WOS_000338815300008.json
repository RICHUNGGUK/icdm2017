A response to this data scarcity is to utilise data from other regions in the hope that there exist common patterns in the generation of ground motion that can contribute to the development of a GMPE for the region in question. This is not an unreasonable course of action since we expect regional GMPEs to be related to each other. In this work we model this relatedness by assuming that the regional GMPEs occupy a common low-dimensional manifold in the space of all possible GMPEs. As a consequence, the GMPEs are fitted in a joint manner and not independent of each other, borrowing predictive strength from each other's regional datasets. Experimentation on a real dataset shows that the manifold assumption displays better predictive performance over fitting regional GMPEs independent of each other. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
