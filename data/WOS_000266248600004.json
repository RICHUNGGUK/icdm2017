The proposed tool is a simulation environment (implemented by using the Arena software) representing the dynamics of a container terminal. When the system faces some particular conditions (critical events), an optimization procedure integrated in the simulation tool is called. This means that the simulation is paused, an optimization problem is solved and the relative solution is an input for the simulation environment where some system parameters are modified (generally, the handling rates of some resources are changed). For this reason, in the present article we consider two modelling and planning levels about container terminals. The simulation framework, based on an appropriate discrete-event model, represents the dynamic behaviour of the terminal, thus it needs to be quite detailed and it is used as an operational planning tool. On the other hand, the optimization approach is devised in order to define some system parameters such as the resource handling rates; in this sense, it can be considered as a tool for tactical planning. The optimization procedure is based on an aggregate representation of the terminal where the dynamics is modelled by means of discrete-time equations.", "paper_title": "An integrated simulation-optimization framework for the operational planning of seaport container terminals", "paper_id": "WOS:000266248600004"}
