Membership function is the key to introduce the fuzzy sets theory to multiobjective optimization. However, it is difficult to determine membership functions in engineering applications. On the basis of rapid quadratic optimization in the learning of weights, simplification in hardware as well as in computational procedures of functional-link net, discrete membership functions are used as sample training data. When the network converges, the continuous membership functions implemented with the network. Membership functions based on functional-link net have been used in multiobjective optimization. An example is given to illustrate the method.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy set based solution method for multiobjective optimal design problem of mechanical and structural systems using functional-link net", "paper_id": "WOS:000238327700006"}
