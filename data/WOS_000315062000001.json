It matches the expected time bound of the best known randomized algorithm for this problem. Our approach relies on Cole's improved parametric searching technique. As a direct application, our result yields the first O(n log n)-time algorithm for computing a k-center of a set of n weighted points on the real line. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
