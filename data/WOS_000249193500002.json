Even when they are conscious about the needs of maintenance to keep the system in a good condition, they lack efficient methods and tools that may help them in taking appropriate decisions. One can say that no really satisfactory and efficient tool exists, enabling the optimization of Inspection, Maintenance, or Rehabilitation (IMR) strategies on such systems. Sewer managers and researchers have been involved for many years in the French National Research Project for Renewal of Non Man Entry Sewer System (RERAU-Rehabilitation des Reseaux d'Assainissement Urbains, in French) to improve their knowledge of these systems and the management policies. During the RERAU project, a specific action has been dedicated to the modeling of asset ageing and maintenance. A special attention has been dedicated to the description of defects and dysfunctions, to the evaluation of performances and its modeling, accounting for its various dimensions (from the point of view of the manager, of the user, of the environment...). After having defined an Index of Technical Performance (ITp), we will introduce the Index of Technical and Economic Performance (ITEp) that is a combined measure of performance (including social costs) and technical costs. This index provides an objective standard tool for managers to compare different alternatives. It is used in the article to compare some simple IMR strategies. It sets the basis of a new method for no-man entry sewer system management, enabling us to analyze the profitableness of investment in terms of both technical and economic performance.", "paper_title": "Estimating the capital cost of wastewater system", "paper_id": "WOS:000249193500002"}
