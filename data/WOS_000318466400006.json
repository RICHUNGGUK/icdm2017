This paper presents low-complexity yet effective prioritization based on slice position within a video frame relative to the cyclic refresh line. Two prioritization schemes are compared. The first is a region-based method, while the second, which is packet-based, improves packet classification. Experimental results indicate that, the packet-based scheme can achieve video quality gains of up to 4 dB, compared to when the scheme is not used. The proposed schemes require no decoder modifications and do not introduce an increase in bitrate or in computational complexity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
