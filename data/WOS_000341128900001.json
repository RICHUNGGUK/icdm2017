We formally define a novel representation for N-PolyVectors as the root sets of complex polynomials and analyze their topological and geometric properties. A smooth N-PolyVector field can be efficiently generated by solving a sparse linear system without integer variables. We exploit the flexibility of N-PolyVector fields to design conjugate vector fields, offering an intuitive tool to generate planar quadrilateral meshes.", "paper_title": "Designing N-PolyVector Fields with Complex Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000341128900001"}
