In order to improve the 3Cs of natural language requirements, namely Consistency, Correctness and Completeness, in this paper we propose a systematic pattern matching approach supporting both NL requirements modeling and inconsistency, incorrectness and incompleteness analysis among requirements. We first use business process modeling language to model NL requirements and then develop a formal language - Workflow Patterns-based Process Language (WPPL) - to formalize NL requirements. We leverage workflow patterns to perform two-level 3Cs checking on the formal representation based on a coherent set of checking rules. Our approach is illustrated through a real world financial service example - Global Equity Trading System (GETS).", "paper_title": "Improving Natural Language Requirements Quality Using Workflow Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300022"}
