Based on the linear matrix inequality (LMI) methodology, a novel analysis approach is developed. The sufficient conditions of stochastically robust stable are given in terms of coupled linear matrix inequalities. The stable criteria represented in LMI setting are less conservative and more computationally efficient than the methods reported in the literature.", "paper_title": "Stochastic robust stability analysis for Markovian jump discrete-time delayed neural networks with multiplicative nonlinear perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000026"}
