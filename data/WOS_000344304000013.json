We analyze different social, visual, and textual relationships from a real-world dataset and find four relationships with apparent geography clues that can be used for web video geolocation. Then, the geolocation process is formulated as an optimization problem that simultaneously takes the social, visual, and textual relationships into consideration. The optimization problem is solved by an iterative procedure, which can be interpreted as a propagation of the geography information among the web video social network. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, with the geolocation accuracy higher than state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "A Unified Geolocation Framework for Web Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000344304000013"}
