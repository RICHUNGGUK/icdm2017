With this exploratory tool, we can understand better the journal's dual roles of citing and being cited in a reference network. The h-plot is introduced and its use is validated with a set of 25 journals belonging to the statistics area. The relatedness factor is considered for describing the relations of citations from a journal \"i\" to a journal \"j,\" and the citations from the journal \"j\" to the journal \"i.\" More information has been extracted from the h-plot, compared with other statistical techniques for modelling and representing asymmetric data, such as multidimensional unfolding.", "paper_title": "Mapping the Asymmetrical Citation Relationships Between Journals by h-Plots", "paper_id": "WOS:000335583900016"}
