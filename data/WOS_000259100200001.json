Further, in certain special cases, it is observed that the two semi-infinite optimization problems reduce to (finite) linear programming problems which are dual to each other either in the fuzzy sense or in the crisp sense.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy matrix games via a fuzzy relation approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000259100200001"}
