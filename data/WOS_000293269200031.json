To solve this problem, we have developed a tracking system based on optical flow and stereo vision, combined with adaptive filters to predict the expected 3D velocities of objects. The critical point of the system is the coupling between tracking and predictive algorithms. We propose the use of a fuzzy control system to solve this coupling problem between the different velocities. This technique has been previously tested in 2D video sequences, providing great robustness to the tracking algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
