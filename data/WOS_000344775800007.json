Understanding such behaviours has its potential to extract actionable patterns that can be beneficial to develop effective marketing strategies, optimise user experiences and maximise website revenues. With the rapid development of micro-blogging, Twitter has become a richer source of intelligence that can be used to study collective user behaviour, due to its efficient and meaningful user-to-user interactions. However, the classical statistical methods have some drawbacks in bridging the gap between user-generated data and human analysts who mostly use linguistic terms to analyse data and model/summarise knowledge learned. To address this gap, this work proposes a new approach, which employs the mass assignment theory-based fuzzy association rules algorithm (MASS-FARM), for the first time, to extract useful interaction behaviour of Twitter users. The influential factors (including activity time, number of friends/followers and the number of tweets) are represented as fuzzy granules, and the associations amongst are studied by employing MASS-FARM. The collective user behaviours are analysed in the Reply category and the Non-Reply category, respectively. The applicability and usefulness of the proposed method are demonstrated via an empirical study on a collected Twitter data set. The derived results are also discussed and compared with existing works.", "paper_title": "Study of collective user behaviour in Twitter: a fuzzy approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800007"}
