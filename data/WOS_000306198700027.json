A new gait representation - Marching in Place (MIP) gait is also introduced which preserves the spatiotemporal characteristics of individual gait manner. In comparison with the previous studies on gait recognition which usually use human silhouette images from image sequences, this research applies three dimensional (3D) point clouds data of human body obtained from stereo camera. The proposed framework exhibits gait recognition rates superior to those of other gait recognition methods.", "paper_title": "SSM-HPC: Front View Gait Recognition Using Spherical Space Model with Human Point Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198700027"}
