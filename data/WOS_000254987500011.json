We study the plectonemic equilibrium of such a rod, taking into account the impenetrability constraint. Numerical solutions of this boundary value problem have previously shown that purely elastic models can reproduce the supercoiling response of the DNA molecule. Using a variational approach, we derive analytical formulae for the elastic response of the filament, and extend former numerical results.", "paper_title": "Analytical results for the plectonemic response of supercoiled DNA", "paper_id": "WOS:000254987500011"}
