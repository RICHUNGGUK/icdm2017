Alternatively, we benefit from the advantages of both finite-volume and finite-element methods and estimate the advection terms on the cell faces, Using an inclusive pressure-weighted upwinding scheme extended on unstructured grids. The present pressure-based method treats the steady and unsteady flows on a collocated grid arrangement. However, to avoid a non-physical Spurious pressure field pattern, two mass flux per volume expressions are derived at the cell interfaces. The dual advantages of using an unstructured-based discretization and a pressure-weighted upwinding scheme result in obtaining high accurate Solutions with noticeable progress in the performance of the primitive method extended on the structured grids. The accuracy and performance of the extended formulations are demonstrated by solving different standard and benchmark problems. The results show that there are excellent agreements with both benchmark and analytical solutions as well as experimental data.
