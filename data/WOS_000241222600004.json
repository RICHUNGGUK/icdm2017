The 2D Laplace equation is solved by using the scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) based on the linearized free surface boundary condition. The computational results are compared with the analytical solution and solutions from a finite element method (FEM). It is found that the SBFEM method gives much better results than the FEM method in the case of same mesh size. The effect of the oscillating frequency on the amplitude of the surface elevation is also investigated.
