This study investigates immersion/flow/presence effects in the acceptance of 3DTV with the conceptual model of subliminal factors. A model is created to validate the relationship of subliminal factors to attitude and behavior. Structural equation modeling is used to construct a predictive model of attitudes toward 3DTV. Further, the model examines the mediating and moderating roles of immersion and flow. Implications of the findings are discussed in terms of building a theory of 3DTV and providing practical insight into developing a user-centered 3D interface.", "paper_title": "Can 3DTV Create Immersive Environments?", "paper_id": "WOS:000303208800001"}
