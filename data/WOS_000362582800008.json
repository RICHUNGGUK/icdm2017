For multicomponent systems, the degradation dependence within one component or/and among components need to be considered. Physics-based models and multistate models are often used for component degradation processes, particularly when statistical data are limited. In this paper, we treat dependence between degradation processes within a piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP) modeling framework. Epistemic (subjective) uncertainty can arise due to the incomplete or imprecise knowledge about the degradation processes and the governing parameters, to take this into account, we describe the parameters of the PDMP model as fuzzy numbers. Then, we extend the finite-volume method to quantify the (fuzzy) reliability of the system. The proposed method is tested on one subsystem of the residual heat removal system of a nuclear power plant, and a comparison is offered with a Monte Carlo simulation solution the results show that our method can be most efficient.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Reliability Assessment of Systems With Multiple-Dependent Competing Degradation Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800008"}
