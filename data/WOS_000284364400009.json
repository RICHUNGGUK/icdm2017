The dynamic range of the steady-state values of the weight of the perceptron can be evaluated by finding the dynamic range of the weight of the perceptron inside the largest invariant set. In addition, the necessary and sufficient condition for the forward dynamics of the weight of the perceptron to be injective, as well as the condition for the invariant set of the weight of the perceptron to be attractive, is derived.", "paper_title": "Invariant Set of Weight of Perceptron Trained by Perceptron Training Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000284364400009"}
