Therefore, the computational prediction of allosteric sites in proteins is receiving increased attention in the field of drug discovery. Allosite is a newly developed automatic tool for the prediction of allosteric sites in proteins of interest and is now available through a web server.", "paper_title": "Allosite: a method for predicting allosteric sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000323943200020"}
