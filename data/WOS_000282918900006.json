The model incorporates four major self-perceived dimensions: personality traits (PTs), job characteristics (JCs), transformational leadership behaviors (LBs), and AOs. Design/methodology/approach - This is a quantitative research using a survey questionnaire as data collecting instrument. Data collected from ten technological companies located in the Neihu Science Park in Taiwan (n = 221) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings - Results reveal that both personal traits and JCs have positive yet insignificant effects on AOs. However, both factors significantly and indirectly influence AOs via transformational LBs. Originality/value - This proposed model provides an overall framework which indicates how both intrinsic and extrinsic factors can affect the perception of LBs, which consequently plays a critical role in influencing employees emotionally. This structure has rarely been explored and the findings are particularly useful for management in helping to set leadership in a bigger context.", "paper_title": "The factors influencing employees' attitudes in high-tech environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000282918900006"}
