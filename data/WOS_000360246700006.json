The matrix-completion primal-dual interior-point method (MC-PDIPM) extracts a sparse structure of input SDP by factorizing the variable matrices. In this paper, we propose a new factorization based on the inverse of the variable matrix to enhance the performance of MC-PDIPM. We also use multithreaded parallel computing to deal with the major bottlenecks in MC-PDIPM. Numerical results show that the new factorization and multithreaded computing reduce the computation time for SDPs that have structural sparsity.", "paper_title": "Fast implementation for semidefinite programs with positive matrix completion", "paper_id": "WOS:000360246700006"}
