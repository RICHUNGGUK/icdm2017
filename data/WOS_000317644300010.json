The new (n, k, p)-Gray code has potential applications in digital communications and signal/image processing systems. This paper focuses on three illustrative applications of the (n, k, p)-Gray code, namely, image bit-plane decomposition, image denoising, and encryption. The computer simulations demonstrate that the (n, k, p)-Gray code shows better performance than other traditional Gray codes for these applications in image systems.", "paper_title": "(n, k, p)-Gray Code for Image Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317644300010"}
