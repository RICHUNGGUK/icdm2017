Essential steps in achieving Web service composition include the translation of the Web service composition problem into a solver-ready planning domain and problem, followed by the acquisition of solutions, and the translation of the solutions back to Web service terms. The solutions to the problem, that is, the descriptions of the desired composite service, are obtained by means of external domain-independent planning systems, they are visualized and finally evaluated. Throughout the entire process, the system exploits semantic information extracted from the semantic descriptions of the available Web services and the corresponding ontologies, in order to perform composition under semantic awareness and relaxation.", "paper_title": "The PORSCE II framework: using AI planning for automated Semantic Web service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629400003"}
