However, their scheme cannot recover the lossless image by computation as they claimed. In this paper, we resolve the problem of lossless reconstruction. In addition, we improve the visual quality of the previewed image. Also, we introduce a new definition of contrast to evaluate the visual quality of the previewed image. Compared with Yang and Ciou's TiOISSS, our scheme can gain the lossless secret image and meantime enhance the contrast of previewed image. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
