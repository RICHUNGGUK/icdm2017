Through RFID become popular worldwide, it is susceptible to various attacks and security problems. Since RFID systems use wireless transmission, user privacy may be compromised by malicious people intercepting the information contained in the RFID tags. Many of the methods previously proposed to prevent such attacks do not adequately protect privacy or reduce database loading. In this paper, we propose a new authentication and encryption method that conforms to the EPC Class 1 Generation 2 standards to ensure RFID security between tags and readers. Our scheme not only reduces database loading, but also ensures user privacy. Finally, we survey our scheme from several security viewpoints, and prove its feasibility for use in several applications.
