It represents genuine emotions that people try to conceal, thus making it a promising cue for lie detection. Since micro-expressions are considered almost imperceptible to naked eyes, researchers have sought to automatically detect and recognize these fleeting facial expressions to help people make use of such deception cues. However, the lack of well-established micro-expression databases might be the biggest obstacle. Although several databases have been developed, there may exist some problems either in the approach of eliciting micro-expression or the labeling. We built a spontaneous micro-expression database with rigorous frame spotting, AU coding and micro-expression labeling. This paper introduces how the micro-expressions were elicited in a laboratory situation and how the database was built with the guide of psychology. In addition, this paper proposes issues that may help researchers effectively use micro-expression databases and improve micro-expression recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
