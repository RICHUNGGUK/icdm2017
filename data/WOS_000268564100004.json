We propose an algorithm that solves the problem in O(n(3)) time using O(n(2)) space. Without altering the complexity, our approach can be used to solve another optimization problem namely, minimize the sum of the areas of two arbitrarily oriented parallel rectangles covering a given set of points in a plane.
