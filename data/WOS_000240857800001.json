This paper numerically studies the propagation and attenuation of blast-induced elastoplastic waves in deep geomedia by using a one-dimensional (I-D) finite-difference code. Firstly, the elastoplastic Cap models for rock and soil masses are introduced into the governing equations of spherical wave motion and a FORTRAN code based on the finite difference method is developed. Secondly, an underground spherical blast is simulated with this code and verified by software, RENEWTO. The propagation of stress-waves in rock and soil masses is numerically investigated, respectively. Finally, the effect of a soil cover layer on the attenuation of stress waves in the rear rock mass is studied. It is determined that large plastic deformation of geomedia can effectively dissipate the energy of stress-waves inward and the developed I-D finite difference code coupled with elastoplastic Cap models is convenient and effective in the numerical simulations for underground spherical explosion.
