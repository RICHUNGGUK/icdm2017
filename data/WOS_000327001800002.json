We first enumerate partial vertex covers of size at most 2k and then construct an edge dominating set based on each vertex cover to find a required edge dominating set. To effectively enumerate vertex covers, we adopt a branch-and-reduce method, and use some techniques, such as 'pseudo-cliques' and 'amortized transfer of cliques,' to analyze the running time bound.
