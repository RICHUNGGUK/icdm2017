Leiberman and Resnikoff, Schneider and many others have considered this problem for location-scale type lifetime distributions. However, in practice, the actual lifetime distribution is often unknown. In this article, we propose a procedure based on order statistics for designing a reliability sampling plan which is applicable to any lifetime distribution. It is shown that, under the proposed procedure, subject to MIL-STD-105D specifications, only a few specimens need to be tested until failure, thereby reducing total test time considerably. A large-scale simulation study shows that the proposed procedure performs well. Two examples are given to illustrate the procedure.", "paper_title": "Order statistics based sampling design for reliability sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000249549200006"}
