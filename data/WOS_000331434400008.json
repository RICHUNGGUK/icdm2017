There are several technologies in the intersection of Sustainable Computing and Ambient Intelligence. Among them we may mention \"Human-Centric Interfaces for Ambient Intelligence\" and \"Collaborative Smart Objects\" technologies. In this paper we present our efforts in developing these technologies for \"Mixed Reality\", a paradigm where Virtual Reality and Ambient Intelligence meet. Cubica is a mixed reality educational application that integrates virtual worlds with tangible interfaces. The application is focused on teaching computer science, in particular \"sorting algorithms\". The tangible interface is used to simplify the abstract concept of array, while the virtual world is used for delivering explanations. This educational application has been tested with students at different educational levels in secondary education, having obtained promising results in terms of increased motivation for learning and better understanding of abstract concepts.", "paper_title": "CUBICA: An Example of Mixed Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000331434400008"}
