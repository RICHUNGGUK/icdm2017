This proves a conjecture made by Gopalan et al. [Proceedings of the 18th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, 2007, pp. 318-327] who proved a matching upper bound. Our results yield asymptotically tight lower bounds for all approximation factors, thus resolving the main open problem from their paper. Our proof is based on analyzing a related communication problem and proving a direct sum type property for it.", "paper_title": "LOWER BOUNDS ON STREAMING ALGORITHMS FOR APPROXIMATING THE LENGTH OF THE LONGEST INCREASING SUBSEQUENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000285546500002"}
