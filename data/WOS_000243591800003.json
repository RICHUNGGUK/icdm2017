The results of integration obtained with the two sequences are compared and the parameters C and alpha from the convergence model C/N-alpha are estimated, where N is the number of points used. For all the tests done, the Sobol' sequence demonstrated somewhat better convergence, but for many practical values of N the relative error is higher than for Richtmyer sequences due to the large value of C. Constructing Sobol' sequences also takes considerably more time than constructing Richtmyer sequences. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
