Such searches often take many hours and consume a great number of CPU cycles on modern computers. We present a cluster-enabled hardware/software-accelerated implementation of the HMMER search tool hmmsearch. Our results show that combining the parallel efficiency of a cluster with one or more high-speed hardware accelerators (FPGAs) can significantly improve performance for even the most time consuming searches, often reducing search times from several hours to minutes.", "paper_title": "MPI-HMMER-Boost: Distributed FPGA acceleration", "paper_id": "WOS:000249211900004"}
