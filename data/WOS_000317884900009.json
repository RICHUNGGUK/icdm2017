To evaluate the performance of the BMSA, computational experiments were conducted on the well-known benchmark problem set provided by Taillard. The non-dominated sets obtained from each of the existing benchmark algorithms and the BMSA were compared, and then combined to form a net non-dominated front. The computational results show that more than 64% of the solutions in the net non-dominated front are contributed by the proposed BMSA. It is believed that these solutions can serve as new benchmarks for future research. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
