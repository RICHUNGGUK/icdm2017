In this paper, we propose an accurate and robust algorithm for pairwise and multi-view range image registration. We first extract a set of Rotational Projection Statistics (RoPS) features from a pair of range images, and perform feature matching between them. The two range images are then registered using a transformation estimation method and a variant of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm. Based on the pairwise registration algorithm, we propose a shape growing based multi-view registration algorithm. The seed shape is initialized with a selected range image and then sequentially updated by performing pairwise registration between itself and the input range images. All input range images are iteratively registered during the shape growing process. Extensive experiments were conducted to test the performance of our algorithm. The proposed pairwise registration algorithm is accurate, and robust to small overlaps, noise and varying mesh resolutions. The proposed multi-view registration algorithm is also very accurate. Rigorous comparisons with the state-of-the-art show the superiority of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Accurate and Robust Range Image Registration Algorithm for 3D Object Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000340295600019"}
