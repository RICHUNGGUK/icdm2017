Despite their widespread adoption as a theoretical tool, though, they still face some unresolved semantic issues, since the standard operational, denotational and logical methods often proved inadequate to reason about these formalisms. A domain which has been successfully employed for languages with asymmetric communication, like the pi-calculus, are presheaf categories based on (injective) relabellings, such as . Calculi with symmetric binding, in the spirit of the fusion calculus, give rise to novel research challenges. In this work we examine the explicit fusion calculus, and propose to model its syntax and semantics using the presheaf category , where is the category of equivalence relations and equivalence preserving morphisms.", "paper_title": "A Presheaf Environment for the Explicit Fusion Calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000305832500004"}
