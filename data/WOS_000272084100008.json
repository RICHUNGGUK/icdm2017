Replication also increases data availability thereby enhancing system reliability. The research addresses the problem of replication in Data Grid environment by investigating a set of highly decentralized dynamic replica placement algorithms. Replica placement algorithms are based on heuristics that consider both network latency and user requests to select the best candidate sites to place replicas. Due to dynamic nature of Grid, the candidate site holds replicas currently may not be the best sites to fetch replicas in subsequent periods. Therefore, a replica maintenance algorithm is proposed to relocate replicas to different sites if the performance metric degrades significantly. The study of our replica placement algorithms is carried out using a model of the EU Data Grid Testbed 1 [Bell et al. Comput. Appl., 17(4), 2003] sites and their associated network geometry. We validate our replica placement algorithms with total file transfer times, the number of local file accesses, and the number of remote file accesses.", "paper_title": "Replica Placement Strategies in Data Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000272084100008"}
