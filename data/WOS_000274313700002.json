In particular, the distortion of the rising slope of the sustain waveform according to the display load was shown to affect the sustain discharge characteristics, thereby varying the luminance of the ac-PDP. Therefore, the luminance variation relative to the display load was significantly compensated by proper control of the rising slope of the sustain waveform according to the display load.
