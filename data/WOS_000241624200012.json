However, the tradeoff problem between consistency and resource utilization is the primary obstructer for building a transactional environment for Web Services Compositions. Since a resource may not be acceptable to lock exclusively by an unknown Internet user, we propose a Transaction-Aware Tentative Hold Protocol (taTHP) to perceive the transaction context information and play a more active role in transaction coordination. With the capability of forecasting the will-succeed transactions in a fairly small scope of candidates, taTHP is able to achieve more resource utilization with smaller complaints about the transaction coordination. Finally, a comprehensive comparison is carried out to demonstrate the improvement of the proposed protocol. And it can be concluded from the result that taTHP is provided with better efficiency and satisfactory quality of service.", "paper_title": "A transaction-aware coordination protocol for Web services composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200012"}
