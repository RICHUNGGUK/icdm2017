The algorithm uses a curvilinear coordinate formulation of the equations that is derived for the Euler equations with the stiffened gas equation of state to ensure the correct fluid mixing when approximating the equations numerically with material interfaces. A gamma-based and a alpha-based model have been described that is an easy extension of the Cartesian coordinates counterpart devised previously by the author [30]. A standard high-resolution mapped grid method in wave-propagation form is employed to solve the proposed multiphase models, giving the natural generalization of the previous one from single-phase to multiphase flow problems. We validate our algorithm by performing numerical tests in two and three dimensions that show second order accurate results for smooth flow problems and also free of spurious oscillations in the pressure for problems with interfaces. This includes also some tests where our quadrilateral-grid results in two dimensions are in direct comparisons with those obtained using a wave-propagation based Cartesian grid embedded boundary method.
