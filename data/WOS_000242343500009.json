Both of the proposed simulators employ second-generation current controlled conveyors (CCCIIs) and only grounded passive elements. The non-ideal current and voltage gain as well as parasitic impedance effects on the first proposed circuit are investigated. Also, simulation results using SPICE program are given for the first introduced floating simulator to verify the theory and to exhibit the performance of the circuit.", "paper_title": "On the realization of the floating simulators using only grounded passive components", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500009"}
