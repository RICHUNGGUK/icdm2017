On the other hand, adaptive design's most exploiting facilities are not practical for any cases (huge machines). Hence, sometimes manufacturing firms are in need of robust design. In this paper, a robust design is considered to configure cells in a dynamic cellular manufacturing system to overcome the onerous machine relocation costs. Most of researches on robust design are trying to reduce the number of facilities while, here, this idea is adopted accompanying with practical concepts of facility utilisation with new mathematical formulae. Then, a multi-objective mathematical model containing the minimisation of the inter-cell movements besides maximising the machine and worker utilisation is developed. Some other supplements are the following: (1) considering a cubic space representation for calculation of inter-cell movements and (2) fuzzy random nature of part demands. Above all, a new goal programming method named 'percentage multi-choice goal programming' (PMCGP) is innovated to solve the proposed multi-objective model. Finally, a comprehensive numerical example is generated randomly to verify the proposed model.", "paper_title": "New bi-objective robust design-based utilisation towards dynamic cell formation problem with fuzzy random demands", "paper_id": "WOS:000352345300003"}
