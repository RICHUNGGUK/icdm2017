The technique is equally applicable to any other bolted structure. A 3D FE model of a detailed bolted joint was created and the relationship between energy dissipated in the joint and the transverse excitation force established using non-linear FE analyses. Experimental tests were carried out on bolted joint specimens to provide data for the FE modelling techniques used. Local joint forces in the satellite were obtained from a FE model of the satellite using a frequency response analysis. These forces were used in conjunction with the joint force-energy relationship to obtain the energy dissipated in the joints. Analysis revealed that, without including joint macro-slip, the energy dissipated in the joints of the current satellite was relatively small. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
