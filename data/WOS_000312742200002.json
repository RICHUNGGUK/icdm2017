Customers select their preferred pairs from the menu and the server is obligated to meet the quoted leadtime. Customers have convex-concave delay costs. The firm does not have information on a given customer's type, so the offered menus must be incentive compatible. A menu quotation policy is given and proven to be asymptotically optimal under traditional large-capacity heavy-traffic scaling.", "paper_title": "Congestion-based leadtime quotation and pricing for revenue maximization with heterogeneous customers", "paper_id": "WOS:000312742200002"}
