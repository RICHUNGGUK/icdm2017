This problem is beforehand re-casted as a polyhedral DC program with the help of exact penalty in DC programming. The related DCA is original and computer efficient because it consists of solving a few linear programs and converges after a finite number of iterations to an integer solution while working in a continuous domain. Numerical simulations show the efficiency and robustness of DCA and its superiority with respect to standard methods.", "paper_title": "Solving the minimum M-dominating set problem by a continuous optimization approach based on DC programming and DCA", "paper_id": "WOS:000309347400001"}
