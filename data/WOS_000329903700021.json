Based on the free-weighting matrix approach, the average dwell-time approach and by constructing a Lyapunov-like Krasovskii functional, delay-dependent sufficient conditions are derived and formulated to check the exponential stability of such systems in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By checking the corresponding LMI conditions, the average dwell-time and switching signal conditions are obtained. This paper also highlights the relationship between the average dwell-time of the switched nonlinear singular time-delay system, its stability and the exponential convergence rate of differential and algebraic states. A numerical example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of hybrid switched nonlinear singular time-delay systems with stable and unstable subsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329903700021"}
