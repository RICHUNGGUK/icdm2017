Traditionally, AGVs were mostly used at manufacturing systems, but currently other applications of AGVs are extensively developed in other areas, such as warehouses, container terminals and transportation systems. This paper discusses literature related to different methodologies to optimize AGV systems for the two significant problems of scheduling and routing at manufacturing, distribution, transshipment and transportation systems. We categorized the methodologies into mathematical methods (exact and heuristics), simulation studies, metaheuristic techniques and artificial intelligent based approaches.", "paper_title": "Methodologies to Optimize Automated Guided Vehicle Scheduling and Routing Problems: A Review Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000350657800009"}
