This logic is investigated for structures with an injective omega-automatic presentation. If first-order logic is extended by an infinity-quantifier, the resulting theory of any such structure is known to be decidable [4]. It is shown that, as in the case of automatic structures [13], also modulo-counting quantifiers as well as infinite cardinality quantifiers (\"there are n many elements satisfying ...\") lead to decidable theories. For a structure of bounded degree with injective omega-automatic presentation, the fragment of L(Q(u)) that contains only effective quantifiers is shown to be decidable and an elementary algorithm for this decision is presented. Both assumptions (omega-automaticity and bounded degree) are necessary for this result to hold.", "paper_title": "First-order and counting theories of omega-automatic structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000022"}
