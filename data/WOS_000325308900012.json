A systematic investigation of the partition of the parameter space is provided. Furthermore, the recursive formula of the transition matrix of an MNN is obtained. By implementing the well-developed tools in the symbolic dynamical systems, the topological entropy of an MNN can be computed explicitly. A novel phenomenon, the asymmetry of a topological diagram that was seen in Ban, Chang, Lin, and Lin (2009) [J. Differential Equations 246, pp. 552-580,2009], is revealed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
