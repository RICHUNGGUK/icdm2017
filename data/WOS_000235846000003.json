However, these traditional algorithms lack flexibility. FIFO and SPR cannot adapt to changes in the cell flow environment. DWPS on the other hand, is more adaptable to changing traffic flow. But if the cell flow changes dramatically, the performance of this method is also not very good. In order to address these issues, we propose the framework of evolvable fuzzy system (EFS). The system is intrinsically evolvable and able to carry out on-line adaptation to meet the desired QoS requirement. The EFS is realizable as a form of evolvable fuzzy hardware (EFH) by means of a reconfigurable fuzzy inference chip (RFIC). With an implementation of the EFS as EFH which carries out intrinsic evolution and on-line adaptation, some open issues pertinent to evolvable hardware (EHW) can be addressed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
