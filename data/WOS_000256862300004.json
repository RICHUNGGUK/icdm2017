Restricting ourselves to the second-order case of state-space digital filters, we can express the L-2-sensitivity by a simple linear combination of exponential functions and formulate the L(2-)sensitivity minimization problem by a simple polynomial equation. As a result, the L-2-sensifivity minimization problem can be converted into a problem to find the solution to a fourth-degree polynomial equation of constant coefficients, which can be algebraically solved in closed form without iterative calculations.", "paper_title": "A closed form solution to L-2-sensitivity minimization of second-order state-space digital filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862300004"}
