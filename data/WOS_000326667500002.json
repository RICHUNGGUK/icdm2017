The group sparsity indicates sparsity across the groups, i.e., a vector is separated into some groups, and most of groups only contain approximately zero-valued entries. First, we provide a theoretical evidence that the second-order Volterra systems tend to have the group sparsity under natural assumptions. Next, we propose an algorithm by applying the adaptive proximal forward-backward splitting method to a carefully designed cost function to exploit the group sparsity effectively. The designed cost function is the sum of the weighted group l(1) norm which promotes the group sparsity and a weighted sum of squared distances to data-fidelity sets used in adaptive filtering algorithms. Finally, Numerical examples show that the proposed method outperforms a sparsity-aware algorithm in both the system-mismatch and the echo return loss enhancement.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Group Sparsity in Nonlinear Acoustic Echo Cancellation by Adaptive Proximal Forward-Backward Splitting", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667500002"}
