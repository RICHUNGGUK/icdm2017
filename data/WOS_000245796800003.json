Different CASE tool vendors support this paradigm, allowing developers to define high-level models and helping to transform them into refined models or source code. However, current software configuration management tools use a file-based data model that is barely sufficient to manipulate source code. This file-based data model is not adequate to provide versioning capabilities for software modeling environments, which are strongly focused on analysis and architectural design artifacts. The existence of a versioned repository of high-level artifacts integrated with a customized change control process could help in the development and maintenance of such model-based systems. In this work, we introduce Odyssey-SCM, an integrated software configuration management infrastructure for UML models. This infrastructure is composed of a flexible version control system for fine-grained UML model elements, named Odyssey-VCS, and two complementary components: a customizable change control system tightly integrated with the version control system, and a traceability link detection tool that uses data mining to discover change traces among versioned UML model elements and provides the rationale of change traces, automatically collected from the integrated software configuration management infrastructure.
