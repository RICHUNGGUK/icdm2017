In this paper, according to the characteristics of locator/identifier separation, we systematically analyze the mitigation of worm propagation in three aspects: address semantics, address space and mapping delay. By applying the classical AAWP and SIR worm propagation models, we give a quantitative comparison between today's Internet and networks with locator/identifier separation. In particular, our research results show that, the characteristics of locator/identifier separation can help to markedly mitigate worm propagation, and networks with locator/identifier separation are more resistant to worm propagation than today's Internet.", "paper_title": "Locator/Identifier Separation: Comparison and Analysis on the Mitigation of Worm Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000009"}
