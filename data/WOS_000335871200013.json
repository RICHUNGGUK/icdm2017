Recently, cosegmentation has received more and more attention. Although lots of research efforts have already studied this problem in the case of single object, there still lacks the deep investigation on multiple objects cosegmentation. In this paper, we try to attack this challenge by transferring the foreground segmentations using nonrigid mapping. We present a framework, in which we first take advantage of deformable part models to detect the foreground regions across the images, and the segmentation is formulated as an energy minimization problem on pixel labeling. We have conducted a set of experiments on the FlickrMFC dataset and iCoseg dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.
