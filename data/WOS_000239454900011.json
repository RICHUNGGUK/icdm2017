The device extracted quantitative features characterizing the lesions by shape, margins, size and distribution. Descriptors taken from the BI-RADS lexicon for the appearance of the lesion were generated based on the values of the quantitative features. A paradigm based on the computer generated descriptors was developed to assist in assigning a level of suspicion. The paradigm deemed malignant, all 10 malignant cases of the study (100% sensitivity) and correctly classified 38 of the 103 benign lesions. The CAD-generated descriptors, thus, eliminated 36.9% of unnecessary biopsies without decreasing the sensitivity.", "paper_title": "Computerized classification can reduce unnecessary biopsies in BI-RADS category 4A lesions", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454900011"}
