Most of them focus on theory, whereas practical aspects are omitted. Theoretical advances demand flexible real-time kernel support for multitasking and preemption, thus requiring more sophisticated and expensive software/hardware solutions. On the other hand, embedded control systems often have cost constraints related with mass production and strong industrial competition, thus demanding low-cost solutions. In this paper, it is shown that these conflicting demands can be softened and that a compromise solution can be reached. We advocate that recent research results on optimal resource management for control tasks can be implemented on simple multitasking preemptive real-time kernels targeting low-cost microprocessors, which can be easily built in-house and tailored to actual application needs. The experimental evaluation shows that significant control performance improvement can be achieved without increasing hardware costs.", "paper_title": "Performing flexible control on low-cost microcontrollers using a minimal real-time kernel", "paper_id": "WOS:000256404500006"}
