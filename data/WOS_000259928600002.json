Genome rearrangement phylogenetics requires that all genomes analyzed have the same set of orthologs, so that it is not possible to include doubled and unduplicated genomes in the same phylogeny. A framework for solving this difficulty requires separating out various possible local configurations of doubled and unduplicated genomes in a given phylogeny, each of which requires a different strategy for integrating genomic distance, halving and rearrangement median algorithms. In this paper we focus on the two cases where doubling precedes a speciation event and where it occurs independently in both lineages initiated by a speciation event. We apply these to a new data set containing markers that are ancient duplicates in two yeast genomes.", "paper_title": "Descendants of Whole Genome Duplication within Gene Order Phylogeny", "paper_id": "WOS:000259928600002"}
