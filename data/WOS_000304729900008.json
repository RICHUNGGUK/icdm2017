The presented method can be applied on any experimental design and more particularly on space filling designs. This specificity is very interesting in terms of time and calculation economy. Indeed, we can use a universal design, which is adapted to sensitivity analysis as well as optimization without any supplementary simulation. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
