Hence, it will increase product value and avoid risks associated with new product development including the spending of excessive time on product development, excessive development costs, and the creation of redundant products. Additionally, considering each performance factor for example, including cost, quality, delivery date, and so on, we construct a supplier evaluation and planning model, which uses Particle Swarm Optimization to identify the optimal solution to the problem of variable combination, to provide a basis for decision making. This study researched the utilization of currently available data by the corporation and analyzed this data to make it valuable, as well as identifying the most common failures so as to maximize the efficacy of alterations. The modern businesses must deal with vast quantities of information every day, and all wish to identify appropriate methods of dealing with highly competitive markets, and also use the evaluation of changes in product design to identify the approach that is cheapest and most profitable.
