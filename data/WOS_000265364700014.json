Specifically, the interface discussed here employs what is known as the \"photothermic effect\" to convert light power into a pneumatic signal. This is crucial in developing actuators that are suitable for use in areas involving explosion hazards or electromagnetic interference problems, where electrical devices are not recommended or must be avoided. In this case, the system converts an optical signal into a pneumatic signal thanks to a light absorption body interposed between the optical source and the operating gas. The investigation was carried out using both theoretical and experimental methods. Essentially, its goals were to compare the behavior of light absorption bodies in a photothermic cell, using different materials that ensure a durable, repeatable coating with little sensitivity to disturbance, and to determine the influence of varying the photothermic cell's geometric dimensions.
