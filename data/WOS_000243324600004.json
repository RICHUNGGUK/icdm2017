This algorithm is used to deal with some control problems in cooperative multi-robot systems. Specifically, a leader-follower robotic system and a flocking system are investigated. In the leader-follower robotic system, the leader robot tries to track a desired trajectory, while the follower robot tries to follow the reader to keep a formation. Two different fuzzy policies are developed for the leader and follower, respectively. In the flocking system, multiple robots adopt the same fuzzy policy to flock. Initial fuzzy policies are manually crafted for these cooperative behaviors. The proposed learning algorithm finely tunes the parameters of the fuzzy policies through the policy gradient approach to improve control performance. Our simulation results demonstrate that the control performance can be improved after the learning.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy policy reinforcement learning in cooperative multi-robot systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243324600004"}
