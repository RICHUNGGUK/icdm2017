Moreover, these approaches have to be simple enough to provide quick diagnosis results and to reduce development and maintenance costs. Consistency-based diagnosis using possible conflicts (PCs) relies upon the simulation of numerical models to provide a simple and efficient fault diagnosis approach. However, simulation approaches need to know the initial state, and this assumption is not easily fulfilled in real systems, even in the presence of measurements related to state variables due to noise and parameter uncertainties. In this paper, we develop an approach where PCs are used to automatically compute structural models which can be implemented as simulation and state observer models. Using these models, we propose a framework which integrates those state observers to estimate the initial states for simulation within the consistency-based diagnosis framework. Then, both the simulation models and the state observers are used to provide quick detection decisions without increasing the complexity of the diagnoser. Our integration proposal is open to different kinds of state observers, except for the structural model, and different fault detection configurations. The proposal has been tested on a thermohydraulic reconfigurable laboratory plant using real data with satisfactory results.", "paper_title": "Integration of Simulation and State Observers for Online Fault Detection of Nonlinear Continuous Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345627700001"}
