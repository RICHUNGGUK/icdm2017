Because of its NP-completeness, many heuristics such as Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are employ solve the QoS routing problem. Base on the previously proposed Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO), this paper proposes a QPSO-based QoS multicast routing algorithm. The proposed method converts the QoS multicast routing problem into an integer programming problem and then solve the problem by QPSO. We test QPSO-base routing algorithm on a network model. For performance comparison, we also test Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm and GA. The experiment results show the availability and efficiency of QPSO on the problem and its superiority to PSO and GA.", "paper_title": "QPSO-based QoS multicast routing algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300034"}
