This protocol improves the previously known achievable rate of the decode-and-forward (DF) strategy for multirelay networks by allowing relays to decode only a selection of messages from relays with strong links to it. Hence, each relay may have several choices as to which messages to decode, and for a given network many different parity forwarding protocols may exist. A tree structure is devised to characterize a class of parity forwarding protocols for an arbitrary multirelay network. Based on this tree structure, closed-form expressions for the achievable rates of these DF schemes are derived. It is shown that parity forwarding is capacity achieving for new forms of degraded relay networks.", "paper_title": "Parity Forwarding for Multiple-Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262328600017"}
