In this approach, different weights of risk factors were not taken into consideration so that the three risk factors were assumed to have the same weight. This may not be realistic in real applications. In this paper we treat the risk factors as fuzzy variables and evaluate them using fuzzy linguistic terms and fuzzy ratings. As a result, fuzzy risk priority numbers (FRPNs) are proposed for prioritization of failure modes. The FRPNs are defined as fuzzy geometric means of the fuzzy ratings for O, S and D and can be computed using alpha-level sets and linear programming models. A numerical example is provided to examine the results of this model.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy linear programming model for risk evaluation in failure mode and effects analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100008"}
