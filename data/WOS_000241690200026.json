In order to cope with the case the same person name or place name appears over two or more Web pages, we propose a system classifying each page into a cluster which corresponds to the same entity in the real world. For this purpose, we propose two new methods involving algorithms to classify these pages. In our evaluation, the combination of local text matching and named entities matching outperformed the previous baseline algorithm used in simple document classification method by 0.22 in the overall F-measure.", "paper_title": "NAYOSE: A system for reference disambiguation of proper nouns appearing on web pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200026"}
