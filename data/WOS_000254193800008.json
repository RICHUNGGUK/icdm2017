We present recent progress concerning a 4-1 planar contraction considering a power-law and a Carreau-law model. First we compare the power-law model for a Poiseuille flow with the analytical solution, and show that our model is second-order accurate in space. Then we compare the results obtained with LBM for both laws to those obtained using a commercial finite element solver for the 4-1 plane sharp corner contraction.", "paper_title": "Simulation of generalized newtonian fluids with the lattice boltzmann method", "paper_id": "WOS:000254193800008"}
