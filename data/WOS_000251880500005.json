In this model, a voltage controlled switch is introduced to describe the breakdown process of the gas discharge. And two zener diodes are introduced to describe the sustain process of the gas discharge. Three internal discharge characteristic parameters, the breakdown voltage of discharge gap, the minimum sustain voltage of discharge gap and the discharge cell capacitance ratio, are proposed. The formulas for expressing external discharge characteristic parameters by internal discharge characteristic parameters are derived. The experimental method for measuring internal characteristic parameters is developed and the measurement results for a macro discharge cell are presented.
