The new distribution can be expressed as a linear combination of Burr III distributions and then it has tractable properties for the ordinary and incomplete moments, generating and quantile functions, mean deviations and reliability. The density of its order statistics can be given in terms of an infinite linear combination of Burr III densities. The estimation of the model parameters is approached by maximum likelihood and the observed information matrix is derived. The proposed model is applied to a real data set to illustrate its potentiality.", "paper_title": "Another extended Burr III model: some properties and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000340874500001"}
