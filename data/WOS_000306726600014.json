For a square sign pattern matrix A with order n, the associated digraph of A. denoted by D(A), has vertex set V = {1, 2, . . . , n} and arc set E = {(i, j) vertical bar a(ij) not equal 0}. The associated signed digraph of A, denoted by S(A), is obtained from D(A) by assigning sign of a(ij) to arc (i, j) for all i and j. In this paper, we consider the base set of the primitive nonpowerful sign pattern matrices. For a square primitive nonpowerful sign pattern A with order n and base at least 3/2n(2) - 2n + 4, some properties about the cycles in S(A) are obtained, and a bound on the base is given. Some sign pattern matrices with given bases are characterized and some \"gaps\" in the base set are shown as well. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
