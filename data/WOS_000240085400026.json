The essential characteristic of both is the massive parallel of obtaining and managing information. The integer linear programming problem is an important problem in opsearch and it is an NP-complete problem. But up to now, there does not exist any good algorithm yet. A new DNA computing model is provided to solve a integer linear programming problem based on Molecular Beacon chip. In the method, the integer linear programming problem is solved with molecular beacon by fluorescing upon hybridization to their complementary DNA targets. The method has some significant advantages such as simple encoding, excellent sensitivity, high selectivity, low cost, low error, short operating time, reusable surface and simple experimental steps. The result suggests the potential of Molecular Beacon used as a DNA computer chip.", "paper_title": "DNA computing model of the integer linear programming problem based on Molecular Beacon", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400026"}
