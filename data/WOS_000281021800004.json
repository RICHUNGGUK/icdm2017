The first model is a combination of an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm used as a global planner and the probabilistic roadmap (PRM) method acting as a local obstacle avoidance planner. For the PSO component, new improvements are proposed in initial particle generation, the weighting mechanism, and position-and velocity-updating processes. Moreover, two objective functions which aim to minimize the path length and oscillations, govern the robot's movements towards its goal. The PSO and PRM components are further intertwined by incorporating the best PSO particles into the randomly generated PRM. The second model combines a genetic algorithm component with the PRM method. In this model, new specific selection, mutation, and crossover operators are designed to evolve the population of discrete particles located in continuous space. Thorough comparisons of the developed models with each other, and against the standard PRM method, show the advantages of the PSO method.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective robot motion planning using a particle swarm optimization model", "paper_id": "WOS:000281021800004"}
