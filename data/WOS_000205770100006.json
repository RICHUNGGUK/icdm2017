Some nodes are active while others are in sleep mode, thus using less energy. Such a dynamic topology should not impact the monitoring activity. Area coverage protocols aim at turning off redundant sensor nodes while ensuring full coverage of the area by the remaining active nodes. Providing multiple area coverage therefore means that every physical point of the monitored field is sensed by more than one sensor device. Connectivity of the active nodes subset must also be maintained so that monitoring reports can reach the sink stations. Existing solutions hardly address these two issues as a unified one. In this paper, we based our work on two distinct definitions of the k-area-coverage problem. After first detailing how traditional simple coverage protocols could be enhanced to handle k-coverage, we propose an adaptive localized algorithm for multiple sensor area coverage. Experimental results show that our solution is extremely resistant to collisions of messages as multiple coverage of the deployment area and connectivity of the active nodes set can still be ensured.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Localized Algorithm for Multiple Sensor Area Coverage", "paper_id": "WOS:000205770100006"}
