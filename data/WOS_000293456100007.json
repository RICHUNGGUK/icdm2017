Two perceptual studies (each with N - 12 participants) compared the visual quality of images rendered from BCC and FCC lattices to images rendered from the CC lattice. Images were generated from two signals: the commonly used Marschner-Lobb synthetic function and a computed tomography scan of a fish tail. Observers found that BCC and FCC could produce images of comparable visual quality to CC, using 30-35 percent fewer samples. For the images used in our studies, the L(2) error metric shows high correlation with the judgement of human observers. Using the L(2) metric as a proxy, the results of the experiments appear to extend across a wide range of images and parameter choices.", "paper_title": "Visual Comparability of 3D Regular Sampling and Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000293456100007"}
