Given the limited network bandwidth resources, how to provide Internet users with good video playback quality-of-service (QoS) is a key problem. For video clips competing bandwidth, we propose an approach of Content-Aware distortion-Fair (CAF) video delivery scheme, which is aware of the characteristics of video frames and ensures max-min distortion-fair sharing among video flows. CAF leverages content-awareness to prioritize packet dropping during congestion. Different from bandwidth fair sharing, CAF targets end-to-end video playback quality fairness among users. The proposed CAF approach does not require rate-distortion modeling of the source, which is difficult to estimate. Instead, it exploits the temporal prediction structure of the video sequences along with a frame drop distortion metric to guide resource allocations and coordinations. Experimental results show that the proposed approach operates with limited overhead in computation and communication, and yields better QoS, especially when the network is congested.", "paper_title": "Content-Aware Distortion-Fair Video Streaming in Congested Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776700014"}
