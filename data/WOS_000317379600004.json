(2001) [13]. The idea of this proof relies on the decomposition of the matrix into an infinite sum of positive semidefinite matrices. The proof is valid for any size of the frame of discernment but we provide an illustration for a frame of three elements. The Jaccard index matrix being positive definite guarantees that the associated Euclidean distance is a full metric and thus that a null distance between two belief functions implies that these belief functions are strictly identical.
