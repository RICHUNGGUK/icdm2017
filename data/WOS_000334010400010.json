This study aims to overcome the traditional observations of the olive stone by replacing it with an artificial vision and chemometric treatment. The potential of this approach is shown by applying it to the varietal identification of olive stones from five main French cultivars. Two hundred and six variables are extracted from two stone pictures (front and profile). A Principal Component Analysis (PCA) allows projection of the five stone groups corresponding to the five cultivars. Partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) regression predicts the varietal origin of the stones. The best model considers all the data of front and profile pictures and gives 100% of correct classification. The methodology can be proposed as an alternative method for the recognition of olive fruits from five main French cultivars and can be extended to the varietal identification of stone fruits.
