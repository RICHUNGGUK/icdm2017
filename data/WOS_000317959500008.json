The proposed mechanism is based on the structure of medium-transparent MAC, which is capable of allocating capacity dynamically over both optical and wireless media. A frequency band dedicated to the control channel is assigned to reduce the negative effects of the fiber delay in the high-speed 60 GHz radio-over-fiber system. Moreover, multiple channels are used to transmit data for end users according to their requirements.", "paper_title": "Multichannel Resource Allocation Mechanism for 60 GHz Radio-Over-Fiber Local Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317959500008"}
