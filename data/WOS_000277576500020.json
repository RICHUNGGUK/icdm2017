Two new filters are developed. The first is based on H-2 estimation, while the second is based on estimation. Extension to the case of real convex parametric uncertainties in the system matrices is presented. Performance of the developed filters is numerically illustrated using a fifth order dynamic system.", "paper_title": "H-2 AND H-infinity FILTERING FOR LINEAR SYSTEMS WITH UNKNOWN INPUTS AND POLYTOPIC UNCERTAINTY", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500020"}
