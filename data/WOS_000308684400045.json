Simultaneously, Chiu, Chiu, and Yang (2012) solve a multi-delivery policy into economic production quantity with partial rework. Both papers consider the number of shipments as a fixed and a given value. In this paper both the optimal replenishment lot size and the optimal number of shipments are derived jointly for the inventory models of Chen et al. (2012) and Chiu. Chiu, et al. (2012). Two easy to apply solution procedures are proposed. The solutions reported in this paper are better than the solutions of Chen et al. (2012) and Chiu. Chiu, et al. (2012). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
