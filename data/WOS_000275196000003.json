This paper begins by establishing the theory basis for linguistic information processing and constructs the linguistic truth-valued concept lattice for a decision information system, and further utilises uncertainty reasoning to make the decision. That is, we first utilise the linguistic truth-valued lattice implication algebra to unify the different kinds of linguistic expressions; second, we construct the linguistic truth-valued concept lattice and decision concept lattice according to the concrete decision information system and third, we establish the internal and external uncertainty reasoning methods and talk about the rationality of them. We apply these uncertainty reasoning methods into decision making and present some generation methods of decision rules. In the end, we give an application of this decision method by an example.", "paper_title": "A decision method based on uncertainty reasoning of linguistic truth-valued concept lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000275196000003"}
