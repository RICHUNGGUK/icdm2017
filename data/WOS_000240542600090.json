A new kind of pairwise key pre-distribution model for sensor networks is proposed. And in addition, based on which, an efficient dynamic key path establishment algorithm is designed. Theoretic analysis and experimental figures show that the new algorithm has better performance than those previous related works.", "paper_title": "Research on pairwise key establishment model and algorithm for sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600090"}
