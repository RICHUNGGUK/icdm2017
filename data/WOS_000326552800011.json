Since genes work in a cascade of networks, reconstruction of gene regulatory network (GRN) is a crucial process for a thbrouoh understanding of the underlying biological interactions. We present here an approach b-ased on pairwise correlations and lasso to infer the GRN, taking into account the variable time delays between various genes. The proposed method is applied to both synthetic and real data sets, and the results on synthetic data show that the proposed approach outperforms the current- methods. Further, the results using real data are more consistent with the existing knowledge concerning the possible gene-interactions.", "paper_title": "Inference of Gene-Regulatory Networks with Variable Time Delay from Time-Series Microarray Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000326552800011"}
