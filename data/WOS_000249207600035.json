We propose an intermediate representation, called ribbons, which is obtained by partitioning a point cloud into one-dimensional strips. This representation is well suited to the placement of strokes in nonphotorealistic rendering, and can be visualized efficiently using quad strips. Methods for performing hatching, cross-hatching, and silhouette renderings are presented. Ribbons also allow for the application of curve-based operations to the point cloud.", "paper_title": "Ribbons - A representation for point clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600035"}
