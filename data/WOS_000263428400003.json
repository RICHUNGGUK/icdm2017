Through vibration suppression, the method acts to regulate the shape of flexible links and, consequently, improves the performance of any independent trajectory controller being employed over the manipulator joints. To demonstrate the approach, a series of piezoceramic actuators (PZTs) are bonded to the surface of a single-link flexible manipulator. Slewing of the flexible link induces vibrations in the link that persist long after the hub stops rotating. The vibration suppression is achieved through a combined scheme of PD-based hub motion control and a PZT actuator controller that is a composite of linear and angular velocity feedback controllers. A Lyapunov approach is used to synthesize the composite controller, and a unique, commercially-available sensor, called ShapeTape\", that provides the linear and angular velocity feedback. The sensor array is comprised of a series of fiber optic curvature sensors that are laminated on a long, thin ribbon tape which can be embedded into the flexible link and measures the bend and twist of the link's centerline. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the ability of the new sensor to provide the requisite feedback. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
