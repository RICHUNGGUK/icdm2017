Starting from an arbitrary triangular mesh, our algorithm generates a new sampling pattern that exhibits blue noise properties. The fidelity to the original surface being essential, our algorithm preserves sharp features. Our sampling is based on a discrete dart throwing applied directly on the surface to get good blue noise sampling patterns. It is also driven by a feature detection tool to avoid geometric aliasing. Experimental results prove that our sampling scheme is faster than techniques based on brute-force dart throwing, and produces sampling patterns with blue noise properties even for complex surfaces of arbitrary topology. In parallel, we also propose an improvement of a tool initially developed for the spectral analysis of non-uniform sampling patterns, that may generate biased results with complex shapes. The proposed improvement overcomes this problem.", "paper_title": "Direct blue noise resampling of meshes of arbitrary topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000360759800006"}
