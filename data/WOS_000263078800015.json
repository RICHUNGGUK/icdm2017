The proposed protocol allows conversions of the El Gamal and Paillier cryptosystems and has the potential to design an efficient multiparty protocol intended for circuits consisting of arithmetic and logical operations. We clarify the condition of circuits such that the multiparty protocol based on the proposed protocol provides better performance than previous approaches. In addition, we introduce some privacy-preserving statistical computations as all effective application of the proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "Multiparty Computation from El Gamal/Paillier Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078800015"}
