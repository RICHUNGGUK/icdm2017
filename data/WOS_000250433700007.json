The method starts with UML design annotated according to the UML Profile for Schedulability, Performance and Time. The UML design is transformed into a performance model where to compute the referred metrics. Being the performance model a Stochastic Well-formed Net, the method is enabled to analyze systems where the object identities are relevant as well as those where they are not. A complete case study reveals how to apply the method and its usefulness. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
