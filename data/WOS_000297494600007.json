The QR decomposition improves convergence behaviors in the block BiCGSTAB algorithm suppressing deviation between true residual and recursive one. The SAP preconditioner applied to the domain-decomposed lattice helps us minimize communication overhead. We find remarkable cost reduction thanks to cache tuning and reduction of number of iterations. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
