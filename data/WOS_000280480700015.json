However, privacy concerns often prevent multiple competitive organizations from sharing and integrating their patient training videos. In addition, patients with infectious or chronic diseases may not want the online patient training organizations to identify who they are or even which video clips they are interested in. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective techniques to protect both video content privacy and access privacy. In this paper, we have developed a new approach to construct a distributed Hippocratic video database system for supporting more profitable online patient training and counseling. First, a new database modeling approach is developed to support concept-oriented video database organization and assign a degree of privacy of the video content for each database level automatically. Second, a new algorithm is developed to protect the video content privacy at the level of individual video clip by filtering out the privacy-sensitive human objects automatically. In order to integrate the patient training videos from multiple competitive organizations for constructing a centralized video database indexing structure, a privacy-preserving video sharing scheme is developed to support privacy-preserving distributed classifier training and prevent the statistical inferences from the videos that are shared for cross-validation of video classifiers. Our experiments on large-scale video databases have also provided very convincing results.", "paper_title": "Constructing Distributed Hippocratic Video Databases for Privacy-Preserving Online Patient Training and Counseling", "paper_id": "WOS:000280480700015"}
