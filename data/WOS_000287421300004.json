In such a case E is order continuous. If moreover E is complete then order convergence of nets of elements of E is topological and hence it coincides with convergence in the order topology and this topology is compact Hausdorff compatible with a uniformity induced by a separating function family on E corresponding to compact and cocompact elements. For block-finite Archimedean atomic lattice effect algebras the equivalence of almost orthogonality and s-compact generation is shown. As the main application we obtain a state smearing theorem for these effect algebras, as well as the continuity of circle plus-operation in the order and interval topologies on them.", "paper_title": "ALMOST ORTHOGONALITY AND HAUSDORFF INTERVAL TOPOLOGIES OF ATOMIC LATTICE EFFECT ALGEBRAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287421300004"}
