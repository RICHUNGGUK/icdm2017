In this paper, we leverage prediction to solve this challenging problem, by exploiting temporal-spatial correlations among sensory data. The basic idea lies in that a sensor node can be turned off safely when its sensory information can be inferred through some prediction methods, like Bayesian inference. We adopt the concept of entropy in information theory to evaluate the information uncertainty about the region of interest (RoI). We formulate the problem as a minimum weight submodular set cover problem, which is known to be NP hard. To address this problem, an efficient centralized truncated greedy algorithm (TGA) is proposed. We prove the performance guarantee of TGA in terms of the ratio of aggregate weight obtained by TGA to that by the optimal algorithm. Considering the decentralization nature of WSNs, we further present a distributed version of TGA, denoted as DTGA, which can obtain the same solution as TGA. The implementation issues such as network connectivity and communication cost are extensively discussed. We perform real data experiments as well as simulations to demonstrate the advantage of DTGA over the only existing competing algorithm [1] and the impacts of different parameters associated with data correlations on the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Leveraging Prediction to Improve the Coverage of Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000300981100015"}
