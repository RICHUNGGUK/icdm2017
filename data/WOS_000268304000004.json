Many previous approaches used text-based single classifiers to identify spam messages from a large e-mail corpus with some amount of false positive tradeoffs. Researchers are trying to prevent false positive in their filtering methods, but so far none of the current research has claimed zero false positive results. In e-mail classification false positive can potentially cause serious problems for the user. In this paper, we use fusion-based multi-classifier classification technique in a multi-core framework. By running each classifier process in parallel within their dedicated core, we greatly improve the performance of our multi-classifier-based filtering system in terms of running time, false positive rate, and filtering accuracy. Our proposed architecture also provides a safeguard of user mailbox from different malicious attacks. Our experimental results show that we achieved an average of 30% speedup at an average cost of 1.4 ms. We also reduced the instances of false positives, which are one of the key challenges in a spam filtering system, and increases e-mail classification accuracy substantially compared with single classification techniques.
