On the basis of information coverage, we study equilateral triangle and square deployment strategies, and we provide the maximum distance between sensors in order to reach the required detection probability for any point in the monitoring field. First, we provide a model of the signal attenuation. On the basis of the detected signal from the K sensors, the best linear and unbiased estimation is used to estimate the signal parameter with the corresponding error. For the equilateral triangle deployment, the maximum distance between sensors is computed and provided when the received signal data from two or three sensors is used. Similarly, we have computed and supplied the maximum distance between sensors in the square deployment. Simulations are performed to show the relationship between the number of sensors and the detection probability. The simulation results show that it is not a good choice to improve the detection probability with a larger number of sensors.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Deterministic deployment based on information coverage in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345223300001"}
