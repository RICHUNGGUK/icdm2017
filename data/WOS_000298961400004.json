The objective of this review is to propose a system of classification of health care topic areas examined with the assistance of simulation methods. The categories described in literature were expanded and a detailed taxonomy for sub-groups was formulated. Usefulness of simulation modeling techniques was investigated and an attempt was made to correlate the simulation approach with a corresponding health care application group from the suggested classification.", "paper_title": "Application of computer simulation modeling in the health care sector: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000298961400004"}
