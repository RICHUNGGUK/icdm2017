This methodology has been shown to be an effective topology synthesis tool. In previous work, it has been observed that the convergence of the HCA methodology is affected by parameters of the algorithm. As a result, questions have been raised regarding the conditions by which HCA converges to an optimal design. The objective of this investigation is to examine the conditions that guarantee convergence to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. In this paper, it is shown that the HCA algorithm is a fixed point iterative scheme and the previously reported KKT optimality conditions are corrected. To demonstrate the convergence properties of the HCA algorithm, a simple cantilevered beam example is utilized. Plots of the spectral radius for projections of the design space are used to show regions of guaranteed convergence.", "paper_title": "Convergence analysis of hybrid cellular automata for topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500018"}
