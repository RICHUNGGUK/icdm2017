In such cases, DLL injection and API hooking are techniques that can be used to modify applications without intervening into their source code. The commonly used varieties of injection and hooking approaches have many practical limitations: they are inconvenient for a programmer to implement, do not work reliably in conjunction with all applications and with certain low-level machine instructions. In this paper we present two novel approaches to DLL injection and API hooking, which we call Debugger-aided DLL injection and Single Instruction Hooking. Our approaches overcome the limitations of the state-of-the art approaches. Despite incurring greater execution times, our approach allows extending of the applications in situations where the comparable approaches fail. As such, it has a notable practical value for beneficial practical applications of injection and hooking approaches, which are present in malware detection programs and computer security tools.
