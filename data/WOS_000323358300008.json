We look at more general problems where some input strings can be classified as outliers. The Close to Most Strings problem is, given a set S of the same-length strings, and a parameter d, find a string x that maximizes the number of \"non-outliers\" within Hamming distance d of x. We prove that this problem has no polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) unless NP has randomized polynomial-time algorithms, correcting a decade-old erroneous proof made previously in the literature. The Most Strings with Few Bad Columns problem is to find a maximum-size subset of input strings so that the number of non-identical positions is at most k; we show it has no PTAS unless P = NP. We also observe Closest to k Strings has no efficient PTAS (EPTAS) unless a parameterized complexity hierarchy collapses. In sum, outliers help model problems associated with using biological data, but we show the problem of finding an approximate solution is computationally difficult. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
