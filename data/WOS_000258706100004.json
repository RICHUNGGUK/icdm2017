The target of this paper - to bring down the overall system cost and increase feasibility, scalability, and performance - is to propose a new architecture for a wireless video surveillance network, whose telecommunication infrastructure is based on a wireless mesh network, and where video sources are able to estimate network bandwidth and consequently control their output rate. Multipath routing is applied in such a way that at least part of the information arrives at its destination even if a wireless link is shielded (maliciously or not). A case study is considered to discuss the performance of the proposed architecture, analyzing a comparison between single-path and multipath approaches.", "paper_title": "Multipath routing and rate-controlled video encoding in wireless video surveillance networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258706100004"}
