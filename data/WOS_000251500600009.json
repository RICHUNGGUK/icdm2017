This is distinct from previous hardware designs that have been realized directly from conventional genetic algorithm approaches. To be suitable for hardware implementation, we propose that a genetic algorithm should attempt to both minimize final layout dimensions and reduce execution time while remaining a valid implementation. Consequently, the new genetic algorithm specifically aims to keep the requisite silicon area to a minimum by incorporating a monogenetic strategy that retains only the optimal individual, resulting in a dramatic reduction in the memory requirement and obviating the need for crossover circuitry. The results given in this paper demonstrate that new approach improves on a number of existing hardware genetic algorithm implementations in terms of the quality of the solution produced, the calculation time and the hardware component requirements.
