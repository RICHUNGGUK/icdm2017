It also demonstrates significant differences between the engineering degrees (at graduate level) and the engineering master degrees (at post-graduate level) related to skills needs. Furthermore, this work establishes the fact that there is a gap between the expectations of the ICT sector and the computer-based engineering curricula and telecommunication engineering curricula the graduated receives, and where this gap appears in relation to generic competences or skills.
