This structure is derived via left and right trapezoidal membership functions for inputs, trapezoidal membership functions for output, algebraic product triangular norm, bounded sum triangular co-norm, Mamdani minimum inference method, and center of sums ( COS) defuzzification method. Conditions for bounded-input bounded-output ( BIBO) stability are derived using the Small Gain Theorem. Finally, two numerical examples along with their simulation results are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the simplest fuzzy PID controller. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
