We demonstrate the accuracy of new axisymmetric OBCs compared to the standard OBC by conducting direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a turbulent plume and a turbulent jet. The new OBCs conform to the fundamental features of statistically axisymmetric turbulent flows, regardless of the computational domains on which they are imposed. They do not contain tunable parameters and are dynamical, accounting for the strength and extent of a flow at a given time, which eliminates the need for calibration to particular cases. The implementation presented herein is computationally efficient and robust in the vicinity of turbulent flows. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
