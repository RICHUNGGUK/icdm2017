We evaluate five of these measures, all of which use WordNet as their central resource, by comparing their performance in detecting and correcting real-word spelling errors. An information-content-based measure proposed by Jiang and Conrath is found superior to those proposed by Hirst and St-Onge, Leacock and Chodorow, Lin, and Resnik. In addition, we explain why distributional similarity is not an adequate proxy for lexical semantic relatedness.", "paper_title": "Evaluating WordNet-based measures of lexical semantic relatedness", "paper_id": "WOS:000237977900003"}
