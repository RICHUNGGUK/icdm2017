Among all the MPPT schemes, the chaos optimization scheme is one of the hot topics in recent years. In this study, a novel stepped-up chaos optimization algorithm is presented. A chaos mapping x(n+1) = mu sin(pi x(n)) is used as a chaos generator to produce a chaos variable. In the process of MPPT, a coarse search is done to find the current optimal solution in a certain range, and then a fine search reduces the space of optimized variables. Compared with the algorithm of traditional chaos searches, the proposed algorithm is more accurate and can respond quickly. Simulation and experimental results confirm the goodness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "MPPT of PV array using stepped-up chaos optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000365508200018"}
