The attitude of nurses to information technology may influence the process of shaping an e-health environment. This survey was conducted to assess the use of information technologies and opinions about e-health among nurses employed in hospital centers located in an urban area in Poland. The questionnaire included items on the use of computers and the Internet, perception of the importance of e-health systems, and opinions about the roles and benefits of e-health for healthcare stakeholders. The questionnaire was distributed to 215 nurses participating in extension courses. The analysis was performed on 153 questionnaires accepted after quality control. The respondents were convinced about the importance of information technology in the delivery of healthcare services and specifically of e-health systems; however, there was a significant group that expressed skepticism about the need for the development of e-health services in Poland at the moment. The respondents indicated the Ministry of Health, the National Health Fund, and public health specialists as the stakeholders who should have the most important role in initiating e-health development.", "paper_title": "The Opinions About e-Health Among Nurses Employed in Hospitals Located in an Urban Area in Poland", "paper_id": "WOS:000321459100007"}
