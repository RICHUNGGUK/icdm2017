Scientometrics was the journal that published the highest proportions. A low rate of publication deprives researchers of potentially interesting results and points up the role of the ISSI Conference proceedings as a primary source of information.", "paper_title": "Full-text publications in peer-reviewed journals derived from presentations at three ISSI conferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000268019900010"}
