Starting points of our study are the works of Rigo and Maes, Caucal, and Carton and Thomas concerning lexicographic presentation, MSO-interpretability in algebraic trees, and the decidability of the MSO theory of morphic words. Refining their techniques we observe that the lexicographic presentation of a (morphic) word is in a certain sense canonical. We then generalize our techniques to a hierarchy of classes of w-words enjoying the above mentioned definability and decidability properties. We introduce k-lexicographic presentations, and morphisms of level k stacks and show that these are inter-translatable, thus giving rise to the same classes of k-lexicographic or level k morphic words. We prove that these presentations are also canonical, which implies decidability of the MSO theory of every k-lexicographic word as well as closure of these classes under MSO-definable recolorings, e.g. closure under deterministic sequential mappings. The classes of k-lexicographic words are shown to constitute an infinite hierarchy.", "paper_title": "A hierarchy of automatic w-words having a decidable MSO theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000256464100002"}
