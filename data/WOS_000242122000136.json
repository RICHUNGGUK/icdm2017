The tool supports communication phases as well as document and product creation phases by means of annotations. Memorizing all the annotations and creating documents from these annotations enable the team members to capture their experience. Annotation is here defined as a continuum fulfilling several purposes from communication and argumentation to indexation.", "paper_title": "Annotations: A way to capture experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000136"}
