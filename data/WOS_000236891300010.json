We prove that this hierarchical basis is well suited for compressing surfaces. Our compression method does not require the construction of wavelets which are usually expensive to compute, but instead we use a stable quasi-interpolation scheme that achieves optimal approximation order. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high compression rate of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Surface compression with hierarchical Powell-Sabin B-splines", "paper_id": "WOS:000236891300010"}
