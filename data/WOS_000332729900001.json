In this paper a new discrete time variable index is proposed, to handling differences in temporal behavior of alternatives, which are not discriminated in preceding dynamic approaches, also considering rating-based perspectives for discrimination of the decision maker by modeling different attitudes to deal with the rating changes along different time periods. Moreover a DMCDM for supplier selection example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed index.", "paper_title": "A DISCRETE TIME VARIABLE INDEX FOR SUPPORTING DYNAMIC MULTI-CRITERIA DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000332729900001"}
