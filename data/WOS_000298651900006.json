In our experiment, the polished copper target was irradiated by a p-polarized laser with intensity of more than 10(18) W/cm(2) at an incident angle of 67.5 degrees from the target normal. The THz energy from three different detection angles is measured. The maximum emission is found in the direction at an angle of 45 degrees to the laser backward direction, which is more than one order of magnitude higher than in the other two directions. A simple theoretical model has been established to explain the measurements.", "paper_title": "Angular distribution of terahertz emission from laser interactions with solid targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000298651900006"}
