The most widespread notation for this purpose is business process diagrams in the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN). In this article, we use the visual query language BPMN-Q for expressing patterns that are related to possible problems in such business process diagrams. We discuss two classes of problems that can be found frequently in real-world models: sequence flow errors and model fragments that can make the model difficult to understand. By using a query processor, a business process modeler is able to identify possible errors in business process diagrams. Moreover, the erroneous parts of the business process diagram can be highlighted when an instance of an error pattern is found. This way, the modeler gets an easy-to-understand feedback in the visual modeling language he or she is familiar with. This is an advantage over current validation methods, which usually lack this kind of intuitive feedback. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
