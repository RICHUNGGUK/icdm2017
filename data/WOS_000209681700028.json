It employs binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) in the pulse cluster to carry information. In this letter, a hybrid pulse position modulation (PPM) and BPSK is introduced into the TRPC to improve energy efficiency and/or increase data rate. Two types of bit-to-pulse cluster mapping are proposed, one of which is termed Gray PPM-BPSK. It is shown by analysis and simulation that, compared with the original BPSK-TRPC, the new Gray PPM-BPSK-based TRPC not only increases the data rate by a factor of 2 but also achieves 1.5-3-dB coding gain in the BER performance. The performance improvement of the proposed hybrid schemes over BPSK-TRPC and NC PPM is demonstrated over both 3-10-GHz UWB and 60-GHz millimeter-wave channels, making it a promising signaling candidate for these frequency bands.", "paper_title": "Hybrid PPM-BPSK for Transmitted Reference Pulse Cluster Systems in UWB and 60-GHz Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700028"}
