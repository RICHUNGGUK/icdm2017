Various resource distribution modeling scenarios were tested in simulation to determine their system performances. MGA operations were then applied in the selection of the best resource utilization schemes based on those performances. A case study showed that this new modeling mechanism, along with the implemented computer program, could not only ease the process of developing optimal resource utilization, but could also improve the system performance of the simulation model.", "paper_title": "Integrating Messy Genetic Algorithms and Simulation to Optimize Resource Utilization", "paper_id": "WOS:000267121400002"}
