Such environment makes it difficult to ensure high bandwidth, low delay and low packet losses required for real time multimedia streaming applications. We target a scenario of video surveillance in urban environment which not only requires efficiency of spectrum utilization, but also requires energy efficient mechanisms for the battery operated MWSN nodes. In this paper, we propose a new solution for multimedia transmission over WSNs which uses cognitive radio technology for spectrum efficiency and clustering mechanism for energy efficiency. A video streaming solution is proposed that is called \"EMCOS: Energy-efficient Mechanism for Multimedia Streaming over Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks''. EMCOS ensures high quality real time multimedia transmission from one or more sources to a given sink, under different spectrum availability conditions, while efficiently using the energy of the MWSN nodes. First, EMCOS clusters the MWSN nodes into different clusters in order to ensure low energy consumption. Additionally for clustering, EMCOS not only takes into consideration the geographic positions, but it also takes into account the actual and the forecast of the channel availability in order to ensure stable clusters. Once the clusters are built, a cluster head is elected for each cluster in a way which preserves the cluster energy by considering the energy utilization of all cluster members. Further, to ensure the content delivery from the source to the sink, a routing/channel selection mechanism is proposed. The channel selection is based on PU activity forecasts to prevent frequent channel switching. Simulations show that our proposal EMCOS outperforms the two existing pioneering mechanisms called SEARCH and SCEEM. EMCOS outperforms them in terms of providing higher video quality, lower end-to-end transmission delay and lower frame loss ratio under varied spectrum conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
