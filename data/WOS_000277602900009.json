The aim of this work is to improve Grid application performances by tuning the job submission system. A stochastic model, capturing the behavior of a complex Grid workload management system is proposed. To instantiate the model, detailed statistics are extracted from dense Grid activity traces. The model is exploited for optimizing a simple job resubmission strategy. It provides quantitative inputs to improve job submission performance and it enables the impact of faults and outliers on Grid operations to be quantified.", "paper_title": "Optimization of Jobs Submission on the EGEE Production Grid: Modeling Faults Using Workload", "paper_id": "WOS:000277602900009"}
