In particular, a Gaussian MIMO wiretap channel is considered, where the eavesdropper channel state can vary from one channel use to the next, and the overall channel state sequence is known only to the eavesdropper. When the eavesdropper has fewer antennas than the transmitter and its intended receiver, a positive secrecy rate in the sense of strong secrecy is proved to be achievable and shown to match with the converse in secure degrees of freedom. This yields the conclusion that secure communication is possible regardless of the location or channel states of the eavesdropper. Additionally, it is observed that, the present setting renders the secrecy capacity problems for some multiterminal wiretap-type channels more tractable as compared to the case with full or partial knowledge of eavesdropper channel states. To demonstrate this observation, secure degrees of freedom regions are derived for the Gaussian MIMO multiple access (MAC) wiretap channel and the two-user Gaussian MIMO broadcast (BC) wiretap channel, where the transmitter(s) and intended receiver(s) have the same number of antennas.", "paper_title": "MIMO Wiretap Channels With Unknown and Varying Eavesdropper Channel States", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100009"}
