Ray-Space predictive coding is one of main techniques in ray-space based FTV systems, in which block matching and compensation plays a very important role to improve coding performance. However, the computational burden of block matching for ray-space coding is the problem to be solved. Ray-space representation of FTV is introduced and inter-slice correlations of ray-space data are analyzed. Then, a fast adaptive block matching algorithm for ray-space predictive coding is proposed to reduce the encoding complexity. Experimental results show that the proposed block matching method reduce the computational burden and speed up the coding process greatly.", "paper_title": "Efficient block matching for ray-space predictive coding in free-viewpoint television systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900033"}
