By 'conformal' it is meant that the discrete system is obtained front the continuous weak formulation by appropriately selecting different finite-dimensional subspaces for the shape and test functions without any additional stabilizing term. Our approach is based on searching continuous test functions that provide exact nodal values for a selected class Of Solutions. This method induces a stabilizing upwinding effect that removes the wiggles obtained with the Galerkin method.
