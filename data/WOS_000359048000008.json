Design/methodology/approach - For this investigation, the mathematic model of LSPV is constructed in the form of state space equation. Then the estimation process is implemented relying on the experimental measurements. With the coefficients of the PC expansion obtained by the numerical implementation, the output observation function can be transformed into a linear and time-invariant form. The uncertain parameter recursively update functions based on Newton method can therefore be derived fit for computer calculation. To improve the estimation accuracy and stability, the Newton method is modified by employing the acceptance probability to escape from the local minima during the estimation process. Findings - The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed parameter estimation method are confirmed by model validation compared with other estimation methods. Meanwhile, the influence of measurement noise on the robustness of the estimation methods is taken into consideration, and it is shown that the estimation approach developed in this paper could achieve impressive stability without compromising the convergence speed and accuracy too much. Originality/value - The model of LSPV is originally developed in this paper, and then the authors propose a novel effective strategy for recursively estimating uncertain parameters of complicate pneumatic system based on the PC theory.", "paper_title": "Recursive parameter estimation for load sensing proportional valve based on polynomial chaos expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000359048000008"}
