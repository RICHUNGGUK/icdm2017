These authors proved the weak consistency of an estimator based on the nearest neighbour density estimator. In this paper, we study an empirical version of the regularity index and give sufficient conditions for its weak and strong convergence without assuming absolute continuity or other global properties of the underlying measure.", "paper_title": "EMPIRICAL ESTIMATOR OF THE REGULARITY INDEX OF A PROBABILITY MEASURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000310190200002"}
