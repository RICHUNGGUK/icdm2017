We show that this equivalence of robust optimization and regularization has implications for both algorithms, and analysis. In terms of algorithms, the equivalence suggests more general SVM-like algorithms for classification that explicitly build in protection to noise, and at the same time control overfitting. On the analysis front, the equivalence of robustness and regularization provides a robust optimization interpretation for the success of regularized SVMs. We use this new robustness interpretation of SVMs to give a new proof of consistency of (kernelized) SVMs, thus establishing robustness as the reason regularized SVMs generalize well.", "paper_title": "Robustness and Regularization of Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000270825000007"}
