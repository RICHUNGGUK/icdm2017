Due to TCP dynamics, throughput of data transfers can be much lower than the available bandwidth in wide area networks. Splitting a TCP connection into segments has been shown to improve throughput in this setting. This paper presents a set of components that enable deployment of overlay networks that use split-TCP connections to improve GridFTP transfer performance. Emulation demonstrates the conditions for which, splitting a TCP connection is most useful and reveals a significant source of overhead. Empirical results demonstrate significant performance improvement despite using intermittent, passive throughput observations to choose proxies. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
