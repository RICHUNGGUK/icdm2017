Our numerical technique is based on an algebraic non-overlapping domain decomposition technique that only exploits the graph of the sparse matrix. This approach to high-performance, scalable solution of large sparse linear systems in parallel scientific computing, is to combine direct and iterative methods. We report numerical and parallel performance of the scheme on large matrices arising from the finite element discretization of linear elasticity in structural mechanics problems.
