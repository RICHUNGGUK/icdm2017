These papers, selected by means of a standard peer review process after an open call, offer an interesting variety of models, approaches and techniques, to be applied within different specific problems. Each paper is introduced in this preface and is developed in the subsequent article. Moreover, in this preface we also claim for a more intense collaboration between decision engineers and other fields that study human brain behavior, like Neurology, Psychology, Sociology and Linguistics. Because if we really want to procure intelligent tools for decision aid, we should start by taking the human brain as our first reference, as it is the most efficient machinery we have found in order to deal with complex, uncertain, incomplete and even apparently inconsistent information. We hope that readers will enjoy this Special Issue devoted to Computational Intelligence in Decision Making.", "paper_title": "Computational intelligence in decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500001"}
