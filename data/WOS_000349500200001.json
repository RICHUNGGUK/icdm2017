The MBA mimics the explosion of landmines, while the WCA is inspired by the observation of water cycle process. An improved version of MBA (IMBA), is also presented. The efficiency of the three optimization algorithms is tested using classical benchmark discrete truss design problems. Optimization results show that MBA, IMBA, and WCA offer a good degree of competitiveness against other state-of-the-art metaheuristic techniques. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
