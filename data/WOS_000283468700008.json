Firstly, the changing process of the dynamic properties of a cable-stayed bridge is obtained by identifying the acceleration response measured from the structural health monitoring (SHM) system, which was implemented on this bridge in 2006. Secondly, the effects of the traffic load and wind load on the dynamic properties of this bridge are eliminated by categorizing the loads and wind load into different grades, and the probability density function of modal parameters at each grade are obtained statistically. Finally, the frequencies and damping ratio measured during 3 months in 2006 are applied to found the confidence interval of safety condition of this bridge, and then the measured modal parameters in 2009 are applied to evaluate the safety condition of this bridge by using above safety confidence interval.", "paper_title": "CONDITION ASSESSMENT OF A CABLE-STAYED BRIDGE USING THE DYNAMIC ANALYSIS BASED ON A STATISTIC CATEGORIZATION STRATEGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468700008"}
