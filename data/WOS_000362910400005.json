Vast amounts of data are being produced by different sources and in diverse formats. It is becoming critical to endow assessment systems with the ability to process streaming information from sensors in real time in order to better manage physical systems, derive informed decisions, tweak production processes, and optimize logistics choices. This article first surveys the works dealing with building, adapting, and managing networks of classifiers, then describes the challenges and limitations of the current approaches, discusses possible directions to deal with these limitations, and presents some open research questions that need to be investigated.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Stream Mining: Online Knowledge Extraction Using Classifier Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362910400005"}
