We study two different communication levels for the problem, complete communication (where all travelers can receive and send blockage information with each other) and limited communication (where only some travelers can both receive and send information while the others can only receive information). The objective is that at least one traveler finds a feasible route from the origin to the destination with as small cost as possible. We give lower bounds on the competitive ratio for both the two communication levels. Considering the urban traffic environment, we propose the Retrace-Alternating strategy and Greedy strategy for both the two communication levels, and prove that increasing the number of travelers with complete communication ability may not always improve the competitive ratio of online strategies.", "paper_title": "The k-Canadian Travelers Problem with communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000321062500003"}
