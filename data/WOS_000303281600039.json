Various techniques prevent routing misbehaviors have been published, but most of them do not consider the collusion attacks. Therefore, we propose the scheme called NACK to simultaneously detect routing misbehavior and collusion attacks, and to mitigate the effects of routing attacks. Furthermore, NACK scheme adopts an acknowledgment-based approach and timestamps comparison to resist the attacks mentioned above. The security analysis and simulation results are presented to evaluate the performance of NACK. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
