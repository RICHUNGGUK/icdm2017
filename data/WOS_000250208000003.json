Based on our work with several movement-based projects we present four selected applications, and use these applications to leverage our discussion, and to describe our three main concepts space, relations, and feedback. We see these as central for describing and analysing movement-based systems using camera tracking and we show how these three concepts can be used to analyse other camera tracking applications.", "paper_title": "Movement-based interaction in camera spaces: a conceptual framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000250208000003"}
