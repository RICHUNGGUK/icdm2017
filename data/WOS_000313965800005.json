CBVCD systems rely on two different tasks: Feature Extraction task, that calculates many representative descriptors for a video sequence, and Similarity Search task, that is the algorithm for finding videos in an indexed collection that match a query video. This work details a CBVCD approach based on a combination of global descriptors, an automatic weighting algorithm, a pivot-based index structure, an approximate similarity search, and a voting algorithm for copy localization. This approach is analyzed using MUSCLE-VCD-2007 corpus, and it was tested at the TRECVID 2010 evaluation together with other state-of-the-art CBVCD systems. The results show that this approach enables global descriptors to achieve competitive results and even outperforms systems based on combination of local descriptors and audio information. This approach has a potential of achieving even higher effectiveness due to its seamless ability of combining descriptors from different sources at the similarity search level.", "paper_title": "Competitive content-based video copy detection using global descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000313965800005"}
