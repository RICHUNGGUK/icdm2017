In many western countries, the media production, distribution, ownership, and funding are dominated by corporations, and therefore governed by the idea of maximizing profits for the investors making freedom and fairness of the press very questionable. There exist, however, a number of political activists who, by writing books and articles, and giving talks, are fighting to free the media from the influence of big corporations. This paper presents a simple cellular automaton model of this struggle.", "paper_title": "A CELLULAR AUTOMATON MODELING THE STRUGGLE TO CONTROL THE MEDIA", "paper_id": "WOS:000263880100006"}
