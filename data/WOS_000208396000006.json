In particular, cooperative caching, based on the idea of sharing and coordination of cache data among multiple users, can be particularly effective for information access in mobile ad hoc networks where mobile clients are moving frequently and network topology is changing dynamically. Most existing cache strategies perform replacement independently, and they seldom consider coordinated replacement and energy saving issues in the context of a mobile ad hoc network. In this paper,we analyse the impact of energy on designing a cache replacement policy and formulate the Energy-efficient COordinated cache Replacement Problem (ECORP) as a 0-1 knapsack problem. A dynamic programming algorithm called ECORP-DP and a heuristic algorithm called ECORP-Greedy are presented to solve the problem. Simulations, using both synthetic workload traces and real workload traces in our experiments, show that the proposed policies can significantly reduce energy consumption and access latency when compared to other replacement policies.
