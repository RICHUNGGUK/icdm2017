Nevertheless, on one hand, some of these works only consider the local QoS attributes in Web services composition; on the other hand, some ideas derived from QoS selection algorithms for network routing are directly applied in service composition without any adaption. A service composition model with end-to-end QoS constraints has been presented in this paper. An improved heuristics HCE based on the observation of characteristic of end-to-end service composition is proposed as a novel solution. Simulation results reveal the better performance of proposed heuristic compared to the other two heuristics, HMCOP and generic CE algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
