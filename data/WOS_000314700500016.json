There are k angular sectors sigma (1),aEuro broken vertical bar,sigma (k) between consecutive halflines. The k-fan is convex if every sector is convex. A (nice) probability measure mu is equipartitioned by the k-fan if mu(sigma (i) )=1/k for every sector. One of our results: Given a nice probability measure mu and a continuous function f defined on sectors, there is a convex 5-fan equipartitioning mu with f(sigma (1))=f(sigma (2))=f(sigma (3)).", "paper_title": "Functions, Measures, and Equipartitioning Convex k-Fans", "paper_id": "WOS:000314700500016"}
