It turns out that all three types of systems consist of a common subset, which accounts for most of the challenges. We terra systems falling into this common subset, Dynamic Interactive Systems (DISs). We propose an incremental, componentwise, correct-by-construction approach to DIS development, using Equivalent Transformation (ET). This facilitates the construction of comprehensible DISs by decomposing global analysis of the DIS into local analysis of each component and its feasible interactions. To this end, we introduce two small, uniform, sets of ET rule types for comprehensively specifying DIS components, and their interaction patterns. We also outline our synthesis technique in which the properties of the model are reliably transferred to the actual implementation code. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by modelling and synthesizing a fully functional Web-based interactive application.", "paper_title": "COMPONENTWISE MODELLING AND SYNTHESIS OF DYNAMIC INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS USING THE EQUIVALENT TRANSFORMATION FRAMEWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800034"}
