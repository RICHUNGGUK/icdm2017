FHDoE combine two design layers and use focused substitutions to increase the probability of obtaining active peptides when designing libraries through a selection of compounds biased towards a lead structure. Increasing the number of peptides with measurable activity will increase the information gained and the likelihood of constructing good quantitative structure-activity relationship QSAR) models. The utility of the novel design method is verified using two different approaches. First, a library designed with the novel FHDoE method was compared with libraries generated from classical positional scanning techniques (e.g., alanine scan) as well as with general and centered minimum analog peptide sets (MAPS) libraries by using an example found in the literature. Secondly, the same design strategies were applied to a clataset of 58 angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) dipeptide inhibitors. QSAR models were generated from designed sublibraries and the activities of the remaining compounds were predicted. These two examples show that the use of FHDoE renders peptide libraries close in physicochernical space to the native ligand, yielding a more thorough screening of the area of interest as compared to the classical positional scans and fractional factorial design (FFD). It is also shown that an FHDoE library of six dipeptides could produce a QSAR model that better described the requisites of high activity ACE inhibitors than could QSAR models built from either a nine-dipeptide library designed with MAPS or a 58-dipeptide library.
