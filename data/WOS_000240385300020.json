This paper studies the multi-solution phenomenon for the perspective 3-point (P3P) problem. For the P3P problem, we give: 1) an algorithm to compute the number of solutions based on a Monte-Carlo type method; 2) the probabilities for the P3P problem to have zero, one, two, three and four solutions using the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Computation of the probability on the number of solution for the P3P problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300020"}
