This challenge is particularly acute on single look complex images, where little information about the scattering process can be derived from a rank-1 covariance matrix. This paper proposes to analyze and to evaluate the performances of a set of PolSAR speckle filters. The filter performances are measured by a set of ten different indicators, including relative errors on incoherent target decomposition parameters, coherences, polarimetric signatures, point target, and edge preservation. The result is a performance profile for each individual filter. The methodology consists of simulating a set of artificial PolSAR images on which the various filters will be evaluated. The image morphology is stochastic and determined by a Markov random field and the number of scattering classes is allowed to vary so that we can explore a large range of image configurations. Evaluation on real PolSAR images is also considered. Results show that filters performances need to be assessed using a complete set of indicators, including distributed scatterer parameters, radiometric parameters, and spatial information preservation.", "paper_title": "Analysis, Evaluation, and Comparison of Polarimetric SAR Speckle Filtering Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000338318100004"}
