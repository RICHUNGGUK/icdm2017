However, actual computation is realised by some physical process, and the latter is of course subject to physical laws and the laws of thermodynamics in Particular. An issue that has been the subject of much controversy is that of whether or not there are any systematic connections between the logical properties of computations considered abstractly and the thermodynamical properties of their concrete physical realizations. Landauer [R. Landauer, Irreversibility and heat generation in the computing process, IBM journal of Research and Development 5 (1961) 183-191. Reprinted in Leff and Rex (1990)] proposed such a general connection, known as Landauer's Principle. To resolve this matter an analysis of the notion of the implementation of a computation by a physical system is clearly required. Another issue that calls for an analysis of implementation is that of realism about computation. The account of implementation presented here is based on the notion of an L-machine. This is a hybrid physical-logical entity that combines a physical device, a specification of which physical states of that device correspond to various logical states, and an evolution of that device which corresponds to the logical transformation L. The most general form of Landauer's Principle can be precisely stated in terms of L-machines, namely that the logical irreversibility of L implies the thermodynamic irreversibility of every corresponding L-machine.
