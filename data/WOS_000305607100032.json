The computational model mimics facial motion by reproducing the layered anatomical structure of a human head including the bony structure, overlapping facial muscles and the skin. The model is flexible enough to animate face meshes of various shape, connectivity, and scale. Different from previously proposed approaches based on massspring networks, overshooting problems are avoided by simulating the dynamics through a position-based scheme, which allows for real-time performance, control, and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that convincing expressive facial animation can be interactively prototyped on consumer class platforms.
