It becomes a great challenge in the information era to effectively understand human behavior, mobility and activity through the perceived RFID data. Focusing on RFID data management, this article provides an overview of current challenges, emerging opportunities and recent progresses in RFID. In particular, this article has described and analyzed the research work on three aspects: algorithm, protocol and performance evaluation. We investigate the research progress in RFID with anti-collision algorithms, authentication and privacy protection protocols, localization and activity sensing, as well as performance tuning in realistic settings. We emphasize the basic principles of RFID data management to understand the state-of-the-art and to address directions of future research in RFID.", "paper_title": "Managing RFID Data: Challenges, Opportunities and Solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000343072200007"}
