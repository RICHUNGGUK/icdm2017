The Pulse Laser Imaging (PLI) technique was applied for visualising the back-stream melt flow phenomena with an analogue water atomizer and the associated PLI images compared with numerical results. In the investigation a Convergent-Divergent (C-D) discrete gas jet die at five different atomization gas pressures of 1-5 MPa, with different gas exit jet distances of 1.65, 1.6, 1.55, 1.5, 1.45 and 1.40 mm from the melt nozzle external wall, was combined with four melt nozzles of varying gas jet mis-match angles of 0 degrees, 3 degrees, 5 degrees, and 7 degrees relative to the melt nozzle external wall (referred to as nozzle types 1-4). The results show that nozzle type 1 with the smallest mis-match angle of zero degrees has highest back-stream flow at an atomization gas pressure of 1 MPa and a gas die exit jet located between 1.65 mm and 1.5 mm from the external melt nozzle wall. This phenomenon decreased with increasing mis-match angle and at higher atomization gas pressure. For nozzle type 2, with a mis-match angle of 3 degrees, a weak back-stream flow occurred with a gas exit jet distance of 1.65 mm from the melt nozzle external wall. For a gas pressure of 1 MPa with a decrease in the gas jet exit distance from the external wall of the melt nozzle this phenomenon was eliminated. This phenomenon was not seen for nozzle types 3 and 4 at any gas pressure and C-D gas exit jet distances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
