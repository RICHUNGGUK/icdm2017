In this paper, we report preliminary investigation on performance and fault recovery designs, as impacted by emerging storage interconnect protocols and state-of-the-art storage devices. Empirical results obtained using validated device-level and interconnect data demonstrate the significance of the said parameters on the overall system performance and reliability.", "paper_title": "Network and device-level impacts: performance and reliability of active I/O storage systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247552900006"}
