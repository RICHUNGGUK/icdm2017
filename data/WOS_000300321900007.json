We give a complete answer to this question by showing that the affine plane of order 3 and the binary projective spaces are the only such systems. The major part of the proof is to show that no block graph of a Steiner triple system of order 25 satisfies the 4-vertex condition.", "paper_title": "Steiner triple systems satisfying the 4-vertex condition", "paper_id": "WOS:000300321900007"}
