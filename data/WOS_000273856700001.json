The curing conditions include water, air, low temperature (4 degrees C) and different elevated temperatures of up to 110 degrees C. The curing age varies from 3 days to 91 days. The development in the pulse velocity and the compressive strength is found to be higher in full water curing than the other curing conditions. The reduction of pulse velocity and compressive strength is more in high temperature curing conditions and also more in VPC compared to NC. Curing conditions affect the relationship between pulse velocity and compressive strength of both VPC and NC.", "paper_title": "Influence of extreme curing conditions on compressive strength and pulse velocity of lightweight pumice concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000273856700001"}
