In this paper we provide the complete and accurate rate expressions for model reactions having cross-sections dependent on translational, line-of-centers translational, and internal energies as well as on combinations thereof. Included are rate expressions for models giving Arrhenius-like temperature dependencies. Tests of several of the models and their corresponding cross-section expressions were made using Bird's direct simulation Monte Carlo method. These were successful in reproducing the experimentally determined rates over the full range of temperatures for the representative reactions: HF + H -> H-2 + F, CO + OH -> CO2 + H, H-2 + O -> OH + H and H-2 + Cl -> HCI + H.
