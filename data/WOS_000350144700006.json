Most multivariate statistical process monitoring strategies, such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares, make an essential assumption that the collected data follow a unimodal or Gaussian distribution. However, owing to the complexity and the multi-mode feature of industrial processes, the collected data usually follow different distributions. This paper proposes a novel multi-mode data processing method called weighted k neighbourhood standardisation (WKNS) to address the multi-mode data problem. This method can transform multi-mode data into an approximately unimodal or Gaussian distribution. The results of theoretical analysis and discussion suggest that the WKNS strategy is more suitable for multi-mode data normalisation than the z-score method is. Furthermore, a new fault detection approach called WKNS-PCA is developed and applied to detect process outliers. This method does not require process knowledge and multi-mode modelling; only a single model is required for multi-mode process monitoring. The proposed method is tested on a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman process. Finally, the results demonstrate that the proposed data preprocessing and process monitoring methods are particularly suitable and effective in multi-mode data normalisation and industrial process fault detection.
