The simulation results show that, for asymmetric two-route model, average flux can be significantly improved if only partial road information is provided for road users. However, for symmetric two-route model, average flux of the two routes adopting information feedback cannot outweigh the flux of two routes chosen completely at random. We explain the results by studying the vehicle number on two routes. We hope the study may provide a good suggestion to the design of Advanced Traveler Information Systems.", "paper_title": "FLOW IMPROVEMENT BY PROVIDING PARTIAL TRAFFIC INFORMATION FOR ROAD USERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288566500007"}
