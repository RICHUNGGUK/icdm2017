Therefore, WX (World Wide Web Consortium) proposes the Semantic Web as the new web paradigm to present semantic information and study browser systems that use Ontology to perform their tasks. However, these systems do not necessarily provide correct information, particularly when users are trying to show relevant information, or information they are not familiar with. Therefore, the authors of this paper propose that the Semantic WebGraph system should be used to present semantic information, using ontology to query language, and also to show relevant information using Anchor Text in web pages. Such a system forms a Semantic Web base search engine that can get relevant information, as well as information about queried language.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of Semantic Web search system using ontology and anchor text", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900060"}
