To separate each sub-manifold constructed by each class, we define the within-manifold scatter, between-manifold scatter and total-manifold scatter matrices. The scatter matrices are robust to outlier and diverse-density clusters. Kernelization and direct non-linear embedding are also developed. Experimental results show that our approach can give competitive results in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
