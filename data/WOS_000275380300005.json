This framework is developed on the basis of the absolute order-of-magnitude qualitative model through the use of quantitative entropy. As such, we study the algebraic structure induced in the set of qualitative descriptions given by evaluators. Our results demonstrate that it is a weak partial semi-lattice structure that in some conditions takes the form of a distributive lattice. We then define the entropy of a qualitatively described system. This enables us, on the one hand, to measure the amount of information provided by each evaluator and, on the other hand, to consider a degree of consensus among the evaluation committee. This new approach is capable of managing situations where the assessment given by experts involves different levels of precision. In addition, when there is no consensus regarding the group decision, an automatic process assesses the effort required to achieve said consensus. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
