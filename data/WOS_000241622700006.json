Many security requirements can be expressed at the business process level. A business process model is important for software developers, since they can capture from it the necessary requirements for software design and creation. Besides, business process modeling is the center for conducting and improving how the business is operated. This paper contains a description of our UML 2.0 extension for modeling secure business process through activity diagrams. We will apply this approach to a typical health-care business process.", "paper_title": "Towards a UML 2.0 extension for the modeling of security requirements in business processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000241622700006"}
