A new method, which is based on the rotation of the space sector, clockwise or vice versa, is proposed to improve the performance of the switching table. Then, it is combined with a fuzzy system to have advantages of both rotation sector and fuzzy controller. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - In this paper, a new DPC of the DFIG is presented. To improve the performance of the switching table, a new method is proposed. The method is based on the rotation of the space sector, clockwise or vice versa. The excellence of the proposed method is proven. Then, it is shown that the performance of the system can be enhanced by using a fuzzy logic controller. The rotation method is combined with a fuzzy system. Findings - Simulation shows that although sector rotation and fuzzy controller can improve the performance of the DFIG, a combination of both demonstrates a smoother response in order that reactive and active power ripples and TM of the injected current decrease in different speeds. Also, it is demonstrated that the proposed method is robust against parameters variations. However, a hardware experiment should be performed to be practically verified. Originality/value - A sector rotation is proposed and its effect on the performance of the DFIG is considered. A simple method to write rules table is presented and the performance of sector rotation and fuzzy controller on the DFIG is analysed.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy logic control to improve the performance of the direct power control based DFIG", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500025"}
