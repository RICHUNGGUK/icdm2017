This paper proposes a multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) technique, Deviation Measure, to support decision making in context-aware B2B collaboration. Empirical investigations to compare this proposed technique against other short-listed MCDM techniques were conducted. The completeness of ranking results, stability and robustness of the ranking sequence when new alternatives are introduced was investigated. The tests also examined the sensitivity of the sequence to changing weights in the criteria used. Results showed that the Deviation Measure technique is the best. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
