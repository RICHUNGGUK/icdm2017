Design/methodology/approach - Saturation fields at MHz frequencies are obtained through resonance effects of properly designed circuit. Simulations and measurements are presented and discussed. Findings - The paper shows the flexibility of the method and the possibility to use it for a complete characterization of the magnetic cores. Discussions and possible extension to rotating field measurements are reported. Originality/value - The paper provides information on a low-cost and easy to use measurement method to characterize magnetic hysteretic materials.", "paper_title": "Improvements in a method to characterize soft ferrite up to high frequencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900022"}
