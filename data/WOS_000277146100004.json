This study proposes and empirically tests three predictive models of MMOG dependency using a survey of online gaming participants. It finds multimedia realism for social interaction serves as an original antecedent factor affecting other mediating factors to cause MMOG dependency. These mediating factors derive from Uses and Gratifications theory and include: (1) participation in a virtual community, (2) diversion from everyday life, and (3) a pleasant aesthetic experience. Of these, participation in a virtual community has a strong positive relationship with MMOG dependency, and aesthetics has a modest negative relationship. Moderator analyses suggest neither gender nor \"frequency of game playing\" are significant but experience playing online games is a significant moderating factor of MMOG dependency.", "paper_title": "Antecedents of Online Game Dependency: The Implications of Multimedia Realism and Uses and Gratifications Theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000277146100004"}
