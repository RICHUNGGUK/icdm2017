Both rigid and field alignment methods, taking the unsubstituted 2-formylpyridine thiosemicarbazone in its syn conformation as template, have been used to generate multiple predictive CoMFA and CoMSIA models derived from training sets and validated with the corresponding test sets. Acceptable predictive correlation coefficients (Q(cv)(2) from 0.360 to 0.609 for CoMFA and Q(cv)(2) from 0.394 to 0.580 for CoMSIA models) with high fitted correlation coefficients (r' from 0.881 to 0.981 for CoMFA and r(2) from 0.938 to 0.993 for CoMSIA models) and low standard errors (s from 0.135 to 0.383 for CoMFA and s from 0.098 to 0.240 for CoMSIA models) were obtained. More precise CoMFA and CoMSIA models have been derived considering the subset of thiosemicarbazones (TSC) substituted only at 5-position of the pyridine ring (n=22). Reasonable predictive correlation coefficients (Q(cv)(2) from 0.486 to 0.683 for CoMFA and Q(cv)(2) from 0.565 to 0.791 for CoMSIA models) with high fitted correlation coefficients (r(2) from 0.896 to 0.997 for CoMFA and r(2) from 0.991 to 0.998 for CoMSIA models) and very low standard errors (s from 0.040 to 0.179 for CoMFA and s from 0.029 to 0.068 for CoMSIA models) were obtained. The stability of each CoMFA and CoMSIA models was further assessed by performing bootstrapping analysis. For the two sets the generated CoMSIA models showed, in general, better statistics than the corresponding CoMFA models. The analysis of CoMFA and CoMSIA contour maps suggest that a hydrogen bond acceptor near the nitrogen of the pyridine ring can enhance inhibitory activity values. This observation agrees with literature data, which suggests that the nitrogen pyridine lone pairs can complex with the iron ion leading to species that inhibits RNR. The derived CoMFA and CoMSIA models contribute to understand the structural features of this class of TSC as antitumor agents in terms of steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic and hydrogen bond donor and hydrogen bond acceptor fields as well as to the rational design of this key enzyme inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Three-Dimensional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship Study of Antitumor 2-Formylpyridine Thiosemicarbazones Derivatives as Inhibitors of Ribonucleotide Reductase", "paper_id": "WOS:000273713200012"}
