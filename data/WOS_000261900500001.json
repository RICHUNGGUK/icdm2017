In such applications, QoS issues concerning the delay and the reliability of data transmission are of utmost importance. In this paper, a distributed routing protocol for WMNs operating above 10 GHz to support services with distributed QoS is presented. As far as propagation is concerned, the major factor limiting the performance of millimetre wave radio systems is rain attenuation. The routing problem is formulated as a problem of linear programming, where the objective is to determine the path with minimum transmission delay while at the same tithe, satisfying a given set of constraints. Lagrangian Relaxation and ducal decomposition are used to solve the problem in a distributed way. The proposed algorithm exhibits a low computational complexity, it is scalable and guarantees convergence to an optimal routing scheme. Its performance is verified through extended simulations employing an accurate spatial-temporal channel model.
