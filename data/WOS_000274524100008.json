This paper presents a framework and architecture of a Web-based construction specification system (aka SPEC WRITER). Its database includes 15 standard specifications, 13 specialty specifications, national design guidelines, technical standards, standard drawings, over 45,000 construction materials, and more than 600 lists of manufacturers. This system is linked to national construction laws, regulations, and decrees through the internet. A functional framework and system architecture is proposed and construction information breakdown structure is used to reorganize the specifications and construction materials because of different numbering systems and formats. SPEC WRITER enables specification writers to write or edit a project specification in accordance with the national guideline and allows them to find all the related sections using a few keywords. Specification writers can also review, edit, and generate complex specifications with minimum efforts by using premade templates. This paper also presents a method to update and validate the SPEC WRITER through the internet.", "paper_title": "Web-Based Construction Project Specification System", "paper_id": "WOS:000274524100008"}
