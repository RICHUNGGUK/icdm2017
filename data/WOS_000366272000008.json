Firstly, the notions of lattice-valued Horn generalized clause, normal lattice-valued Horn generalized clause and unit lattice-valued Horn generalized clause are given in L P(X ). Then, the -resolution of two lattice-valued Horn generalized clauses is represented in L P(X ). It indicates the reasoning rules in a resolution process, which aims at deleting -resolution literals and obtaining a resolvent. Finally, we build an -resolution algorithm for a set of lattice-valued Horn generalized clauses in L P(X ). It provides a foundation for automated reasoning in lattice-valued first-order logic system and an application for designing an inference system in the field of intelligent decision support.", "paper_title": "alpha-Resolution Method for Lattice-valued Horn Generalized Clauses in Lattice-valued Propositional Logic Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366272000008"}
