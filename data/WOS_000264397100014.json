The method preferentially segments objects that have intensities and boundaries similar to those of objects in a database of prior images. A tree of shapes is utilized to represent the content distributions in images, and curve matching is applied to compare the boundaries. The algorithm is invariant to contrast change and similarity transformations of translation, rotation and scale. A performance evaluation of the proposed method using a large image dataset is provided. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is promising for applications such as object segmentation and video tracking with cluttered backgrounds.", "paper_title": "Preferential Image Segmentation Using Trees of Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000264397100014"}
