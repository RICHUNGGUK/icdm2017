In AF, the beat-to-beat variation of blood pressure is increased because of variations in filling time and contractility. However, only a few studies have analyzed short-term blood pressure variations in AF, and we have recently observed a harmonic low-frequency (LF) component in systolic arterial pressure (SAP) during AF. Aim of the present study is to propose a method to verify the reliability of the spectral component found in SAP series, based on the position of the poles of the autoregressive spectral decomposition in the z-plane. In particular, 1,000 random permutations of the series allowed the definition of an area in the z-plane where poles from random process are likely to occur. Poles lying outside this area are considered as reliable oscillations. We tested the method on 53 recordings obtained at rest from patients with persistent AF. LF component was found in, respectively, 51 and 43 recordings in SAP and RR series. High-frequency (HF) component was found in all the recordings for both SAP and RR series. Using the proposed test, the percentage of reliable components in LF and HF bands was 80 and 38 in SAP series, and 20 and 18 in RR series. We concluded that, at variance with RR ones, SAP LF components are likely to represent true physiological oscillations.", "paper_title": "On the reliability of frequency components in systolic arterial pressure in patients with atrial fibrillation", "paper_id": "WOS:000276630500009"}
