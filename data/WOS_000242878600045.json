The hybrid systems are modelled by the differential-algebraic-impulsive-switched (DAIS) structure. The FFNN is used to identify the full dynamics of the hybrid system. Moreover, the partial derivatives of an objective function J with respect to the parameters are estimated by the proposed identifier. Then, it is. applied for the identification and estimation of the non-smooth nonlinear dynamic behaviors due to a saturation limiter in a practical engineering system.", "paper_title": "First derivatives estimation of nonlinear parameters in hybrid system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600045"}
