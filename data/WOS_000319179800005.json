The protocol using the information of second-order neighbours with communication delays is proposed and the delay effects on stability and the convergence speed are analysed, respectively, under an assumption about the network topologies. It is proved that, for appropriate communication delays, networks reach average consensus faster under the proposed protocol than the standard protocol using only the information of first-order neighbours. Finally, a simulation example is presented to illustrate the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Accelerating average consensus by using the information of second-order neighbours with communication delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000319179800005"}
