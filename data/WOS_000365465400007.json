Both methods are inspired by the principles of the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) method, being both based on object pairwise similarities. Their performance was evaluated in comparison with nine well-known classification methods. In order to obtain reliable statistics, several comparisons were performed using 32 different literature data sets, which differ for number of objects, variables and classes. Results highlighted that N3 on average behaves as the most efficient classification method with similar performance to support vector machine based on radial basis function kernel (SVM/RBF). The method BNN showed on average higher performance than the classical K-nearest neighbors method.", "paper_title": "N3 and BNN: Two New Similarity Based Classification Methods in Comparison with Other Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000365465400007"}
