Both soft decision rule and hard decision rule are considered. Computer simulation shows that the SUIs can be ignored in some cases, depending on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the signal-to-interference ratio, the number of secondary users, the sample correlation, and the decision rule. Thus, by choosing appropriate system parameters, one may conduct collaborative spectrum sensing at the same time as secondary data transmission to save overheads.
