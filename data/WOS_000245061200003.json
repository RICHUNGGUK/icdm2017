Nancy, France has initiated a project to create an automatic 3D digitizing system. Previous papers focused on the visibility determinations using spherical geometry in a three axis environment. Here, the latest developments are presented. They enable one to improve this approach by taking into account a five axis environment. Using a new approach based on the Minkovsky operations to calculate the visibility of the different face of the B-Rep model of the part, the minimum set of directions required to entirely digitize the part is computed.", "paper_title": "3D digitizing strategy planning approach based on a CAD model", "paper_id": "WOS:000245061200003"}
