However, certain locations in reality need to be modeled in three-dimensional space. This paper addresses a location problem in three-dimensional space from the application perspective. Specifically, we introduce a 3D coverage location model of Wi-Fi access points CAPS) in an indoor environment. To do this, we first incorporate a generic radio propagation assuming typical obstructions of a building into the standard coverage model, using 3D Euclidean distance characterizing radio signal penetration. The suggested model is then applied for an efficient AP placement plan in a multi-story building at a university campus. The empirical results present 3D representations of the solutions for multi-floor deployment of Wi-Fi APs. This research is expected to provide a useful modeling framework for combining facility location model with wireless network design in a 3D environment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
