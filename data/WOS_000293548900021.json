However, it tends to suffer from premature convergence when solving complex problems. This paper presents an enhanced PSO algorithm called GOPSO, which employs generalized opposition-based learning (GOBL) and Cauchy mutation to overcome this problem. GOBL can provide a faster convergence, and the Cauchy mutation with a long tail helps trapped particles escape from local optima. The proposed approach uses a similar scheme as opposition-based differential evolution (ODE) with opposition-based population initialization and generation jumping using GOBL Experiments are conducted on a comprehensive set of benchmark functions, including rotated multimodal problems and shifted large-scale problems. The results show that COPS obtains promising performance on a majority of the test problems. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
