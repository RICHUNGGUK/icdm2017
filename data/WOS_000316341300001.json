This paper describes basic decision tree issues and current research points. Of course, a single article cannot be a complete review of all algorithms (also known induction classification trees), yet we hope that the references cited will cover the major theoretical issues, guiding the researcher in interesting research directions and suggesting possible bias combinations that have yet to be explored.", "paper_title": "Decision trees: a recent overview", "paper_id": "WOS:000316341300001"}
