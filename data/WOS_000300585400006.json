The proposed skeletonization algorithm encodes a 3D shape into a topological Reeb graph using a normalized mixture distance function. We also propose a novel graph matching algorithm by comparing the relative shortest paths between the skeleton endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed topological Reeb graph as a shape signature for 3D object matching and retrieval.", "paper_title": "Reeb graph path dissimilarity for 3D object matching and retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000300585400006"}
