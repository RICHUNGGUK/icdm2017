One of the most promising models for heterogeneous computing is the accelerator model, and one of the most cost-effective, high-performance accelerators currently available is the general-purpose, graphics processing unit (GPU). Two similar programming environments have been proposed for GPUs: CUDA and OpenCL. While there are more lines of code already written in CUDA, OpenCL is an open standard that supports a broader. Hence, there is significant interest in automatic translation from CUDA to OpenCL. The contributions of this work are three-fold: (1) an extensive characterization of the subtle challenges of translation, (2) CU2CL (CUDA to OpenCL) - an implementation of a translator, and (3) an evaluation of CU2CL with respect to coverage of CUDA, translation performance, and performance of the translated applications.
