The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate the capability of 3DCEI in mapping the transmural distribution of extracellular potentials and localizing initiation sites of ventricular activation in an in vivo animal model. A control swine model (n = 10) was employed in this study. The heart-torso volume conductor model and the excitable heart model were constructed based on each animal's preoperative MR images and a priori known physiological knowledge. Body surface potential mapping and intracavitary noncontact mapping (NCM) were simultaneously conducted during acute ventricular pacing. The 3DCEI analysis was then applied on the recorded BSPMs. The estimated initiation sites were compared to the precise pacing sites; as a subset of the mapped transmural potentials by 3DCEI, the electrograms on the left ventricular endocardium were compared to the corresponding output of the NCM system. Over the 16 LV and 48 RV pacing studies, the averaged localization error was 6.1 +/- 2.3 mm, and the averaged correlation coefficient between the estimated endocardial electrograms by 3DCEI and from the NCM system was. The results demonstrate that the 3DCEI approach can well localize the sites of initiation of ectopic beats and can obtain physiologically reasonable transmural potentials in an in vivo setting during focal ectopic beats. This study suggests the feasibility of tomographic mapping of 3D ventricular electrograms from the body surface recordings.", "paper_title": "Noninvasive Mapping of Transmural Potentials During Activation in Swine Hearts From Body Surface Electrocardiograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000310148600010"}
