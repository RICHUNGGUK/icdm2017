Computational experiments compare the algorithm with the well-known GPS algorithm, as well as recently proposed methods. These show the new approach to be as good as current best algorithms. In addition, an algorithm to randomly generate matrices with known optimal bandwidth is developed and used to evaluate results. Comparisons show that the new algorithm was able to find either the optimal solution or a solution very close to the optimal for most instances. (C) 2005 Elsevier B. V.
