In this paper we focus on a recently proposed probabilistic collaborative filtering model that explicitly represents all users and items simultaneously in the model. This model class has several desirable properties, including high recommendation accuracy and principled support for group recommendations. Unfortunately, it also suffers from poor scalability. We address this issue by proposing a scalable variational Bayes learning and inference algorithm for these types of models. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly better accuracy results than other straw-men models evaluated on a collection of well-known data sets. We also demonstrate that the algorithm has a highly favorable behavior in relation to cold-start situations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
