Motivated by the ideal of induced Choquet ordered averaging operator (Yager, RR., Induced aggregation operators, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 137 (2003) 59-69.) and induced generalized OWA operator (Merigo J.M. and Gil- Lafuente, A.M, The induced generalized OWA operator, Information Sciences 179(2009) 729-741), in this paper, we have developed an induced generalized uncertain linguistic correlated averaging ( I-GULCA) operator. The prominent characteristic of the operators is that they can not only consider the importance of the elements or their ordered positions, but also reflect the correlation among the elements or their ordered positions. We have applied the I-GULCA operator to multiple attribute decision making problems for evaluating the service marketing management with uncertain linguistic information. Finally an illustrative example for evaluating the service marketing management with uncertain linguistic information has been given to show the developed method.", "paper_title": "Induced generalized uncertain linguistic correlated averaging operator and their application to multiple attribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500017"}
