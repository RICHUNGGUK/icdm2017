A 'Zigzag' model was established for mapping the design target domain and evaluation index domain. The evaluation index system of the product design scheme was confirmed and these indexes were divided into different types according to the relations of the index values and design scopes. The respective membership was described using the normal fuzzy distribution curve, and a method was provided to calculate the homologous index information amount. The process of fuzzy evaluation was given based on the information axiom. The method could be used to optimise the design and manufacturing process of product and it played an important role in improving product manufacturing quality, efficiency and resource utilisation, etc. The above method was applied in the scheme evaluation of automobile conveyance matching with the vertical rotating stereo garage.", "paper_title": "An improved fuzzy evaluation method for design schemes based on the information axiom", "paper_id": "WOS:000341924400009"}
