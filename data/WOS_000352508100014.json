This paper examines two approaches to shape representation, and their effects on accuracy in the context of cylindrical particle packing. Two discrete element method (DEM) based software packages are used. A X-ray CT scan of a packed bed provides the experimental measurements for comparison. Eight sphere-composite representations of the same cylindrical pellet were tested. Two of these gave results that quantitatively follow experimental measurements. A range of factors that in theory could affect accuracy of the simulation results are examined, including edge roundedness, surface roughness and restitutional behaviour as a function of sphere-composite representations. The conclusion is that, for packing at least, matching the object's overall shape and dimensions is not enough. Only when a high enough resolution is applied to corners and edges, could the sphere-composite approach possibly match the experimental data quantitatively. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
