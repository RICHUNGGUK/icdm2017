We developed Pock Drug) a tobliSt pocket druggability Modd that copes with uncertainties in pocket boundaries. It is based on a linear discriminant analysis from a, pool of 52 descriptors combined with a selection of the racist stable and efficient models using different pocket estimation methods. PockDrug retains the best combinations of three pocket properties which impact druggability geometry, hydrophobicity, and atomaticity. It results in an rage accuracy of 87.9% +/- 4.7% using a test set and exhibits higher accuracy (similar to 5-10%) than previous studies that used an identical apo set In conclusion, this study confirms the influence of pocket estimation on pocket druggability prediction and proposes PockDrug as a new model that nyereomes pocket estimation variability.", "paper_title": "Pock Drug: A Model for Predicting Pocket Druggability That Overcomes Pocket Estimation Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000353668600017"}
