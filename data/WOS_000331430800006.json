To this purpose a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis was carried out adopting a finite volume code, while an experimental activity was performed at a steady flow rig to validate the computational model. The comparison between numerical data and experimental measurements showed a good agreement and it demonstrated the capabilities of the proposed CFD model to predict in detail the flow field within a complex production automobile component that largely influences the efficiency and reliability of actual internal combustion engines (ICEs).
