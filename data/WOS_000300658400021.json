With increasing penetration of WFs in electric power systems, modification of current tools for evaluating and managing the system is an important issue. Determination of total transfer capability (TTC) is one such tool and is of considerable importance in the restructured power systems. TTC is used to calculate maximum power that can be transferred between areas in a reliable manner and schedule future transactions and commercial activities. In this paper, a method is proposed for TTC evaluation in the presence of WFs. In the proposed approach, Monte Carlo method is used to simulate a system state and optimal power flow is used to calculate the TTC level for each state. Risk analysis is used as a decision-making tool to determine the appropriate TTC level. IEEE reliability test system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Assessment of TTC in Power Systems Including Wind Power Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300658400021"}
