Findings based on a heuristic evaluation and usability study were applied in an iterative redesign of the site to better serve the needs of this special academic library population. Recommendations for design of Web-based services for library patrons from LIS programs are discussed, as well as implications for Web sites for special libraries within larger academic library settings.", "paper_title": "User-centered design of a web site for library and information science students: Heuristic evaluation and usability testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240667900008"}
