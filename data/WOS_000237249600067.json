Recently, the problem of outlier detection in categorical data is defined as an optimization problem and a local-search heuristic based algorithm (LSA) is presented. However, as is the case with most iterative type algorithms, the LSA algorithm is still very time-consuming on very large datasets. In this paper, we present a very fast greedy algorithm for mining outliers under the same optimization model. Experimental results on real datasets and large synthetic datasets show that: (1) Our new algorithm has comparable performance with respect to those state-of-the-art outlier detection algorithms on identifying true outliers and (2) Our algorithm can be an order of magnitude faster than LSA algorithm.", "paper_title": "A fast greedy algorithm for outlier mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600067"}
