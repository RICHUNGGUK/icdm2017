Recently, adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists have been identified as a drug target for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Consequently, there is an immediate need to develop new classes of A(2A) receptor antagonists. In the present analysis, three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) studies were performed on a series of pyrimidines, using comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA). The best prediction was obtained with a CoMFA standard model (q(2) = 0.475, r(2) = 0.977) and a CoMFA region focusing model (q(2) = 0.637, r(2) = 0.976) combined with steric and electrostatic fields. The structural insights derived from the contour maps helped to better interpret the structure-activity relationships. Also, to understand the structure-activity correlation of A(2A) receptor antagonists, we have carried out molecular docking analysis. Based on the results obtained from the present 3D-QSAR and docking studies, we have identified some key features for increasing the activity of compounds, which have been used to design new A(2A) receptor antagonists. The newly designed molecules showed high activity with the obtained models.", "paper_title": "3D-QSAR and docking studies on adenosine A(2A) receptor antagonists by the CoMFA method", "paper_id": "WOS:000360291500003"}
