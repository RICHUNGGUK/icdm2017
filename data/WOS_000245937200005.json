We extend one of the most important communication protocols of cooperating distributed (CD) grammar systems, the so-called t-derivation mode, to P systems with string-objects: if no rule can be applied to a string in a region of a P system, then the string is moved to a neighbouring region, depending on the communication mode either in exactly one direction (in or out) or in both directions. We describe the computational power of the obtained classes of P systems in comparison with families of languages generated by grammars in the Chomsky hierarchy or with CD grammar systems and formulate several problems for future research.", "paper_title": "Grammar systems versus membrane computing: The case of CD grammar systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245937200005"}
