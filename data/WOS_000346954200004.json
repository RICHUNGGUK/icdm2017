A power-law distribution of waiting times results in very general properties of a survival probability which in turn can be used to estimate eigenvalues of some fractional operators. Here, the problem of numerical estimation of the smallest eigenvalues is discussed for the two generic problems: escape from a finite interval and the Kramers problem of escape from a potential well. We discuss both how to numerically obtain the (effective) smallest eigenvalue of the problem, and how it can be used in numerically assessing other important characteristics of the processes.
