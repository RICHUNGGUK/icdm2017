In addition, the discontinuity in fluid density, viscosity and species concentration at the interface present additional numerical challenges. In this work, we extend our balanced-force volume-tracking algorithm for modeling interfacial flow with surface tension force [10] to include mass transfer. We propose a global embedded interface formulation to model the interfacial conditions of the species concentration at an interface in thermodynamic equilibrium. To verify our formulation, we perform simulations of a pure diffusion problem with species concentration discontinuity at the interface. Then we present two and three-dimensional simulations of droplets rising by buoyancy with mass transfer. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
