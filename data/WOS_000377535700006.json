It is mainly derived from two major research findings in a piece of our prior work. The first finding is that a pulse with a high contribution in a track is more likely to serve as the optimal pulse in the optimal vector pertaining to the track, and the second is that the speech quality can be well maintained at a search accuracy above 50%. In this proposal, the trade off can be tuned between the search accuracy and the search complexity so as to reach a nearly consistent speech quality. With this presented search algorithm implemented on a G.729A speech codec, it is experimentally demonstrated that either Fixed-G1-RCM (N = 3), or Fixed-2Track-RCM (M = 2, N = 3, or M = 3, N = 4) can provide a highly superior search performance relative to a global pulse replacement method (iteration = 2) and an iteration-free pulse replacement method.", "paper_title": "Efficient Statistics-Based Algebraic Codebook Search Algorithms Derived from RCM for an ACELP Speech Coder", "paper_id": "WOS:000377535700006"}
