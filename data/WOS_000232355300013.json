However, most collections were intended for retrieving newspaper articles and technical abstracts. In this paper, we describe the process of producing a test collection for patent retrieval, the NTCIR-3 Patent Retrieval Collection, which includes two years of Japanese patent applications and 31 topics produced by professional patent searchers. We also report experimental results obtained by using this collection to re-examine the effectiveness of existing retrieval models in the context of patent retrieval. The relative superiority among existing retrieval models did not significantly differ depending on the document genre, that is, patents and newspaper articles. Issues related to patent retrieval are also discussed. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
