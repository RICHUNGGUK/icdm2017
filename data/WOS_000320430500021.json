Participants were 135 college students randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions formed by a 2 x 2 factorial design with agent presence as one factor (agent vs. no-agent) and type of verbal feedback it provided as the other factor (simple feedback vs. elaborate feedback). Results revealed that participants who learned with the animated agent that delivered elaborate feedback had significantly higher scores on a learning measure compared to participants who learned with an agent that provided simple feedback. The results are interpreted from both social agency and cognitive load theoretical perspectives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
