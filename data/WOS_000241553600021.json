This approach does not require calibrated kinematic and camera models, as needed in classical visual servoing to obtain the Jacobian. Fuzzy modeling is used to identify the inverse Jacobian in the robot workspace. Robot control is achieved by means of using the inverse fuzzy models directly as the controller. Experimental results obtained in a PUMA robot performing eye-to-hand visual servoing demonstrate the validity of the approach.", "paper_title": "Uncalibrated visual servoing in 3D workspace", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600021"}
