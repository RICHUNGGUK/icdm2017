In this paper, a multi-devices composition and maintenance problem is proposed with ubiquitous service model and network model. In addition, a multi-devices composition and maintenance approach with dynamic planning is proposed to deal with this problem, consisting of service discovery, service composition, service monitor and service recover. At last, the simulation is implemented with OPNET and MATLAB and the result shows this mechanism is better applied to support complex ubiquitous service.", "paper_title": "Multi-Devices Composition and Maintenance Mechanism in Mobile Social Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000354470900003"}
