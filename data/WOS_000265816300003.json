This extensive online survey builds upon the findings of an earlier observational case study of the use Of Computer tools by a small engineering team. The case Study was conducted during the conceptual and detailed stages of the design of a first-to-world product. Four mechanisms by which CAD tools may influence the creative problem solving process were investigated: enhanced visualisation and communication, circumscribed thinking, premature design fixation and bounded ideation. The prevalence of these mechanisms was examined via a Series of questions that probed the user's mode of working, attitudes, and responses to hypothetical situations. The Survey showed good Support for the first three mechanisms and moderate support for the fourth. The results have important implications for both the users and designers of CAD tools.
