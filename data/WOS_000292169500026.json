In this paper a new chance-constrained data envelopment analysis (CCDEA) approach is proposed to assist the decision makers to determine the most appropriate third-party reverse logistics (3PL) providers in the presence of both dual-role factors and stochastic data. A numerical example demonstrates the application of the proposed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
