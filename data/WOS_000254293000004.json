A nonrigid motion can be treated as a combination of a rigid component and a nonrigid deformation. To reduce the high dimensionality of the deformable structure or shape, we estimate the probability distribution function (PDF) of the structure through random sampling, integrating an established probabilistic model. The fitting between the observations and the estimated 3D structure will be evaluated using the pooled variance estimator. The recovered structure is only available when the 2D feature points have been properly corresponded over two image frames. Applications of the proposed method to both synthetic and real image sequences are demonstrated with promising results.", "paper_title": "Recovery of nonrigid structures from 2D observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000254293000004"}
