Currently such a description is unavailable, although similar approaches have been made from the perspective of using the discrete gradient approximations as an emulator of the continuous-time system. The SS-delta-GPC algorithm is demonstrated to improve on the round-off errors encountered when using the shift-operator under conditions of fast-sampling and finite word lengths.", "paper_title": "Predictive control of fast-sampled systems using the delta-operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000267371100007"}
