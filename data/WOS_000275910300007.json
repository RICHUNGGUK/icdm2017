They can support dynamic operational infrastructures adapted to the requirements of distributed applications. As large-scale distributed systems reach enormous sizes in terms of equipment, the energy consumption issue becomes one of the main challenges for large-scale integration. Like any other large-scale distributed system, Clouds face an increasing demand in energy. In this paper, we explore the energy issue by analyzing how much energy virtualized environments cost. We provide an energy-efficient framework dedicated to Cloud architectures and we validate it through different experimentations on a modern multicore platform. We show on a realistic example that our infrastructure could save 25% of the Cloud nodes' electrical consumption.", "paper_title": "Designing and evaluating an energy efficient Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000275910300007"}
