We first obtain the membership function of the fuzzy renewal function when the amount of demand has Nakagami distribution with a fuzzy spread parameter. By using fuzzy renewal function, we obtain the fuzzy ergodic distribution of this process. Also some numerical results are obtained with the use of this membership function.", "paper_title": "Investigation of fuzzy inventory model of type (s, S) with Nakagami distributed demands", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100009"}
