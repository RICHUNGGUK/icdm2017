The formulation evaluates the state response of the system in terms of the original system matrices. The proposed solutions naturally fit systems which are most described conveniently by matrix processes. Its formulation uses a compact notation referred to as double matrix exponential functions, which is an extension of normal matrix exponential function. It is a straightforward extension of the solutions for ordinary vector linear systems studied in the past several decades and will play an important role in the design of matrix linear systems using original system matrices.", "paper_title": "Closed form solutions for matrix linear systems using double matrix exponential functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262632300010"}
