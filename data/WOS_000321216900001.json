In the existing literature, however, there is no complete exact analysis for EDF scheduling when both resource sharing and release jitter are considered. Since resource sharing and release jitter are important characteristics of embedded real-time systems, a solid theoretical foundation should be provided for EDF scheduled systems. In this paper, we extend traditional processor demand analysis to let arbitrary deadline real-time tasks share non-preemptable resources and suffer release jitter. A complete and exact schedulability analysis for EDF scheduled systems is provided. This analysis is incorporated into QPA (Quick Processor-demand Analysis) which provides an efficient implementation of the exact test.", "paper_title": "Schedulability Analysis of EDF-Scheduled Embedded Real-Time Systems with Resource Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000321216900001"}
