The conventional method of doing this is to use a counter. We show that sequences generated by linear feedback shift registers (LFSRs) can be tailored to suit the appropriate algorithms. For hardware implementation, this reduces both time and chip area. As a result, we are able to suggest improvements to the design of DES Cracker built by the Electronic Frontier Foundation in 1998; provide an efficient strategy for generating start points in time-memory trade/off attacks, and present an improved parallel hardware implementation of a variant of the counter mode of operation of a block cipher.", "paper_title": "Application of LFSRs for parallel sequence generation in cryptologic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300047"}
