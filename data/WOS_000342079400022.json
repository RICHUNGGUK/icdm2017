In this paper a three amplifier state variable filter is used as circuit under test (CUT) and, a hybrid neural network is proposed for soft fault diagnosis of the CUT. Genetic algorithm (GA) has the powerful ability of searching the global optimal solution, and back propagation (BP) algorithm has the feature of rapid convergence on the local optima. The hybrid of two algorithm will improve the evolving speed of neural network. GA-BP scheme adopts GA to search the optimal combination of weights in the solution space, and then uses BP algorithm to obtain the accurate optimal solution quickly. Experiment results show that the proposed GA-BP scheme is more efficient and effective than BP algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fault detection in analogue circuits using hybrid evolutionary algorithm and neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000342079400022"}
