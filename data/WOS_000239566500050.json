The problem is important in developing effective pose classification as wells as in developing models of human attention. We estimate the human pose effort using two kinds of body constraints - skeletal constraints and gravitational constraints. The extracted features are combined together using SVM regression to estimate the pose effort. We tested our algorithm on 55 poses with different annotated efforts with excellent results. Our user studies additionally validate our approach.", "paper_title": "Estimating the physical effort of human poses", "paper_id": "WOS:000239566500050"}
