Based on given user preferences and navigation behavior, the Web-based content returns the requested personalized result. The main scope of this paper is to present the various techniques employed by such systems with regard to extraction of user profiles and to introduce a comprehensive user profilethat includes user perceptual preference characteristics. It further analyzes the main intrinsic user characteristics such as visual, cognitive and emotional-processing parameters that are incorporated as well as the 'traditional' user profile characteristics that together tend to give the most optimized, adapted and personalized outcome. It finally presents a Web adaptation and personalization system that implements the proposed comprehensive user profile as well as the initial evaluation results.", "paper_title": "Realizing Comprehensive User Profile as the Core Element of Adaptive and Personalized Communication Environments and Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000271903900003"}
