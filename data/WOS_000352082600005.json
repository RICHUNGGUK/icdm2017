Czyzowicz et al. conjectured that the maximum length of the fence that can be patrolled is , which is achieved by the simple strategy where each agent moves back and forth in a segment of length . We disprove this conjecture by a counterexample involving agents. We also show that the conjecture is true for .", "paper_title": "Fence patrolling by mobile agents with distinct speeds", "paper_id": "WOS:000352082600005"}
