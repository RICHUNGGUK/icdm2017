Due to this property, the RfLPP is combined with the Hough transform for chirp signal detection in the parameter domain. Simulations of the RfLPP-Hough transform are given for chirp signal detection in white Gaussian noise and impulsive noise, with comparisons to the pseudo-Wigner-Hough transform (PWHT), the local polynomial periodogram (LPP)-Hough transform (LHT), and the reassigned LPP-Hough transform. It shows that the RfLPP-Hough transform can provide better performance with reduced computation time and is a proper candidate for chirp signal detection.", "paper_title": "RfLPP-Hough Transform for Chirp Signal Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000365243700017"}
