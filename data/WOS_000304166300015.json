In adaptive LDPC codes, clients inform the content download server of the losses they are experiencing. Using this information, the server makes forward error correction (FEC) parity symbols available to the client at an optimum code rate. This paper presents an analytical model of the proposed adaptive LDPC codes. The model is validated through measurements realized with an application prototype. In addition, results show the performance of these codes in different scenarios, compared to the performance of non-adaptive AL-FEC, optimum LDPC AL-FEC codes, and an almost ideal rateless code. Adaptive LDPC AL-FEC codes achieve download times similar to almost ideal rateless codes with less coding complexity, at the expense of an interaction channel between server and clients.", "paper_title": "Analysis and Evaluation of Adaptive LDPC AL-FEC Codes for Content Download Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000304166300015"}
