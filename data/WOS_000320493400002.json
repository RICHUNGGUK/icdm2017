Drawing upon the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, this study identifies the key issues in collaborative deployment of FOSS for humanitarian relief operations. The research further elaborates the key research issues by adopting a case study approach in which qualitative data were gathered from key informants from both private and public sectors. The results suggest that task-technology fit, expertise management, and inter-organizational relationship management play critical roles in humanitarian FOSS deployment.
