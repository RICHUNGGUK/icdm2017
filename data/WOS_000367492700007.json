Statistical techniques are useful tools to help computer architects to predict performance of complex processors. In this study, these methods are utilized to build a model which predicts the GPU performance efficiently. The design space of targeted Fermi GPU has more than 8 million points which cause exploring this huge design space a challenging process. In order to build an accurate model, we propose a two-tier algorithm in our algorithm which builds a multiple linear regression model from a small set of simulated data. In this algorithm the Plackett Burman design is used to find the key parameters of the GPU, and further simulations are guided by a fractional factorial design for the most important parameters. Our algorithm is able to construct a GPU performance predictor which can predict the performance of any point in the design space with an average prediction error between 1% and 5% for different benchmark applications. In addition, in comparison to other methods which need a large number of sampling points, the accuracy in our method is achieved by only sampling between 0.0003% and 0.0015% of the full design space.
