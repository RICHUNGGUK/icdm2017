We argue that email lists can provide a valuable students-instructor communication channel and describe the process of setting up and managing such lists. A case study of email messages exchanged in an introductory operations research course is also included. The case illustrates how a 'strategic' use of email leads to a richer learning experience, by providing an extra medium for communication, and offers a valuable feedback database that can, among other things, be used to improve future editions of a course.
