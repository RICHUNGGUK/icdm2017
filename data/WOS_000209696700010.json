In this letter, we propose a two-phase power allocation algorithm for an MBSFN. The algorithm first decides ratios for power allocation among the BSs for each subchannel (CH) of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, and then determines the total power of each CH such that the total utility is maximized, where the utilities can be designed on the basis of system objectives.", "paper_title": "A Power Allocation Algorithm for Maximizing Total Utility over an MBSFN", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700010"}
