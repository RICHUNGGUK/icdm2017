In this paper, we proposed a modified DC index based on improved phase- rectified signal averaging (PRSA) algorithm. Sinusoidal analysis is applied to elucidate the rationality of the improved PRSA. Then the validity of the modified DC is verified by the databases of chronic heart failure (CHF) patients and control group. Both the conventional and modified DCs are significantly lower in CHF patients than that in the control group (2.12 +/- 2.98 vs. 6.34 +/- 1.92 ms, P < 0.0001 and 5.45 +/- 2.48 vs. 10.64 +/- 1.76 ms, P < 0.0001, respectively). And the modified DC provides higher accuracy in distinguishing CHF than the conventional one (87.4 vs. 82.1%). The results indicate that the suggested technique enhances the performance of PRSA and improves the efficiency of DC in assessing ANS activity in CHF patients.", "paper_title": "Enhancing the deceleration capacity index of heart rate by modified-phase-rectified signal averaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000276630500011"}
