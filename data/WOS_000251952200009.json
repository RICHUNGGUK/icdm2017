Face annotation usually requires many training data labeled by hand in order to build effective classifiers. This is particularly challenging when annotating faces on large-scale collections of media data, in which huge labeling efforts would be very expensive. As a result, traditional supervised face annotation methods often suffer from insufficient training data. To attack this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel Transductive Kernel Fisher Discriminant (TKFD) scheme for face annotation, which outperforms traditional supervised annotation methods with few training data. I he main idea of our approach is to solve the Fisher's discriminant using deformed kernels incorporating the information of both labeled and unlabeled data. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three types of multimedia testbeds: the FRGC benchmark face dataset, the Yahoo! web image collection, and the TRECVID video data collection. The experimental results show that our TKFD algorithm is more effective than traditional supervised approaches, especially when there are very few training data.", "paper_title": "Face annotation using Transductive Kernel Fisher Discriminant", "paper_id": "WOS:000251952200009"}
