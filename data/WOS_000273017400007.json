The Bcl-2 inhibitors BH31-1 and BH31-2 were used as lead compounds to find possible Bcl-2 or Bcl-X(L) inhibitors by using computer-assisted screening with our in-house database, containing more than four million commercially available molecules. Identified compounds were further investigated regarding their possible application as a drug. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
