The optimized geometries reveal that the most stable isomers have 3D structures at n = 3, 5, 7, 8, and 9. Here, the relative stabilities were investigated in terms of the averaged atomic binding energies, fragmentation energies and second-order difference of energies. The results show that the planar Be2Au4 structure is the most stable structure for Be2Au (n) clusters. The HOMO-LUMO gap, vertical ionization potential, vertical electron affinity and chemical hardness exhibit a pronounced even-odd alternating phenomenon. In addition, charge transfer and natural electron configuration were analyzed and compared.", "paper_title": "Ab initio calculation of the geometries, stabilities, and electronic properties for the bimetallic Be2Au (n) (n=1-9) clusters: comparison with pure gold clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000298756500026"}
