Current concepts foster either a dynamic mapping that directs content requests to a nearby copy, or an immediate routing on content identifiers. In this paper, we evaluate in practical experiments the performance of content routing, which we analyze with a focus on conceptual aspects. Our findings indicate that the performance of the content distribution system is threatened by a heavy management of states that arise from the strong coupling of the control to the data plane in the underlying routing infrastructure.", "paper_title": "Bulk of Interest: Performance Measurement of Content-Centric Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000309217600020"}
