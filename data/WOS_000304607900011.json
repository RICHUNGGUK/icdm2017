Hence, how to determine the optimal number and positions of gateways, i.e., gateway deployment, is one of the most important and challenging topics in practical and theoretical research on designing a WMN. Although several approaches have been proposed to address this problem, few of them take load balancing and interference minimization into account. In this paper, we study the Load-balancing and Interference-minimization Gateway Deployment Problem (LIGDP), which aims to achieve four objectives, i.e. minimizing deployment cost, minimizing MR-GW path length, balancing gateway load and minimizing link interference. We formulate it as a multi-objective integer linear program (ILP) issue first, and then propose an efficient gateway deployment approach, called LIGDP Heuristic. The approach joints two heuristic algorithms, i.e., MSC-based location algorithm (MLA) and load-aware and interference-aware association algorithm (LIAA), to determine gateway positions and construct GW-rooted trees. Simulation results not only show that the trade-off between deployment cost and network performance can be achieved by adjusting R-hop, GW throughput and MR throughput constraints, but also demonstrate that, compared with other existing approaches, LIGDP Heuristic performs better on MR-GW path, load balancing and interference minimization without deploying more gateways.", "paper_title": "Optimization of Gateway Deployment with Load Balancing and Interference Minimization in Wireless Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000304607900011"}
