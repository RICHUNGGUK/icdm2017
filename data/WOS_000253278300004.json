However, in many cases, information such as a company's internal marketing policy is not available. This study proposes a negative exponential growth curve model that incorporates unobservable time-varying covariates by reversely estimating the unknown covariates. The proposed approach is then applied to technological forecasting of high-speed Internet access services provided by a telecommunication corporation in Korea. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
