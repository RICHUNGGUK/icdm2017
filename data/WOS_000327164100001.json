In order to produce an optimal design of such devices, we consider a methodology combining simulated annealing optimization and lattice Boltzmann simulations. Our results surpass, in terms of stent efficiency, those obtained in the recent literature with an other optimization method. Although our approach is still in 2D, it demonstrates the potential of the method. We give some hint on how the 3D cases can be investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
