Using cell models with catalytic reaction networks, we confirmed that the power-law distribution in abundances of chemicals emerges by the selection of cells with higher growth speeds, as suggested in our previous study. Through the further evolution, this inhomogeneity in chemical abundances is shown to be embedded in the distribution of links, leading to the power-law distribution. These findings provide novel insights into the nature of network evolution in living cells.", "paper_title": "Emergence of two power-laws in evolution of biochemical network; Embedding abundance distribution into topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807500009"}
