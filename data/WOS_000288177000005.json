However, the constraint of the tamper ratio may be too stringent. This paper proposes a neighborhood characteristic based detection model for statistical fragile watermarking to lift the constraints of the tampered area from 4% to 14% of the host image. The neighborhood characteristic is used to effectively decrease the probability of false rejection, while the low probability of false acceptance is guaranteed by selecting proper threshold. The tamper detection performance of the proposed detection model is analytical analyzed in the different conditions. Analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the neighborhood characteristic based detection model effectively reduce the total number of false decisions and detect the tampered pixels with high probability.", "paper_title": "A neighborhood-characteristic-based detection model for statistical fragile watermarking with localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000288177000005"}
