Transmitter preprocessing at the mobile station is formulated by singular value decomposition (SVD) of only the individual user's channel state information (CSI) while post-processing exploits all the users' CSI using BS cooperation. Our simulations show that this approach completely removes CCI and also outperforms classical zero-forcing multi-user detection, which has about the same detection complexity. Further, the results show that our system, coupled with the optimal 'water-filling' strategy for power allocation, results in higher capacity than the maximum signal-to-noise ratio strategy. Furthermore, SVD-based MUTP outperforms dirty paper coding and Tomlinson-Harashima precoding in terms of achievable symbol error rate. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
