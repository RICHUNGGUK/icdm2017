The need for protection and improvement of the mechanical characteristics of the surface of engineering parts can be to some extent satisfied by coatings. Coatings are considered as an excellent solution when resistance to corrosion, oxidation or low friction is demanded, but due the complexity of selecting the appropriate one, engineers often avoid them. The need for simultaneous consideration of qualitative and quantitative properties, render the use of classic material selection theories inadequate. An expert system for coating selection is presented in this paper, which can handle both qualitative and quantitative variables. The mathematical model used combines the multi-criteria decision making theories (MCDM) together with the fuzzy sets theory. The \"Max-Min set\" method is applied to calculate the ordering value of the alternatives while the TOPSIS method is used to rank them. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the method. Finally, the process presented can be easily computerized, to create the relative software.
