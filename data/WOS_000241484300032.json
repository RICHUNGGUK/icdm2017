We propose a cellular automata model to investigate the possibility that speciation proceeds in sympatry, focusing on the importance of the structure of the landscape on the likelihood of speciation. The conditions for speciation are shown to be limited whatever the landscape being considered, although habitat structure best favours the emergence of new species.", "paper_title": "A cellular automata model for adaptive sympatric speciation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241484300032"}
