Generally speaking, one has to use a multi-axis CMM and follow the appropriately planned measuring paths to accomplish the task of precision measurement of the machined part. This article discusses the methodology of using a 3D geometric model of a turbine blade as the basis to generate interference-free measuring paths that are suitable for implementing on a CMM with three translational axes and two rotational axes. Through the use of the methodology proposed in this research, the goal of multi-axis precision inspection for any geometric design of turbine blade can be achieved.", "paper_title": "Automatic inspection of turbine blades using 5-axis coordinate measurement machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000284634500002"}
