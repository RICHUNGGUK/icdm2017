We find out that the parameter space A = {(epsilon, tau)vertical bar 0 < tau < 1, 0 < epsilon < 1) can be partitioned into two regions A(1), A(2) in such a way that the network will have apparently different firing properties on them. In A(1), the firing behavior is relatively simple for rigorous analysis, while it is more complicated on A(2). First, we show that the delay tau is a lower bound for the inter-spike intervals of each oscillator on A(1). Using this lower bound, three important properties of the firing on A(1) are obtained: (a) Any complete synchronized solution is a solution with period 1; (b) If two oscillators fire at same time, and they have the same coupling strength from each other and from other oscillators, then, they will be synchronized forever; (c) The firing order of two oscillators is always preserved. However, examples can be provided to show that these properties do not hold for the region A(2). Yet, numerical simulation still reveals some interesting phenomenon on A(2): (a) Completely synchronized solutions are prevalent; (b) Given (tau, epsilon) is an element of A(2), the fraction of the initial values that will lead to complete synchronization will converge along with increasing network size.
