Canny's edge detection and the Hough transform are used to find the iris/pupil boundary and a simple thresholding method is employed for eyelash detection. The Gabor wavelet technique is deployed in order to extract the deterministic features in the transformed iris of a person in the form of template, The extracted iris features are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Our results indicate that the performance of SVM as a classifier is far better than the performance of a classifier based on the artificial neural network.", "paper_title": "Iris recognition with support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300065"}
