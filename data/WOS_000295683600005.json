It uses a novel synchronous multicast and broadcast transmission mechanism to achieve macro diversity. With the newly introduced synchronous delivery constraint, the multicast data delivery algorithm should be designed differently to enhance system performance. This paper provides Multi-Rate Selection Algorithm (MRSA) for multicast and broadcast (MBS) data delivery. It could reduce the data distribution delay from the BS to all the RSs. Besides, we also propose the path selection algorithm to further improve the effectiveness of MRSA. Our simulation results show that using MRSA with our shortest-path path selection algorithm, the delay for data delivery in 802.16j MBS system could be greatly reduced. The proposed scheme could achieve the performance closed to the optimal solutions. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first research work to investigate the IEEE 802.16j multicast and broadcast problem.", "paper_title": "Synchronous multicast and broadcast service in multi-rate IEEE 802.16j WiMAX relay network", "paper_id": "WOS:000295683600005"}
