OR has gained a lot of attention from the research communities for its ability to increase the performance of wireless networks. It benefits from the broadcast characteristic of wireless mediums to improve network performance. The basic function of OR is its ability to overhear the transmitted packet and to coordinate among relaying nodes. In OR, a candidate set is a potential group of nodes that is selected as the next-hop forwarders. Hence, each node in OR can use different potential paths to send packets toward the destination. Any of the candidates of a node that have received the transmitted packet may forward it. The decision of choosing the next forwarder is made by coordination between candidates that have successfully received the transmitted packet. In OR, by using a dynamic relay node to forward the packet, the transmission reliability and network throughput can be increased. In this article, we explain the fundamental idea of OR and its important issues by providing some examples. We then categorize each of the important issues and explain them in detail. Furthermore, we illustrate different protocols from each category and compare their benefits and drawbacks. Finally, some potential directions for future research in OR is explained.", "paper_title": "Opportunistic Routing in Wireless Networks: Models, Algorithms, and Classifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000351437800008"}
