As such, dirigibles are well suited for surveillance and surveyance missions such as rescue and aid operations after disasters. This paper reviews hybrid dirigible UAV design considerations, then presents a novel hybrid power plant design. The hybrid power plant design consists of a 2-stroke 4cc glow engine in-line with a brushless DC motor/ generator and variable pitch propeller. The experimental results have shown that the hybrid power plant is capable of producing a power output of 148.4 W.", "paper_title": "Experimental Testing of a Hybrid Power Plant for a Dirigible UAV", "paper_id": "WOS:000312583500008"}
