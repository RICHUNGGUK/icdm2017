SKRR obtains the sparseness by backward deletion feature selection procedure that recursively removes the feature with the smallest leave-one-out score until the stop criterion is satisfied. Besides good generalization performance, the most compelling property of SKRR is rather sparse, and moreover, the kernel function needs not to be positive definite. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark data sets validate the feasibility and validity of SKRR.", "paper_title": "Sparse kernel ridge regression using backward deletion", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500040"}
