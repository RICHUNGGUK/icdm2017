In addition to the straightforward application of the active form of the quantum mechanical rotation operator, we introduce two methods using a passive position-space rotation followed by an active spin-space rotation, one after variation and the other before variation. These methods can be used to initialize reactions involving deformed nuclei where a particular alignment of the deformed nuclei with respect to the collision axis is desired. We show that doing the rotation before the variation is the most efficient way of generating such initial states. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
