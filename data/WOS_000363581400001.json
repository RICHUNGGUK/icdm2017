Following this paradigm, the purpose of this paper is to support and optimize the signaling aggregation and barring of M2M services based on cellular network. With LTE network being the example access network, a congestion-aware signaling aggregation and barring scheme is designed considering the various requirements of M2M services and the congestion situation in the network entity. Theoretical analysis and experimental simulations show that this scheme can improve the system efficiency and greatly alleviate the signaling congestion, especially for the bursty M2M service.", "paper_title": "Congestion-Aware Signaling Aggregation and Barring Scheme for LTE Based Machine-to-Machine Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000363581400001"}
