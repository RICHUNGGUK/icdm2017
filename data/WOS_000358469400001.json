Since there are multiple SPs built upon the same Internet Service Provider (ISP), their overlays are co-existing and may interfere with each other. The selfishness of overlay may lead to sub-optimal performance and traffic arrangement dilemma for overlays. To optimize the performance of overlays and maximize the benefit of SPs, we propose a cooperative overlay optimization approach, in which overlays can form coalitions freely for the purpose of cooperation. This approach performs a two-step process: the coalition optimization process and the coalition formation process. Several models are applied to describe these two processes. The overlay routing problem of a coalition, the revenue allocation problem, and the convergence problem of coalition formation are analyzed and solved. In the coalition formation process, the relationship between co-existing overlays is also analyzed. Simulations are performed to evaluate our approach, which is proved to be effective on improving the performance and balancing the fairness of co-existing overlays. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
