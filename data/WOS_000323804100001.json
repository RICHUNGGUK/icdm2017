During the last three decades, numerous techniques have been developed to meet these challenges. The goal of this paper is to categorize and evaluate these algorithms in a comprehensive way. We focus on the overall difficulties and challenges in real-life scenarios, and present a detailed review of prominent algorithms from the perspective of learning generalizable, flexible and efficient statistical eye models from a small number of training images. In addition, we organize the discussion of the global aspects of eye localization in uncontrolled environments, towards the development of a robust eye localization system. This paper concludes with several promising directions for future research. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
