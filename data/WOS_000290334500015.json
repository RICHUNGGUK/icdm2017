The MEMPACK prediction server allows users to submit a transmembrane protein sequence and returns transmembrane topology, lipid exposure, residue contacts, helix-helix interactions and helical packing arrangement predictions in both plain text and graphical formats using a number of novel machine learning-based algorithms.", "paper_title": "The MEMPACK alpha-helical transmembrane protein structure prediction server", "paper_id": "WOS:000290334500015"}
