Catalano, Fiore and Warinschi proposed a generalized notion called adaptive pseudo-free groups, and showed that the RSA group Z(N)(X) is adaptive pseudo-free with some specific parametric distribution under the strong RSA assumption. In this paper, we develop an alternative parametric distribution and show that the RSA group Z(N)(X) is adaptive pseudo-free with the parametric distribution under the RSA assumption rather than the strong RSA assumption.", "paper_title": "The RSA Group Is Adaptive Pseudo-Free under the RSA Assumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000330553400024"}
