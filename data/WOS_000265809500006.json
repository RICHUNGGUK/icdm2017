Remote sensing data and geographic information system were used to locate potential zones for groundwater in the Musi basin. Various maps (i.e., base, hydrogeomorphological, geological, structural, drainage, slope, land use/land cover and groundwater prospect zones) were prepared using the remote sensing data along with the existing maps. The groundwater availability of the basin is qualitatively classified into different classes (i.e., very good, good, moderate, poor and nil) based on its hydrogeomorphological conditions. The land use/land cover map was prepared for the Kharif season using a digital classification technique with the limited ground truth for mapping irrigated areas in the Musi basin. The alluvial plain in filled valley, flood plain and deeply buried pediplain were successfully delineated and shown as the prospective zones of groundwater. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
