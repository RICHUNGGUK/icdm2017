This paper discusses topology optimization formulations for creating designs that perform robustly under spatial variations for acoustic cavity problems. For several structural problems, robust topology optimization methods have already proven their worth. However, it is shown that direct application of such methods is not suitable for the acoustic problem under consideration. A new double filter approach is suggested which makes robust optimization for spatial variations possible. Its effect and limitations are discussed. In addition, a known explicit penalization approach is considered for comparison. For near-uniform spatial variations it is shown that highly robust designs can be obtained using the double filter approach. It is finally demonstrated that taking non-uniform variations into account further improves the robustness of the designs.", "paper_title": "Creating geometrically robust designs for highly sensitive problems using topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000362583800008"}
