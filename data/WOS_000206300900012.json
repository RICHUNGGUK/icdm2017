The number of times a particular slave is polled by its master in succession is dependent on the assigned priority. The slaves know the polling sequence in advance and go to a power-saving mode during the intervening time interval. For bridge scheduling, a bridge is assigned to each piconet for a quantum of time that is determined by the inter-piconet traffic. We compare performance of the proposed scheme with other existing methods by simulation studies.", "paper_title": "A power-aware master and bridge scheduling scheme for bluetooth scatternets", "paper_id": "WOS:000206300900012"}
