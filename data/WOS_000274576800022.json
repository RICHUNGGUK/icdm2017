In particular, we focus on aspects of implementing a full-featured FDTD package that go beyond standard textbook descriptions of the algorithm, or ways in which Meep differs from typical FDTD implementations. These include pervasive interpolation and accurate modeling of subpixel features, advanced signal processing, support for nonlinear materials via Pade approximants, and flexible scripting capabilities.", "paper_title": "MEEP: A flexible free-software package for electromagnetic simulations by the FDTD method", "paper_id": "WOS:000274576800022"}
