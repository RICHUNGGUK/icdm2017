A tractable relaxation for CP matrices is provided by the cone of Doubly Nonnegative (DNN) matrices; that is, matrices that are both positive semidefinite and componentwise nonnegative. A natural problem in the optimization setting is then to separate a given DNN but non-CP matrix from the cone of CP matrices. We describe two different constructions for such a separation that apply to 5 x 5 matrices that are DNN but non-CP. We also describe a generalization that applies to larger DNN but non-CP matrices having block structure. Computational results illustrate the applicability of these separation procedures to generate improved bounds on difficult problems.", "paper_title": "Separating doubly nonnegative and completely positive matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000313797100006"}
