The geometry of the inlet is similar to the one used by Anderson and Wong for experimental investigation for Mach 3 flow. The computations are capable of simulating the start-up problems associated with the inlet. The critical back pressure for the successful operation of the inlet is computed. The effect of inlet back pressure on the total pressure recovery and the flow distortion level is analysed. Contrary to the popular belief, it is found that in addition to the throat to inlet capture area ratio, the ramp geometry close to the throat plays an important role in the start-up dynamics. It is demonstrated via simulations that, everything else being same, the geometries of ramp upstream of the throat that are associated with a curvature higher than a certain threshold, result in unstarting the intake.
