This prototype software was developed to simplify the industrial implementation and testing of differential-geometric, model-based controllers on lumped-parameter processes. DGMBC has a user-friendly interface that allows a user to enter process model equations and parameters easily. The user interface was developed using Visual Basic and linked to MATHEMATICA using MathLink. The user enters the process model (set of ordinary differential equations), and the software generates an analytical model-based controller, if an analytical solution exists. The resulting analytical model-based controller (set of ordinary differential and algebraic equations) can be in FORTRAN, C, or MATLAB format. DGMBC can also simulate the closed-loop process responses. The application and implementation of DGMBC 1.0 are shown using three chemical and biochemical process examples with varying levels of complexity. An analytical model-based controller is designed for each of the processes, and simulation results showing the closed-loop process responses are presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
