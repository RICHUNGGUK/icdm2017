The vertex set of a Lucas cube Lambda(n) is the set of all binary strings of length n without consecutive l's and 1 in the first and the last bit. Two vertices of the Lucas cube are adjacent if their strings differ in exactly one bit. Carbon nanotubes were discovered 20 years ago and their unique structure explains their unusual properties such as conductivity and strength. Our interest is in a class of carbon nanotubes, called cyclic polyphenanthrenes. The resonance graph of an aromatic hydrocarbon reflects the structure of its perfect matchings (t.i. Kekule structures). The main result of this paper is the following: Lucas cubes are the nontrivial component of the resonance graphs of cyclic polyphenanthrenes. This result has some interesting applications regarding hamiltonicity and observability of the resonance graph of the cyclic polyphenanthrene.", "paper_title": "Lucas Cubes and Resonance Graphs of Cyclic Polyphenanthrenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307149200004"}
