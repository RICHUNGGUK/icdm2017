There are several algorithms for solving the popular and computationally expensive task of association rule mining from a TDB. In this paper we propose a data structure which consists of a directed graph D (loops and multiple arcs are permitted) and a system of directed paths in D to represent a TDB. We give efficient algorithms for generating the data structure, for extracting frequent patterns and for association rule mining. We also propose several graph theoretic parameters which lead to a better understanding of the system.", "paper_title": "Association Rule Mining using Path Systems in Directed Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000327050700001"}
