In addition to the authentication time estimation, once a document is rejected by an authenticator after authentication, the applicant might sometimes fail to exactly recognize the major rejection reasons and modification guides. Focusing on the above issues related to document authentication, this research proposes algorithms, namely the determination of document authentication time and the recommendation of document paragraph modification, to determine the document authentication information to support electronic document authentication. In addition to the proposed algorithms, a web-based document authentication information management system is developed and used to demonstrate feasibility of the proposed algorithms applied in CMP patent document authentication. Whether in providing authentication information to users or in reusing the information generated from the authentication processes, the document authentication information management system developed in this study can enhance the performance of the traditional approaches for document authentication.
