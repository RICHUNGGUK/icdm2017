An accurate timing analysis can be achieved by finding input vectors that simultaneously satisfy both functional and temporal requirements. The problem of finding such input vectors can be modeled as a Boolean equation called the timed characteristic function (TCF). Despite the usefulness of the TCF, traditional TCF construction and solving is slow for large circuits. In this paper, we present a more efficient way to use the TCF. On average, our method is much faster than other most recent works.", "paper_title": "Efficient Boolean Characteristic Function for Timed Automatic Test Pattern Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263768100010"}
