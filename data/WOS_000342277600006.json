We present two automatic image registration algorithms using the similarity measure Linear Correlation of Linear Combination (LC2) to align either freehand US slices or US volumes with MRI images. Both approaches allow an automatic and robust registration, while the three dimensional method yields a significantly improved percentage of optimally aligned registrations for randomly chosen clinically relevant initializations. This study presents a detailed description of the methodology and an extensive evaluation showing an accuracy of 2.51 mm, precision of 0.85 mm and capture range of 15 mm (>95% convergence) using 14 clinical neurosurgical cases.
