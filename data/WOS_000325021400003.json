In spite of the importance of this NP-hard problem, no local search approach had been proposed so far for tackling it. Building on a property of acyclic graphs, we suggest in this paper a new representation of the solutions of the FVSP (feedback sets). Thanks to this solution representation, we are able to design a local transformation (equivalent to a neighborhood) that changes a feedback set into a new one. Based on this neighborhood, we have developed a simulated annealing algorithm for the FVSP. Our experiments show that our algorithm outperforms the best existing heuristic, namely the greedy adaptive search procedure by Pardalos et al.", "paper_title": "Applying local search to the feedback vertex set problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000325021400003"}
