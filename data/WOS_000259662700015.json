Since the population reliability R-j of the subsystem P-j (j = 1, 2,..., n) is unknown, if we use the point estimate (R) over bar (j) to estimate R-j from the statistical data in the past, we don't know the probability of the error (R) over bar (j) - R-j. Moreover, the reliability of the system may fluctuate around the point estimate (R) over bar (j). during a time interval. It follows that to use the point estimate (R) over bar (j) to estimate the population reliability Rj is not suitable for the real cases. Therefore, it is more desirable to use the statistical confidence interval. Moreover, the probability of the error (R) over bar (j) - R-j can also be solved. In this paper, we use the statistical confidence interval instead of the point estimate. We transfer the statistical confidence interval into the triangular fuzzy number. Through these triangular fuzzy numbers, we consider the fuzzy reliability system. We fuzzify the reliability of both the serial and parallel systems. Through defuzzifying the fuzzy reliability using the signed distance method; we get a fuzzy estimate of reliability in the two systems.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy system reliability analysis using triangular fuzzy numbers based on statistical data", "paper_id": "WOS:000259662700015"}
