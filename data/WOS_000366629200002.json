Replacing the aryl group of PhN5 by six-member heterocycle weakens pentazole ring. Compared to PhN5, title molecules have longer N-N bonds and lower activation energy (E-a,E-1) needed for the N-5 ring breaking. E-a,E-1 decreases with the increasing number of nitrogen atoms of heterocycle. The ortho nitrogen of heterocycle most obviously lowers the stability of pentazole. The central C-N bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of title molecules are lower than that of PhN5. For the molecule with 0 similar to 1 orthonitrogen, H rearrangement happens during the central C-N bond breaking. The energy (E-a,E-2) required for H rearrangement is considerably smaller than the corresponding BDE. Delta E-a,E-2 (E-a, (2(PhN5)) - E-a,E-2=7.5 similar to 35.7 kJ mol(-1)) is larger than Delta E-a,E-1 (E-a,E-2(PhN5) - E-a,E-2=4.6 similar to 15.5 kJ mol(-1)), while Delta E-a,E-2/E-a,E-2(PhN5) (2 similar to 9.5 %) is smaller than Delta E-a,E-1/E-a,E-1(PhN5) (4.4 similar to 15.0 %). The larger Delta E-a,E-1/E-a,E-1(PhN5) suggests that title molecules can not be the better N-5(-) than PhN5.", "paper_title": "Theoretical investigations on stability of pyridylpentazoles, pyridazylpentazoles, triazinylpentazoles, tetrazinylpentazoles, and pentazinylpentazole searching for a replacement of phenylpentazole as N-5(-) source", "paper_id": "WOS:000366629200002"}
