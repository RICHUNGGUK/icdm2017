The main goal is to give a suitable formulation of mathematical model, which describes the changes of stresses in TMJ incurred after the surgery The TMJ is a complex, sensitive and highly mobile joint which works bilaterally so each side influences the contralateral joint and because of this the distribution of the stresses is changed in the healthy joint as well. Detailed knowledge about function these are necessary for clinical application of temporomandibular joint prosthesis and also help us estimate the lifetime of the prosthesis a possibilities of alteration in the contra lateral joint components. The geometry for the 3D models is taken from the CT scan date and its numerical solution is based on the theory of semi-coercive unilateral contact problems in linear elasticity. This article provides medical part with case report, discretion of treatment, than the methods of mathematical modeling and his possibilities are described and finally results are reported.
