These devices have great potential for educational applications, especially when integrated with disparate technologies, such as environmental sensors, microscopes, and robotics. In this work, we present the development of an iDevice application and communication hardware for interacting with a miniature robotic fish. The application includes a user interface for controlling the robot's motion, a detailed tutorial featuring an animated fish, and a link to information about scientific research using the robot. This platform has been field-tested with children in a broad age range and refined based on their feedback. The application has been found to be significantly easier to use than a traditional joystick controller by a survey of middle school children. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
