In particular, we consider a four-node cognitive scenario where the secondary receiver is treated as a potential eavesdropper with respect to the primary transmission. The cognitive transmitter should ensure that the primary message is not leaked to the secondary user by using cooperative jamming. We investigate the optimal power allocation and power splitting at the secondary transmitter for our cognitive model to maximize the secondary energy efficiency (EE) under secrecy constraints. We formulate and analyze an important EE Stackelberg game between the two transmitters aiming at maximizing their utilities. We illustrate the analytical results through our geometrical model, highlighting the EE performance of the system and the impact of the Stackelberg game.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficiency Analysis of Cooperative Jamming in Cognitive Radio Networks With Secrecy Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000377307900024"}
