The objective of this study is to investigate the response of a single pile subjected to unidirectional and multidirectional lateral loadings using the finite element analysis program ABAQUS. A simplified version of the state-dependent dilatancy model was implemented and embedded into the program to simulate the behavior of the soil around the pile. The results of the analyses indicate that the lateral resistance of the pile along one horizontal direction under multidirectional loading is lower than that under unidirectional loading. The degree of reduction of the resistance increases with the aspect ratio of the displacement path at the pile head. The directions of the force increment vector and the displacement increment vector are generally non-coaxial under multidirectional loading. The soil-pile interaction and soil responses under multidirectional loading are also significantly different than those under unidirectional loading. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
