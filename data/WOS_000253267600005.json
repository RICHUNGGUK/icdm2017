First, by using the continuation theorem in conincidence degree theory, we establish a sufficient condition for the existence of a positive omega-periodic solution (x) over bar (n) with strictly positive components. Second, we establish some sufficient conditions for oscillation of the positive solutions about a periodic solution. Finally, we give an estimation of the lower and upper bounds of the oscillatory solutions and establish some sufficient conditions for the global attractivity of {(x) over bar (n)}. Some illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the results.
