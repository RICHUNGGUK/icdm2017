We present a two dimensional scheme for classifying agent-oriented patterns. We define agent-oriented pattern attributes and use these attributes in a process for analyzing and placing agent-oriented patterns within the classification scheme. Using the proposed classification scheme, we classify 28 patterns written by a variety of agent researchers, chosen from almost 100 patterns which we have studied.", "paper_title": "A comprehensive view of agent-oriented patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000250115600004"}
