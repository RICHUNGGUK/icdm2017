We connect the problem to results in classic convex geometry and introduce a new series of radii, which we call core-radii. For the MEB problem, these radii have already been considered from a different point of view and sharp inequalities between them are known. In this paper sharp inequalities between core-radii for general containment under homothetics are obtained. Moreover, the presented inequalities are used to derive sharp upper bounds on the size of core-sets for containment under homothetics. In the MEB case, this yields a tight (dimension-independent) bound for the size of such core-sets. In the general case, we show that there are core-sets of size linear in the dimension and that this bound stays sharp even if the container is required to be symmetric.", "paper_title": "No Dimension-Independent Core-Sets for Containment Under Homothetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000313438500002"}
