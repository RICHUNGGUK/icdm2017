It consists of a star part network and a ring part network. Optical carriers generated by the C-MCLS are broadcast to all network nodes, which select and utilize them for data transmission. Optical carrier distribution as well as data transmission and receiving are performed in the star part network. The ring part network is for fiber failure recovery. The network resilience property enables the design of a fast distributed failure recovery scheme to deal with single and multiple fiber failures. We introduce a fiber connection automatic protection switching (FC-APS) architecture that only consists of optical couplers and 1 x 2 optical switches for each network node. Based on the FC-APS architecture, we design a distributed failure recovery scheme to recover the carriers and data affected by fiber failures. The fiber failure detection and failure recovery operations are performed by each network node independently only using its local information. We evaluate the recovery time of the distributed failure recovery scheme compared with that of the centralized one. Numerical results show that the distributed scheme greatly reduces the recovery time compared to the centralized configuration in the recoveries of both single and multiple fiber failures. Optical power loss analysis and compensation of the recovery routes in the distributed scheme are also presented. We show the required number of optical amplifiers for the longest recovery route in the distributed scheme under different numbers of network nodes and fiber span lengths.", "paper_title": "A resilient star-ring optical broadcast-and-select network with a centralized multi-carrier light source", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400012"}
