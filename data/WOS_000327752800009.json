There are four main phenomenological components: directionality, intensity, connection energy and volume. The paper establishes thermodynamics of deontical systems based on the Law of Zipf and the temperature of information. Design/methodology/approach - Mathematical and logical development of human society structure. Findings - A fundamental question in this approach to DIS is the intensity or forces of a relation. Concepts are introduced as the system volume and propose a system thermodynamic theory. It hints at the possibility of adapting the fractal theory by introducing the fractal dimension of the system. Originality/value - This paper is a continuation of other previous papers and developing the theory of DIS.", "paper_title": "An introduction to alysidal algebra (V): phenomenological components", "paper_id": "WOS:000327752800009"}
