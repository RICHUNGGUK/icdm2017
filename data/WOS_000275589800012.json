The main benefits of the proposed approach compared to classical modelling are the increased transparency and alleviated computational time. Two case studies, dealing with a mobile robot and an unforced pendulum system, are included to exemplify and test the theoretical results. One of the case studies makes use of the definition and calculation of several discrete plausibilities. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
