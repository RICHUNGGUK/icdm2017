IFCT protocol employs two schedules to avoid transmission interference. The first schedule assigns different frame number to neighboring clusters so that neighboring clusters could collect their member's data during different frames, avoiding inter-cluster interference. The second schedule allocates different slots to cluster members and they sending their data to their respectively cluster heads during different slots to avoid intra-cluster interference. Simulation results show that IFCT performs better than HEED, which is a clustering protocol based on TDMA. In addition, IFCT is more practical than HEED which uses CDMA code to avoid inter-cluster interference for deploying large-scale wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "An interference free cluster-based TDMA protocol for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000022"}
