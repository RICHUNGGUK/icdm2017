A new class of efficiently encodable structured nonbinary LDPC codes are proposed. The defining parity-check matrices are composed of scalar circulant sub-matrices which greatly reduce the storage requirement when compared with random LDPC codes. With this special structure of parity-check matrix, an efficient encoding algorithm is presented. Based on the proposed codes, a family of variablerate/variable-field nonbinary LDPC codes is designed for the ACM system. When combined with matched-size signal constellations, the family of constructed codes can achieve a wide range of spectral efficiency. Furthermore, the resultant ACM system can be implemented via a set of encoder and decoder. Simulation results show that the proposed nonbinary LDPC codes for the ACM system perform well.", "paper_title": "Design of efficiently encodable nonbinary LDPC codes for adaptive coded modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500005"}
