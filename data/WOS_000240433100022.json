The MDR algorithm was redesigned to allow an unlimited number of study subjects, total variables and variable states, and to remove restrictions on the order of interactions being analyzed. In addition, the algorithm is markedly more efficient, with similar to 150-fold decrease in runtime for equivalent analyses. To facilitate the processing of large datasets, the algorithm was made parallel.", "paper_title": "Parallel multifactor dimensionality reduction: a tool for the large-scale analysis of gene-gene interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000240433100022"}
