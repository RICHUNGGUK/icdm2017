The underlying assumption is that there is a conservation law like R-parity in supersymmetry which guarantees the stability of the lightest odd particle. The new physics model must be incorporated in the notation of CalcHEP, a package for the automatic generation of squared matrix elements. Once this is done, all annihilation and coannihilation channels are included automatically in any model. Cross-sections at nu = 0, relevant for indirect detection of dark matter. are also computed automatically. The package includes three sample models: the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), the MSSM with complex phases and the NMSSM. Extension to other models, including non supersymmetric models, is described.", "paper_title": "micrOMEGAs 2.0.7: a program to calculate the relic density of dark matter in a generic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000251763500007"}
