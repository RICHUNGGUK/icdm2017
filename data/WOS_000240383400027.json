The IEEE 802.15.3 Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol works on a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) basis within a piconet. With multiple overlapped piconets, the current protocol uses Parent/ Child (P/C) or Parent /Neighbor (P/N) configuration to avoid interpiconet interference, but the throughput of P/N or P/C cannot exceed that of single piconet. In this paper we propose an intelligent MAC protocol to cooperate with the UWB system based on Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC-CDMA). The proposed protocol uses Intermediate Sensor Device (ISDEV) to connect Piconet Coordinators and adaptively arrange 2 simultaneous data transmission links during each Channel Time Allocation (CTA). Our simulation results demonstrate the proposed scheme can achieve a higher throughput with an acceptable compromise at link success probability in multiple overlapped sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Intelligent MAC protocol for efficient support of multiple SOPs in UWB-based sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400027"}
