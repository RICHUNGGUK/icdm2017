Every information bit of each user is modulated and transmitted over a set of parallel sequences of PSWF-based orthogonal chip pulses and are further assigned to a ternary complementary code set with additional zero padding if necessary: Moreover, the ternary complementary code sets are generated to be mutually orthogonal and assigned to any pair of multiple users. Hence, the mitigation of multipath interference as well as multiple user interference (MUl) can be expected. Furthermore, the ternary code length can be greatly shortened by taking advantage of pulse and code orthogonality. Thus, the proposed transmission scheme is especially suitable for high data rate DS-UWB systems that offer very high flexibility.", "paper_title": "PSWF-based direct-sequence UWB transmission using orthogonal ternary code sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100019"}
