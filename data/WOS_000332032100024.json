The HTS Navigator processes output files from different plate readers' formats, computes the overall HTS matrix, automatically detects hits and has different types of baseline navigation and correction features. The software incorporates advanced cheminformatics capabilities such as chemical structure storage and visualization, fast similarity search and chemical neighborhood analysis for retrieved hits. The software is freely available for academic laboratories.", "paper_title": "HTS navigator: freely accessible cheminformatics software for analyzing high-throughput screening data", "paper_id": "WOS:000332032100024"}
