It automatically selects the most contrasted regions of an image. However, in the presence of nested structures (e.g. text in a signboard or windows in a contrasted facade), interesting structures may be masked by the containing region. In this paper we focus on ultimate attribute openings and we propose a method that improves the results by favoring regions with a predefined shape via a similarity function. An efficient implementation using a max-tree representation of the image is proposed. The method is validated in the framework of three applications: facade analysis, scene-text detection and cell segmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields better segmentation results than UO. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
