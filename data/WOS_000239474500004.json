We extend this result to a new graph parameter called tree-bandwidth, which is very similar to (but more restrictive than) treewidth. This represents the first constant distortion embedding of a non-planar class of graphs into l(1). Our results make use of a new technique that we call iterative embedding in which we define coordinates for a small number of points at a time.", "paper_title": "Embedding bounded bandwidth graphs into l(1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500004"}
