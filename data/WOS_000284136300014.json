If the variety is given by polynomials of degree <= d in n variables, then our algorithms run in parallel (sequential) time (n log d)(O(1)) (d(O(n4))). In the case of a hypersurface, the complexity drops to O (n(2) log(2) d) (d(O(n))). In the proof of the last result we use the effective Nullstellensatz for two polynomials, which we also prove by very elementary methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
