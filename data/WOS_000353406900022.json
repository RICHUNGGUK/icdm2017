Furthermore, with increasing densities of wireless network deployments, paucity of spectrum, and new developments like whitespace devices and cognitive networks, there is a need to study the computational efficiency of managing interference and optimizing coverage. This work presents new algorithms for computing and optimizing interference-limited coverage of wireless networks under protocol and Signal-to-Interference-and-Noise Ratio (SINR) models. For the protocol model we demonstrate lower bounds on computation of the coverage area for an transmitter topology. We first show that any offline computation has a run-time of , and any dynamic update takes time to locate transmitters whose coverage is modified and time to update affected coverage regions. We then demonstrate an extension of an offline algorithm to a dynamic algorithm that achieves the lower bound. For coverage in the SINR model, we demonstrate the difficulty of geometric direct computation, and report a flexible coverage area estimation method. We then propose a Random Hill Climbing method for optimizing the coverage area measure, and demonstrate the efficacy of this method by experimental comparison with the Nelder-Mead and exhaustive search optimization methods.", "paper_title": "Interference-constrained coverage algorithms in the protocol and SINR models", "paper_id": "WOS:000353406900022"}
