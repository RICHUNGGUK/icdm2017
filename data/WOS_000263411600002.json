In this work. we study analytically the benefits of transmission power control on throughput and energy consumption in a uniformly distributed power-aware ad hoc network where nodes are equipped with directional antennas. We construct an interference model for directional antenna based on a honey grid model to calculate the maximum interference. We further derive a directional collision avoidance model and based on the integrated interference/collision model and signal to interference requirements (SIR), we present the maximum end-to-end throughput under the maximum interference. We further investigate the effect of collision on the energy consumption and propose an energy consumption model that utilizes all aspects of energy wastage. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
