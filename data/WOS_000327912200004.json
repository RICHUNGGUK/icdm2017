Nowadays, adding mobility technology into WSNs has drawn increasing attention. In this paper, we combine the uneven clustering algorithm with mobile sink strategy and propose our mobile sink based uneven clustering algorithm First, we study the uneven clustering algorithm with a fixed sink node located at the center of a rectangle network. We analyze the performance of energy consumption and network lifetime, and compare our algorithm with LEACH. Then we use mobile sink node instead of fixed sink node to collect fused data under similar environment. Simulation results show that mobile sink node can efficiently mitigate hot spots near sink node as sink node moves either randomly or along a predetermined fixed path.", "paper_title": "A Mobile Sink Based Uneven Clustering Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327912200004"}
