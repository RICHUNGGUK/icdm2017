To this end, the fuzzy Laplace and fuzzy Fourier transform were used to obtain the solutions of FFPDEs. Then, some new results regarding the relation between some types of differentiability have been obtained. Finally, some applicable examples are solved in order to show the ability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Solving fuzzy fractional partial differential equations by fuzzy Laplace-Fourier transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000348559100006"}
