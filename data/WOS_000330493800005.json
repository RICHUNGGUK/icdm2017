Using a wing-fuselage configuration under transonic inviscid flow conditions as reference test case, the performance of the FPM flow solver is compared with an equivalent edge-based Finite Element (FEM) implementation. Efficiency issues have discouraged practical application of meshless methods in the past. Thus, a simplification of the basic FPM technique is proposed in order to reduce the performance gap with respect to classical grid-based algorithms. A comparative evaluation of the accuracy, computational cost and parallel performance of the meshless implementation is carried out with the objective to assess the level of maturity of the technique and identify improvements still required to tackle practical applications. The results obtained show accuracy and performance of the core algorithm comparable to a conventional FEM implementation, thus removing a major obstacle for further developments of the FPM.
