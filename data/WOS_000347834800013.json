The proposed cognitive system fused recursive-least-square (RLS) filters in parallel with an enhanced probabilistic convergent network (EPCN) serially-implemented on field programmable gate array. The novelty is that EPCN does not require an optimum result from RLS to achieve good responses from the RLS-EPCN fusion, thereby further offering two main distinguishing features: compactness and speed. Test results demonstrate RLS-EPCN's suitability to exploration/exploitation of hostile surroundings such as sea exploration.", "paper_title": "The FPGA-based multi-classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000347834800013"}
