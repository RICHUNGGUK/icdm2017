To reduce the load on the network, mobile network operators deploy femtocells to increase their coverage and performance and to eliminate wireless notspots. Femtocells are low-cost devices that connect a new femtocell network architecture to the core telecommunication network through a licensed spectrum and standardized interface protocols. In this paper, we first note that the user equipment registration procedure, which is defined in the 3GPP (Third Generation Partnership Project) standard, in a femtocell-enabled network is vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks. We then propose a mechanism to defend against these attacks. For compatibility, the proposed mechanism makes use of the well-defined control message in the 3GPP standard and modifies the user equipment registration procedure as little as possible.", "paper_title": "On the Security of a User Equipment Registration Procedure in Femtocell-Enabled Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355181300004"}
