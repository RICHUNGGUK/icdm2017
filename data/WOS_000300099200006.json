An equivalent form of the fuzzy core is researched. In order to better understand the fuzzy core and the Shapley function for dynamic fuzzy games on matroids, we pay more attention to study three kinds of dynamic fuzzy games on matroids, which are named as fuzzy games with multilinear extension form, with proportional value and with Choquet integral form, respectively. Meantime, the relationship between the fuzzy core and the Shapley function for dynamic fuzzy games on matroids is researched, which coincides with the crisp case.", "paper_title": "The fuzzy core and Shapley function for dynamic fuzzy games on matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000300099200006"}
