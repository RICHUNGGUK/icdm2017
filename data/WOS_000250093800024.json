The stability of the closed loop system is guaranteed by introducing a robust adaptive bound based on Lyapunov stability analysis. A radial-basis function type neural network is used in the paper. To show the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed some simulation studies. The results of simulation become very promising.", "paper_title": "Decentralized adaptive control of large-scale nonaffine nonlinear systems using radial basis function neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800024"}
