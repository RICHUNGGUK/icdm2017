Due to the particularity of equipment used in the centrifuge experiment, and the high risk of experiment for human body, EEG research under +Gz acceleration is rare. The research on preventing and early warning human syncope induced by +Gz by means of EEG signal is therefore much less. In this study, the EEG change feature under +Gz Acceleration is studied with the human experiment by use of a new type human centrifuge. The valuable feature parameters changes are extracted by using the analysis method based on periodogram parameters, after data filtering and other pretreatment. The results show that, the features of some typical EEG levels are significant for aviation medicine. Particularly, the comprehensive parameter R change of alpha and beta frequency bands early shown is applicable and significant for early warning syncope induced by +Gz acceleration.
