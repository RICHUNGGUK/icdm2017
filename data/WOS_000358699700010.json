However, mobile devices still do not have the computing power and battery life that will allow them to perform effectively over long periods of time, or for executing applications that require extensive communication, computation, or low latency. Cyber-foraging is a technique to enable mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in single-hop proximity. This article presents the results of a systematic literature review (SLR) on architectures that support cyber-foraging. Elements of the identified architectures were codified in the form of Architectural Tactics for Cyber-Foraging. These tactics will help architects extend their design reasoning toward cyber-foraging as a way to support the mobile applications of the present and the future. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
