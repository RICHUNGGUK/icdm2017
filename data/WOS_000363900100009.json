This type of \"souvenir photo\" is one of the most common photos clicked by tourists. Although algorithms that aid a user-photographer in taking a well-composed picture of a scene exist [Ni et al. 2013], few studies have addressed the issue of properly positioning human subjects in photographs. In photography, the common guidelines of composing portrait images exist. However, these rules usually do not consider the background scene. Therefore, in this article, we investigate human-scenery positional relationships and construct a photographic assistance system to optimize the position of human subjects in a given background scene, thereby assisting the user in capturing high-quality souvenir photos. We collect thousands of well-composed portrait photographs to learn human-scenery aesthetic composition rules. In addition, we define a set of negative rules to exclude undesirable compositions. Recommendation results are achieved by combining the first learned positive rule with our proposed negative rules. We implement the proposed system on an Android platform in a smartphone. The system demonstrates its efficacy by producing well-composed souvenir photos.", "paper_title": "Where2Stand: A Human Position Recommendation System for Souvenir Photography", "paper_id": "WOS:000363900100009"}
