Furthermore the dynamism of Grid environments and applications requires that these services be able to continually manage and optimize their operation based on system state and application requirements. This paper presents a design and implementation of such a self-managing data-streaming service based on online control strategies. A Grid-based fusion workflow scenario is used to evaluate the service and demonstrate its feasibility and performance.", "paper_title": "A self-managing wide-area data streaming service", "paper_id": "WOS:000250751600001"}
