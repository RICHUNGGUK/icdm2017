However, keeping track of the relationships between the different assets involved in a development process is a complex and tedious task. The fact that the main assets handled in any model-driven engineering project are models and model transformations eases the task. In order to take advantage of this scenario, which has not been appropriately capitalized on by the most widely adopted model transformation languages before, this work presents MeTAGeM-Trace, a methodological and technical proposal with which to support the model-driven development of model transformations that include trace generation. The underlying idea is to start from a high-level specification of the transformation which is subsequently refined into lower-level transformation models in terms of a set of DSLs until the source code that implements the transformation can be generated. Running this transformation produces not only the corresponding target models, but also a trace model between the elements of the source and target models. As part of the proposal, an EMF-based toolkit has been developed to support the development of ATL and ETL model transformations. This toolkit has been empirically validated by conducting a set of case studies following a systematic research methodology.", "paper_title": "Dealing with Traceability in the MDD of Model Transformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000338030200002"}
