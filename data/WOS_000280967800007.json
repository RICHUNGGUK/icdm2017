A critical issue when selecting an OWA operator is the determination of the associated weights. For this reason, numerous weight generating methods, including programming-based approaches, have appeared in the literature. In this paper, we develop a general method for obtaining OWA operator weights via an extreme point approach. The extreme points are represented by the intersection of an attitudinal character constraint and a fundamental ordered weight simplex. The extreme points are completely identified using the proposed formula, and the OWA operator weights can then be expressed by a convex combination of the identified extreme points. With those identified extreme points, some new OWA operator weights can be generated by a centroid or a user-directed method, which reflects the decision-maker's incomplete preferences. This line of reasoning is further extended to encompass situations in which the attitudinal character is specified in the form of interval with an aim to relieve the burden of specifying the precise attitudinal character, thus obtaining less-specific expressions that render human judgments readily available. All extreme points corresponding to the uncertain attitudinal character are also obtained by a proposed formula and then used to prioritize the multitude of alternatives. Meanwhile, two dominance rules are effectively used for prioritization of alternatives. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
