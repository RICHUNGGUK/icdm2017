Information technologies can make e-contracting more efficient and effective. A process model for flexible B2B e-contracting is proposed that separates concerns by distinguishing function and communication perspectives of e-contracting processes supplemented with activity constraints. The model supports the elaboration of fully detailed e-contracting process specifications, coherent communication between contracting parties, and seamless coupling between the internal and external activities of a company.", "paper_title": "Supporting the diversity of B2B e-contracting processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000256933600003"}
