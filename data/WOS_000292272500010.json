The proposed scheme not only provides a differentiated recovery capability but also maximizes the capacity utilization. A simple routing strategy for enabling multi-priority delay-aware survivability in WDM networks with three classes of working traffic is also proposed. The simulation results show that the dual-failure recovery scheme achieves the desired restoration ratio for the two classes of working traffic given appropriate settings of the reservation and allocation ratios. In addition, it is shown that the multi-priority delay-aware survivability scheme successfully achieves a delay-sensitive differentiated recovery capability.", "paper_title": "Differentiated recovery in WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292272500010"}
