Under this special boundary condition, the governing system of partial differential equations is converted to a set of coupled ordinary differential equations by using suitable similarity transformations, which are solved by a collocation method equivalent to the fourth order mono-implicit-Runge-Kutta method with MATLAB. The main purpose of the present study is to investigate the effects of the different physical parameters, namely the stretching Reynolds number, the permeability Reynolds number,the expansion ratio and the Prandtl number on the velocity and temperature distribution. The results are shown graphically. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
