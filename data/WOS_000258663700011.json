The system state tends to the so-called necessary path, or creode, when the exogenous signals are in a certain system-relevant range. The present work develops the homeorhesis-aware dynamical model for the motion of a single individual (e.g., human). The model allows for the purposeful behaviour of the individual, the creode, the exogenous forces, and the individual-specific sensitivity to their influences. The model also describes the homeorhetic-dysfunction movements. The transparency of the model is such that it allows a physical analogue in the form of electronic circuits. The model is a first step towards the construction of sociologically relevant models for the prediction of human behaviour. It is indispensable for the analyses of dangerous scenarios where the experiments are impossible, for example when predicting the behaviour of panic-stricken crowds in life-threatening situations. The work illustrates the corresponding numerical-simulation results with a series of figures and suggests topics for future research. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
