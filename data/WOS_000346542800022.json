It generalizes several related approaches known from the literature. The approach is based on a system of aggregation functions with property (SA) - a weakened form of symmetry. It generalizes symmetric associative aggregation. In the paper, several methods of constructing sequential aggregations, as well as extended aggregation functions with property (SA), are introduced and exemplified. Moreover, an example of a real-world application, which illustrates the proposed sequential aggregation procedure, is included.
