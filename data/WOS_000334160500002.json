In this revolutionised competitive environment, day by day increase in fossil fuel cost along with the environment issues, force the electric power producing utilities for a best possible economic real power dispatch with a minimum power production cost. The economic load dispatch (ELD) is a complex optimisation problem due to non-linear, non-convex type fuel cost characteristics of the fossil fuel operated thermal generators. Although many conventional optimisation approaches have been developed to solve such problem, over the past decade, the bio-inspired optimisation (BIO) techniques have shown promising performance on such constrained ELD problems. This paper attempts to provide a comprehensive review of application of BIO algorithms to solve most complex practical ELD problems.", "paper_title": "Bio-inspired optimisation for economic load dispatch: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000334160500002"}
