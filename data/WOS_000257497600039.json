Unlike these specially built machines that feature high speed interconnects the MMPI system is designed on top of Bluetooth technology allowing for parallel applications to be developed within the realm of mobile computing. MMPI is a Java based library built upon Java Micro Edition (JME) and JSR-82 Bluetooth. Fault Tolerance is especially important in MPI as the probability for failure within the system increases as the number of nodes increase. This paper looks at the aspects of fault tolerance from the mobile perspective through the use of the MMPI library. Mobile fault tolerance opens up a whole other dimension of possible faults that need to be handled when dealing with wireless communications technology such as Bluetooth. This paper discusses some of the aspects of Mobile fault tolerance within the MMPI world.", "paper_title": "Examination of Fault Tolerance in MMPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600039"}
