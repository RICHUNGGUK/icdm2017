performs the classification of engineering knowledge framework and examines the feasibility of using the relativity of classified hierarchical knowledge to establish a relational engineering knowledge base for a door-shaped structure Hierarchical analysis is also performed of agent techniques, which are correlated with important engineering knowledge and related parameters, to establish an engineering knowledge coding for a door-shaped structure Various boundary conditions and loading range as well as the coding of related detailed parameters are established in a proper order to solve analytic problems of natural frequency or stress of the transverse beam According to the existing coding model, decoding can be done rapidly for making general calculations based on engineering principles Additionally, detailed parameter coding is performed via a detailed parameter agent The most similar cases can be located from the database by using the case-based similarity agent and the corresponding structural target parameters of the detailed codes More over, an information search and comparison of results are made based on the similarity of cases, thus shortening the time of data retrieval, and obtaining inferential and analytical results efficiently for a subsequent evaluation and applications Furthermore, a novel concept is adopted, in which the analytical results are taken from a case based similarity agent as the foundation for further evaluation The concept is also combined with a genetic algorithm to perform light weight calculations to obtain the optimal design and provide engineers with a rational design The proposed framework of the knowledge system adopts JAVA language and combines with MySQL software and C++ program to facilitate the construction and application of a related program interface, knowledge coding and case based similarity The above proposed method for case based similarity and light-weight analyses can be extended to apply other similar structures", "paper_title": "INVESTIGATION OF CASE-BASED SIMILARITY AND LIGHT-WEIGHTING ANALYSIS OF DOOR-SHAPED STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000284189600016"}
