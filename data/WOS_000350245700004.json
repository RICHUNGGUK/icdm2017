A recent line of research has studied the possibility of a direct construction of adaptive PRFs from non-adaptive ones, where direct means that the constructed adaptive PRF uses only few (ideally, constant number of) calls to the underlying non-adaptive PRF. Unfortunately, this study has only yielded negative results (e.g., Myers in Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2004, pp. 189-206, 2004; Pietrzak in Advances in Cryptology - CRYPTO 2005, pp. 55-65, 2005). We give an affirmative answer to the above question, presenting a direct construction of adaptive PRFs from non-adaptive ones. The suggested construction is extremely simple, a composition of the non-adaptive PRF with an appropriate pairwise independent hash function.", "paper_title": "From Non-adaptive to Adaptive Pseudorandom Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000350245700004"}
