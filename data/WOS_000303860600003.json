Depending on the location, an MN may use direct link to AR (Tier-0) or indirect link to AR via MR (Tier-1). To increase system utilization, sessions generated by high-speed MNs in one tier are allowed to use a certain amount of free bandwidth in another tier. Since Tier-1 traffic can be temporarily buffered at MR, to reduce the blocking probability of Tier-0, the bandwidth between Tier-0 and Tier-1 can be proportionally adjusted based on BER. In other words, more bandwidth is allocated to the tier with smaller BER. For the purpose of performance evaluation, we build a mathematical model with 6D Markov chains to analyze session blocking probabilities, system utilization, and normalized goodput. Analytical results are validated through a simulation. Both results demonstrate that the proposed PBA can significantly reduce the session blocking probabilities and increase the overall normalized goodput when BER ratio between Tier-0 and Tier-1 is very different.
