Rotational symmetry is one of the important features for image decoding and object recognition in computer vision systems. In the genetic Fourier algorithm, the Fourier descriptors are chromosomes and fitting function of the GA. The genetic Fourier method has the following advantages. (1) It can handle partially occurred contour and opened contour, (2) it can handle complex point pattern and (3) it can obtain multiple perceptions. Experimental results show that it can handle complex symmetry figures, these symmetry figures may be formed by separated curves, points or partially occurred or partially missed (opened contour).
