Member of the cooperative teams is simulated by an agent. In the virtual cooperative team, agents adapt its knowledge according to cooperative principles. The multi-goal Q-learning algorithm is approached to the multiple learning goals. In the virtual team, agents learn what knowledge to adopt and how much to learn (choosing learning radius). The learning radius is interpreted in Section 3.1. Five basic experiments are manipulated proving the validity of the multi-goal Q-learning algorithm. It is found that the learning algorithm causes agents to converge to optimal actions, based on agents' continually updated cognitive maps of how actions influence learning goals. It is also proved that the learning algorithm is beneficial to the multiple goals. Furthermore, the paper analyzes how sensitive the learning performance is affected by the parameter values of the learning algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
