Although bundle adjustment techniques can be used to minimize the 2D reprojection error, these methods being based on nonlinear optimization alcyorithms require a good starting point. Quasi-linear algorithms with better global convergence properties can be used to generate an initial solution before submitting it to bundle adjustment for refinement. In this paper, we propose a factorization-based method to integrate the initial search as well as the bundle adjustment into a single algorithm consisting of a sequence of weighted least-squares problems, in which a control parameter is initially set to a relaxed state to allow the search of a good initial solution, and subsequently tightened up to force the final solution to approach a minimum point of the 2D reprojection error. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge. Our method readily handles images with missing points.", "paper_title": "Projective reconstruction from multiple views with minimization of 2D reprojection error", "paper_id": "WOS:000236475400005"}
