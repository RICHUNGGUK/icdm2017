The purpose of this study is to formulate the matching problem as an optimization task and carry out this optimization problem by means of a chaotic neural network. The proposed method uses TCNN, a Hopfield neural network with decaying self-feedback, to find the best-matching (i.e., the lowest global distance) path between an input and a template. Experimental results show a very good performance for the proposed algorithm in pattern recognition tasks. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
