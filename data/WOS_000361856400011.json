We point out the connections of weak odd domination with odd domination, [sigma, rho]-domination, and perfect codes. We introduce bounds on kappa(G), the maximum size of WOD sets of a graph G, and on kappa'(G), the minimum size of non-WOD sets of G. Moreover, we prove that the corresponding decision problems are NP-complete. The study of weak odd domination is mainly motivated by the design of graph-based quantum secret sharing protocols: a graph G of order n corresponds to a secret sharing protocol whose threshold is kappa(Q)(G) = max(kappa(G), n - kappa'(G)). These graph-based protocols are very promising in terms of physical implementation, however all such graph-based protocols studied in the literature have quasi-unanimity thresholds (i.e. kappa(Q) (G) = n - o(n) where n is the order of the graph G underlying the protocol). In this paper, we show using probabilistic methods the existence of graphs with smaller kappa(Q) (i.e. kappa(Q) (G) <= 0.811n where n is the order of G). We also prove that deciding for a given graph G whether kappa(Q) (G) <= k is NP-complete, which means that one cannot efficiently double check that a graph randomly generated has actually a kappa(Q) smaller than 0.811n.
