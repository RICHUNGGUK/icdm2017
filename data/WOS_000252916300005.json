Design/methodology/approach - The first hybrid scheme is based on Green's function applied to magnetization source while the other one is based on a magnetic scalar potential boundary element method. A comparison of the two techniques is performed on a benchmark case with analytical solution, on a 2D multiply-connected problem and on an industrial case where measurements are available. Findings - The proposed hybrid approaches have proved to be effective techniques to solve open boundary non-linear magnetostatic problems. Similar convergence speed with respect to the number of unknowns is found for both schemes Originality/value - The paper shows the effectiveness of hybrid schemes applied to the finite formulation, assessing their performances on various test cases.", "paper_title": "Coupling of finite formulation with integral techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000252916300005"}
