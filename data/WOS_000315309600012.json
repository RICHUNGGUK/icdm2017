When D contains a total of n characters drawn from an alphabet of size a, Hon et al. (2008) [12] gave an nH(k)(D)+o(n log sigma)-bit index which supports a query in O(vertical bar T vertical bar (log(epsilon) n+log d)+occ) time, where epsilon > 0 and H-k(D) denotes the kth-order entropy of D. Very recently, Belazzougui (2010) [3] has proposed an elegant scheme, which takes n log sigma + O(n) bits of index space and supports a query in optimal O(vertical bar T vertical bar + occ) time. In this paper, we provide connections between Belazzougui's index and the XBW compression of Ferragina and Manzini (2005) [8], and show that Belazzougui's index can be slightly modified to be stored in nH(k)(D) O(n) bits, while query time remains optimal; this improves the compressed index by Hon et al. (2008) [12] in both space and time. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Faster compressed dictionary matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000315309600012"}
