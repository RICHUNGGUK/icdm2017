Taking the powerfulness of the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and the fuzzy AHP (FAHP) into account when tackling comprehensive multi-criteria decision-making problems, in this paper, we extend the classic AHP and the FAHP into the intuitionistic fuzzy AHP (IFAHP) in which the preferences are represented by intuitionistic fuzzy values. The IFAHP can be used to handle more complex problems, where the decision maker has some uncertainty in assigning preference values to the objects considered. The paper proposes a new way to check the consistency of an intuitionistic preference relation and then introduces an automatic procedure to repair the inconsistent one. It is worth pointing out that our proposed method can improve the inconsistent intuitionistic preference relation without the participation of the decision maker, and thus, it can save much time and show some advantages over the AHP and the FAHP. This paper also develops a novel normalizing rank summation method to derive the priority vector of an intuitionistic preference relation, on which the priorities of the hierarchy in the IFAHP are derived. The procedure of the IFAHP is given in detail, and an example concerning global supplier development is used to demonstrate our results.", "paper_title": "Intuitionistic Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000344661600004"}
