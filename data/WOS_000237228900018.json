However, along with the speedup of the process and an ever increasing volume of data there are continuing concerns about the quality of the assembled sequence. Many genomes have been sequenced only to a draft, leaving the data in a series of more-or-less organized scaffolds, and many feature a small, but not negligible number of mis-assembled pieces. In this paper we present a new method for automated flagging of potential trouble spots in large assembled supercontigs. It can be incorporated into existing quality control pipelines and lead to a considerable improvement in the sensitivity to certain types of errors.", "paper_title": "An algorithm for the automated verification of DNA supercontig assemblies", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900018"}
