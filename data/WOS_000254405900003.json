We show that only the S-polynomialsthe of neighbor pairs of a strictly ordered finite homogenours generating set are needed in the computing of a Grobner base of the homogenous ideal. It reduces dramatically the number of unnecessary S-polynomials that are processed. We also show that the computational complexity of our new algorithm is O(N-2), where N is the maximum degree of the input generating polynomials. The new algorithm can be used to solve a problem of blind recognition of convolutional codes. This problem is a new generalization of the important problem of synthesis of a linear recurring sequence.", "paper_title": "Fast computation of Grobner basis of homogenous ideals of F[x, y]", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405900003"}
