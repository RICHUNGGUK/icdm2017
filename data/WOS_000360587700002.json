We compare the performance of the M-channel filter with the well-known bilateral filter in achieving such \"vision at a glance\" which is akin to image preprocessing in the computer vision domain. We find that at higher noise levels, the M-channel filter performs better than the bilateral filter in terms of reducing noise while preserving edge details. The M-channel filter is also significantly simpler and therefore faster than the bilateral filter. Overall, the M-channel filter enables us to model, simulate and arrive at a better understanding of some of the initial mechanisms in visual pathway, while simultaneously providing a fast, biologically inspired algorithm for digital image preprocessing.", "paper_title": "Comparison Between an HVS Inspired Linear Filter and the Bilateral Filter in Performing \"Vision at a Glance\" through Smoothing with Edge Preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360587700002"}
