This paper presents the details of the context management module that has adopted ontological modeling and reasoning technologies. The ontological approach can support both distributed context integration and advanced temporal reasoning capabilities. iMessenger has the ability to infer inconsistencies between what the user was expected to do and what the user is actually doing, and supply appropriate feedback to encourage people to follow their predefined agendas correctly in addition to keep healthy postures during their daily activities. The framework has been validated using simulated scenarios within the Protege environment.", "paper_title": "An ontological framework for activity monitoring and reminder reasoning in an assisted environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000209332000002"}
