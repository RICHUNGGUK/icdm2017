Ergonomics specialists have offered auxiliary posture diversity to deal with the lack of varieties, especially for high-risk ones. Meanwhile, Assembly Line Balancing (ALB) problem has been recognized as a prior thinking to (re)configure assembly lines via the balancing of their tasks among their workstations. Some conventional criteria, cycle time and overall workload are often considered during the balancing. This paper presents a novel model of ALB problem that incorporates assembly worker postures into the balancing. In addition to the conventional ALB criteria, a new criterion of posture diversity is defined and contributes to enhance the model. The proposed model suggests configurations of assembly lines via the balancing; so that the assigned workers encounter the opportunities of changing their body postures, regularly. To address uncertainties in the conventional criteria, a fuzzy goal programming is used, and an appropriate genetic algorithm is developed to deal with the model. Various computational tests are performed on the different models made with combinations of the three criteria mentioned above. Comparing the pay-offs among the combinations, results show that well balanced task allocation can be obtained through the proposed model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
