Design/methodology/approach - The 3D TO algorithm is described, and experimentally validated on an electromagnetic design problem. Findings - The proposed method is capable of finding an optimal configuration for the validation problem used. Research limitations/implications - More tests are needed in order to fully assert the capabilities of the algorithm. Moreover, further improvements are needed in order to obtain smoother topologies at the end of the optimization procedure. Practical implications - The paper presents a novel tool for the design of electromagnetic devices, using a TO approach. Originality/value - So far most of the TO algorithms did not tackle true 3D problems, and the ones capable of 3D optimization do it at high computational costs. The algorithm presented here is capable of true 3D design at a reasonable computational budget.", "paper_title": "3D topology optimization using an immune algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000248369400010"}
