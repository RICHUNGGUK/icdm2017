Some primary properties of interval-valued fuzzy logical operators and the construction approaches of interval-valued fuzzy T-similarity relations are first introduced. Determined by an interval-valued fuzzy triangular norm and an interval-valued fuzzy implicator, a pair of lower and upper generalized interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators with respect to an arbitrary interval-valued fuzzy relation on two universes of discourse is then defined. Properties of I-lower and T-upper interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators are examined based on the properties of interval-valued fuzzy logical operators discussed above. Connections between interval-valued fuzzy relations and interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators are also established. Finally, an operator-oriented characterization of interval-valued fuzzy rough sets is proposed, that is, interval-valued fuzzy rough approximation operators are characterized by axioms. Different axiom sets of T-lower and T-upper interval-valued fuzzy set-theoretic operators guarantee the existence of different types of interval-valued fuzzy relations which produce the same operators.
