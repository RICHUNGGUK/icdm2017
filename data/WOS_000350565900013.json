According to the definition used by these procedures, a test vector is unnecessary if all the target faults continue to be detected after it is omitted. This article introduces a more general definition of unnecessary test vectors that allows additional ones to be omitted. According to this definition, a test vector is unnecessary if every target fault can be detected by a sequence that is obtained after omitting the vector, and possibly other vectors. The article develops a procedure for omitting test vectors based on this definition and discusses its effects on the storage requirements and test application time.", "paper_title": "A Generalized Definition of Unnecessary Test Vectors in Functional Test Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000350565900013"}
