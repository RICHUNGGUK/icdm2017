We provide an algorithm that solves the problem in a time linear in the number of pixels in the region and requiring only constant memory space in addition to the frame-buffer memory itself. We map this problem to a boundary fill problem in a general graph, and solve it using a novel depth first search-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "A linear-time constant-space algorithm for the boundary fill problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000248374800010"}
