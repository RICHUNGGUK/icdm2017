The docking studies validated the experimental results indicating that the paclitaxel site is the binding site for (-)-ZMP. The 18 ns MD simulation shows the docking mode has changed a lot, whereas it offers more reliable binding data. MM-PBSA binding free-energy calculations further confirmed the results of the MD simulation. The study revealed that hydrophobic interactions play an important role in stabilizing the binding, and the strong hydrogen bond formed with Asp224 enhances the affinity for tubulin. Meanwhile, the results support the assumption that (-)-ZMP can be attacked by His227, leading to a nucleophilic reaction and covalent binding. These theoretical results lead to a greater understanding of the mechanism of action of binding to tubulin, and will therefore aid the design of new compounds with higher affinities for tubulin.", "paper_title": "Exploration of the binding mode between (-)-zampanolide and tubulin using docking and molecular dynamics simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332179000003"}
