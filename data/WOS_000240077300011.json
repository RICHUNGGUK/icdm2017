In this paper we consider some of the algebraic properties of RFA, namely the varieties these automata generate. Consequently, we obtain a characterization of the boolean closure of the classes of languages recognized by these models.", "paper_title": "Varieties generated by certain models of reversible finite automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300011"}
