Results: OntoMaton is an open source solution that brings ontology lookup and tagging capabilities into a cloud-based collaborative editing environment, harnessing Google Spreadsheets and the NCBO Web services. It is a general purpose, format-agnostic tool that may serve as a component of the ISA software suite. OntoMaton can also be used to assist the ontology development process.", "paper_title": "OntoMaton: a Bioportal powered ontology widget for Google Spreadsheets", "paper_id": "WOS:000315158500024"}
