In this paper, we consider a generalization of the classical geometric spanner problem (called segment spanner): Given a set S of n disjoint 2-D segments, find a spanning network G(S) with minimum size so that for any pair of points in S, there exists a path in G(S) with length no more than t times their Euclidean distance. Based on a number of interesting techniques (such as weakly dominating set, strongly dominating set, interval cover, and imaginary Steiner points), we present an efficient algorithm to construct the segment spanner. Our approach first identifies a set Q of Steiner points in S and then constructs a point spanner for the set of Steiner points. Our algorithm runs in O(vertical bar Q vertical bar+n(2) log n) time and Q is a constant approximation (in terms of its size) of the optimal solution when S has a constant relative separation ratio. The approximation ratio depends on the stretch factor t and the relative separation ratio of S.", "paper_title": "A GEOMETRIC SPANNER OF SEGMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275469600004"}
