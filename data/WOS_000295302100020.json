The resources required by the activities have to be available in the corresponding workspaces and those sitting idle during a period have to be stored. This problem contains the Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) as a particular case, which puts it in the NP-hard class. In this context, the difficulty of identifying optimal solutions, even for instances of medium size, justifies the use of heuristic techniques. This work proposes a construction and a hybrid algorithm (HGT) based on the GRASP and Tabu search metaheuristics. Comparisons are presented for values obtained by HGT, pure GRASP versions, Tabu search and literature results. Computational results show the proposed methods to be competitive in relation to instances in the literature and to existing techniques. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
