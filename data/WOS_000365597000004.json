According to experts, the KSFs of KM using e-portfolio included knowledge sharing, innovation, acquisition, application, and accumulation. Detailed sub-KSFs were developed based on the activities of the e-portfolios including reflection, work revision, self-assessment on works, arrangement of learning content, teacher feedback, modeling, communication, and discussion. Each KSF and sub-KSF was weighted and ranked and had an acceptable reliability and validity. Among these sub-KSFs, reflection had the highest weight, followed by work revision, implying that reflection had the greatest impact on knowledge management.
