As the delta operator (gamma-domain) formulation of digital filters offers better numerical accuracy and lower coefficient sensitivity in narrow-band filter designs when compared to the traditional shift-operator formulation, it is desirable to have efficient design and implementation techniques in gamma-domain which utilize the various symmetries in the filter specifications. Furthermore, with the delta operator formulation, the discrete-time systems and results converge to their continuous-time counterparts as the sampling periods tend to zero. So a unifying theory can be established for both discrete- and continuous-time systems using the delta operator approach. With these motivations, we comprehensively establish the unifying symmetry theory for delta-operator formulated discrete-time complex-coefficient 2-D polynomials and functions, arising out of the many types of symmetries in their magnitude responses. The derived symmetry results merge with the s-domain results when the sampling periods tend to zero, and are more general than the real-coefficient results presented earlier. An example is provided to illustrate the use of the symmetry constraints in the design of a 2-D IIR filter with complex coefficients. For the narrow-band filter in the example, it can be seen that the gamma-domain transfer function possesses better sensitivity to coefficient rounding than the z-domain counterpart.", "paper_title": "Unified theory of symmetry for two-dimensional complex polynomials using delta discrete-time operator", "paper_id": "WOS:000286665800010"}
