Bridge design involves uplink transmission to the coordinator and downlink transmission to the bridge. Bridge periodically visits upper and lower clusters and exchanges data using CSMA-CA access. We develop the queuing model for bridging algorithm and present numerically obtained performance results. The effects of different parameters of the bridging algorithm, i.e. event sensing reliability, number of clusters and bridging period, are investigated. Our analysis shows how parameters of clustering algorithm should be tuned in order to prolong the lifetime. Our results demonstrate fair distribution of lifetime of nodes which means that all nodes of a cluster will deplete their energy within short window of time.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of Single Dimensional Sensor Network Implemented Using Slave-Slave Bridging in IEEE 802.15.4 Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000350193200002"}
