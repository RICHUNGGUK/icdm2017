Three cases with different We numbers and Re number are considered to simulate the process of droplet coalescence, droplet marginal splashing and droplet splashing. For all cases, at time around t = 0 ms, the velocity and pressure rises to a peak between droplet and liquid surface, and then decreased to a quasi-stable value. The dimensionless center height shows an approximate same trend for each case: firstly decreases sharply and then shows a logarithmic growth. As time goes on, the center height curve will approach zero with the impinging energy dissipating. The dimensionless maximum height can be divided into three parts with three peaks: (a) the crown crest; (b) the crown spreading on the wall; (c) the center rebounding liquid. The dimensionless crown radius shows a similar hyperbolic-type shape. A case with higher local mesh refinement levels shows more accurate phase interface which costs more computational time and storage. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
