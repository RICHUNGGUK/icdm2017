The focus of this study is to examine the feasibility and validity of DER algorithm in systems reliability prediction by comparing it with some existing approaches. To build an effective DER forecasting model, the parameters of prediction model must be set carefully. To solve this problem, a generic nonlinear optimisation model is investigated to search for the optimal parameters of forecasting model, and then the optimal parameters are adopted to construct the DER forecasting model. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the detailed implementation procedures and the validity of the proposed approach in the areas of reliability prediction.", "paper_title": "Dynamic evidential reasoning algorithm for systems reliability prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000278648300004"}
