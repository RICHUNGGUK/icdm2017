This way, we can deal both with qualitative and quantitative information, and consequently, to obtain more accurate results. The proposed logic system is introduced as an extension of Propositional Dynamic Logic: this choice, on the one hand, simplifies the theoretical study concerning soundness, completeness and decidability; on the other hand, provides the possibility of constructing complex relations from simpler ones and the use of a language very close to programming languages.
