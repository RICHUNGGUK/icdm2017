These rhythms can be highly variable due to culture conditions and are non-stationary due to baseline trends, damping and drift in period length. We present a technique for characterizing the modal frequencies of oscillation using continuous wavelet decomposition to non-parametrically model changes in amplitude and period while removing baseline effects and noise.
