Bounds are derived on limiting exponents of guessing moments for general sources. The bounds are shown to be tight for i.i.d., Markov, and unifilar sources, thus recovering some known results. A close relationship between error exponents and correct decoding exponents for fixed rate source compression on the one hand and exponents for guessing moments on the other hand is established.", "paper_title": "The Shannon Cipher System With a Guessing Wiretapper: General Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000288459100049"}
