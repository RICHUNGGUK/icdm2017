In this article, we present a wireless sensor network protocol, Trail, that supports distance-sensitive tracking of mobile objects for in-network subscribers upon demand. Trail achieves a find time that is linear in the distance from a subscriber to an object, via a distributed data structure that is updated only locally when the object moves. Notably, Trail does not partition the network into a hierarchy of clusters and clusterheads, and as a result Trail has lower maintenance costs, is more locally fault tolerant, and it better utilizes the network in terms of load balancing and minimizing the size of the data structure needed for tracking. Moreover, Trail is reliable and energy efficient, despite the network dynamics that are typical of wireless sensor networks. Trail can be refined by tuning certain parameters, thereby yielding a family of protocols that are suited for different application settings such as rate of queries, rate of updates, and network size. We evaluate the performance of Trail by analysis, simulations in a 90 x 90 sensor network, and experiments on 105 Mica2 nodes in the context of a pursuer-evader control application.", "paper_title": "Trail: A Distance-Sensitive Sensor Network Service For Distributed Object Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000267018000006"}
