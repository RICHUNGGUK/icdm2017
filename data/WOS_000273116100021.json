Each of these steps have received lot of attention in the past years. However, there currently exists no framework that integrates all of the different steps in an easy workflow. Here, we introduce Ancestors 1.0, a web server allowing one to easily and quickly perform the last three steps of the ancestral genome reconstruction procedure. It implements several alignment algorithms, an indel maximum likelihood solver and a context-dependent maximum likelihood substitution inference algorithm. The results presented by the server include the posterior probabilities for the last two steps of the ancestral genome reconstruction and the expected error rate of each ancestral base prediction.", "paper_title": "Ancestors 1.0: a web server for ancestral sequence reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000273116100021"}
