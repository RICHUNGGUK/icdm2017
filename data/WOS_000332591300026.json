A central problem in compressive sensing is that for a given sparse signal, we wish to recover it accurately, efficiently and stably from very few measurements. Inspired by mathematical analysis, we introduce a combining scheme between stability and robustness in reconstruction problems using compressive sensing. By choosing appropriate parameters, we are able to construct a condition for reconstruction map to perform properly.", "paper_title": "Combining Stability and Robustness in Reconstruction Problems via l(q) (0 < q <= 1) Quasinorm Using Compressive Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300026"}
