Despite continuous effort, offline handwriting-based writer identification still remains as a challenging problem because writing features can only be extracted from the handwriting image. As a result, plenty of dynamic writing information, which is very valuable for writer identification, is unavailable for offline writer identification. In this paper, we present a novel wavelet-based Generalized Gaussian Density (GGD) method for offline writer identification. Compared with the 2-D Gabor model, which is currently widely acknowledged as a good method for offline handwriting identification, GGD method not only achieves a better identification accuracy but also greatly reduces the elapsed time oil calculation in our experiments.", "paper_title": "Handwriting-based personal identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000237140000008"}
