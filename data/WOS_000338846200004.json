This pattern of wireless LAN usage is called the private OBSS (Overlapping Basic Service Set) environment in this paper. Due to frame collisions across BSSs, each BSS in the private OBSS environment suffers severe performance degradation. This study approaches the problem from the perspective of congestion control rather than noise or collision resolution. The retry limit, one of the 802.11 attributes, could be used for traffic control in conjunction with TCP. Reducing the retry limit causes early discard of a frame, and it has a similar effect of random early drops at a router, well known in the research area of congestion control. It makes the shared link less crowded with frames, and then the benefit of fewer collisions surpasses the penalty of less strict error recovery. As a result, the network-wide performance improves and so does the performance of each BSS eventually. Reducing the retry limit also has positive effects of merging TCP ACKs and reducing HOL-like blocking time at the AP. Extensive experiments have validated the idea that in the OBSS environment, reducing the retry limit provides better performance, which is contrary to the common wisdom. Since our strategy is basically to sacrifice error recovery for congestion control, it could yield side-effects in an environment where the cost of error recovery is high. Therefore, to be useful in general network and traffic environments, adaptability is required. To prove the feasibility of the adaptive scheme, a simple method to dynamically adjust the value of the retry limit has been proposed. Experiments have shown that this approach could provide comparable performance in unfriendly environments.", "paper_title": "Adjusting the Retry Limit for Congestion Control in an Overlapping Private BSS Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200004"}
