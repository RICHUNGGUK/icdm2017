The partial channel state information is assumed to be asymmetric at the encoders. As a main contribution, a tight converse coding theorem is presented. The difficulties associated with the case when the channel state has memory are discussed and connections to decentralized stochastic control theory are presented.", "paper_title": "On the Capacity of Memoryless Finite-State Multiple-Access Channels With Asymmetric State Information at the Encoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200006"}
