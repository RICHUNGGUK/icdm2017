Sampling bias is a critical problem in the field of complex networks ranging from biological networks, social networks and artificial networks like the Internet. This bias phenomenon depends on both the sampling method of the measurements and the features of the underlying networks. In RIPE NCC and the PlanetLab measurement architectures, the Internet is mapped as G(boolean OR mspt), the union of shortest paths between each pair of a set M of m testboxes, or equivalently, m shortest path trees. In this paper, we investigate this sampling method on a wide class of real-world complex networks as well as on the weighted Erdos-Renyi random graphs. This general framework examines the effect of the set of testboxes on G(boolean OR mspt). We establish the correlation between the subgraph G(M) of the underlying network, i.e. the set M and the direct links between nodes of set M, and the sampled network G(boolean OR mspt). Furthermore, we illustrate that in order to obtain an increasingly accurate view of a given network, a higher than linear detection/measuring effort (the relative size m/N of set M) is needed, where N is the size of the underlying network. Finally, when the relative size m/N of set M is small, we characterize the kind of networks possessing small sampling bias, which provides insights on how to place the testboxes for good network topology measurement.
