It can be observed that the frequency of cooperators (f(c)) decreases with increasing of loners' (e) and defectors' payoffs (b) . In particular, f(c) has a sharp decline when the loners' payoffs approximate 1.0. In addition, we find that introduction of troublemaker strategies prevents the uniform defection in the spatial evolutionary PD games for large b values and small e values. In practice, it also prevents cooperative strategies and defective strategies from vanishing for large e values.", "paper_title": "PRISONER'S DILEMMA GAMES WITH SOME TROUBLEMAKERS IN A RANDOM NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633600012"}
