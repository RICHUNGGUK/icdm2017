The problem of semi-supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction called KNDR is considered for wood defects recognition. In this setting, domain knowledge in forms of pairs constraints are used to specify whether pairs of instances belong to the same class or different classes. KNDR can project the data of labeled and unlabeled data as well as the constraints defined in the embedding space, under which the projections of the original data can be effectively partitioned from each other. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of KNDR for data visualization and wood defects recognition through extensive experiments. Experimental results show it achieves similar or even higher performances than some existing methods.", "paper_title": "Effective Semi-supervised Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction for Wood Defects Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000276234000012"}
