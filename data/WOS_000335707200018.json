The micro-mechanics model is based on the effective stress concept which covers the theory of deformation of soils (soil skeleton) and other porous materials. The final set of equations is simplified and derived for the water flow in a porous media and the spatial discretization is performed by the finite element method. The model was implemented to the SIFEL software package and some numerical examples are presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
