We derive the mean square error of the Stansfield algorithm with estimated DoA estimation error variance. Our derivation considers the statistical variation of DoA, as well as the impact of receive signal strength variations and node self-positioning error. In addition, we propose a distributed implementation of the Stansfield algorithm based on diffusion adaptation, which obtains accuracy comparable to its centralized counterpart and saves total transmit power for sufficient node density.", "paper_title": "Stansfield Localization Algorithm: Theoretical Analysis and Distributed Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700021"}
