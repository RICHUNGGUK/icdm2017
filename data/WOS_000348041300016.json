One of the common scenarios of using data wireless data network is while travelling in a train. Providing in-train wireless Internet access to multimedia applications (e.g., youtube) requires 3G/4G networks. While 3G/4G networks provide fast data access when users are static, it has significant latency when being used on the train. This is because 3G/4G networks use Mobile-IP that requires mobile nodes to register to foreign agents when handover occurs. This will introduced latency for the handover process. When registration is done, Mobile-IP suffers from triangular routing, which further decreases its performance. In this paper we argue that railway networking can be more effective through named data networking (NDN). Rather than using IP addresses, NDN provides a name-based paradigm that can achieve seamless handover. We analyze how NDN can support efficient handover and conduct simulation to test its performance. Results show the efficiency of NDN.", "paper_title": "Efficient handover in railway networking via named data", "paper_id": "WOS:000348041300016"}
