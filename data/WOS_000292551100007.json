Here a neural network is considered as a part of a large field called neural computing or soft computing. Moreover, in order to find the approximate solution of an n x n system of fuzzy linear equations that supposedly has a unique fuzzy solution, a simple algorithm from the cost function of the FNN is proposed. Finally, we illustrate our approach by some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of fully fuzzy linear systems by fuzzy neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000292551100007"}
