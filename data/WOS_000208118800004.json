Contrary to recent experiments, our aim is to elaborate a robust but very efficient (real-time even with uncompressed data) method to deal with the remaining problems related to shot change detection: illumination changes, context and data independency, and parameter settings. To do so, we have considered some adaptive threshold and derivative measures in a hue-saturation colour space. We illustrate our robust and efficient method by some experiments on news and football broadcast video sequences.", "paper_title": "Efficient and robust shot change detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000208118800004"}
