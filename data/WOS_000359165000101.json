The research about social networks has an impact on the people's daily life. In this paper, we observe the social networks based on the DBLP and Facebook datasets and confirm that the medium-scale community has a star-shaped structure and a core structure with high-connectivity and small diameter in the social networks. At the same time, we find that community merging depends largely on the clustering coefficient of the graph composed of nodes that connect two communities directly, and community splitting is largely decided by the clustering coefficient of this community.
