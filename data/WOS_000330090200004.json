However, few file downloading oriented RSU deployment strategies have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a new RSU deployment strategy for file downloading in VANETs. The encounters between vehicles and RSUs are modeled as a time continuous homogeneous Markov chain. The optimal inter-meeting time between vehicles and RSUs is analyzed based on the encounter model. Then, the road network is modeled as a weighted undirected graph, and a RSU deployment algorithm is designed based on the depth-first traversal algorithm for edges of a graph. Simulation results show that the proposed RSU deployment algorithm can satisfy the file downloading service requirements with the lowest RSU deployment cost. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
