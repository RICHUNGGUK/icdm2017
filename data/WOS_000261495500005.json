Quantitative sequence-activity model (QSAM), applying QSAR strategy to explore sequence-activity/function relationship for biosystems, is greatly meaningful but meanwhile extremely difficult. For biomolecules, high molecular weight, diverse structural morphology and intricate interaction network all bring in traditional QSAR methodologies unprecedented challenges. This article comprehensively reviewed developing process, current state and future perspective of QSAM, concerning its applications into fields of pharmacy, food science, immunology and molecular biology. Besides, discipline-crossing and amalgamation of QSAM with QSAR, bioinformatics and computational biology were also discussed.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Sequence-Activity Model (QSAM): Applying QSAR Strategy to Model and Predict Bioactivity and Function of Peptides, Proteins and Nucleic Acids", "paper_id": "WOS:000261495500005"}
