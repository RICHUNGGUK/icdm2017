The IDM, comprised of a naive Bayes classifier generated by supervised training with Gaussian clustering, is developed to classify patient motion in-context (due to a medical condition) and in real-time using a wearable sensor system. The IDM also incorporates a utility function, which is a simple form of expert knowledge and user preferences in sensor selection. Upon initial in-context detection, the utility function decides which sensor is to be activated next. High-resolution in-context detection with minimum sensor usage is possible because the necessary sensor can be activated or requested at the appropriate time. As a case study, the IDM is demonstrated in detecting different severity levels of a limp with minimum usage of high diagnostic resolution sensors.", "paper_title": "Incremental diagnosis method for intelligent wearable sensor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249309900007"}
