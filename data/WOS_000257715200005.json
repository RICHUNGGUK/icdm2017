Multiple organizations, within a domain, often combine to work on specific projects. When separate organizations come together to communicate, an alignment of terminology and semantics is required. Ontology creation is often privatized for these individual organizations to represent their view of the domain. This creates problems with alignment and integration, making it necessary to consider how much each ontology should influence the current decision to be made. To assist with determining influence a trust-based approach on authors and their ontologies provides a mechanism for ranking reasoning results. A representation of authors and the individual resources they provide for the merged ontology becomes necessary. The authors are then weighted by trust and trust for the resources they provide the ontology is calculated. This is then used to assist the integration process allowing for an evolutionary trust model to calculate the level of credibility of resources. Once the integration is complete semantic agreement between ontologies allows for the revision of the authors' trust.", "paper_title": "Trust-annotated ontology integration using social modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000257715200005"}
