Modeling trust properly and exploring techniques for establishing computational trust is at the heart of the Semantic Web to realize its vision. We propose a scalable probabilistic approach to trust evaluation which combines a variety of sources of information and takes four types of costs (operational, opportunity, service charge and consultant fee) and utility into consider during the process of trust evaluation. Our approach gives trust a strict probabilistic interpretation which can assist users with making better decisions in choosing the appropriate service providers according to their preferences. A formal robust analysis has been made to examine the performance of our method.", "paper_title": "A scalable probabilistic approach to trust evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238108800031"}
