The resulting 'oscillator-plus-noise' model in combination with vocal tract modeling by linear prediction is able to re-generate the spectral content of stationary wide-band vowel signals with high fidelity. For adequate modeling of mixed-excitation speech signals (such as voiced fricatives), the model is extended by a second linear prediction path for the independent spectral shaping of the noise-like component. With one and the same model, not only sustained voiced and mixed-excitation phonemes, but also stationary unvoiced sounds can be re-generated faithfully. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
