Minimax Probability Machine (MPM) and its extension, Minimum Error Minimax Probability Machine, have shown advantages in the machine learning literature. In this paper, we incorporate the MPM-based approaches into our face recognition system for further study. To test the performance of our new system, we compare the MPM-based approaches with SVM, a PCA-based and a LDA-based algorithms on the FERET database for both verification and identification. The experimental results demonstrate that MPM-based approaches are promising for automatic face recognition. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
