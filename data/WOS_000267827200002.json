As such, it is now being applied in many research projects in a number of different network management and security scenarios. This application has enabled the validation of the main ideas of the proposals and to learn some of the problems that it brings. This paper describes several research projects where ontology based network management proposals were applied, detailing the most important facets of the initial proposals that were used and explaining the main advantages and drawbacks that were found after prototyping these proposals.", "paper_title": "Ontology-Based Network Management: Study Cases and Lessons Learned", "paper_id": "WOS:000267827200002"}
