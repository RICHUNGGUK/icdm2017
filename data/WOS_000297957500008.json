Four sensors, located near the table corners, are employed to record the acoustic waveform coming from the impacts. A microprocessor extracts relevant characteristics from these signals including amplitudes and differential timings, which are then used to estimate the location of the hit. As this system requires only simple hardware, no special adaptation of the touch screen is needed. Further, as all sensors are mounted on the inner surface, the system is easy to deploy as a retrofit to existing tables. The technique can be applied to detect commands in responsive environments.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF A KNOCK TRACKING SYSTEM BASED ON TDOA METHOD FOR RESPONSIVE ENVIRONMENT APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500008"}
