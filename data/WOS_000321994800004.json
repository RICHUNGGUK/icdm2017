Conventional block ciphers are poorly suited to image protection due to the size of image data and increasing demand for real-time teleradiology and other online telehealth applications. To meet this challenge, this paper presents a novel chaos-based medical image encryption scheme. To address the efficiency problem encountered by many existing permutation-substitution type image ciphers, the proposed scheme introduces a substitution mechanism in the permutation process through a bit-level shuffling algorithm. As the pixel value mixing effect is contributed by both the improved permutation process and the original substitution process, the same level of security can be achieved in a fewer number of overall rounds. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides an efficient method for real-time secure medical image transmission over public networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
