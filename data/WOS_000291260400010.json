One begins with some primal scaling functions and their biorthogonal duals. Then desired biorthogonal wavelets are given by the method of Dahmen, Kunoth and Urban. Since the structure of those wavelets looks complicated, one tries to construct those types of wavelets only in primal side finally, without using any dual informations. Some numerical experiments show good effects, although the uniform stability remains to be proved theoretically.", "paper_title": "SPLINE WAVELETS WITH BOUNDARY VALUES AND VANISHING MOMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291260400010"}
