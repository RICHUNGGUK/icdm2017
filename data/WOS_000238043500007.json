Our purpose is to build the planar surfaces of three-dimensional (3D) polyhedric objects from labeled line segments using an active vision system (projection of laser planes on the object and 3D reconstruction using a CCD camera). Each line segment is first characterized by three geometric constraints, which are assigned by a specific membership function. These constraints are used in geometric relations between image features (such as collinear and parallel relations) through the fuzzy integral for grouping the line segments with accuracy, since edge detection gives imperfect and incomplete information.
