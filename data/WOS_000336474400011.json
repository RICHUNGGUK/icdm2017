In our method, local-space time feature and audio feature are firstly extracted from the video sequences and then an individual video sequence is represented as a SOFM density map; finally we integrate such density map with SVM for recognition events. To evaluate effectiveness of this method, this paper uses the public Hollywood dataset, in this dataset the shot sequences have been collected from 32 different Hollywood movies and it includes 8 event classes. The presented result justifies the proposed method explicitly, improve the average accuracy and average precision compared to other relative approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
