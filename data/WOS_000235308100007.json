We concentrate on such a very large scale neighborhood (VLSN) search technique based on compounding independent moves (CIM) such as 2-opts, swaps, and insertions. We present a systematic way of creating and searching CIM neighborhoods for routing problems with side constraints. For such problems, the exact search of the CIM neighborhood becomes NP-hard. We introduce a multi-label shortest path algorithm for searching these neighborhoods heuristically. Results of a computational study on the vehicle routing problem with capacity and distance restrictions shows that CIM algorithms are very competitive approaches for solving vehicle routing problems. Overall, the solutions generated by the CIM algorithm have the best performance among the current solution methodologies in terms of percentage deviation from the best-known solutions for large-scale capacitated VRP instances.", "paper_title": "Creating very large scale neighborhoods out of smaller ones by compounding moves", "paper_id": "WOS:000235308100007"}
