In this paper we propose an external, distributed and directed on-the-fly model checking algorithm to check general LTL properties in the model checker SPIN. Previous attempts are restricted to checking safety properties. The worst-case I/O complexity is bounded by O(sort(vertical bar F vertical bar R vertical bar)/p+l (.) scan(vertical bar F vertical bar vertical bar S vertical bar)), where S and R are the sets of visited states and transitions in the synchronized product of the Buchi automata for the model and the property specification, T is the number of accepting states, l is the length of the shortest counterexample, and p is the number of processors. The algorithm we propose returns minimal lasso-shaped counterexamples and includes refinements for property-driven exploration.", "paper_title": "Large-scale directed model checking LTL", "paper_id": "WOS:000236941300001"}
