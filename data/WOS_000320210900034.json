Furthermore, we give the definition of fractional covariance matrix. Based on fractional covariance matrix, principal component analysis (PCA) and two-dimensional principal component analysis (2D-PCA), we propose two new techniques, called fractional principal component analysis (FPCA) and two-dimensional fractional principal component analysis (2D-FPCA), which extends PCA and 2D-PCA to fractional order form, and extends the transition recognition ranges of PCA and 2D-PCA. To evaluate the performances of FPCA and 2D-FPCA, a series of experiments are performed on two face image databases: ORL and Yale. Experiments show that two new techniques are superior to the standard PCA and 2D-PCA if choosing different order between 0 and 1. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
