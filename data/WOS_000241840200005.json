The design procedure is given and applied to the pitch angle control of unmanned testing rocket with uncertain parameters. The proposed algorithm gives a framework to design a control for a wide range of different linear time-invariant processes with uncertain parameters and can be implemented also in the case of non-convex problems. The algorithm gives the analytical way of finding the nearly optimal solution of model reference trajectory tracking in the case of general time-invariant systems with uncertain parameters and can be used when optimization method fails due to the complexity of the problem.", "paper_title": "Pitch angle control of unmanned air vehicle with uncertain system parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000241840200005"}
