This paper deals with the problem of fitting a discrete polynomial curve to given 2D integer points in the presence of outliers. A 2D discrete polynomial curve is defined as a set of integer points lying between two polynomial curves. We formulate the problem as a discrete optimization problem in which the number of points included in the discrete polynomial curve, i.e., the number of inliers, is maximized. We then propose a robust method that effectively achieves a solution guaranteeing local maximality by using a local search, called rock climbing, with a seed obtained by RANSAC. We also extend our method to deal with a 3D discrete polynomial surface. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fitting discrete polynomial curve and surface to noisy data", "paper_id": "WOS:000361450200008"}
