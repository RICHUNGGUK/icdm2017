We show that the recursive teaching dimension, recently introduced by Zilles et al. (2008), is strongly connected to known complexity notions in machine learning, e.g., the self-directed learning complexity and the VC-dimension. To the best of our knowledge these are the first results unveiling such relations between teaching and query learning as well as between teaching and the VC-dimension. It will turn out that for many natural classes the RTD is upper-bounded by the VCD, e.g., classes of VCdimension 1, intersection-closed classes and finite maximum classes. However, we will also show that there are certain (but rare) classes for which the recursive teaching dimension exceeds the VC-dimension. Moreover, for maximum classes, the combinatorial structure induced by the RTD, called teaching plan, is highly similar to the structure of sample compression schemes. Indeed one can transform any repetition-free teaching plan for a maximum class C into an unlabeled sample compression scheme for C and vice versa, while the latter is produced by (i) the corner-peeling algorithm of Rubinstein and Rubinstein (2012) and (ii) the tail matching algorithm of Kuzmin and Warmuth (2007).", "paper_title": "Recursive Teaching Dimension, VC-Dimension and Sample Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000344638800009"}
