It is intuitively true that these fractional order models require the corresponding fractional order controllers to achieve desired performance. In this paper, an experimental study of the fractional order proportional and derivative (FO-PD) controller systematic design is presented, to validate the control performance for the fractional order systems with generalized fractional capacitor membrane model. The performance of the designed FO-PD controller is compared with both the integer order and fractional order controllers which are designed based on the approximate integer order system. This comparison results are presented both in the simulation and the hardware-in-the-loop experiment. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
