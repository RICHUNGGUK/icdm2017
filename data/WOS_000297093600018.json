In this communication, molecular docking studies were used to predict the potential ligands from compounds 1-18 which culminated in the identification of certain new urease inhibitors. Ligands were screened in vitro for their urease inhibitory potential. Compound 1, as deduced from modeling studies, was found to be the most active urease inhibitor (13.0 +/- 1.2 mu M), when compared with the standard thiourea (IC(50) = 21.1 +/- 0.3 mu M). All of the compounds were found to be nontoxic to Artemia sauna in brine shrimp lethality bioassay. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
