The proposed detection is derived from the SISO MMSE detection, which is a popular detection strategy for iterative receivers. For each transmitted symbol in the proposed detection, a soft successive interference cancellation (SIC) is performed based on a posteriori probabilities of past detected symbols. Simulation results show that the proposed detection, while needing less computational efforts, achieves significant performance gain compared with the SISO MMSE detection.", "paper_title": "MMSE SQRD based SISO detection for coded MIMO-OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333614700012"}
