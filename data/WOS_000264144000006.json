Ignoring the symmetry leads to an overestimation of the solution. Our method to find the solution of a system of linear fuzzy equations takes the symmetry of the matrix into account and is based on parametric functions. It is a practical algorithm using parametric functions in which the variables are given by elements of the support of the fuzzy coefficients of the system.", "paper_title": "USING PARAMETRIC FUNCTIONS TO SOLVE SYSTEMS OF LINEAR FUZZY EQUATIONS WITH A SYMMETRIC MATRIX", "paper_id": "WOS:000264144000006"}
