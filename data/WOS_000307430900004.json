Based on the comparison principle, it presents new theoretical results on the global robust exponential stability of interval fuzzy Cohen-Grossberg networks with piecewise constant argument. As a special case, the corresponding results of interval fuzzy recurrent neural networks with piecewise constant argument are derived. Three examples are given for illustrating validity of the obtained results. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
