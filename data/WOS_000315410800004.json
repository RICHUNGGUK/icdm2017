Computer-assisted solutions can help to detect and suggest replacements. In this paper, we present a new string distance metric for the Persian language to rank respelling suggestions of a misspelled Persian word by considering the effects of keyboard layout on typographical spelling errors as well as the homomorphic and homophonic aspects of words for orthographical misspellings. We also consider the misspellings caused by disregarded diacritics. Since the proposed string distance metric is custom-designed for the Persian language, we present the spelling aspects of the Persian language such as homomorphs, homophones, and diacritics. We then present our statistical analysis of a set of large Persian corpora to identify the causes and the types of Persian spelling errors. We show that the proposed string distance metric has a higher mean average precision and a higher mean reciprocal rank in ranking respelling candidates of Persian misspellings in comparison with other metrics such as the Hamming, Levenshtein, Damerau-Levenshtein, Wagner-Fischer, and Jaro-Winkler metrics.", "paper_title": "A novel string distance metric for ranking Persian respelling suggestions", "paper_id": "WOS:000315410800004"}
