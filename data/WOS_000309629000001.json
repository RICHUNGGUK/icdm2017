Based on three-dimensional Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations, the distinct features associated with the evolution of internal granular structure and different anisotropy sources during drained/undrained shearing of granular samples are carefully examined. The study finds that static liquefaction occurs when the geometrical anisotropy in a sample dominates the mechanical anisotropy in the overall shear strength, and the weak force network features an exceptionally high proportion of sliding contacts and develops certain degree of anisotropy. Phase transformation corresponds to a transitional, unstable state associated with a dramatic change in both coordination number and the proportion of sliding contacts in all contacts. The critical state in a granular material is always associated with a highly anisotropic fabric structure wherein both the critical void ratio and critical fabric anisotropy are uniquely related to the mean effective stress. The relations provide a more comprehensive definition for the critical state in granular media with proper reference to the critical fabric anisotropy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
