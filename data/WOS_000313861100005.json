Previously, the best algorithm was due to Byrka (2007). Byrka proposed an algorithm parametrized by gamma and used it with gamma approximate to 1.6774. By either running his algorithm or the algorithm proposed by Jain, Mandian and Saberi (STOC'02), Byrka obtained an algorithm that gives expected approximation ratio 1.5. We show that if gamma is randomly selected, the approximation ratio can be improved to 1.488. Our algorithm cuts the gap with the 1.463 approximability lower bound by almost 1/3.
