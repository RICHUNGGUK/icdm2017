In these organizations, knowledge usually serves as the means for attainment of competitive advantage. It is clear that organizational knowledge has to be carefully managed, and knowledge management measurement is important to businesses. In this paper, corporate memory (CM) is viewed as an organization memory for managing knowledge. Generically and concretely, CM is constructed using analytical knowledge (AK), which is defined as the knowledge formatted with 5W1H (who, when, where, what, why, and how). AK is extracted from data storage systems and domain experts by aggregating information, where data analysts, knowledge workers, and knowledge users are involved in a knowledge discovery process. The research objective of this study is to propose a measurement approach, which provides a generic and applicable methodology for measuring the performance and quality of CM. To represent the uncertainty and fuzzy terms in the evaluation environments, and to explicate the invisible impact induced by information technology (IT), the fuzzy set theory is applied. An effective procedure is also proposed to apply the measurement approach in practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
