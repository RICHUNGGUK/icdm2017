A number of algorithms are known for constructing sparse spanners with small multiplicative or additive stretch. Recently, algorithms were introduced for constructing fault-tolerant multiplicative spanners of general graphs. This paper addresses the analogous problem of constructing fault tolerant additive and (mu, alpha)-spanners for general graphs, and presents a number of (deterministic and randomized) construction algorithms for such spanners.
