In the I day and I week ahead prediction of foreign exchange rates forecasting, the neural networks with the weekly input data performs better than the random walk models. In the I month ahead prediction of foreign exchange rates forecasting, only the special neural networks with weekly input data perform better than the random walk models. Because the weekly data contain the appropriate fluctuation information of foreign exchange rates, it can balance the noise of daily data and losing information of monthly data.", "paper_title": "Comparisons of the different frequencies of input data for neural networks in foreign exchange rates forecasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500072"}
