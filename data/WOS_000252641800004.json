This system combines an articulated 3D model of a virtual newborn with text-based descriptions of its physiological and behavioral responses, enabling medical experts to easily construct, simulate and revise an arbitrary postnatal critical situation. Afterwards, the resulting descriptions of newborn's behavior can be used for technical specifications (and even for automatic generation) of more complex behavioral models, such as finite-state automata.
