In this class of approaches, the weights of the feature elements (FEs) are adjusted based on the relevance feedbacks (RFs) given by the users to reduce the so-called semantic gap in the underlying CBIR system. An analytical approach is proposed in this paper to convert the users' feedbacks to the appropriate FE weights by solving a constrained optimization problem. Experiments on a set of 11,000 images from the Corel database show that the proposed approach outperforms other existing short-term RF approaches reported in the literature. The proposed approach is also incorporated in two long-term RF methods and enhanced their performance.", "paper_title": "A FEATURE RELEVANCE ESTIMATION METHOD FOR CONTENT-BASED IMAGE RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000294612300009"}
