Under these circumstances that the influence of SMS is getting bigger bigger, which factors make users participate and work in the social media service and how relatively important these factors are between them need to be examined. But SMS are different from the existing information systems. Most information systems are task-oriented, that is, the systems aim to provide users with useful information for better decision making. Therefore, a different approach is required. In this research, we examine and select the main factors which affect users' social media service use, and evaluate relative importance degrees of each factor on the basis of relationships between the factors with Analytic Network Process (ANP).", "paper_title": "Relative weight evaluation of the factors inducing social media service use", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214900004"}
