Ontologies specify the knowledge shared by a community of a target domain in an explicit and formal way. The present work deals with the problem of ontology construction for the Semantic Web. The objective of the paper is to propose a solution for the representation of Web knowledge by means of ontologies as well as to define an approach to their semi-automatic construction. The implementation and the experimentation of the proposition were achieved by the development of a framework, called \"OntoCoSemWeb\" and an On-Line Information Retrieval tool using the generated ontologies. An evaluation and an analysis of the results of this approach were carried out.", "paper_title": "A model-driven approach of ontological components for on-line Semantic Web information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000253929800003"}
