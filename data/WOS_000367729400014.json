In this article, a radio system based on OAM, called an RV system, is proposed. Specifically, a vortex modulation method and an azimuthal angle integral method are developed for the transmitter and receiver of the proposed RV system, respectively. Different from the conventional radio system, vortex signals are generated by the vortex modulation method and are multiplexed to provide remarkable improvement of capacity without increasing the bandwidth in the proposed RV system. Simulation results are conducted to verify that the proposed RV system could achieve higher capacity than the traditional radio system in free space.", "paper_title": "RADIO VORTEX FOR FUTURE WIRELESS BROADBAND COMMUNICATIONS WITH HIGH CAPACITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000367729400014"}
