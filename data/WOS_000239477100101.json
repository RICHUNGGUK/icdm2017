Cognitively oriented and socially oriented support are enabled by two technologies, namely heuristic-based feedback generation and community-datadriven social recommendation. Formal representations and corresponding automated reasoning procedures for these technologies are introduced.", "paper_title": "VIBRANT: A brainstorming agent for computer supported creative problem solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100101"}
