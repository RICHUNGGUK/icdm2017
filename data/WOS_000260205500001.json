In this paper, several new facilities are introduced for this. Numeric and curve parameters are presented for specification and variation of freeform surface feature models. Several properties of the parameters can be defined, such as the direction of evaluation for a curve parameter. In addition to parameters present in features, other parameters can be added to a feature model, including intersection curves between features. To provide these facilities, a new three-level structure is introduced, which includes a partially evaluated model that can capture new generic model entities, including feature intersection curves. The work has been implemented in a prototype surface feature modelling system with functionality for feature class definition, feature model creation, and advanced feature model variation through the new types of parameters.
