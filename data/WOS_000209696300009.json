We extend such distributed TDMA approaches to multiple channels (frequencies). This is achieved by extending the concept of collaborative reactive listening in order to balance the number of nodes in all available channels. We prove the stability of the new protocol and estimate the delay until the balanced system state is reached. Our approach is benchmarked against single-channel distributed TDMA and channel hopping approaches using TinyOS imote2 wireless sensors.", "paper_title": "Distributed Time-Frequency Division Multiple Access Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300009"}
