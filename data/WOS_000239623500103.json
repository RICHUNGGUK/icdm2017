Different from traditional five-parameter method, the method is composed of feature extraction, feature selection using rough set theory and combinatorial classifier. Support vector clustering, support vector classification and Mahalanobis distance are integrated to design an efficient combinatorial classifier. 155 radar emitter signals with 8 intra-pulse modulations are used to make simulation experiments. It is proved to be a valid and practical method.", "paper_title": "Intra-pulse modulation recognition of advanced radar emitter signals using intelligent recognition method", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500103"}
