In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for characteristic tracking on two-dimensional unstructured triangular meshes. Numerical experiments, including an example for applying this algorithm with the Eulerian-Lagrangian localized adjoint method (ELLAM) to solve a convection-dominated convection-diffusion problem, are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of this algorithm.", "paper_title": "An efficient algorithm for characteristic tracking on two-dimensional triangular meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000247463700002"}
