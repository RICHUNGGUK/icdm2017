One interest on ensemble generation involves the multi-objective approach, which attempts to generate both accurate and diverse members that fulfill the theoretical requirements of good ensembles. These methods resolve common difficulties of balancing the trade-off between accuracy and diversity and have been shown to be advantageous over single-objective methods. This study presents an up-to-date survey on multi-objective ensemble generation methods, including widely used diversity measures, member generation, selection, and integration techniques. Challenges and potential applications of multi-objective ensemble generation are also discussed.
