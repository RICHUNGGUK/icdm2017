In this paper, a new technique to improve the performance of transmission with the correlated Rayleigh-fading signals is proposed. In conventional array systems, individual receivers start sampling the received signals at the same time with the same sampling rate. On the other hand, in the proposed scheme, the received signals are again sampled with the same rate, however the sampling points are shifted in each receiver. Numerical results through computer simulation show that with correlated received signals, by applying the proposed technique the correlation can be reduced to a sufficient level for diversity reception.", "paper_title": "Multipath Diversity through Time Shifted Sampling for Spatially Correlated OFDM-Antenna Array Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600003"}
