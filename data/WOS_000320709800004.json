A new lattice invariant called the secrecy gain is used as a code design criterion for wiretap lattice codes since it was shown to characterize the confusion that a chosen lattice can cause at the eavesdropper: the higher the secrecy gain of the lattice, the more confusion. In this paper, secrecy gains of extremal odd unimodular lattices as well as unimodular lattices in dimension n, 16 <= n <= 23, are computed, covering the four extremal odd unimodular lattices and all the 111 nonextremal unimodular lattices (both odd and even), providing thus a classification of the best wiretap lattice codes coming from unimodular lattices in dimension n, 8 < n <= 23. Finally, to permit lattice encoding via Construction A, the corresponding error correction codes of the best lattices are determined.", "paper_title": "A Classification of Unimodular Lattice Wiretap Codes in Small Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000320709800004"}
