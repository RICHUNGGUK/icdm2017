Although the light-weight and small-size body of such a humanoid robot facilitates safer and smoother experiments of agile motions involving large accelerations and impacts, building a complex humanoid system in a small body is still a challenging problem. Simultaneous requirements for wider motion ranges, higher rigidity, less fragile electric devices and circuits, and less sensitive electric wiring should be satisfied in a limited space. In order to meet them by overcoming the difficulties, we propose to mechanically modularize joint structures, and to equip a centralized electric control unit involving PC boards, sensing devices, signal-processors, communication boards, and power amplifiers. The developments of the mechanical modules and the centralized unit are made for two miniature humanoid robots. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
