The paper shows that the discretization of the conservative and non-conservative forms of the SWEs leads to the same finite difference scheme when the source term is discretized in a certain way. The non-conservative form is used in the solution outlined herein, since this formulation is simpler and more efficient. The time step is determined adaptively, based on the maximum instantaneous Courant number across the domain. The bed friction is included either explicitly or implicitly in the computational algorithm according to the local water depth. The wetting and drying process is simulated in a manner which complements the use of operator-splitting and two-stage numerical schemes. The numerical model was then applied to a hypothetical dam-break scenario, an experimental dam-break case and an extreme flooding event over the Toce River valley physical model. The predicted results are free of spurious oscillations for both sub- and super-critical flows, and the predictions compare favourably with the experimental measurements.
