This proposed method has firstly been verified through an experimental triaxial test on a reinforced sand specimen. A normalized relation was established between the volumetric change and the axial strain of soil to enable the analysis of granular material behavior under a continuous increase in lateral pressure. The analytical results show that the reinforced granular columns embedded in clay behave differently from granular columns subjected only to a constant confining pressure. It is found that reinforcing a column with a sleeve at the top portion will be adequate to prevent the column from bulging and also improve its load carrying capacity. The optimum skirting length that a sleeve call deter a granular column from bulging depends oil the characteristics of the in situ soil and the stiffness and yield strength of the sleeve.
