The optimisation model aims at minimising fuel consumption and emissions in combined-cycle power plants. The results presented are of significant importance for power plants operators that have the possibility of frequently connecting and disconnecting to the power grid. By optimising power generation periods and levels, downtimes and maintenance scheduling, the operators ensure that the plant operates at a high efficiency level in periods when fuel prices are high. High efficiency levels ensure low fuel consumption and emission levels. The work presented in this paper was implemented as a product prototype at ABB Utility Automation in 2003 and patented in 2005, [1].", "paper_title": "Scheduling of gas turbine compressor washing", "paper_id": "WOS:000235413800008"}
