The construction is a generalization of some known constructions. Within the framework of this generic construction, several classes of authentication codes using certain classes of error-correcting codes are described. The authentication codes presented in this paper are better than known ones with comparable parameters. It is demonstrated that the construction is related to certain combinatorial designs, such as difference matrices and generalized Hadamard matrices.", "paper_title": "A generic construction of Cartesian authentication codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000246862300016"}
