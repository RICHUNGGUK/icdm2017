Aleatory uncertainty is usually represented with probability and leads to cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) or complementary CDFs (CCDFs) for analysis results of interest. Several mathematical structures are available for the representation of epistemic uncertainty, including interval analysis, possibility theory, evidence theory and probability theory. In the presence of epistemic uncertainty, there is not a single CDF or CCDF for a given analysis result. Rather, there is a family of CDFs and a corresponding family of CCDFs that derive from epistemic uncertainty and have an uncertainty structure that derives from the particular uncertainty structure (e.g. interval analysis, possibility theory, evidence theory or probability theory) used to represent epistemic uncertainty. Graphical formats for the representation of epistemic uncertainty in families of CDFs and CCDFs are investigated and presented for the indicated characterisations of epistemic uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Representation of analysis results involving aleatory and epistemic uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000279618000002"}
