For the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of service and network, ensuring end-to-end QoS (Quality of Service) becomes a challenge in service composition. This paper proposes a distributed QoS registry architecture, in which QoS registries could maintain services cooperatively and exchange information. Then we present a model combining network QoS and service QoS together to show their impact on end-toend QoS. Based on the distributed QoS registry and combined QoS model, we present a distributed service selection algorithm to find optimal service composition plan. Experimental results show that the algorithm achieves excellent selection result with outstanding performance in our architecture.", "paper_title": "On distributed service selection for QoS driven service composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241159700018"}
