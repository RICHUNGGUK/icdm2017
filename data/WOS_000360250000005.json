Such periodic sequences should have a series of cryptographic properties in order to resist many attack methods. The binary generalized cyclotomic periodic sequences, constructed by the cyclotomic classes over finite fields, have good pseudo-random properties and correlation properties. In this paper, the linear complexity and minimal polynomials of some generalized cyclotomic sequences over GF(q) have been determined where g = p(m) and p is an odd prime. Results show that these sequences have high linear complexity over GF(q) for a large part of odd prime power q, which means they can resist the linear attack method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
