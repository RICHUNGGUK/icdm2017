The advent of computer based Geographic Information Systems (GIs) has allowed users to explore different scenarios using a variety of data. This paper describes the development of specialised GIs tools, via thin-client technology, to assist policy makers, donor organisations and Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) understand how the interactions between changing land use (particularly land uses involving forestry, irrigation and soil water conservation structures) and climate affect water resources and people's livelihoods. The research brings together hydrological and socio-economic models with easy to use user interfaces. It is expected that the EXCLAIM tool will help to support the \"Bridging Research And Policy\" process and encourage the development of evidence based (rather than presently often myth based) land and water policies, especially in relation to watershed development projects.
