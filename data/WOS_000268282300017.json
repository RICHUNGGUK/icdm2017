In this paper, bandwidth smoothing is formulated into a binary classification problem of the underflow and overflow points. We propose a novel method to solve that problem based on support vector machine (SVM). Our method is proven to be able to achieve the minimum buffer requirements of constant rate transmission and transport. Furthermore, it directly computes the transmission rate without exhaustively searching buffer size and startup delay. Besides this method, this paper provides a systematic video segmentation algorithm, which can intelligently partition the playback curve into some unequal segments to naturally track the trends of playback curve. The smoothing results with the playback curve of demonstrate that this video systematic segmentation requires smaller than half of the buffer of the equal segmentation algorithm. Finally, we construct a generalized piecewise constant rate transmission and transport algorithm with SVM and the systematic video segmentation method. The experiments of some real MPEG4 and H.264 video data confirmed the efficiency of our proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Generalized PCRTT Offline Bandwidth Smoothing Based on SVM and Systematic Video Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000268282300017"}
