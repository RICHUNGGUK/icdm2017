In this paper, we introduce a new clustering algorithm. This algorithm, based on granular computing, constructs a hypergraph (simplicial complex) by the hypergraph bisection algorithm. It will discover the similarities and associations among documents. In some experiments on Web data, the proposed algorithm is used; the results are quite satisfactory.
