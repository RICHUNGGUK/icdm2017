In this work, randomization test (RT) is used as a gene selection method for dealing with gene expression data. In the method, a statistic derived from the statistics of the regression coefficients in a series of partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLSDA) models is used to evaluate the significance of the genes. Informative genes are selected for classifying the four gene expression datasets of prostate cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and the rationality of the results is validated by multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling and principal component analysis (PCA). With the selected genes, satisfactory results can be obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
