In contrast to many experimental results, relatively few rigorous analyses of RWalkSAT are available. Up to now, runtime results of small density random 3-SAT have been achieved showing RWalkSAT terminates successfully in linear time up to clause density 1.63. This paper presents a rigorous runtime analysis of RWalkSAT for 3-CNF formulas generated under the planted assignment distribution. It proves that with overwhelming probability, when starting from any initial assignment vertical bar x vertical bar < 0.9999n, the expected number of steps until RWalkSAT on random planted formulas with a large constant density finds the planted assignment (1, ... , 1) is at least Omega(1.1514(n)) and at most O(n(2)1.1517(n)).", "paper_title": "Exponential bounds for the random walk algorithm on random planted 3-SAT", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600012"}
