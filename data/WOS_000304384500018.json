The fluid was initially at rest and rigid body rotation was expected to be reached. However, as the simulation proceeded, the DP's (Dissipative Particles) began accumulating near the wall, leaving the cylinder's core empty of DP's, obviously, an aphysical solution. To solve this problem it was suggested to set the cutoff radius as a function of the DP's number density. A conceptual explanation is suggested. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
