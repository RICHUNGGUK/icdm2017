A Poisson binomial distribution (PBD) over is the distribution of a sum of independent Bernoulli random variables which may have arbitrary, potentially non-equal, expectations. These distributions were first studied by Poisson (Recherches sur la ProbabilitS des jugements en mati, criminelle et en mati,re civile. Bachelier, Paris, 1837) and are a natural -parameter generalization of the familiar Binomial Distribution. Surprisingly, prior to our work this basic learning problem was poorly understood, and known results for it were far from optimal. We essentially settle the complexity of the learning problem for this basic class of distributions. As our first main result we give a highly efficient algorithm which learns to -accuracy (with respect to the total variation distance) using samples independent of . The running time of the algorithm is quasilinear in the size of its input data, i.e., bit-operations (we write to hide factors which are polylogarithmic in the argument to ; thus, for example, denotes a quantity which is for some absolute constant . Observe that each draw from the distribution is a -bit string). Our second main result is a proper learning algorithm that learns to -accuracy using samples, and runs in time . This sample complexity is nearly optimal, since any algorithm for this problem must use samples. We also give positive and negative results for some extensions of this learning problem to weighted sums of independent Bernoulli random variables.", "paper_title": "Learning Poisson Binomial Distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000352434300014"}
