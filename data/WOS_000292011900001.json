Several simulations conducted at nanoscale using different power supplies, load capacitors, frequencies and temperatures demonstrate the superiority of the proposed design in terms of delay and power-delay product (POP) compared to the other cells. In addition the proposed structure improves the robustness and reduces sensitivity to the process variations of the other Bridge-Cap Full Adder cell already presented in the literature.
