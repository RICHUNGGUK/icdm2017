This quantifier was introduced by Bojanczyk to express some asymptotic properties. Since it is not hard to see that each language expressible in MSO vertical bar U is projective, our finding solves the topological complexity of MSO vertical bar U. The result can immediately be transferred from omega- words to infinite labelled trees. As a consequence of the topological hardness we note that no alternating automaton with a Borel acceptance condition - or even with an acceptance condition of a bounded projective complexity - can capture all of MSO + U. The same holds for deterministic and nondeterministic automata since they are special cases of alternating ones. We also give exact topological complexities of related classes of languages recognized by nondeterministic omega B-, omega S- and omega BS-automata studied by Bojanczyk and Colcombet. Furthermore, we show that corresponding alternating automata have higher topological complexity than nondeterministic ones - they inhabit all finite levels of the Borel hierarchy. The paper is an extended journal version of [8].
