Due to the fact that the extremely large number of factors affect track irregularity, it is challenging to find a concise yet effective mathematical method to describe the evolution of track irregularity. In this paper, inspection data generated by GJ-4 track inspection cars from Jinan Railway Bureau in China were analyzed to identify the characteristics of track irregularity changes common to different mileage points. Based on these characteristics, a multi-stage linear fitting model to describe the pattern of track irregularity evolution over time was developed. The availability of new inspection data will make the model revise itself. In this sense, the model is a machine learning model. Finally, inspection data from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Line (Jing-Hu Line) were used to verify the model.", "paper_title": "Novel Description Method for Track Irregularity Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000029"}
