We have performed mean field analysis for the phase diagram, the density profiles, and the currents, which is in good agreement with the Monte Carlo simulations. In particular, in the special case that the diffusive channels are identical, the phase boundaries have been derived explicitly. It is shown that, in the driven part, the low density high density region and the low density region shrink and will finally vanish with the increase of the number of diffusive channels. On the other hand, the high density region and the low density high density region vanish if the total number of particles keeps constant. Numerical examples indicate that these features might be extended to a general case in which the diffusive channels are not identical. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
