In this paper proposes, we propose an integrated multilayer traffic engineering framework that considers both physical and logical (optical layer) topologies for dynamically admitting new label switched paths (LSPs) in GMPLS networks. The dynamic admission control mechanism is based on an optimal resolution of an integer linear programming model that takes into account both lightpaths availability, wavelength continuity and routing constraints. In order to minimize LSPs set up delays, this mechanism first considers the logical topology (set of lightpaths) that is already in place before setting up a new lightpath for the incoming LSP, resulting in an additional set up signaling delay. When tested by simulations, results confirm that the proposed formulation effectively improves the network performance by reducing the connection blocking rate, while guaranteeing strict delay and noise constraints.
