Although functional performance specifications and adequacy of various design forms can be measured directly and objectively, many designers and engineers struggle with clearly evaluating product criteria requiring subjective consumer input; the fact that these inputs change over time further complicates the process. To appropriately evaluate product criteria, an effective design decision-making analysis is required. In this study, we propose a methodology to assure effective elicitation of needs and their inclusion in design decision making and illustrate it using a mobile phone product family design scenario. First, consumer perceived utility of design features is gathered using a questionnaire (500+ responses) and then modeled using multi- attribute utility theory to facilitate the evaluation of a product family while responding to needs across customer clusters shaped by demographics. The methodology goal is to determine the relative goodness of a product family in comparison to its competition. We also compare and evaluate the application of the proposed method to conjoint analysis.", "paper_title": "Perceived feature utility-based product family design: a mobile phone case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000324334700006"}
