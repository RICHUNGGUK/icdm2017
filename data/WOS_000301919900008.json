The characteristics of subtle difference among products and rapid change of production states in the line need effective production management. However, traditional paper-based or phone-based manual management is time-consuming, error-prone and frequently damaged, so it impedes capturing and collection of real-time production information, and then it is impossible to realise real-time production management. To tackle these issues and meet the requirements, we design a production management system (PMS) integrated with an radio frequency identification (RFID)-enabled real-time data capture system for Loncin motorcycle assembly line. RFID technology is employed to collect the real-time production information (e. g. raw material, Work In Process (WIP), staff, etc.), which can enhance the visibility, track ability and traceability of items of interest. The solution to deploy RFID on the line is proposed. Then, on the basis of real-time production information, the framework and integrated operation mode of corresponding RFID-enabled real-time PMS are established to facilitate the dynamically changing manufacturing activities. Moreover, the explorers of PMS for operators and assembly line supervisors show how to manage and execute production. The application results show that the productivity and quality are obviously improved.", "paper_title": "RFID-enabled real-time production management system for Loncin motorcycle assembly line", "paper_id": "WOS:000301919900008"}
