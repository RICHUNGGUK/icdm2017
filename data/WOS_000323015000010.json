We consider an initial partial assessment consistent with either probability or possibility or necessity, then we study the upper and lower envelopes of all possible extensions. By resorting to a notion of weak logical independence we get as lower or upper envelope a possibility or a necessity, respectively, starting either from a probability or from a possibility or from a necessity.
