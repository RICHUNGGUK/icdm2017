The satisfaction levels awarded to the questions of students' answerscripts are represented by fuzzy numbers associated with degrees of confidence between zero and one. The arithmetic operations between the alpha-cuts of fuzzy numbers are used to evaluate the total mark of each student, where alpha is an element of [0 1]. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of the methods presented by Biswas (1994) and Chen and Lee (1999). It can evaluate students' answerscripts in a more flexible and more intelligent manner.", "paper_title": "Evaluating students' answerscripts using fuzzy numbers associated with degrees of confidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500011"}
