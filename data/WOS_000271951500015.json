This mirror symmetry is interpreted as a manifestation of the linear codebook-level duality between Slepian-Wolf coding and channel coding. Furthermore, this duality, in conjunction with a systematic analysis of the expurgated exponents, reveals that nonlinear Slepian-Wolf codes can strictly outperform linear Slepian-Wolf codes in terms of rate-error tradeoff at high rates. The linear codebook-level duality is also established for general sources and channels.", "paper_title": "On the Linear Codebook-Level Duality Between Slepian-Wolf Coding and Channel Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000271951500015"}
