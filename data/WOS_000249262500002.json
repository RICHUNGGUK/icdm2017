Currently, however, most building models do not have sufficient and accurate texture information. The lack of texture not only makes 3D building models less realistic in visualization, it may also fail to provide needed information in intricate applications. This study developed a polygon- based texture mapping system to produce near photo- realistic texture mappings for 3D building models. Textures of building exteriors were generated from mosaics of close- range photographs acquired with commodity digital cameras. The developed system integrated multiple digital photographs to create texture mosaics that were continuous in geometric outlines and smooth in colour shadings, and correctly mapped them onto corresponding building model facades. A test example demonstrated that the resultant building model had more complete and accurate texture features as well as a near- photo- realistic appearance.", "paper_title": "Polygon-based texture mapping for cyber city 3D building models", "paper_id": "WOS:000249262500002"}
