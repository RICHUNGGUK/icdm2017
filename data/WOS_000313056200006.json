In this contribution, a method for efficient decoding of Gabidulin codes up to their error correcting capability is shown. The new decoding algorithm for Gabidulin codes (defined over ) directly provides the evaluation polynomial of the transmitted codeword. This approach can be seen as a Gao-like algorithm and uses an equivalent of the Euclidean Algorithm. In order to achieve low complexity, a fast symbolic product and a fast symbolic division are presented. The complexity of the whole decoding algorithm for Gabidulin codes is operations over the ground field F-q.", "paper_title": "Fast decoding of Gabidulin codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200006"}
