First, as the formulation stage, we consider reliability and robustness simultaneously to propose the new formulation of reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO) problems. In order to generate reliable and robust Pareto-optimal solutions, the combination of genetic algorithm with reliability assessment loop based on the performance measure approach is applied as the second stage. Next, we develop two criteria to select a solution from obtained Pareto-optimal set to achieve the best possible implementation. Finally, the result verification is performed with Monte Carlo Simulations and also the quality improvement during manufacturing process is considered by identifying and controlling the critical variables. The effectiveness and applicability of this new proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
