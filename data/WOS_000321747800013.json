It implements three types of multivariate tests that encompass all commonly used association tests for rare variants. The input files can be generated from the accompanying software SCORE-Seq. This bundle of programs allows analysis of large sequencing studies in a time and memory efficient manner.", "paper_title": "MASS: meta-analysis of score statistics for sequencing studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000321747800013"}
