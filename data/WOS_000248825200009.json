These devices are in turn showing more computational capabilities. It is therefore possible to envision a near future where client applications may be deployed on these devices. There are, however, constraints that hinder this deployment, especially the limited communication bandwidth and storage space available. This paper describes the Efficient XML Data Exchange Manager (EXEM) that combines context-dependent lossy and lossless compression mechanisms used to support lightweight exchange of objects in XML format between server and client applications. The lossy compression mechanism reduces the size of XML messages by using known information about the application. The lossless compression mechanism decouples data and metadata (compression dictionary) content. We illustrate the use of EXEM with a prototype implementation of the lossless compression mechanism that shows the optimization of the available resources on the server and the mobile client. These experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the EXEM approach for XML data exchange in the context of mobile application development.", "paper_title": "EXEM: Efficient XML data exchange management for mobile applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000248825200009"}
