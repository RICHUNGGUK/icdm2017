A cascaded linear systems approach wherein several parameter values were estimated using Monte Carlo methods was used to model the image formation process of a single-side read \"flying spot'' CR system using a granular phosphor. Objective image quality metrics such as modulation transfer function and detective quantum efficiency were determined using this model and show good agreement with published empirical data. A model such as that addressed in this work could allow for improved understanding of the effect of storage phosphor physical properties and CR reader parameters on objective image quality metrics for existing and evolving CR systems.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Performance Characteristics of Computed Radiography (CR) Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276308800018"}
