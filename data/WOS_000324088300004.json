In this paper, we propose an efficient method for the estimation of parameters and quantiles of the three-parameter lognormal distribution, which avoids the problem of unbounded likelihood, by using statistics that are invariant to unknown location. Through a Monte Carlo simulation study, we then show that the proposed method performs well compared to other prominent methods in terms of both bias and mean-squared error. Finally, we present two illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "Parameter and quantile estimation for the three-parameter lognormal distribution based on statistics invariant to unknown location", "paper_id": "WOS:000324088300004"}
