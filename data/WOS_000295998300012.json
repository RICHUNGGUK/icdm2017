Unlike barcode technology, RFID enables accurate real-time visibility, which in turn enables several process improvements. We analyze the impact of automatic counting and discuss the system redesign critical to optimizing the inventory policy and eliminating shrinkage. We show that continuous review is superior to periodic review whenever accurate real-time information is available at no additional cost. We explain how RFID-enabled strategies vary with inventory parameters and provide a cost-benefit analysis for the implementation of RFID for the radiology practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
