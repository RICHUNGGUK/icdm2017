We consider to estimate Q(lambda) by nonparametric maximum likelihood (NPML) method under two scenarios: (1) the likelihood is penalized by a functional g(Q); and (2)Q is under a constraint g(Q) = g(0). We propose a simple and reliable algorithm termed VDM/ECM for Q-estimation when the likelihood is penalized by a linear functional. We show this algorithm can be applied to a more general situation where the penalty is not linear, but a function of linear functionals by a linearization procedure. The constrained NPMLE can be found by penalizing the quadratic distance vertical bar g(Q) - g(0)vertical bar(2) under a large penalty factor gamma > 0 using this algorithm. The algorithm is illustrated with two real data sets. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
