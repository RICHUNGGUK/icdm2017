Such documentation may involve substantial effort, particularly in the case of large. densely-built regions. This paper proposes a method for generating parcelation proposals based on the geometric concept of equal partitioning and on existing, in situ, physical evidence. Airborne laser scanning data is used to generate partitions. Laser scanning data enables the detection of buildings around which parcel boundaries are established as well as weak cues that indicate the existence of physical parcel boundaries. We show that, even with modest resolution, such cues can be found within the data and utilized. Coverage of large geographic areas by airborne laser scanning data makes the proposed model applicable to wide regions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
