We predicted that playing a violent video game using an IVET platform would lead to increased presence and aggressive feelings and behavior compared to playing on a less immersive desktop platform. The results of two experiments supported this hypothesis. The data suggest that presence mediated the relationship between playing platform and aggressive feelings but not the relationship between playing platform and aggressive behavior. Finally, we explored the utility of using cardiovascular measures within this research paradigm.", "paper_title": "Immersive virtual video game play and presence: Influences on aggressive feelings and behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000252667000005"}
