Most of these methodologies target the software architecture level of systems, with limited work investigating the performance of database designs and systems. In this paper, we present a categorization of queueing network performance models of database systems in the literature. These models are classified based on the level of detail at which database transactions are modelled. In addition, we present a survey and evaluation of performance evaluation methodologies proposed to map database system specifications onto queueing network models with appropriate workloads. The paper identifies future research directions that should encourage a wider application of these methodologies in mainstream industrial practice. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
