This scheme starts from a basic anchor-node-based distributed localization (ADL) using grid scan with the information of anchor nodes within two-hop distance. Even though the localization accuracy of ADL is higher than that of previous schemes (e. g., DRLS), estimation error can be propagated when the ratio of anchor nodes is low. Thus, after each normal node estimates the initial position with ADL, it checks whether the position needs to be corrected because of the insufficient anchors within two-hop distance, that is, the node is in sparse anchor area. If correction needs, the initial position is repositioned using hop progress by the information of anchor nodes located several hops away so that error propagation is reduced (REP); the hop progress is an estimated hop distance using probability based on the density of sensor nodes. Results via in-depth simulation show that ADL has about 12% higher localization accuracy and about 10% lower message transmission cost than DRLS. In addition, the localization accuracy of ADL with REP is about 30% higher than that of DRLS, even though message transmission cost is increased.", "paper_title": "Anchor-Node-Based Distributed Localization with Error Correction in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303768000001"}
