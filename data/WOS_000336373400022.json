The main goal of IS is to improve resource (materials, waste, energy) efficiency and lead to mutual environmental, financial and social benefits to participants. In this paper we present a semantic approach for IS input/output matching. This approach is based on knowledge modelling and ontologies. Ontologies are used to model all resources - waste, water, energy - along with details about their composition, characteristics (chemical and physical) and tacit knowledge about their flow. The input/output matching algorithm presented enables the valorisation of resources through industrial symbiosis networks. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
