These low-dimensional features facilitate in situ decision-making in diverse applications, such as computer vision, structural health monitoring, and robotics. Wavelet transforms of time series have been widely used for feature extraction owing to their time-frequency localization properties. In this regard, this paper presents a symbolic dynamics-based method to model surface images, generated by wavelet coefficients in the scale-shift space. These symbolic dynamics-based models (e.g., probabilistic finite state automata (PFSA)) capture the relevant information, embedded in the sensor data, from the associated Perron-Frobenius operators (i.e., the state-transition probability matrices). The proposed method of pattern classification has been experimentally validated on laboratory apparatuses for two different applications: (i) early detection of evolving damage in polycrystalline alloy structures, and (ii) classification of mobile robots and their motion profiles.
