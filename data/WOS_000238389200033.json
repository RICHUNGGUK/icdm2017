A partition scheme is developed through domain decomposition and loading balance is considered for scheduling jobs on machines with different efficiencies. Using sp(3)d(5)s* tight-binding model, the Hamiltonian matrix of the SiNW is constructed and its eigenvalues are extracted with the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi Method. Parallel calculation performance is tested on identical machines finally and a linear speedup is gained as the number of nodes increases.", "paper_title": "Computation of Si nanowire bandstructures on parallel machines through domain decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200033"}
