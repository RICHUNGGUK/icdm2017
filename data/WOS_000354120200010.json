The algorithm combines the advantages of the efficiency of DGM mesh deformation and the better control of the near surface mesh quality from the RBF method. The Delaunay graph is used to divide the mesh domain into a number of sub-domains. On each of the sub-domains, the radial basis function is applied to build a much smaller sized translation matrix between the original mesh and the deformed mesh, resulting in a similar efficiency for the mesh deformation as compared to the fast Delaunay graph mapping method. Furthermore, by separating the translation and rotation motion, the mesh quality near the wall can be substantially improved for extremely large rotational deformation. The paper will show how the near-wall mesh quality is controlled and improved by the new method while the computational time is maintained to be comparable to the original Delaunay graph mapping method.
