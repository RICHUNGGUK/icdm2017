Moreover, real-time communication further enhances the efficient sharing of knowledge and experiences within a collaborative group. Therefore, this paper proposes a premier synchronous collaboration system for learning entity-relationship model, called SCLERA to enable students to learn data model in the database field in a real-time cooperation manner. This paper first describes the design methodology of SCLERD, including network protocol and software architecture. Then system performance and educational evaluation are conducted to verify the system's feasibility and efficiency. The results of performance evaluation show that current devices and bandwidth can easily afford the needs of SCLERD. The results of educational evaluation unveil that most of students in the experiment group have better learning achievement than those in the control group. Also, all evaluated items receive positive feedback from the results of questionnaire.", "paper_title": "A SYNCHRONOUS COOPERATION SYSTEM FOR LEARNING ENTITY-RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648400023"}
