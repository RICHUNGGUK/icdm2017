These minor differences may average out while trying to synthesize the face image of a given per son, or while building a model of face image in automatic face recognition. In this paper, we propose a template-matching approach for face verification, which neither synthesizes the face image nor builds a model of the face image. Template matching is performed using an edginess-based representation of the face image. The edginess-based representation of face images is computed using 1-D processing of images. An approach is proposed based on autoassociative neural network models to verify the identity of a person. The issues of pose and illumination in face verification are addressed.", "paper_title": "Face verification using template matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000248832500016"}
