However, current models have pitfalls associated with their strong assumptions. Here, we propose a new implementation designed to overcome some of these pitfalls using an empirical Bayes algorithm. Results: Here we introduce NAM, an R package that allows user to take into account prior information regarding population stratification to relax the linkage phase assumption of current methods. It allows markers to be treated as a random effect to increase the resolution, and uses a sliding-window strategy to increase power and avoid double fitting markers into the model.", "paper_title": "NAM: association studies in multiple populations", "paper_id": "WOS:000366378400027"}
