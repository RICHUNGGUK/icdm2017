According to theory of chaotic phase space, the paper established four models of the single-point, multi-point, lineal, and three-parameter D(m, T,k) models, they have stronger non-linear mapping function and much more information in the time series than traditional ways. Findings - The results of calculation show that the models are highly effective and worthy of popularization and application. It is reasonable and superior to use these models in mid- and long-term hydrologic prediction Research limitations/implications - The method cannot reduce or eliminate the un-prediction parts caused by the inner random factors, such as the noise information of the observed data Practical implications - The models are applied in the long-term runoff prediction of Baishan reservoir Originality/value - The new approach of hydrology forecasting due to the theory of chaotic phase space The paper is aimed at hydrology forecasting researches and engineers, especially those who dealt with the mid- and long-term prediction", "paper_title": "Similarity model of chaos phase space and its application in mid- and long-term hydrologic prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500023"}
