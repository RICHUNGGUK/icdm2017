Round-like shapes are utilized as the filter shape to calculate of the Hessian determinant. D-xy can be acquired from approximate round areas, while the regions for computing D-yy or D-xx are designed with the consideration to symmetry and a balance of pixel number. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method has higher repeatability than the one used in SURF, especially in the aspects of rotation and viewpoint, due to the centrosymmetry of the proposed filter shapes. The results of image matching also show that more ?recision can be gained with the application of proposed detector.", "paper_title": "Improving Hessian Matrix Detector for SURF", "paper_id": "WOS:000289921900020"}
