On the other hand, these networks have enormous potential applicability, e.g.,- habitat monitoring, medical care, military surveillance or traffic control. Many protocols have been developed for Wireless Sensor Networks that try to overcome the constraints that characterize this type of networks. Ant-based routing protocols can add a significant contribution to assist in the maximisation of the network lifetime, but this is only possible by means of an adaptable and balanced algorithm that takes into account the Wireless Sensor Networks main restrictions. This paper presents a new Wireless Sensor Network routing protocol, which is based on the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic. The protocol was studied by simulation for several Wireless Sensor Network scenarios and the results clearly show that it minimises communication load and maximises energy savings.", "paper_title": "An energy-efficient ant-based routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241466100005"}
