However, no extensive performance evaluation and comparison is available in the literature. In this paper, after a short review of the major dynamic QoS routing schemes, we analyze and compare their performance referring to several networks scenarios. In order to set an absolute evaluation of the performance quality we have obtained the ideal performance of any routing scheme using a novel and flexible mathematical programming model that assumes the knowledge of arrival times and duration of the connections offered to the network. This model is based on an extension of the maximum multi-commodity flow problem. Being an integer linear programming model, its complexity is quite high and its evaluation is constrained to networks of limited size. To overcome the computational complexity we have defined an approximate model, based on the multi-class Erlang formula and the minimum multi-commodity cut problem, that provides an upper bound to the routing scheme performance. The performance presented in the paper, evaluated by measuring the connection rejection probability, shows that the schemes considered reach, in several scenarios, the ideal performance, showing that no much gain is left for alternate new schemes.
