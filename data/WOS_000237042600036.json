It consists in a bi-manual gestural language specifically designed in order to simplify user's interaction in geometric constructions. As the inherent complexity of geometry in 3 dimensions is combined with the cognitive difficulty of interacting with virtual environments, we propose to constrain the interaction: hand postures constrain the object type for designation and selection; objects already selected constrain the construction process; the degrees of freedom representation constrain the manipulation of constructed figures; and the deformable ray-casting method constrain the navigation.", "paper_title": "Constrained gesture interaction in 3D geometric constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600036"}
