Most of these solutions intend to find a total order on a given collection of fuzzy intervals. However, if one sees fuzzy intervals as descriptions of uncertain quantities, an alternative to rank them is to use ranking rules issued from the imprecise probabilistic literature. In this paper, we investigate ranking rules based on different statistical features (mean, median) and orderings, and relate the obtained (partial) orders to some classical proposals. In particular, we propose a generic expression of stochastic orderings, and then use it to systematically investigate extensions of the most usual stochastic orderings to fuzzy intervals. We also show some relations between those extensions, and explore their relation with existing fuzzy ranking proposals.
