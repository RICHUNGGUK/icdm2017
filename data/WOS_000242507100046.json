Each of them is allocated a share of the secret, and the secret can only be reconstructed when the shares are combined together. We have been proposing a secret sharing distributed database System (SSDDB) that uses a secret sharing scheme to improve confidentiality and robustness of distributed database systems. This paper proposes a vertical partitioning algorithm for the SSDDB, and evaluates the algorithm by computational experiments.", "paper_title": "Vertical partitioning method for secret sharing distributed database system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100046"}
