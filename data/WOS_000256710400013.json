The bottleneck of this algorithm is management of large datasets and searching for the relevant neighbors. This paper aims to deal with this issue and the kappa-Means cluster algorithm is cast into the lazy learning framework. By using this strategy, the nearest neighbors searching process can be converted into a hierarchical searching process with two levels and a lot of searching time for lazy learning can be saved. A novel criterion between two samples is proposed, and based on this criterion, the kappa- Vector Nearest Neighbors (kappa-VNN) is used to find the neighbors of the query, The database can quickly be updated without the need for any further computation. This updating strategy can save a lot of memory space and decrease the neighbor-searching time. These techniques have been successfully applied to estimate a nonlinear function.", "paper_title": "A hierarchical search and updating database strategy for lazy learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400013"}
