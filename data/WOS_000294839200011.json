This longitudinal study allows us to analyse developmental trends over times in different subject areas with distinct citation and publication patterns. To this aim, we first introduce an axiomatic index of the overall prestige of journals with ranking score above a given threshold. Here we demonstrate that, between 1999 and 2009, there was high and increasing overall prestige of first quartile journals in only four areas of Scopus. Also, there was high and decreasing overall prestige of first quartile journals in five areas. Two subject areas showed high and oscillating overall prestige of first quartile journals. And there was low and increasing overall prestige in four areas, since the 1999.", "paper_title": "Overall prestige of journals with ranking score above a given threshold", "paper_id": "WOS:000294839200011"}
