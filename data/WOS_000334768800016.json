Unfortunately, it is not so. Namely, many papers do not document experimental settings in sufficient detail, and hence replication of experiments is almost impossible. Additionally, some work fails to satisfy the thumb rules for Experimentation throughout all disciplines, such that all experiments should be conducted and compared under the same or stricter conditions. Also, because of the stochastic properties inherent in evolutionary algorithms (EAs), experimental results should always be rich enough with respect to Statistics. Moreover, the comparisons conducted should be based on suitable performance measures and show the statistical significance of one approach over others. Otherwise, the derived conclusions may fail to have scientific merits. The primary objective of this paper is to offer some preliminary guidelines and reminders for assisting researchers to conduct any replications and comparisons of computational experiments when solving practical problems, by the use of EAs in the future. The common pitfalls are explained, that solve economic load dispatch problems using EAs from concrete examples found in some papers. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
