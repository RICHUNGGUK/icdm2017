The cost incurred towards this service is termed as warranty cost, which is a function of warranty policy and region, product quality and reliability, and the customers' usage pattern. Under the 2D warranty policy, there exists numerous iso-cost regions for any specified value of warranty cost. In this article, we propose a methodology to determine the optimal region when customers' utility is measured by the length of warranty coverage time. It is believed that the results will help the manufacturer to provide improved customer service. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
