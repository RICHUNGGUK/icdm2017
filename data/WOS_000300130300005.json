A univariate grid hierarchy is regular if all knots are equidistant on each level, and irregular otherwise. We use L-systems to design a wide class of systematically described irregular grid hierarchies. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions on the L-system which guarantee that the subdivision scheme, based on the non-uniform B-spline of degree d defined on the initial knot grid, is uniformly convergent. If n is the number of symbols in the alphabet of the L-system, this subdivision scheme is defined with a finite set of masks (at most n(d+1)) which does not depend on the subdivision step. We provide an implementation of such schemes which is available as a worksheet for Sage software. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
