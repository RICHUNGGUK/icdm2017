Axial velocity is time-dependent, whereas the surface transpiration is uniform and steady. The impinging free stream is steady with a strain rate (k) over bar. The governing parameters are the stagnation-flow Reynolds number Re=(k) over bara(2)/2 nu, and the dimensionless transpiration S=U-0/(k) over bara. An exact solution is obtained by reducing the Navier-Stokes equations to a system of differential equations governed by Reynolds number and the dimensionless wall transpiration rate, S. The system of Boundary Value Problems is then solved by the shooting method and by deploying a finite difference scheme as a semi-similar solution. The results are presented for velocity similarity functions, axial shear stress and stream functions for a variety of cases. Shear stresses in all cases increase with the increase in Reynolds number and suction rate. The effect of different parameters on the deflection of viscous stagnation circle is also determined.
