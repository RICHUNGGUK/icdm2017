This paper analyzes the use of the OWA in the variance and the covariance. It presents several extensions by using a unified framework between the weighted average and the OWA. Furthermore, it also develops other generalizations with induced aggregation operators and by using quasi-arithmetic means. Several measures of correlation by using the OWA are introduced including a new type of Pearson coefficient. The paper ends with some numerical examples focused on the construction of interval and fuzzy numbers with the variance and the covariance.", "paper_title": "The Ordered Weighted Average in the Variance and the Covariance", "paper_id": "WOS:000357339900001"}
