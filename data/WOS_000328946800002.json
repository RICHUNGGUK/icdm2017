However, people are usually not able to estimate their preference degrees with crisp number, since they have a vague knowledge about the preference assessment. In this paper, we propose a 2-tuple linguistic MP-OWA (LMP-OWA) operator. It is useful because it can be used to make decision with linguistic preference relations, and the weighting vector is not only connected to the maximum frequency of the assessment to the criteria, but also to the assessment values. Meanwhile, we introduce the parameterized 2-tuple LMP-OWA operator and the parameterized 2-tuple LMP-OWA operator with power function, which provide multiple aggregation results for decision makers to select. The paper ends up with an example of decision making with linguistic preference relations in movie recommender system.", "paper_title": "PARAMETERIZED 2-TUPLE LINGUISTIC MOST PREFERRED OWA OPERATORS AND THEIR APPLICATION IN DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000328946800002"}
