Its research has a vital significance to both humans and robotics. This paper presents a review of the state of the art in robotic dance. Robotic dance is classified into four categories: cooperative human-robot dance, imitation of human dance motions, synchronization for music, and creation of robotic choreography. The research methods in each category are discussed. Future research areas are highlighted.", "paper_title": "Robotic Dance in Social Robotics-A Taxonomy", "paper_id": "WOS:000354532400001"}
