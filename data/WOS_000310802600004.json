Under two constraints, i.e. keeping the degree of each node unchanged and fixing the total protective cost of a network, we investigate the efficiency of the swap method on scale-free networks and analyze the correlation between the optimized network and the Pearson correlation coefficient. We numerically show that effective swapping of the small part of connections can dramatically improve the network robust level against cascading failures and find that the optimized networks obtained by the swap method exhibit an extremely disassortative degree degree correlation, that is, the disassortativity decreases the robustness of the optimized network against cascading failures. While the extent of the disassortative mixing is decided by the parameters in the cascading model. In addition, we also compare the average path length and the diameter of the optimized and the original networks.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZED SCALE-FREE NETWORKS AGAINST CASCADING FAILURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000310802600004"}
