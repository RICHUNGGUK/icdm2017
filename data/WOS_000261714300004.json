This paper presents an approach for distribution of real time video by uncoordinated peer-to-peer relay or source nodes in an overlay network on top of a MANET. The approach proposed here allows for distributed, rate-distortion optimized transmission-rate allocation for competing scalable video streams at relay nodes in the overlay network. The approach has the desirable feature of path/source diversity that can be used for enhancing reliability in connectivity to serving nodes and/or attaining a higher throughput. The distributed approach reduces signaling overhead as well as avoiding scalability issues that come with centralized processing in MANETs. Results show a significant performance gain over both single-server systems and previously proposed multi-source systems. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
