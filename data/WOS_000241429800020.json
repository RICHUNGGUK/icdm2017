However, given a test image, tensor factorization, i.e., decomposition of mixing factors, is a difficult problem especially when the factor parameters are unknown or are not in the training set. In this paper, we propose a novel tensor factorization method to decompose the mixing factors of a test image. We set up a tensor factorization problem as a least squares problem with a quadratic equality constraint, and solve it using numerical optimization techniques. The novelty in our approach compared to previous work is that our tensor factorization method does not require any knowledge or assumption of test images. We have conducted several experiments to show the versatility of the method for both face recognition and face synthesis.", "paper_title": "Tensor factorization by simultaneous estimation of mixing factors for robust face recognition and synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800020"}
