These models are thought to represent the three ligand-specific receptor conformations. Docking results are in agreement with point mutation studies and suggest that different ligands-agonists and antagonists-may bind to the same binding site under different receptor conformations. Docking to different receptor models ( conformations) also suggests that by changing to a receptor-specific conformation, the receptor may open or close different binding sites to other ligands.", "paper_title": "Docking studies suggest ligand-specific delta-opioid receptor conformations", "paper_id": "WOS:000262578200005"}
