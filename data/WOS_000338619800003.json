Students' ICT literacy level was classified into four levels: below basic, basic, average, and excellent. First, HLM analysis results revealed that male student, completion of computer courses, log usage time for purposes other than study and satisfaction level of students in classes using ICT have positive effects on ICT literacy score, but that log usage time for study has a negative effect at the individual level. In addition, major city, achievement level and number of PCs per student have a positive influence at the school level. At the individual level, the results from HGLM analysis showed that the ICT level of female students was higher than that of male students in average or lower levels. The completion status of computer courses had a significant effect on the probability of attaining a basic or average level. The satisfaction level of students in classes using ICT had a positive influence on attaining a higher level of ICT literacy. At the school level, the number of PCs per student had a significant effect on the probability of attaining an average level. The ICT literacy of schools located in major cities was higher than that in rural area in average level. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
