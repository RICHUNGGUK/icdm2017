Our new trilateral filtering-based tone mapping is about seven to ten times faster than that in [3]. Firstly, a novel tone mapping algorithm for HDR images is presented. It is based on fast bilateral filtering and two newly developed filters: the quasi-Cauchy function kernel filter and the fourth degree Taylor polynomial kernel filter. Secondly, a new gradient-based image retexturing method is introduced, which consists of three steps: 1) converting HDR images into low dynamic range (LDR) images using our fast trilateral filtering-based tone mapping method; 2) recovering the gradient luminance maps for the region to be retextured; 3) reconstructing the final retextured image by solving the Poisson equation. The proposed approach is suitable for HDR image tone mapping and retexturing, and experimental results have demonstrated the satisfactory performance of our method.", "paper_title": "High dynamic range image tone mapping and retexturing using fast trilateral filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600004"}
