Our methodology is developed upon properties of the best affine approximations of quadratic functions, for which formulas for their direct computation (not by means of the Walsh-Hadamard transform) are given. We determine the cubic functions in the above subclass that achieve the maximum second-order nonlinearity, thus yielding a lower bound for the covering radius of the second order Reed-Muller code RM(2,n) in RM(3,n). Simple extensions of these results to some special cases of higher degree functions, are seen to hold. Furthermore, a preliminary analysis of well-known constructions for bent functions, in terms of their second-order nonlinearity, is performed that indicates potential weaknesses if construction parameters are not properly chosen.", "paper_title": "Best Affine and Quadratic Approximations of Particular Classes of Boolean Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700029"}
