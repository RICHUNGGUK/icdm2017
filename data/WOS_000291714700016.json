The optimal single wavelength prediction bias (OSWPB) was used to evaluate the similarity of calibration set and prediction set, and a new division method for calibration set and prediction set was proposed. SG smoothing modes were expanded to 540 kinds. The specific computer algorithm platforms for optimization of SG smoothing mode combined with PLS factor and for MWPLS method with changeable parameters were built up. The optimal waveband for soil organic matter was 1926-2032 nm, the optimal smoothing mode was the 2nd order derivative, 6th degree polynomial, 45 smoothing points, the PLS factor, RMSEP and R(P) were 8, 0.260 (%) and 0.877 respectively. The prediction effect was obviously better than that in the whole spectral collecting region. To get stable results, all the optimization processes were based on the average prediction effect on 50 different divisions of calibration set and prediction set. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
