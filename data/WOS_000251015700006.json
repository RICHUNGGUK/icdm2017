We will show that a TSK fuzzy rule happens to be a localised AR model and that a STAR model can hence be interpreted as a restricted FRBS. Several consequences derive from this fact, and we will explore some of them, including a statistical inference-based procedure to incrementally build FRBS or the linguistic interpretation of STAR models. Finally an econometric example is given to illustrate the core idea. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
