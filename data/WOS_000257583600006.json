Focusing on simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT), we provide an eigenvalue based scheme for automatically determining a near-optimal value of the relaxation parameter. This accelerates the convergence rate of SIRT to the point where only half the number of iterations normally required is needed. We also modify the way SIRT uses preconditioning to solve a weighted least squares problem. The resulting algorithm, which we call PSIRT, is associated with a smaller memory footprint and calls for less data to be commu- nicated in a distributed-memory implementation. Experimental residual norm and timing results are provided based on cone-beam micro-CT mouse data, including for an ordered subsets study.", "paper_title": "Computational analysis and improvement of SIRT", "paper_id": "WOS:000257583600006"}
