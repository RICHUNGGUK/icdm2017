The proposed scheme supports multiple care-of addresses and fast handover mechanism with a single unitary virtual interface among heterogeneous radio access technologies without network changes. We verify that the proposed scheme has significant vertical handover performance gains to support real time communication traffics through the experiment over the real network experimental environment consists of WiFi and 3GPP2 networks.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of IP mobility with multiple care-of addresses in heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321974700023"}
