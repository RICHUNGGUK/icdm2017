In this work, molecular docking and network analysis were employed to elucidate the action mechanism of a medical composition which had clinical efficacy for T2DM. We found that multiple active compounds contained in this medical composition would target multiple proteins related to T2DM and the biological network would be shifted. We predicted the key players in the medical composition and some of them have been reported in literature. Meanwhile, several compounds such as Rheidin A, Rheidin C, Sennoside C, procyanidin Cl and Dihydrobaicalin were notable although no one have reported their pharmacological activity against T2DM. The association between active compounds, target proteins and other diseases was also discussed. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
