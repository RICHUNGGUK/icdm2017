We present an accelerated method to automatically estimate these parameters for a deformation simulator using an iterative optimization framework, given the desired (target) output surface/shape. During the optimization, the input model is deformed by the simulator, and the distance between the deformed surface and the target surface is minimized numerically. To accelerate the optimization process, we introduce a dimension reduction technique to allow a trade-off between the computational efficiency and desired accuracy. The reduced model is constructed using statistical training with a set of example deformations. To demonstrate this approach, we apply the computational framework to 2D animations of elastic bodies simulated with a linear finite element method. We also present a 3D elastography example, which is simulated with a reduced-dimension finite element model to improve the performance of the optimizer.", "paper_title": "Fast optimization-based elasticity parameter estimation using reduced models", "paper_id": "WOS:000304411500004"}
