The control algorithm is derived by using the sliding-mode-control-based design approach. The applied design procedure replaces a discontinuous control with a continuous one. Thus, it guarantees chattering-free performance whilst retaining practical robustness regarding disturbances and provides easy model-free implementation. A high control rate is strongly required in order to achieve high-performance scaled bilateral teleoperation. Hence, the control algorithm is implemented by the FPGA. In order to design a sufficient logic circuit for the FPGA, general optimization approaches are presented that aim to minimize hardware resources and to optimize the control rate. The design applies high-level programming language (LabVIEW) for rapid prototyping. The presented algorithms were validated by the 2-DoF laboratory bilateral teleoperation system.", "paper_title": "FPGA Implementation of Sliding-Mode-Control Algorithm for Scaled Bilateral Teleoperation", "paper_id": "WOS:000323569900009"}
