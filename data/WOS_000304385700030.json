Activators of LXRs are of high pharmacological interest as LXRs regulate cholesterol, fatty acid, and carbohydrate metabolism as well as inflammatory processes. On the basis of different X-ray crystal structures, we established a virtual screening workflow for the identification of novel LXR modulators. A two-step screening concept to identify active compounds included 3D-pharmacophore filters and rescoring by shape alignment. Eighteen virtual hits were tested in vitro applying a reporter gene assay, where concentration-dependent activity was proven for four novel lead structures. The most active compound 10, a 1,4-naphthochinone, has an estimated EC50 of around 5 mu M.", "paper_title": "Identification of Novel Liver X Receptor Activators by Structure-Based Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000304385700030"}
