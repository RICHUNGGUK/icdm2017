This method shows a modified scheme of the state convergence algorithm that feeds back the state of the slave to the master controller. All this information (position, velocity and torque) is processed in order to implement the desired master behavior that has to guarantee the stability of the system and the best remote impedance reflection as possible. This paper shows some experiments that prove the performance of this methodology for a second order-modeled system with 3 degrees of freedom. Moreover, this methodology can also be applied in higher order systems of teleoperation models. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
