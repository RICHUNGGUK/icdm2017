The geo-textual index that integrates a spatial index with a keyword filter offers a promising approach for processing such queries efficiently. However, it is still an open problem on how the geo-textual indices can be effectively constructed from scratch. This paper proposes a bulk loading algorithm for the geo-textual indices, which constructs the indices top-down efficiently. It utilizes a two-phase method to construct the children of nodes at each level of the geo-textual index, taking both spatial and keyword information into consideration, and thus optimizes the geo-textual index for spatial keyword queries. The time complexity of the algorithm is analyzed theoretically, and comprehensive experiments with both real and synthetic datasets show that it can build high quality geo-textual indices with good query performance and space utilization.", "paper_title": "Bulk Construction of Geo-Textual Indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000343386800002"}
