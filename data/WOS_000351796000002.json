However, in the practical applications, the descriptiveness and discrimination are independent and contradictory to each other. 3D facial data provide a promising way to balance these two aspects. In this paper, a robust regional bounding spherical descriptor (RBSR) is proposed to facilitate 3D face recognition and emotion analysis. In our framework, we first segment a group of regions on each 3D facial point cloud by shape index and spherical bands on the human face. Then the corresponding facial areas are projected to regional bounding spheres to obtain our regional descriptor. Finally, a regional and global regression mapping (RGRM) technique is employed to the weighted regional descriptor for boosting the classification accuracy. Three largest available databases, FRGC v2, CASIA and BU-3DFE, are contributed to the performance comparison and the experimental results show a consistently better performance for 3D face recognition and emotion analysis.
