By employing Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) technology, the performance of the simulator has been significantly increased over that of a single CPU and is therefore viable in the demanding accelerator operations environment. Once connected to the accelerator control system, it can rapidly respond to any control set point changes and predict beam properties along an ion linear accelerator in pseudoreal time. This simulator will be a virtual beam diagnostic tool which is especially useful when direct beam measurements are not available. Details about the code structure design, physics algorithms, GPU implementations, and performance are presented.
