MSR is attracting more and more attention from technical and scientific aspects which are expected to help locate the victim goals quickly, precisely, and efficiently. So far, there have been some new techniques applied to MSR, such as computer vision. However, these techniques have a common drawback that they are too dependent on the effort of the search and rescue party, so that the victim goals can only passively wait for their search. To change this kind of passive status, wireless sensor network (WSN) is the deficiencies of the current maritime search and rescue. To make WSN localization suitable for the MSR, an improved microelectromechanical systems MEMS aided algorithm on the basis of triangle and centroid algorithm is proposed to locate and track the search targets in real time and more precisely. Finally, the simulation results show that the proposed method and algorithm are feasible and efficient.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Localization Algorithm for Maritime Search and Rescue Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000316140900001"}
