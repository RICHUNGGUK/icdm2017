The cohesive law in the crack is based on mid-plasticity with softening. The required material data for the concrete failure analysis are the constants of isotropic elasticity and the mode I softening curve. The results of two well known tests are presented in order to illustrate very satisfying performance of the presented approach to simulate failure of concrete solids", "paper_title": "An embedded crack model for failure analysis of concrete solids", "paper_id": "WOS:000280429600005"}
