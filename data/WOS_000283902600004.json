First, the power transients caused by EDFA chains during lightpath set-up/tear-down are characterized. Next, the steady-state effects of EDFA gain dynamics are examined at network level. Appropriate remedies, along with the simulation results, are proposed to alleviate the adverse effects of both transient and steady state gain dynamics of EDFA chains in WRONs. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
