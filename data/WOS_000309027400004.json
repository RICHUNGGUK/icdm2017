EB GIZO TFTs were degraded by a source/drain dry etch process that formed a conductive surface layer. Their switching performance was recovered using an O-2 ashing process that oxidized the conductive surface layer. In addition, a wet etch of the backside of the GIZO recovered the performance of the GIZO TFTs. EB GIZO TFTs with a field-effect mobility of 14.5 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and a subthreshold swing of 0.1 V/dec were obtained without plasma treatment. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
