Although wavelet network is time consuming technique, we decrease computational costs by incorporating three techniques: gradient-based feature selection, Gabor filtering, and wavelet neural network. Similarity criterion is built upon analyzing intensity function with Gabor Wavelet Network, which carries out the image registration by both gradient-based and texture features.", "paper_title": "Gabor neural network for endoscopic image registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000070"}
