A novel bandpass filter achieving a high quality factor and variable gain based on a single CFA is proposed. It is shown that unlike the op-amp Sallen-Key bandpass filter, the CFA filter is more suitable for high frequency applications.", "paper_title": "A novel bandpass filter based on current feedback amplifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000234308500007"}
