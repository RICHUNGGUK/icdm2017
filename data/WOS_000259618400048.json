This paper considers the problem of finding positions to deploy sensors so that the network lifetime will be the most prolonged when a fixed total quantity of energy of sensor devices is given. We formulated the redeployment problem in WSNs as a network optimization problem called the OCSRP (Optimum Clusters Set Redeployment Problem). Two heuristic algorithms, the MFCSPA-static (Most Frangible Clusters Set Prediction Algorithm for static routing), and the MFCSPA-dynamic are proposed to solve the OCSRP in WSNs under static and dynamic routing schemes, respectively. By integrating the above sensor redeployment algorithms with monitoring facilities, a topology control scheme for maintaining the energy usage of a WSN is also proposed. The simulation results show that both proposed algorithms can find better solutions than other heuristic algorithms. Moreover, both proposed algorithms greatly outperform the other algorithms in the percentage of successfully predicting the earliest energy drain out node.
