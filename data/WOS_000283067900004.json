The basic idea is to apply the Q-function, the conditional expectation of the complete-data log-likelihood function obtained from EM algorithm, instead of the observed-data log-likelihood function as used in standard influence analysis. Diagnostic measures are derived based on the case-deletion approach and the local influence approach. Two real examples and a simulation study are examined to illustrate our methodology.", "paper_title": "Influence analysis of additive mixed-effects nonlinear regression models via EM algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000283067900004"}
