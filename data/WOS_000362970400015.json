They are classically defined in the context of crisp sets. However, partitions based on fuzzy sets have been proven to be more useful in real-life problems. This has motivated several different proposals to extend the definition of partition to the fuzzy sets context. Nevertheless, fuzzy sets evaluated in the real interval [0, 1] are still a too restrictive context for some problems. In this contribution we propose a generalization of the notion of partition based on lattices valued sets. We also study some of their properties.", "paper_title": "Classification based on L-fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000362970400015"}
