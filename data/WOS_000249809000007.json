Within this framework, we introduce a new congestion control mechanism called congestion control with explicit reduction request (CCERQ). Through feedback signals, CCERQ proactively attempts to prevent the network from entering the congestion state. Basic building blocks and performance tradeoffs of CCERQ are the main focus of this article.", "paper_title": "A feedback-based congestion control mechanism for labeled optical burst switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249809000007"}
