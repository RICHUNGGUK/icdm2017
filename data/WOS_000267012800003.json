The goal of the PSOX EMS is to manage a large number of sophisticated extraction pipelines across different application domains, at the web scale and with minimum human involvement. Three key value propositions are described: extensibility, the ability to swap in and out extraction operators; explainability, the ability to track the provenance of extraction results; and social feedback support, the facility for gathering and reconciling multiple, potentially conflicting sources.", "paper_title": "Purple SOX Extraction Management System", "paper_id": "WOS:000267012800003"}
