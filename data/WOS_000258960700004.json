Similar to bit commitment schemes, such schemes are supposed to be binding, i.e., Alice cannot change her choice after committing, and concealing, i.e., Bob cannot find Alice's committed string before Alice reveals it. Ideal commitment schemes are known to be impossible. Even if some degree of cheating is allowed, Buhrman et al. (quant-ph/0504078, Nov.2007)(1) have recently shown that there are some binding-concealing trade-offs that any quantum string commitment scheme (QSC) must follow. They showed trade-offs both in the scenario of single execution of the protocol and in the asymptotic regime of sufficiently large number of parallel executions of the protocol. We present here new trade-offs in the scenario of single execution of a QSC protocol. Our trade-offs also immediately imply the trade-off shown by Buhrman et al. in the asymptotic regime. We show our results by making a central use of an important information theoretic tool called the substate theorem due to Jain et al. (Proceedings of the 43rd Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, pp. 429-438, 2002). Our techniques are quite different from that of Buhrman et al. (quant-ph/0504078, Nov. 2007) and may be of independent interest.", "paper_title": "New binding-concealing trade-offs for quantum string commitment", "paper_id": "WOS:000258960700004"}
