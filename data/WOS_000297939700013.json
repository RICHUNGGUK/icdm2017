We also describe the transfer of bipartite entanglement from the two qubits to their respective reservoirs focussing on the case of two atoms inside two different leaky cavities with a specific attention to the role of the detuning. We present a scheme to prepare the cavity fields in a maximally entangled state, without direct interaction between the cavities, by exploiting the initial qubits entanglement. We discuss a deterministic protocol, working in the presence of cavity losses, for the generation of a W-state of one qubit and two cavity fields and we describe a probabilistic scheme to entangle one of the atoms with the reservoir (cavity field) of the other atom.", "paper_title": "NON-MARKOVIAN DYNAMICS OF SYSTEM-RESERVOIR ENTANGLEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000297939700013"}
