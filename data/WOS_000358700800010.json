Integrating the power grid with the ICT exposes the SG to systems security threats and vulnerabilities that could be compromised by malicious users and attackers. This paper presents a SG systems threats analysis and integrated SG Systems Security Threat Model (SSTM). The reference architecture of the SG, with its components and communication interfaces used to exchange the energy-related information, is integrated with the results of SG systems security threat analysis to produce a comprehensive, integrated SG SSTM. The SG SSTM in this paper helps better depict and understand the vulnerabilities exploited by attackers to compromise the components and communication links of the SG. The SG SSTM provides a reference of the systems security threats for industrial security practitioners, and can be used for design and implementation of SG systems security controls and countermeasures.
