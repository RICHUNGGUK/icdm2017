We derive the enhanced Fritz John condition which contains some new information even in the smooth case than the classical enhanced Fritz John condition. From this enhanced Fritz John condition we derive the enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition and introduce the associated pseudonormality and quasinormality condition. We prove that either pseudonormality or quasinormality with regularity on the constraint functions and the set constraint implies the existence of a local error bound. Finally we give a tighter upper estimate for the Fr,chet subdifferential and the limiting subdifferential of the value function in terms of quasinormal multipliers which is usually a smaller set than the set of classical normal multipliers. In particular we show that the value function of a perturbed problem is Lipschitz continuous under the perturbed quasinormality condition which is much weaker than the classical normality condition.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition and weaker constraint qualifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000320844200019"}
