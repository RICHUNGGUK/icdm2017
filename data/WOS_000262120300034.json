This process is carried out in order to optimize a given objective function (e.g., minimizing waste). Our study deals with a case in which there are several stock lengths available in limited quantities. Moreover, we have focused on problems of low demand. Some heuristic methods are proposed in order to obtain an integer solution and compared with others. The heuristic methods are empirically analyzed by solving a set of randomly generated instances and a set of instances from the literature. Concerning the latter. most of the optimal solutions of these instances are known, therefore it was possible to compare the solutions. The proposed methods presented very small objective function value gaps. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
