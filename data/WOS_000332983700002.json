This paper studies the secure similarity coefficients computation in the two-party setting. Recently, a privacy-preserving similarity coefficients protocol for binary data was proposed by Wong and Kim (Computers and Mathematics with Application 2012). We point out that their protocol is not secure, even in the semi-honest model. In their protocol, the client can retrieve the inputs of the server without deviating from the protocol. Next, we propose a secure similarity coefficients computation protocol in the presence of malicious adversaries, which solves the same similarity coefficients functionality as that proposed by Wong and Kim. Meanwhile, we prove the protocol secure against the malicious adversaries by using the standard simulation-based security definitions for secure two-party computation. Also several extensions of our protocol for settling other specific problems are discussed. At last, we present a protocol computing the similarity coefficients with better privacy by using the secure integer division on ciphertexts.
