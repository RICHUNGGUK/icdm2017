The images of three specially designed calibration patterns, which are a white rectangle, a black rectangle, and a dot matrix, are captured and processed sequentially to assist achieving robust extraction of relevant features from the calibration pattern images, especially the border features in the image of the display screen. Image analysis techniques of deformable template matching, local thresholding, and inverse distance-weighted interpolation are integrated to perform feature extraction and coordinate transformation to complete the calibration work. Good performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by comparing the experimental results of the method with those of a well-known calibration method.", "paper_title": "A robust and accurate calibration method by computer vision techniques for coordinate transformation between display screens and their images", "paper_id": "WOS:000258108700013"}
