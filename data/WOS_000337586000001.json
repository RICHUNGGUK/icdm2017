In this approach, one of the most popular ICA methods, the fast fixed-point algorithm for ICA (fastICA), was implemented by the genetic algorithm (geneticICA) to avoid the local maxima problem commonly observed with fastICA. As a case study, an ion-selective electrode (ISE) array, consisting of three working electrodes and one reference electrode, was used for the simultaneous determination of three heavy metals (cadmium, copper, and lead) in aqueous solutions, which are normally prone to severe interferences. The robustness and appropriateness of the approach were assessed using the average mean of relative error (MRE) of triplicated external validation. After configuration and optimization, the average MRE for Cu was <5%. For the determination of Cd and Pb, whose ISEs normally cannot tolerate Cu ions even at the microgram per liter levels, the MREs were 8%. This article demonstrated that this approach can be applied to the detection of heavy metal contamination in industrial wastewater with prediction accuracies comparable with other popular quantitative chemometric neural network methods.
