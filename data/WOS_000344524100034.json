In particular, we consider algorithms which do not require sending channel state information to a central processing unit, nor do they require communication between the users themselves, yet, the resulting capacity closely approximates that of a centrally controlled system, which is able to schedule the strongest user in each time-slot. In other words, multiuser diversity is achieved in a distributed fashion. Our analysis is based on a novel application of the point-process approximation. This technique, besides tackling previously suggested models successfully, allows an analytical examination of new models, such as nonhomogeneous cases (nonidentically distributed users) or various quality of service considerations. This results in asymptotically exact expressions for the capacity of the system under these schemes, solving analytically problems which to date had been open. Possible applications include, but are not limited to, modern 4G networks, such as 3GPP LTE, or random access protocols.", "paper_title": "Capacity of Distributed Opportunistic Scheduling in Nonhomogeneous Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100034"}
