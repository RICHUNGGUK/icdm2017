The software code, with an interactive graphical interface, operates in Matlab environment (version 7.0). The code of the inversion procedure is based on a weighted-damped least-squares algorithm, according to a criterion of balancing the weight of the data inaccuracies and the compactness of the solution. We have applied the approach to both synthetic and field data. This software can be used for didactical purposes or for a fast estimate of magnetic source bodies in archaeological and environmental prospecting. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
