We relate the conditions for achieving consensus to the existence of a common norm for a set of row-stochastic matrices associated with the original set of averaging matrices. For a system to achieve consensus, it is shown that this associated set of matrices should have a Common Lyapunov Function, even if the original set might not have one.", "paper_title": "On the existence of common Lyapunov functions for consensus algorithms based on averaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000291757200012"}
