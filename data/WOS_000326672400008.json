This paper considers the cognitive model in the communication field as the problem of minimizing a fractional quadratic problem, subject to two or more quadratic constraints in complex field. Although both denominator and numerator in the fractional problem are convex, this problem is not so simple since the quotient of convex functions is not convex in most cases. We first change the fractional problem into a non-fractional one. Second, we consider the semi-definite programming (SDP) method. For the problem with m (m2) constraints, we use the SDP relaxation and obtain the exact optimal solution. However, for the problem with m (m>2) constraints, we choose the randomization method to gain an approximation solution in the complex case. At last, we apply this method to practical communications over wireless channels with good results.", "paper_title": "An approach for minimizing a quadratically constrained fractional quadratic problem with application to the communications over wireless channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000326672400008"}
