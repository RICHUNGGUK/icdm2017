More recently, Digital Library (DL) interoperability has played an important role towards providing more visibility and accessibility to the broad range of rich digital resources collected by digital libraries and web-based services worldwide. In this paper, we describe how DL interoperability can be applied to mediating federated intelligent systems. Exemplified by the Digital Library for Life Science Learners (DLLSL) federated search project and the Open Archives Initiatives Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH), we develop the design of an integrated DL system using harvesting methods towards DL interoperability, and the proposal of integrating federated search of non-OAI and harvesting of OAI repositories, which provides an even broader accessibility to intelligent systems with digital resources. This Meta-DL system helps researchers to locate, explore and use the resources in the expanding body of scholarly information by a simple middleware, such as Emerge (see \"Section 2\").", "paper_title": "Generating a meta-DL by federating search on OAI and non-OAI servers", "paper_id": "WOS:000275161000003"}
