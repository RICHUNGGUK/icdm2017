The proposed algorithm obtains initial estimations of the azimuth and elevation angles obtained from the signal subspace, and uses successively one-dimensional local searches to achieve the joint estimation of 2D-DOA. The proposed algorithm, which requires the one-dimension local searches, can avoid the high computational cost within 2D-MUSIC algorithm. The proposed algorithm can obtain automatically-paired 2D-DOA estimation for acoustic vector-sensor array, and it has better DOA estimation performance than propagator method, estimation of signal parameters via rotational invariance technique algorithm and trilinear decomposition algorithm. Meanwhile, it has very close angle estimation to 2D-MUSIC algorithm. Furthermore, it is suitable for non-uniform linear arrays, works well for the sources with the same azimuth angle, and imposes less constraint on the sensor spacing, which does not have to be restricted within half-wavelength. We have also derived the mean-square error of DOA estimation of the proposed algorithm and the Cramer-Rao bound of DOA estimation. Simulation results verify the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Two-dimensional DOA estimation for acoustic vector-sensor array using a successive MUSIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000334754800010"}
