The problem is -hard, and its intractability becomes profound when network instances with several tens of nodes and several hundreds of demands are to be solved to optimum. In order to deal with such instances, large-scale optimization methods need to be considered. In this work, we present a column (more precisely, path) generation-based method for the RSA problem. The method is capable of finding reasonable sets of lightpaths, avoiding large sets of precomputed paths, and leading to high-quality solutions. Numerical results illustrating effectiveness of the proposed method for obtaining solutions for large RSA problem instances are presented.", "paper_title": "Column generation algorithm for RSA problems in flexgrid optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327089100003"}
