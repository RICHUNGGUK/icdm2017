For the purpose, a survey was conducted on potential e-customers for their understandings of service offerings extracted from Portal Sites. Collected data were used to develop a prediction model using decision tree which showed superior prediction accuracy to conventional techniques. The results will help predict online success judging from customer acceptance and afford a better understanding of how to facilitate future adoption of services in e-commerce. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
