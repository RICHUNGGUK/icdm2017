A (q, k, n)-Armstrong code is a q-ary code of length n with minimum Hamming distance n - k + 1, and for any set of k - 1 coordinates, there exist two codewords that agree exactly there. Let f (q, k) be the maximum n for which such a code exists. In this paper, f (q, 3) = 3q - 1 is determined for all q >= 5 with three possible exceptions. This disproves a conjecture of Sali. Furthermore, we introduce generalized Armstrong codes for branching, or (s, t)-dependences, construct several classes of optimal Armstrong codes, and establish lower bounds for the maximum length n in this more general setting.", "paper_title": "Complexity of Dependences in Bounded Domains, Armstrong Codes, and Generalizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000348298400010"}
