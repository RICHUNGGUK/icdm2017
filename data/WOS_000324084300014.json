Based on the concept of maximum expert consensus model (MECM), this paper incorporates aggregation operators into the MECM, and proposes a novel framework of MECM. When the aggregation operator is set to be the weighted averaging operator or the ordered weighed averaging (OWA) operator, this paper equivalently transforms the MECM into mixed 0-1 linear programming problems. Additionally, this paper also shows that the minimum cost consensus model under the OWA operator with any weights can be similarly transformed into a mixed 0-1 linear programming problem. Numerical examples and a comparison analysis are used to demonstrate the validity of the proposed model. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
