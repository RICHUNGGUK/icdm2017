An advantage of the presented study lies in that the state estimation problem for a class of uncertain systems with time-varying state delays and input saturation nonlinearities is handled by using the NNs learning process strategy, novel type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the adaptive memoryless neural network observer. Furthermore, by utilizing the property of the function tan h(2)(v/epsilon)/v NNs compensation technique and backstepping method, an adaptive output feedback controller is constructed which not only efficiently avoids the problem of controller singularity and input saturation, but also can achieve the output tracking. And the proposed approach is obtained free of any restrictive assumptions on the delayed states and Lispchitz condition for the unknown nonlinear functions. The semiglobal uniform ultimate boundedness of all signals of the closed-loop systems and the convergence of tracking error to a small neighborhood are all rigorously proven based on the NN-basis function property, Lyapunov method and sliding model theory. Finally, two examples are simulated to confirm the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
