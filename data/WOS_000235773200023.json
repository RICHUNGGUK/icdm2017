The minimization optimization leads to a mass constrained deterministic annealing (DA) approach, which is independent of the choice of the initial data configuration and has the ability to avoid poor local optima. The maximization optimization provides a robust estimation of probability soft margin to phase out outliers. Furthermore, a novel cluster validity criteria is estimated to determine an optimal cluster number of spherical shells for a given set of data. The effectiveness of MMI algorithm for clustering spherical shells is demonstrated by experimental results.", "paper_title": "Clustering spherical shells by a mini-max information algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200023"}
