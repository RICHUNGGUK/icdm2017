The commutative property of mixed difference operators is generalized to apply to time metrics and Jacobians. Our treatment uses half the number of terms as those used in a recent paper by Abe et al. (2012). We also derive the proper temporal discretizations of both Runge-Kutta and linear multistep methods to satisfy the commutativity property for higher than first order.
