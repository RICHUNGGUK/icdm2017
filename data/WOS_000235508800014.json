We propose a power-aware reconfiguration scheme that (1) moves energy-demanding applications to proxy servers, and (2) adjusts the fidelity of mobile applications as resources diminish. We formulate a cooperative reconfiguration plan which determines when, where, and which components should be deployed and have their fidelity controlled, so as to minimize the power consumption of mobile devices and to utilize the system resources of servers efficiently. We then construct a graph-theoretic model of the cost of migrating components to one proxy server or to a cluster of servers. In this model, changes to the residual energy of mobile devices, available server resources, and the wireless network bandwidth can all accelerate or decelerate the migration and fidelity control of applications. We suggest an approximation algorithm that achieves a near-optimal solution in terms of energy consumption. Our proposal will support mobile applications which require large amount of computation and need to maintain their services for an extended time such as video conferencing, multimedia e-mail, and real-time navigation. Simulation-based experiments verify that our scheme is an efficient way to extend the battery life of mobile devices and to improve the response time of mobile applications.", "paper_title": "Cooperative reconfiguration of software components for power-aware mobile computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000235508800014"}
