One major issue in designing image processors is to design a memory system that supports, parallel access with a simple interconnection network,. The complexity of the interconnection network mainly depends oil memory allocation: it maps pixels onto memory modules and determines the required number of memory modules. This paper presents a memory allocation method to minimize the number of memory modules for image processing using multi-resolution images. For efficient search. the proposed method exploits the regularity of window-type image processing A practical example demonstrates that the number of memory modules, is reduced to less than 14% that of conventional methods.", "paper_title": "Memory Allocation for Multi-Resolution Image Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400400002"}
