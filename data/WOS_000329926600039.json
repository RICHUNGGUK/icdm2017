The paper defines a kind of Fuzzy Time Petri Nets (FTPN) to simulate the behavior of real-time system limited by time. It studies the conflict with time attribute and space-time collision in real-time system and utilizes time constraints property and the collision possibility to resolve the conflict through knowledge reasoning of fuzzy time interval. Compared with existing methods of conflict analysis and resolution, it takes into account the uncertainty of the time with the system of conflict and contact behavior, which could be better to simulate and analyze real-time system in reality.", "paper_title": "Analysis of real-time system conflict based on fuzzy time Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000329926600039"}
