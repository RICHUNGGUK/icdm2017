They range from healthcare to video surveillance. As the number of applications and their associated performance requirements grow rapidly, more and more powerful, flexible, and power efficient computing units are necessary. In such a context, Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) architectures present a good trade-off between performance and flexibility. However, they consume high static power and can hardly be associated with power-gating techniques due to their long context-restoring phase. In this paper, we propose to integrate non-volatile resistive memories in the configuration cells and registers in order to instantly restore the FPGA context. If the circuit is in the 'ON' state for less than 42% of time, nonvolatile FPGA starts saving energy compared to classical FPGA. Finally, when context-saving functionality is included, for a typical application with only 1% of time spent in the 'ON' state, the energy gain exceeds 40%. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
