These proposals decentralize the admission decision by requiring each host or access gateway to probe the network before sending data. In this paper we describe a probe-based admission control scheme that offers a reliable upper bound on packet loss, as well as small end-to-end delay and delay jitter. The admission control supports host mobility and multicast communications without adding any complexity to the network nodes. We present a mathematical analysis which relates system performance to design parameters and which can be used as a dimensioning aid for the system. Finally, we describe performance results from an experimental prototype as well as simulations that prove that the scheme provides a reliable and efficient solution for QoS provisioning for delay and loss sensitive applications.
