In this paper, we will determine the isomorphisms between two linear representations and , under a few conditions on and . First, we prove that an isomorphism between and is induced by an isomorphism between the two linear representations and of their closures and . This allows us to focus on the automorphism group of a linear representation of a subgeometry embedded in a hyperplane of the projective space . To this end we introduce a geometry and determine its automorphism group. The geometry is a straightforward generalization of which is known to be isomorphic to the linear representation of a Baer subgeometry. By providing an elegant algebraic description of as a coset geometry we extend this result and prove that and are isomorphic. Finally, we compare the full automorphism group of with the \"natural\" group of automorphisms that is induced by the collineation group of its ambient space.", "paper_title": "Linear representations of subgeometries", "paper_id": "WOS:000360509600011"}
