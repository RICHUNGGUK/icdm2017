In these models, it is assumed, according to available information, that the OWA weights are in a decreasing or increasing order. Some properties of the models are analyzed, and the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to provide a direct way to find these weights. The models are solved with a specific level of orness comparing the results with some other related models. The results demonstrate the efficiency of the M-Entropy models in generating the OWA operator weights.", "paper_title": "Determination of Ordered Weighted Averaging Operator Weights Based on the M-Entropy Measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000310336100002"}
