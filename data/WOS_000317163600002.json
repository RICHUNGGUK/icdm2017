The algorithm is based on the conversion of spike trains into analogue signals and the application of the Widrow-Hoff learning rule. In this paper we present a mathematical formulation of the proposed learning rule. Furthermore, we extend the application of the algorithm to train a SNN consisting of multiple spiking neurons to perform spatiotemporal pattern classification and we show that the accuracy of classification is improved significantly over a single spiking neuron. We also investigate a number of possibilities to map the temporal output of the trained spiking neuron into a class label. Potential applications for motor control in neuro-rehabilitation and neuro-prosthetics are discussed as a future work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
