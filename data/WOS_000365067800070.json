The most effective quality assessment from the consumer perspective is still to be researched, yet the most common approach is oriented towards quantitative indicators. This study proposes to use a two-dimensional model that combines the widely accepted segmentation of ICTs with elements from the SERVQUAL quality model. This model, useful in multi-criteria decision-making situations, has been developed using the 2-tuple linguistic representation and fuzzy logic principles. This methodology prevents data loss during processing and provides relevant information through 16 indicators related to the quality of service. Besides, an expert-based mechanism is defined for the use of historical information extracted from completed surveys. As a practical case, this mechanism is applied to the historical information of a telecommunications company for assessing the quality of the service provided to its customers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
