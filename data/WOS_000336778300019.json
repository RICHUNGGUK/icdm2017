Several studies have shown the potential of such methods, but these developments have so far not led to easily accessible, versatile, easy to apply and open source software. Based on the top-kriging approach suggested by Skoien et al. (2006), we will here present the package rtop, which has been implemented in the statistical environment R (R Core Team, 2013). Taking advantage of the existing methods in R for analysis of spatial objects (Bivand et al., 2013), and the extensive possibilities for visualizing the results, rtop makes it easy to apply geostatistical interpolation methods when observations have a non-point spatial support. The package also offers integration with the intamap package for automatic interpolation and the possibility to run rtop through a Web Service. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
