Although full affine invariance cannot be guaranteed due to noncommutativity of camera blur with affine maps and the domain problem (that is, the difficulty of finding an affine covariant domain), the proposed descriptors behave more robustly than SIFT with respect to affine deformations. This is supported by our comparisons both with the version of SIFT computed on an affine normalized neighborhood, and with ASIFT, which solves both the previously mentioned camera blur and domain problems by cleverly sampling the orbit of affine transformations of the images.", "paper_title": "On Affine Invariant Descriptors Related to SIFT", "paper_id": "WOS:000306100200007"}
