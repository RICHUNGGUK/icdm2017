Moreover, the network architecture in LTE-Advanced system is modified to take into account coordinated transmission. Under this background, a novel power allocation game model is established to mitigate inter-cell interference with cellular coordination. In the light of cellular cooperation relationship and centralized control in eNodeB, the power allocation in each served antenna unit aims to make signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) balanced among inter-cells. Through the proposed power allocation game algorithm, the users' SINR can reach the Nash equilibrium, making it feasible to reduce the co-frequency interference by decreasing the transmitted power. Numerical results show that the proposed power allocation algorithm improves the throughput both in cell-center and cell-edge. Moreover, the blocking rate in cell-edge is reduced too.", "paper_title": "Multicell power allocation method based on game theory for inter-cell interference coordination", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000016"}
