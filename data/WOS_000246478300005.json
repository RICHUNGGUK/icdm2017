In a growing number of fields they come to play a critical role. In order to provide a high assurance level, verification and validation (V&V) should be considered early in the development process. This paper shows how this can be achieved based on a goal-oriented requirements engineering framework which combines complementary semi-formal and formal notations. This allows the analyst to formalize only when and where needed and also preserves optimal communication with stakeholders and developers. For the industrial application of the methodology, a supporting toolbox was developed. It consist of a number of tightly integrated tools for performing V&V tasks at requirements level. This is achieved through the use of (1) a roundtrip mapping between the requirements language and the specific formal languages used in the underlying formal tools (such as SAT or constraint solvers) and (2) graphical views using domain-based representations. This paper will focus on two major and representative tools: the Refinement Checker (about verification) and the Animator (about validation).", "paper_title": "Early verification and validation of mission critical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246478300005"}
