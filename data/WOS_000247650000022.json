Since these concentrations affect the spectral distribution of the solar light back-scattered by the water body, their estimation can be computed by using a set of remotely sensed multispectral measurements of the reflected sunlight. In this paper, the relation between the concentrations of interest and the average subsurface reflectances is modelled by means of a set of second-order Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy rules. Unlike first-order TS rules, which adopt linear functions as consequent, second-order TS rules exploit quadratic functions, thus improving the modelling capability of the rule in the subspace determined by the antecedent. First, we show how we can build a second-order TS model through a simple transformation, which allows estimating the consequent parameters using standard linear least-squares algorithms, and by adopting one of the most used methods proposed in the literature to generate first-order TS models. Then, we compare first-order and second-order TS models against mean square error and interpretability of rules. We highlight how second-order TS models allow us to achieve better approximation than first-order TS models though maintaining interpretability of the rules. Finally, we show how second-order TS models perform considerably better (the mean square error is lower by two orders of magnitude) than the specific implementations of radial basis function networks and multi-layer perceptron networks used in previous papers for the same application domain.
