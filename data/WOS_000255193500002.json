A common approach to mitigate these effects is to explore functions of an image that are invariant to these photometric events. In this paper we describe a class of such invariants that result from exploiting color information in images of dichromatic surfaces. These invariants are derived from illuminant-dependent 'subspaces' of RGB color space, and they enable the application of Lambertian-based vision techniques to a broad class of specular, non-Lambertian scenes. Using implementations of recent algorithms taken from the literature, we demonstrate the practical utility of these invariants for a wide variety of applications, including stereo, shape from shading, photometric stereo, material-based segmentation, and motion estimation.", "paper_title": "Color subspaces as photometric invariants", "paper_id": "WOS:000255193500002"}
