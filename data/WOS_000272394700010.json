The relationships between nodes are cooperative rather than competitive. These features allow the design approach of a protocol stack to be able to use the cross-layer interactive way instead of a hierarchical structure. The proposed cross-layer protocol CLWSN optimizes the channel allocation in the MAC layer Using the information from the routing tables, reduces the conflicting set, and improves the throughput. Simulations revealed that it outperforms SMAC and MINA in terms of delay and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Protocol Combining Tree Routing and TDMA Slotting in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700010"}
