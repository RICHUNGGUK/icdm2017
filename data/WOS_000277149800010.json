This methodology is based on an linear matrix inequality (LMI) regional pole-placement design framework for the polytopic models for the CG variation ranges. The application of this method for a design of stability/control augmentation system for the longitudinal flight control system of a high-performance aircraft is shown. Simulation results show that the proposed LMI-based regional pole-placement design methodology robustly yields consistent performances with adequate Level 1 flying qualities over the entire CG variation range.", "paper_title": "LMI-based robust flight control of an aircraft subject to CG variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000277149800010"}
