In order to generalize and accumulate the expertise and experience of simulation analysis and experiments, the intelligent design system of sugarcane harvester is introduced. In the intelligent system of sugarcane harvester, the neural network is applied to overcome the difficulty of knowledge acquisition (KA). In this study, the application of neural network in the system is illustrated, including data predisposal, generation and management of the knowledge. An example is given to explain the application as well. The research shows using neural network can simplify the procedure of knowledge acquisition. It can also evaluate and forecast the performance of sugarcane harvester in design phrase. And it is beneficial to enhance the development success rate of the digital product and to lessen the development cost of physical prototype.", "paper_title": "Knowledge acquisition based on neural networks for performance evaluation of sugarcane harvester", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300185"}
