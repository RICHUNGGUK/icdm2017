The network consists of multiple half-duplex amplify-and-forward two-way relays (TWRs), that assist in establishing communication between two distant nodes. A single TWR that maximizes the achievable-rate of the network is selected to participate in the communication process. Assuming that the optical channel is affected by path loss, misalignment errors, and atmospheric turbulence, we derive exact and asymptotic closed form expressions for the achievable-rate and the relay with the maximum achievable-rate is selected for communication.", "paper_title": "Two-Way Relay Selection in Multiple Relayed FSO Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900008"}
