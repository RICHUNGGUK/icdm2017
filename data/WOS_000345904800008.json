Fixed sample method, sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) method, and sequential Bayesian decision method are provided based on univariate degradation testing. The simulation examples show the superiority of degradation based RDT methods compared with the traditional failure based methods, and the sequential-type methods have more test power than their fixed sample counterparts. The test power can be further improved by combining the test data of a reliability indicator with the data of its marker, based on which the bivariate fixed sample method and the sequential Bayesian decision method are defined. The simulation study shows the benefit from the combination. The degradation based RDT plan optimization model, and the corresponding searching-based solution algorithm using some heuristic rules discovered in the paper, are also presented. The case study of Rubidium Atomic Frequency Standard with a RDT plan design demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods on overcoming the difficulties of small samples in reliability demonstration of long life products.", "paper_title": "Reliability Demonstration for Long-Life Products Based on Degradation Testing and a Wiener Process Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000345904800008"}
