One is to process heterogeneous transportation data collected from different types of traffic sensors and the other is to reduce the high computation intensity for processing massive transportation data. To overcome both challenges, this paper proposes an approach using parallelized fusion on multisensor transportation data. Parallelized fusion is an embodied case of CyberITS framework, which is developed for the synthesis of cyberinfrastructure and ITS. The fusion functionality is shaped by a rough evidential fusion model (REFM) based on rough set and DempsterShafer evidence theories. The REFM consists of four components, which are sensor data input, bootstrapping rough conversion, hierarchical evidential fusion, and traffic state output. Their computation intensity is centered on conversion and fusion components, which can be optimized by the algorithm- and data-centric parallelization, respectively. Computational experiments for accuracy and efficiency demonstrate that parallelized fusion achieves a distributed, high-performance, and collaborative CyberITS implementation to provide accurate and real-time traffic state evaluation.", "paper_title": "Parallelized Fusion on Multisensor Transportation Data: A Case Study in CyberITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317591800003"}
