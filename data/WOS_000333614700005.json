A new constraint is analyzed to substitute an extra searching technique in the set-membership partial-update NLMS algorithm (SM-PU-NLMS) which aims to get a variable number of updating coefficients for a further reduction of computational complexity. We get a closed form expression of the new constraint without extra searching technique to generate a novel set-membership variable-partial-update NLMS (SM-VPU-NLMS) algorithm. Note that the SM-VPU-NLMS algorithm obtains a faster convergence and a smaller mean-squared error (MSE) than the existing SM-PU-NLMS. It is pointed out that the closed form expression can also be applied to the conventional variable-step-size partial-update NLMS (VSS-PU-NLMS) algorithm. The novel variable-step-size variable-partial-update NLMS (VSS-VPU-NLMS) algorithm is also verified to get a further computational complexity reduction. Simulation results verify that our analysis is reasonable and effective.", "paper_title": "Variable partial-update NLMS algorithms with data-selective updating", "paper_id": "WOS:000333614700005"}
