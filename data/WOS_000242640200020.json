However, most AQM schemes suffer obvious performance degradation with dynamic traffic. Extensive measurements found that Internet traffic is extremely bursty and possibly self-similar. We propose in this paper a new AQM scheme called multiscale controller (MSC) based on the understanding of traffic burstiness in multiple time scale. Different from most of other AQM schemes, MSC combines rate-based and queue-based control in two time scales. While the rate-based dropping on burst level (large time scales) determines the packet drop aggressiveness and is responsible for low and stable queuing delay, good robustness and responsiveness, the queue-based modulation of the packet drop probability on packet level (small time scales) will bring low loss and high throughput. Stability analysis is performed based on a fluid-flow model of the TCP/MSC congestion control system and simulation results show that MSC outperforms many of the current AQM schemes.", "paper_title": "Design and analysis of a multiscale active queue management scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000242640200020"}
