The starting point is an area of polygonal shape. It is folded until one or more smaller copies result. The crease pattern is scaled to the reduced copies, and then the process repeats. This is equivalent to maintaining the original crease pattern if the reduced objects are magnified. As will become clear in the paper, the fact that the folded object is enlarged implies that functions are used that are the inverse of contracting functions, as is familiar in inverse techniques for iterated function systems. The method is generalized by allowing cuts before folding. With a well-chosen colorization method, the images obtained reveal complex structures suggestive of depth and light. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
