On the other hand. theoretical results on communication protocols in any scenario where the network topology may change during protocol's execution (i.e. a dynamic radio network) are very few. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of broadcasting in radio networks having dynamic unknown topology. The dynamic network is modeled by means of adversaries: we consider two of them. We first analyze an oblivious, memoryless random adversary that can be seen as the dynamic version of the average-case study presented by Elsasser and Gasieniec in JCSS, 2006. We then consider the deterministic worst-case adversary that, at each time slot, can make any network change (thus the strongest adversary). This is the dynamic version of the worst-case study provided by Bar-Yehuda, Goldreich and Itai in JCSS, 1992. In both cases we provide tight bounds on the completion time of randomized broadcast protocols. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
