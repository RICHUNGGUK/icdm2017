While this parameter model is cognizant of within-die correlations, it does not require specific variation models, layout information, or prior knowledge of intrachip covariance trends. The approach works with a \"generic\" critical path, leading to what is referred to as a \"process-specific\" statistical-timing-analysis technique that depends only on the process technology, transistor parameters, and circuit style. A key feature is that the variation model can be easily built from process data. The derived results are \"full-chip,\" applicable with ease to circuits with millions of components. As such, this provides a way to do a statistical timing analysis without the need for detailed statistical analysis of every path in the design.", "paper_title": "A yield model for integrated circuits and its application to statistical timing analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000244471200015"}
