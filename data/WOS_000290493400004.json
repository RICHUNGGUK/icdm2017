We perform stochastic modelling of the queues at the mobile station for uplink communication with multicode multicarrier CDMA system with two types of traffic, namely real-time and non-real-time. Each traffic is assigned its own codes. However, the non-real-time traffic is allowed to use codes assigned to real-time traffic, when real-time traffic is not using its codes. Based on the probability of bit error for a multicode MC-CDMA system, we first compute the probability of packet error. The packet in error will be inserted into the queue until it successfully gets through to the receiver. The packet arrival process at the input queue is modelled as Markov modulated Poisson processes (MMPP). The QoS performance in terms of packet loss for real-time traffic and the occupancy distribution for non-real-time traffic is evaluated using matrix geometric techniques. We present numerical results for low and high load of real-time traffic with varying loads of non-real-time traffic. We observe the binomial tweaking feature of occupancy distribution at higher loads due to batch departures.
