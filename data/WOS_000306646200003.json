In this paper, we will propose the concept of emerging and adaptive fuzzy logic based behaviours which are based on dynamically created activity spheres. We will provide details both on the conceptual notions behind this approach as well as the detailed results from a real world deployment of our proposed system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
