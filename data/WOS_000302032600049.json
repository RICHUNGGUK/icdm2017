We analyze how to deal with this model when the available information is uncertain and it can be represented with fuzzy numbers. We use different types of aggregation operators that aggregate fuzzy numbers such as the fuzzy weighted average (FWA), the fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (FOWA) operator and the fuzzy hybrid averaging (FHA) operator. As a result, we get the belief structure fuzzy weighted average (BS-FWA), the belief structure fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (BS-FOWA) operator and the belief structure fuzzy hybrid averaging (BS-FHA) operator. We further generalize this new approach by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means. We also develop an illustrative example regarding the selection of investments where we can see the different results obtained by using different types of fuzzy aggregation operators.
