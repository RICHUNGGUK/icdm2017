However, in a highly mobile environment intersymbol and intercarrier interferences (ISI/ICIs) increase and can no longer be neglected. These ISI/ICIs deteriorate the performance of the systems. Proper channel equalization is needed for further improvement of the systems. In this paper, a more general case, namely Biorthogonal Frequency Division System based on Offset QAM (BFDM/OQAM) is considered. We propose a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transversal filter to equalize the time-frequency dispersive channel. Tap weights are calculated using the zero-forcing (ZF) algorithm. We also propose maximum-likelihood channel estimator and its low-complexity version. The proposed system can significantly improve the performance of BFDM/OQAM systems in the highly mobile environment.", "paper_title": "MIMO zero-forcing equalizer for BFDM/OQAM systems in time-frequency dispersive channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100028"}
