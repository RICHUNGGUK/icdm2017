Our proposal of remote wire objects extends OSGi's wiring capability across the framework boundaries, so that even remote services can join in the composition. Hence, a better composition is made possible with a richer set of candidate services from foreign domains.", "paper_title": "Cross-Domain Service Composition in OSGi Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000267639600012"}
