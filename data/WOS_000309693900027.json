It uses a hierarchical strategy to estimate more accurate image pair's registration parameters, which consists of a coarse estimation and a robust and efficient refinement stage as well. The initial parameter is estimated through a conventional Phase Only Correlation (POC) method in the coarse stage, and then it is refined by the Local Upsampling Fourier Transform in frequency domain to achieve higher accuracy. Furthermore, as will be shown in many experiments, the LUFT can achieve more accurate translation and rotation estimation, and it is efficient, robust to noise, and it can be applied to accurate 2D and 3D image rotation and translation estimation.
