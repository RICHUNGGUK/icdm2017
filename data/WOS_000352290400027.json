The structure of the controller and the training algorithm are described. The resilient backpropagation (RPROP) algorithm was chosen for the training process of the artificial neural network (ANN). The algorithm was modified in order to improve controller operation. The specific properties of the controller, i.e., adaptation and auto-tuning, are illustrated by the results of both simulation and experimental research. An electric drive with permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) was chosen for experimental research, due to its impressive dynamics. The obtained results indicate that the presented controller may be implemented in industrial applications.", "paper_title": "Neural Speed Controller Trained Online by Means of Modified RPROP Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290400027"}
