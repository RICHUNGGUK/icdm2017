Numerical experiments are carried out to test the new sensor coupled with the associated nonlinear WENO dissipation filter developed to suppress the numerical dissipation. The tests show that, for a problem containing shocks and vortices, the implementation of the new sensor and an optimized WENO scheme can obtain a stable and highly resolved solution. The numerical experiments demonstrated that the new filter scheme performs efficiently both in parallel and serial running for one-dimensional inviscid flow problems. Direct numerical simulation of a Mach 5 turbulent boundary layer over a flat plate was carried out to demonstrate the applicability of the scheme to the DNS practices.
