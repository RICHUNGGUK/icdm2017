In order to improve the face detection accuracy, a novel structure is introduced which uses the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), as expert and gating networks, and employs a new learning algorithm to adapt with the MLPs. We call this model Mixture of MLP Experts (MMLPE). Experiments using images from the CMU- 130 test set demonstrate the robustness of our method in detecting faces with wide variations in pose, facial expression, illumination, and complex backgrounds. The MMLPE produces promising high detection rate of 98.8% with ten false positives.", "paper_title": "Face detection using mixture of MLP experts", "paper_id": "WOS:000248448900004"}
