A multi-matcher system is proposed where each matcher is trained using features extracted from a single sub-window of the whole 2D image. The features are extracted by the convolution of each subwindow with a bank of Gabor Filters, then their dimensionality is reduced by Laplacian EigenMaps. The best matchers, corresponding to the most discriminative sub-windows, are selected by running the Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS). Our experiments, carried out on a database of 114 people, show that combining only few (similar to ten) sub-windows in the fusion step it is possible to achieve a very low Equal Error Rate.
