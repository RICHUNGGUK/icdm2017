In the EKF, a constant-velocity motion model is used as the dynamic system, and the trifocal-tensor constraint is incorporated into the measurement model. The proposed method has the advantages of those structure- and-motion-based approaches in that the pose sequence can be computed with no prior information on the scene structure. It also has the strengths of those model-based algorithms in which no updating of the three-dimensional (3-D) structure is necessary in the computation. This results in a stable, accurate, and efficient algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperformed other existing EKFs that tackle the same problem. An extension to the pose-tracking algorithm has been made to demonstrate the application of the trifocal constraint to fast recursive 3-D structure recovery.", "paper_title": "Recursive camera-motion estimation with the trifocal tensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700009"}
