A hierarchical Bayesian mixture model can be used to analyse the CAT scan data in terms of the proportion of each tissue type present in a scan. In this paper we present an extension to the hierarchical Bayesian mixture model in which estimated parameters from neighbouring CAT scans can be incorporated into the current model. These models are demonstrated using two examples. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
