The main objective of this paper is to develop and propose a DEA model for distribution centres efficiency measuring that can help managers in decision making and improving the efficiency. Due to numerous indicators that describe DCs operating, the main problem is indicators selection. In order to improve discriminatory power of classical DEA models PCA-DEA approach is used. This paper analysis the efficiency of distribution centres of one trading company in Serbia. Proposed models integrate operational, quality, energy, utilisation and equipment warehouse and transport indicators. Several hypotheses are tested in this paper. The results showed that small distribution centres are more efficient than large. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
