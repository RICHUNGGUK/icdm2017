Resource management for ad hoc grids is challenging due to the participation of heterogeneous, dynamic, autonomous and ephemeral grid nodes. The paper proposes an ad hoc grid resource management system, the producers and consumers of ad hoc grid resource are modeled as the self-interested decision-makers described in microeconomic theory. All market participants in the ad hoc grid environment including grid resources and services can be represented as agents. We apply economic agents to build ad hoc grid resource management, where ad hoc grid resource consumers and providers can buy and sell ad hoc grid resource based on an underlying economic architecture. The main processes involved in ad hoc grid resource management are resource registration, discovery, and resource allocation. The experiments are conducted to compare ad hoc grid resource allocation algorithm with other ad hoc grid resource allocation algorithm. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient than compared allocation scheme. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
