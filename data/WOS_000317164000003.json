In the past decade, reusable software assets have emerged to facilitate scientists in implementing couplers. While there is a large amount of overlap in the features supported by software coupling technologies, their implementations differ significantly in terms of both functional and non-functional properties. Using a domain analysis method called feature analysis, we explore the spectrum of features supported by coupling technologies used to build today's production ESMs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
