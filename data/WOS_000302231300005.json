Unlike the existing related models, we assume that the items are replenished at a finite rate and the demand rate of the items is dependent on the current inventory level. The objective is to determine the optimal replenishment policies in order to maximise the system's average profit per unit of time. A simple method is shown for finding the optimal solution of the model based on the derived properties of the objective function. In addition, we deduce some previously published results as the special cases of the model. Finally, numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed model. Some managerial insights are also inferred from the sensitive analysis of model parameters.", "paper_title": "An EPQ model for deteriorating items with inventory-level-dependent demand and permissible delay in payments", "paper_id": "WOS:000302231300005"}
