The spine was expressed as a set of rigid transforms that superpose local coordinates systems of neighbouring vertebrae. To take into account the fact that rigid transforms belong to a Riemannian manifold, the Frechet mean and a generalized covariance computed in the exponential chart of the Frechet mean were used to construct a statistical shape model. The principal deformation modes were then extracted by performing a principal component analysis (PCA) on the generalized covariance matrix. Principal deformations modes were computed for a large database of untreated scoliotic patients and the obtained results indicate that combining rotation and translation into a unified framework leads to an effective and meaningful method of dimensionality reduction for articulated anatomical structures. The computed deformation modes also revealed clinically relevant information. For instance, the first mode of deformation appeared to be associated with patients' growth, the second is a double thoraco-lumbar curve and the third is a thoracic curve.", "paper_title": "Principal spine shape deformation modes using Riemannian geometry and articulated models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700036"}
