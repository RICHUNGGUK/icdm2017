By means of the definition of a double-level Bayesian networks, a classifier is designed to model the intrinsic temporal orders among the strokes effectively, where a sketchy shape is modeled with the relationships not only between a stroke and its neighbouring strokes, but also between a stroke and all of its subsequence.. The drawing-style tree is then adopted to capture the users' accustomed drawing styles and simplify the training and recognition of Bayesian network classifier. The experiments prove both effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Online composite sketchy shape recognition based on Bayesian networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100063"}
