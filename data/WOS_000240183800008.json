These methods rely on experimental undamped natural frequencies of free vibration. The first solves the inverse problem through gradient based optimization techniques, while the second is based on a metamodel of the inverse problem, using artificial neural networks. A numerical higher order finite element laminated plate model is used in both methods and results are compared and discussed through a simulated and an experimental test case.
