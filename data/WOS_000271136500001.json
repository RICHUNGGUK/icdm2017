This model utilizes the Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion, which is defined by the mobilized friction angle varying with plastic octahedral shear strain. The development of Rowe's stress dilatancy theory is reviewed, with its limitation for rockfills highlighted. A modified solution is then proposed to derive the mobilized dilatancy angle of rockfills. Compared with large-scale triaxial testing results, it has been demonstrated that this simple model is capable of predicting the shear behavior of rockfills with fair accuracy. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
