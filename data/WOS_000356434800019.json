Design/methodology/approach - The modeling of inductors is split into a sequence of progressive finite element (FE) SPs. The source fields (SFs) generated by the source conductors alone are calculated at first via either the Biot-Savart (BS) law or FEs. With a novel general way to define the SFs via interface conditions (ICs), to lighten their evaluation process, the associated reaction fields for each added or modified region, mainly the magnetic cores, and in return for the source conductor regions themselves when massive, are then calculated with FE models. Changes of magnetic regions go from perfect magnetic properties up to volume linear and nonlinear properties, and from statics to dynamics. Findings - For any added or modified region, the novel proposed ICs to define the SFs appear of general usefulness, which opens the method to a wide range of model improvements. Originality/value - The resulting SPM allows efficient solving of parameterized analyses thanks to a proper mesh for each SP and the reuse of previous solutions to be locally corrected, in association with novel SF ICs that strongly lighten the quantity of BS evaluations. Significant corrections are progressively obtained for the fields, up to nonlinear magnetic core properties and skin and proximity effects in conductors, and for the related inductances and resistances.", "paper_title": "Progressive inductor modeling via a finite element subproblem method", "paper_id": "WOS:000356434800019"}
