The dynamics that governs the spread of influence is the following: initially only elements in S are influenced; subsequently at each round, the set of influenced elements is augmented by all nodes in the network that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors. We prove that the problem is NP-hard, even in simple networks like complete graphs and trees. We also derive a series of positive results. We present exact pseudo-polynomial time algorithms for general trees, that become polynomial time in case the trees are unweighted. This last result improves on previously published results. We also design polynomial time algorithms for general weighted paths and cycles, and for unweighted complete graphs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
