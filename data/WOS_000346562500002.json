Gait and anthropometric measures can be used when direct facial comparison is not possible because of perpetrators masking their faces. The nature of judicial and natural scientific forms of evidence is discussed, and rulings dealing with the admissibility of video footage and forensic evidence in general are given. Technical issues of video materials are discussed, and the study also discusses how such evidence may be presented, both in written statements and in court.", "paper_title": "Gait as evidence", "paper_id": "WOS:000346562500002"}
