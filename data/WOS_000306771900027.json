Computer: All systems that Mathematica 7+ is available for (PC, Mac). Operating system: Any platform supporting Mathematica 7+ (Windows, Linux, Mac OS). Classification: 4.2, 5, 11.1. Nature of problem: Calculating the renormalisation group equations of a supersymmetric model involves using long and complicated general formulae [1, 2]. In addition, to apply them it is necessary to know the Lagrangian in its full form. Building the complete Lagrangian of models with small representations of SU(2) and SU(3) might be easy but in the general case of arbitrary representations of an arbitrary gauge group, this task can be hard, lengthy and error prone. Solution method: The Susyno package uses group theoretical functions to calculate the super-potential and the soft-SUSY-breaking Lagrangian of a supersymmetric model, and calculates the two-loop RGEs of the model using the general equations of [1, 2]. Susyno works for models based on any representation(s) of any gauge group (the only exception being multiple U(1) groups). Restrictions: As the program is based on the formalism of [1, 2], it shares its limitations. Running time can also be a significant restriction, in particular for models with many fields. Unusual features: Susyno contains functions that (a) calculate the Lagrangian of supersymmetric models and (b) calculate some group theoretical quantities. Some of these functions are available to the user and can be freely used. A built-in help system provides detailed information. Running time: Tests were made using a computer with an Intel Core 15760 CPU, running under Ubuntu 11.04 and with Mathematica 8.0.1 installed. Using the option to suppress printing, the one- and two-loop beta functions of the MSSM were obtained in 2.5 s (NMSSM: 5.4 s). Note that the running time scales up very quickly with the total number of fields in the model.", "paper_title": "Calculating the renormalisation group equations of a SUSY model with Susyno", "paper_id": "WOS:000306771900027"}
