It facilitates the manipulation and analysis of macromolecular structures, protein complexes and molecular dynamics trajectories. At the same time, Biskit offers a software platform for the rapid integration of external programs and new algorithms into complex structural bioinformatics workflows. Calculations are thus often delegated to established programs like Xplor, Amber, Hex, Prosa, Hmmer and Modeller; interfaces to further software can be easily added. Moreover, Biskit simplifies the parallelization of time consuming calculations via PVM (Parallel Virtual Machine).", "paper_title": "Biskit - A software platform for structural bioinformatics", "paper_id": "WOS:000245511800017"}
