Much of the prior work has concentrated on analyzing the amount of buffering required in core routers assuming that TCP carries all the data traffic. In this paper, we evaluate the amount of buffering required for RCP on a single congested link, while explicitly modeling flow arrivals and departures. Our theoretical analysis and simulations indicate that buff er sizes of about 10% of the bandwidth-delay product are sufficient for RCP to deliver good performance to end-users.", "paper_title": "Buffer Sizing results for RCP Congestion Control under Connection Arrivals and Departures", "paper_id": "WOS:000263492200003"}
