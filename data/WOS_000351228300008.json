For the general case of symmetric costs that obey triangle inequality, a famous conjecture is that the integrality gap is 4/3. Little progress towards resolving this conjecture has been made in 30 years. We conjecture that when all edge costs , the integrality gap is 10/9. We show that this conjecture is true when the optimal subtour LP solution has a certain structure. Under a weaker assumption, which is an analog of a recent conjecture by Schalekamp et al., we show that the integrality gap is at most 7/6. When we do not make any assumptions on the structure of the optimal subtour LP solution, we can show that integrality gap is at most 5/4; this is the first bound on the integrality gap of the subtour LP strictly less than 4/3 known for an interesting special case of the TSP. We show computationally that the integrality gap is at most 10/9 for all instances with at most 12 cities.", "paper_title": "On the integrality gap of the subtour LP for the 1,2-TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000351228300008"}
