Unlike existing approaches, we focus on misalignments; these typically indicate expressions in the source language that are translated to the target in a non-compositional way. We introduce a simple algorithm that proposes MWE candidates based on such misalignments, relying on 1:1 alignments as anchors that delimit the search space. We use a large monolingual corpus to rank and filter these candidates. Evaluation of the quality of the extraction algorithm reveals significant improvements over naive alignment-based methods. The extracted MWEs, with their translations, are used in the training of a statistical machine translation system, showing a small but significant improvement in its performance.", "paper_title": "Extraction of multi-word expressions from small parallel corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000311685900004"}
