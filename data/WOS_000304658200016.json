Two distinct schemes, conventional shortest-path routing and an autonomic algorithm energy aware routing algorithm (EARP) are investigated as the starting point for the gradient algorithm. Comparisons are conducted using the same network test-bed and identical network traffic under conditions where routers and link drivers are always kept on so as to meet the needs for network reliability in the presence of possible failures and unexpected overload. Since splitting traffic flows can increase jitter and the arrival of packets which are out of sequence, we also do not allow the same packet flow to be conveyed over multiple paths. In the experiments that we have conducted we observe that power consumed with the gradient-optimiser that is proposed in this paper is a few percent to 10% smaller than that consumed using shortest-path routing or EARP. Although the savings are small, they can be very significant for the Internet backbone as a whole over long periods of time, and further power savings may be obtained by judiciously putting to sleep equipment when it is under-utilised.", "paper_title": "Power Savings in Packet Networks via Optimised Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000304658200016"}
