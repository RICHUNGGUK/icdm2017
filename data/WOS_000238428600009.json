An important issue in this context is how often one should synchronize the data warehouse to reflect the changes in the constituent operational data sources. If the synchronization is performed very frequently, the associated cost might be quite high, although the data warehouse would only have a small amount of stale data. On the other hand, if the data warehouse is synchronized infrequently, it might result in costly errors in business decisions arising from the stale data: This paper examines the trade-off between the synchronization and staleness costs and derives the optimal synchronization frequency.", "paper_title": "Optimal synchronization policies for data warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000238428600009"}
