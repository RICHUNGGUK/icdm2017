Different form current compressors, which simply apply known 2D compression techniques, the method proposed here was developed taking into account specificities of the components of the spatial compression process which may impact the correct depth visualization, named Chrominance Subsampling, Discrete WaveletTransform (DWT) and Quantization. Each component was evaluated analyzing where datalosses occur and proposing ways to provide a good balance between compression ratio and image quality, minimizing losses in depth perception. The evaluations were made using standard objective (PSNR) and subjective (DSCQS) metrics, applied to an anaglyphic stereoscopic video base. The results showedour method is competitive regarding compression rate and providessuperior image quality.", "paper_title": "A new approach to spatial compression of stereoscopic videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000032"}
