In this work, we present an adaptively secure broadcast encryption resilient to key continual leakage in the standard model. Our scheme provides the tolerance of continual leakage, in which any user can generate multiple private keys per user by periodically updating the key. We use the dual system encryption mechanism to implement the leakage resilience and adaptive security, and intrinsically set an algorithm to refresh a key and produce a same distributed new key. We also give the evaluation of the leakage bound and leakage fraction, and the simulations show that our scheme can tolerate about 71% leakage fraction with 3.34 x 10(-52) failure probability in standard 80-bit security level when we adjust the leakage factor to allow the private key to be 100 Kb.", "paper_title": "Key continual-leakage resilient broadcast cryptosystem from dual system in broadcast networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337042200010"}
