To overcome this, a new fast P2P video transmission method applied in an asymmetrical speed channel environment is proposed in this paper. On the basis of the many-to-one concept, the proposed method uses a new multi-peer aggregation technique to enhance the utilization of down-link bandwidth. In addition, an adaptive peer assignment algorithm is also introduced in order to minimize the overall transmission time. Experimental results show that by using our proposed method, the utilization of down-link bandwidth is significantly improved, and the overall transmission time is greatly reduced.", "paper_title": "A New Fast P2P Video Transmission Method Applied in Asymmetrical Speed Channel Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000279276000002"}
