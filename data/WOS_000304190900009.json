L-2, L*(1) boolean AND L-2, L-1(R). L-2, and L-1(R) boolean AND L-2. The tight bounds for all these combined operations on regular languages are obtained and proved. We show that, as usual, they are different from the mathematical compositions of the state complexities of their individual participating operations.", "paper_title": "State Complexity of Combined Operations with Union, Intersection, Star and Reversal", "paper_id": "WOS:000304190900009"}
