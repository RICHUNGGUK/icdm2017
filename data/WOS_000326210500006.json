We investigated users' space management strategies depending on the design philosophy of the user interface (visualization- or document-centric). We classified the types of territorial behavior exhibited in terms of how the users interacted with information on the display (integrated or independent workspaces). Next, we examined how territorial behavior impacted the common ground between the pairs of users. Finally, we offer design suggestions for building future co-located collaborative visual analytics tools for use on large, high-resolution vertical displays. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
