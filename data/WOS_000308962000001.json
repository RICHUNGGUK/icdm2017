Its focus lies on applications in the field of electrocardiography. The topic discussed is also relevant in other medical domains, such as electroencephalography, electroneurography and electromyography. In such domains the methodology involved rests on the same basic principles of physics and electrophysiology as well as on the applied techniques of signal analysis and numerical analysis.", "paper_title": "The inverse problem of bioelectricity: an evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308962000001"}
