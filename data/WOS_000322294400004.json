In this paper, we develop a new LRSV estimator based on the time-varying room impulse responses (RIRs) with the assumption that the background noise is comprised of reverberant noise and direct-path noise in a noisy and reverberant environment. In the LRSV estimator, more than one item of past spectral variance of the reverberant signals are used to obtain a smoother shape parameter, which can lead to a better performance for dereverberation compared to the classic methods. Since this shape parameter affected by the estimation error of LRSV may in turn affect the subsequent LRSV estimation, we combine this smoother shape parameter based LRSV estimator with maximum likelihood (ML) algorithm in spectral domain in order to get a more reliable estimation of LRSV. Furthermore, we use the proposed LRSV estimator prior rather than posterior to speech enhancement in noisy and reverberant environment. Experimental results demonstrate our new LRSV estimator is more effective for both noise-free and noisy reverberant speech. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
