The design technique involves the \"doping\" of standard LDPC (proto-)graphs, by which we mean Hamming or recursive systematic convolutional (RSC) code constraints are used together with single-parity-check (SPC) constraints to construct a code's protograph. We show that the doping of a \"good\" graph with Hamming or RSC codes is a pragmatic approach that frequently results in a code with a good threshold and very low error-rate floor. We focus on low-rate Tanner codes, in part because the design of low-rate, lowfloor LDPC codes is particularly difficult. Lastly, we perform a simple complexity analysis of our Tanner codes and examine the performance of lower-complexity, suboptimal Hamming-node decoders.", "paper_title": "Low-floor tanner codes via hamming-node or RSCC-node doping", "paper_id": "WOS:000236107500024"}
