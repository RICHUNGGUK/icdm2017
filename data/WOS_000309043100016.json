Furthermore, by virtue of Mason theorem, we present two new equivalent conditions to evaluate whether the global encoding kernels (GEKs) can be uniquely determined by the given complete set of local encoding kernels (LEKs) in a CNC over a cyclic network. These two new equivalent conditions turn out to be more intuitive. Moreover, we give an alternative simple proof of an existing result.", "paper_title": "Equivalent Conditions to Determine the GEKs by the LEKs in a Convolutional Network Code over a Cyclic Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043100016"}
