In particular, we investigate separating and extending GUB cover inequalities. We show that, unlike in the linear case, determining whether a cover can be extended with a single variable NP-hard. We describe and compare a number of exact and heuristic separation and extension algorithms which make use of the structure of the constraints. Computational experiments are performed for comparing the proposed separation and extension algorithms. These experiments show that a judicious application of the extended GUB cover cuts can reduce the solution time of conic quadratic 0-1 programs with GUB constraints substantially.", "paper_title": "Separation and Extension of Cover Inequalities for Conic Quadratic Knapsack Constraints with Generalized Upper Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000322424000004"}
