Previous research has established that online repeat purchase intentions are the product of buyer assessments of trust in the online seller. Previous research has also affirmed the importance of justice perceptions in engendering trust. These perspectives, however, have been examined independently by IS and management researchers. By integrating these two perspectives, a richer understanding of buyers' underlying beliefs and subsequent repeat purchase intentions can be gained. In the research model, bidding justice is proposed as a formative second-order construct driven by distributive justice, procedural justice, interpersonal justice, and informational justice. Bidding justice is hypothesized to positively affect trust in the community of sellers, which in turn is hypothesized to positively affect repeat purchase intentions. Data collected from 412 buyers in Yahoo-Kimo's online auction marketplace provide support for the proposed model. The study shows that trust is a significant positive predictor of buyers' intentions to repeat purchase. The study also shows that the four dimensions of justice are important components of bidding justice, which in turn has a strong positive effect on trust in the community of sellers. Implications for theory and practice and suggestions for future research are discussed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
