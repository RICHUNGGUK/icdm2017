Consequently, we propose the design of a ubiquitous, context-aware and evolvable network architecture able to cope with the requirements of restricted networks and devices. The architecture is designed to avoid hierarchical layering, so we propose a service-oriented approach for a flow-oriented context-aware network architecture where communications are composed on the fly (by exploiting reusable components) according to the needs and requirements of the consumed service. Furthermore, the architecture can be extended for other environments, so we also address how to extend it for fulfilling the different \"Internet of\" visions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
