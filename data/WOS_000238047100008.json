E-business, which is a manifestation of this development, relies on efficient information sharing within and between companies. E-business requires interoperabiliry of information systems and, therefore, standardization of information sharing. An e-business framework is a standard for information sharing within and between companies. Tens of e-business frameworks have been standardized so that they utilize XML (Extensible Markup Language). This paper analyzes the properties and standardization of 12 prominent XML-based e-business frameworks. The analysis focuses on the commonalities, differences and regularities between these e-business frameworks and their standardization. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
