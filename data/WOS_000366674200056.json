In addition, the broadcasting nature of a wireless environment makes cooperative communications possible. In this paper, by utilizing the cross-layer optimization scheme, we introduce the fuzzy time series predication model that has linear computational complexity to forecast network performance. When we establish a fuzzy time series model, the sent queue length of the link layer is taken into consideration for the network layer's throughput prediction. In addition, we propose a fuzzy time series-based congestion control framework that is combined with a cooperative communication mechanism, and we apply the fuzzy time series prediction results in the preprocessing of network congestion. Through simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed cross-layer cooperative strategies achieve significant network throughput improvement and average packet delivery ratio.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy time series-based cross-layer optimization scheme for cooperative communication in wireless network", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200056"}
