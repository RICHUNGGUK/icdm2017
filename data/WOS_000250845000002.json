But there are some exceptional point configurations which are not reconstructible from the distribution of distances in the above sense. In this paper, we concentrate on the planar case m = 2 and present a reconstructibility test with running time O(n(11)). The cases of orientation preserving rigid motions (rotations and translations) and scalings are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Which point configurations are determined by the distribution of their pairwise distances?", "paper_id": "WOS:000250845000002"}
