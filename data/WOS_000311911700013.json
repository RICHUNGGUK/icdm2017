Ferreira, F.A. Kurokawa, R.A.B. Queiroz, M.K. Kaibara, C.M. Oishi, J.A. Cuminato, A.F. Castelo, M.F. Tome, S. McKee, assessment of a high-order finite difference upwind scheme for the simulation of convection-diffusion problems, International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids 60 (2009) 1-26]. The ADBQUICKEST scheme is a new TVD version of the QUICKEST [B.P. Leonard, A stable and accurate convective modeling procedure based on quadratic upstream interpolation, Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering 19 (1979) 59-98] for solving nonlinear balance laws. The scheme is based on the concept of NV and TVD formalisms and satisfies a convective boundedness criterion. The accuracy of the scheme is compared with other popularly used convective upwinding schemes (see, for example, Roe (1985) [19], Van Leer (1974) [18] and Arora & Roe (1997) [17]) for solving nonlinear conservation laws (for example, Buckley-Leverett, shallow water and Euler equations). The ADBQUICKEST scheme is then used to solve six types of fluid flow problems of increasing complexity: namely, 2D aerosol filtration by fibrous filters; axisymmetric flow in a tubular membrane; 2D two-phase flow in a fluidized bed; 2D compressible Orszag-Tang MHD vortex; axisymmetric jet onto a flat surface at low Reynolds number and full 3D incompressible flows involving moving free surfaces. The numerical simulations indicate that this convective upwinding scheme is a good generic alternative for solving complex fluid dynamics problems. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
