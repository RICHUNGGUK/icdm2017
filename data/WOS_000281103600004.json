Traditionally, product lifecycle management systems provide a platform for the management of data related to the creation and disposal of products. These systems assist the participants of the products' life cycle processes (manufacturers, suppliers, customers, and regulators) to use data efficiently for planning and control. However, most data collected do not resolve the environmental issues which arise when selling the products or arranging the products to be replaced and disposed. In this paper, we present an Integrated Green Parts Information Platform (IGPIP) framework (The frame work revisited here was published as \"A Framework for a Green Product Lifecycle Management System\", Issues in Information Systems, Vol. IX, No. (2), 2008, 123-131.) and a working prototype of the system. This system uses XML file transmission to improve the quality, cost and time-to market issues for green designs. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
