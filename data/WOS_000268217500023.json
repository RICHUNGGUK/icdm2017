Our primary goals are the segmentation of different paths through a mixing device and the visualization of ellipsoidal particle deformations. The main challenges are the numerically efficient processing of deformation tensors and the robust integration of stream- and streaklines at boundaries of the dataset such that closed segments are obtained. Our results show two- and three-dimensional particle deformations as well as the segmentation of volumes in stationary fields and areas in time-dependent datasets taking consistent paths through a mixing device.", "paper_title": "Volume Deformations in Grid-Less Flow Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000268217500023"}
