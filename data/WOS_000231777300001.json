Numerous factors can affect throughput in such highly integrated systems. These include numbers and types of equipment, physical layout, storage capacity and operating strategies. This study aims to improve operating strategies by developing an analytical tool to assist in load planning of container trains. The problem investigated can be described as a dynamic assignment problem with many uncertain parameters. Numerical investigations focus on tuning the proposed model to deal with the uncertainties.
