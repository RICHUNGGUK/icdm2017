The degrees of freedom (DoF) regions for the two-user broadcast and interference MIMO networks with general antenna configuration under such conditions are fully characterized, as a function of the prediction quality indicator. Specifically, a simple unified framework is proposed, allowing us to attain optimal DoF region for the general antenna configurations and current CSIT qualities. Such a framework builds upon block-Markov encoding with interference quantization, optimally combining the use of both outdated and instantaneous CSIT. A striking feature of our work is that, by varying the power allocation, every point in the DoF region can be achieved with one single scheme. As a result, instead of checking the achievability of every corner point of the outer bound region, as typically done in the literature, we propose a new systematic way to prove the achievability.", "paper_title": "The Degrees of Freedom Region of Temporally Correlated MIMO Networks With Delayed CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600036"}
