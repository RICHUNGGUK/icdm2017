Time series related to events which are interesting for the user are obtained by querying data cubes using OnLine Analytical Processing (OLAP) operations on the time dimension. The comparison of these query results can be summarized so that an appropriate short linguistic description of the series is provided to the user. Our approach is based on linguistically quantified statements and pointwise definitions of the degree and sign of local change. Our linguistic summaries are well suited to be included in an interface layer of a data warehouse system, improving the quality of human-machine interaction and the understandability of the results.
