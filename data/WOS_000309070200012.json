In this paper, we present a local Poisson SPH (LPSPH) method to solve incompressibility for particle based fluid simulation. Considering the pressure Poisson equation, we first convert it into an integral form, and then apply a discretization to convert the continuous integral equation to a discretized summation over all the particles in the local pressure integration domain determined by the local geometry. To control the approximation error, we further integrate our local pressure solver into the predictive-corrective framework to avoid the computational cost of solving a pressure Poisson equation globally. Our method can effectively eliminate the large density deviations mainly caused by the solid boundary treatment and free surface topological change, and show advantage of a higher convergence rate over the predictive-corrective incompressible SPH (PCISPH).", "paper_title": "Local Poisson SPH For Viscous Incompressible Fluids", "paper_id": "WOS:000309070200012"}
