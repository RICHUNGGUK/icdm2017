Comparing with an existing transductive learning method named MRBIR [12], our method could work well whether or not the query image is in the database; thus, it is more applicable for real applications. Given a query image, gMRBIR first initializes a pseudo seed vector based on neighborhood relationship and then spread its scores via manifold ranking to all the unlabeled images in the database. Furthermore, in gMRBIR, we also make use of relevance feedback and active learning to refine the retrieval result so that it converges to the query concept as fast as possible. Systematic experiments on a general-purpose image database consisting of 5 000 Corel images demonstrate the superiority of gMRBIR over state-of-the-art techniques.", "paper_title": "Generalized manifold-ranking-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776200025"}
