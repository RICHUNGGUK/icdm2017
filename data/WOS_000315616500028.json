We present a three-stage methodology that can be used to select personnel rosters. In the first stage we generate multiple personnel rosters with a mathematical programming model. In the second stage, the performance of the rosters regarding a number of service criteria is evaluated through discrete event simulation. In the third stage, a ranking is made using data envelopment analysis. The methodology is tested on a personnel scheduling problem for aircraft line maintenance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
