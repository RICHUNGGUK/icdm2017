This paper proposes an effective rotation and scale invariant holistic handwritten word recognition scheme. This approach utilizes M-band packet wavelet transform to extract feature vector of Farsi word image. The global and local features extracted are exploited in recognition of limited-size lexicon of handwritten words. The rotation and scale invariant feature of a word image involves applying a polar transform to eliminate rotation and scale effects, but this produces M-row shifted polar image, which is passed to a row shift invariant M-band wavelet packet transform to eliminate the row shift effects. The output wavelet coefficients are rotation and scale invariant. For each subband of these wavelet coefficients a set of local energy features are computed and we extract feature vectors from the subbands of wavelet coefficients. The proposed polar M-band wavelet features have been tested by employing Mahalanobis algorithm to classify a set of distinct natural handwriting Farsi words. We compared the proposed scheme with two well-known rotation invariant methods; Fourier-wavelet and Zernike moments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the recognition rate about 12 percents. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
