Using training images, we created a 3D model of an average face. This allows us to transform the image in each frame of an input video, so that it is seen from the front. Then we apply 2D exaggeration rules to caricature each face. Finally, we rotate the face in each frame back to its original position. A panel of viewers gave positive scores to a series of test videos. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Caricature video", "paper_id": "WOS:000250211000007"}
