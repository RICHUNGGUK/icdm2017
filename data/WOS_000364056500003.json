How can we explore the cognitive role that colour plays in determining brand perception? To answer these questions we propose a preference disaggregation method based on multi criteria decision aid. We identify the criteria aggregation model that underlies the global preference of a brand with respect to each brand image attribute. The proposed method is inspired by the well-known UTASTAR algorithm, but unlike the original formulation, it represents preferences by means of non-monotonic value functions. The method is applied to a database of brands ranked on each brand image attribute. For each brand image attribute, non-monotonic marginal value functions from each component of the brand colour are obtained separately. These functions contain the fitness between each colour component and each brand image attribute, in an understandable manner.
