Introducing the N-oxides into the azacubanes could improve their detonation performance significantly due to the increase of the OB and. but would also increase the sensitivity to some extent. These effects would be further enhanced as the numbers of N-oxides increase. Among all the designed azacubane N-oxides, D6-4 (1,3,5,7-tetraazacubane-1,3,5,7-tetraoxides) has higher detonation performance than one famous high explosive HMX (1,3,5,7-tetranitro-1,3,5,7-tetrazocane) and lower sensitivity than one very insensitive explosive TNT (1-methyl-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene), suggesting that its overall performance is outstanding and may be considered as the potential candidate of insensitive high explosives. The internal small cage C-N skeleton of D6-4 is surrounded by the external big cage hydrogen bonds and this special double cage structure may be an important reason why it has low sensitivity.", "paper_title": "Searching for a new family of insensitive high explosives by introducing N hybridization and N-oxides into a cage cubane", "paper_id": "WOS:000343888400010"}
