However, service providers and users suffer from low responsiveness when content is encrypted with traditional cryptographic tools that require strong decryption algorithms on mobile devices. In this paper, we introduce a generic partial encryption scheme for low-power mobile devices. Our primary goal is to design a generic architecture for partial encryption of downloadable and real-time streaming contents, and also to facilitate a trade-off between minimizing the encryption/decryption overhead and providing sufficient DRM security for the service provider. We also evaluate the efficacy of our proposed scheme by applying it to real-world multimedia contents. The results of our experiments indicate that encrypting only a small portion (about 2.5 %) of video content can effectively impose DRM restriction on the content. This significantly reduces the decryption overhead on low-power mobile devices. In the smart phone environment, it is shown that the time overhead during the decryption is less that 5 % of on-the-fly decoding time and the power overhead is reduced by up to 94.5 %, compared to the traditional full encryption scheme.", "paper_title": "A generic partial encryption scheme for low-power mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300002"}
