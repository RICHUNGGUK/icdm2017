The sum-product algorithm(SPA) can be used to decode quantum LDPC codes; however, the decoding performance may be significantly decreased by the many four-cycles required by this type of quantum codes. All four-cycles can be eliminated using the entanglement-assisted formalism with maximally entangled states (ebits). The proposed entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting code based on Euclidean geometry outperform differently structured quantum codes. However, the large number of ebits required to construct the entanglement-assisted formalism is a substantial obstacle to practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel class of entanglement-assisted quantum LDPC codes constructed using classical Euclidean geometry LDPC codes. Notably, the new codes require one copy of the ebit. Furthermore, we propose a construction scheme for a corresponding zigzag matrix and show that the algebraic structure of the codes could easily be expanded. A large class of quantum codes with various code lengths and code rates can be constructed. Our methods significantly improve the possibility of practical implementation of quantum error-correcting codes. Simulation results show that the entanglement-assisted quantum LDPC codes described in this study perform very well over a depolarizing channel with iterative decoding based on the SPA and that these codes outperform other quantum codes based on Euclidean geometries.", "paper_title": "Novel Class of Entanglement-Assisted Quantum Codes with Minimal Ebits", "paper_id": "WOS:000318701400012"}
