We first propose definitions of quaternion fuzzy sets and discuss entailed results which parallel those of regular,fuzzy numbers. Two existence results, relevant to the Cauchy problem for fuzzy fractional differential equations in the case of bounded integral operators, are given. The results require either Holder continuous or Lipschitz continuous response functions.", "paper_title": "The Cauchy problem for quatemion fuzzy fractional differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000040"}
