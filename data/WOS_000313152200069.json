This study incorporates additional information from the users social trust network and the items' semantic domain knowledge to alleviate these problems. It proposes an innovative Trust-Semantic Fusion (TSF)-based recommendation approach within the CF framework. Experiments demonstrate that the TSF approach significantly outperforms existing recommendation algorithms in terms of recommendation accuracy and coverage when dealing with the above problems. A business-to-business recommender system case study validates the applicability of the TSF approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
