We derive accurate a posteriori error estimates that account for all sources of error, and in particular the transfer of error between fluid and solid domains. We use these estimates to guide adaptive mesh refinement. In addition, we provide compelling numerical evidence that the order of convergence of the operator decomposition method is limited by the accuracy of the transferred gradient information, and adapt a so-called boundary flux recovery method developed for elliptic problems in order to regain the optimal order of accuracy in an efficient manner. In an appendix, we provide an argument that explains the numerical results provided sufficient smoothness is assumed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
