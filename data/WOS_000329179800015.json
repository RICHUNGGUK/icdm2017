Objectives are to meet the demand profile, minimize electricity consumption cost, and to modify air pollution under a dynamic electricity pricing policy. The energy demand in the micro-grid network is provided by distributed renewable energy generation (coupling solar and wind), battery storage and balancing power from the electric utility. The fuzzy intelligent approach allows the calculation of the energy exchange rate of the micro-grid storage unit as a function of time. Such exchange rate (or decision-making capability) is based on (1) the electrical energy price per kilowatt-hour (kWh), (2) local demand (load), (3) electricity generation rate of renewable resources (supply), and (4) air pollution measure, all of which are sampled at predefined rates. Then, a cost function is defined as the net dollar amount corresponding to electricity flow between micro-grid and the utility grid. To define the cost function one must consider the cost incurred by the owner of the micro-grid associated to its distribution losses, in addition to its demand and supply costs, in such a way that a positive cost translates to owner losses and a negative cost is a gain. Six likely scenarios were defined to consider different micro-grid configurations accounting for the conditions seen in micro-grids today and also the conditions to be seen in the future. GA is implemented as a heuristic (DNA-based) search algorithm to determine the sub-optimal settings of the fuzzy controller. The aforementioned net cost (which includes pricing, demand and supply measures) and air pollution measures are then compared in every scenario with the objective to identify best-practices for energy control and management of micro-grids. Performance of the proposed GA-fuzzy intelligent approach is illustrated by numerical examples, and the capabilities and flexibility of the proposed framework as a tool for solving intermittent multi-objective function problems are presented in detail. Micro-grid owners looking into adopting a smart decision-making tool for energy storage management may see an ROI between 5 and 10.", "paper_title": "COST-EFFICIENT ENVIRONMENTALLY-FRIENDLY CONTROL OF MICRO-GRIDS USING INTELLIGENT DECISION-MAKING FOR STORAGE ENERGY MANAGEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000329179800015"}
