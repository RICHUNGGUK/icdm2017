A natural goal is to apply this approach to the Gaussian interference channel with an arbitrary number of users. We make progress towards this goal by finding the capacity region of the many-to-one and one-to-many Gaussian interference channels to within a constant number of bits. The result makes use of a deterministic model to provide insight into the Gaussian channel. The deterministic model makes explicit the dimension of signal level. A central theme emerges: the use of lattice codes for alignment of interfering signals on the signal level.", "paper_title": "The Approximate Capacity of the Many-to-One and One-to-Many Gaussian Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000283072400030"}
