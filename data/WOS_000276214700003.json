In particular, we consider a one dimensional array of three level systems interacting via a nearest-neighbour interaction. By encoding the qubit on two levels and using simple projective frequent measurements yielding the quantum Zeno effect, we demonstrate how to implement a well defined quantum register, quantum state transfer on demand, universal two-qubit gates and two-qubit parity measurements. Thus, we argue that the main ingredients for universal quantum computation can be achieved in a spin chain with an always-on and constant many-body Hamiltonian. We also show some possible modifications of the initially assumed dynamics in order to create maximally entangled qubit pairs and single qubit gates.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM INFORMATION PROCESSING WITH QUANTUM ZENO MANY-BODY DYNAMICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276214700003"}
