To support online traffic management, wireless traffic surveillance networks have the potential to collect and relay real-time traffic information from a wide-area transportation network. However, limited research effort has been done to provide an evaluation method to assess the wireless communication performance and reliability for use in a traffic monitoring network. This paper proposed a multi-step analysis method to transportation professionals, and analyzed the performance of a wireless traffic surveillance network for online traffic surveillance using the Network Simulator Version 2 (ns-2) communication network simulator, following the proposed steps. Potential environmental disturbances, such as adverse weather, foliage, and interference, can induce transmission errors in the communication network. Following the proposed method, this study analyzed the impacts of various error rates on the selected measure of effectiveness (MOE) - data throughput and delivery ratio. The study considered wireless sensors connected to roadside controllers through multi-hop relays. A relay is used to pass data from one equipment to another when the distance between traffic sensors and controllers exceeds the wireless transmission range. Simulation results quantified the end-to-end throughput and delivery ratio dependency on the number of fixed range wireless relays and their relationship with different error rates and wireless relay ranges. The findings formed an essential foundation for systematic evaluation of the performance of a wireless traffic sensor network, utilizing a simulation analysis process, for online traffic management systems.", "paper_title": "Development of a multi-step analysis method for evaluating wireless traffic surveillance network performance under adverse conditions and relay network topology using a communication network simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000306511000005"}
