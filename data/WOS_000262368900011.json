In contrast to the existing password change schemes using a server's public key, the proposed scheme can securely update user passwords without a complicated process and server's public key, and also provides explicit key authentication in the case of a session key agreement.", "paper_title": "Robust User Password Change Scheme based on the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368900011"}
