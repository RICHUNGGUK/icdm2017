The long signaling delay for session reestablishment in application layer always results in session interruptions during the handoff. Therefore, handoff poses a challenge for quality of service (QoS) maintenance in IMS that targets to offer real-time multimedia applications over wireless mobile networks. The existing approaches to solve this problem depend on the advance resource reservation and the optimization of handoff control. Unfortunately, big cost of the advance resource reservation in neighboring domains is a major problem that leads to a serious signaling load and a waste of wireless bandwidth. To solve this issue, we present an enhanced IMS handoff mechanism (EHM) based on user mobility prediction to save network resources by avoiding multiple useless advance reservations. In addition, to support the heterogeneous access networks in IMS domain, EHM evolves a network selective scheme to utilize the network resources more efficiently. The architecture of EHM and the advance QoS negotiation signaling are also presented. We model the cost, the handoff delay and the session blocking probability for EHM and the previous work. Analytical and simulation results show that EHM can enhance the handoff performance, such as reducing resource reservation cost greatly, decreasing session reestablishment delay and making good use of multiple access network resources.", "paper_title": "Enhanced IMS Handoff Mechanism for QoS Support over Heterogeneous Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000284954700013"}
