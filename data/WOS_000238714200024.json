Though there are many reported algorithms proposed for restoring noisy blurred color images and inverse halftoning, restoration of color-quantized images is rarely addressed in the literature especially when the images are color-quantized with halftoning. Direct application of existing restoration techniques are generally inadequate to deal with this problem. In this paper, a restoration algorithm based on projection onto convex sets is proposed. This algorithm makes use of the available color palette and the mechanism of a halftoning process to derive useful a priori information for restoration. Simulation results showed that it could improve the quality of a halftoned color-quantized image remarkably in terms of both SNR and CIELAB color difference metric.", "paper_title": "A POCS-based restoration algorithm for restoring halftoned color-quantized images", "paper_id": "WOS:000238714200024"}
