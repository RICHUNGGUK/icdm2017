The quality of connectivity measures how easily and reliably a packet sent by a node can reach another node. It complements the use of capacity to measure the quality of a network in saturated traffic scenarios and provides an intuitive measure of the quality of (end-to-end) network connections. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic connectivity matrix as a tool to measure the quality of network connectivity. Some interesting properties of the probabilistic connectivity matrix and their connections to the quality of connectivity are demonstrated. We demonstrate that the largest magnitude eigenvalue of the probabilistic connectivity matrix, which is positive, can serve as a good measure of the quality of network connectivity. We provide a flooding algorithm whereby the nodes repeatedly flood the network with packets, and by measuring just the number of packets a given node receives, the node is able to asymptotically estimate this largest eigenvalue.", "paper_title": "A New Measure of Wireless Network Connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264300001"}
