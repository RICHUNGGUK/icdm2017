The key of this approach is to find similar users or items using user-item rating matrix so that the system can show recommendations for users. However, most approaches related to this approach are based on similarity algorithms, such as cosine, Pearson correlation coefficient, and mean squared difference. These methods are not much effective, especially in the cold user conditions. This paper presents a new user similarity model to improve the recommendation performance when only few ratings are available to calculate the similarities for each user. The model not only considers the local context information of user ratings, but also the global preference of user behavior. Experiments on three real data sets are implemented and compared with many state-of-the-art similarity measures. The results show the superiority of the new similarity model in recommended performance. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.
