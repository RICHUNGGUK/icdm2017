Our main interest has been to test several standard CLIR techniques and investigate how they affect the final performance of the multilingual system. Specifically, we have evaluated the information retrieval (IR) model used to obtain each monolingual result, the merging algorithm, the translation approach and the application of query expansion techniques. The obtained results show that by means of improving merging algorithms and translation resources we reach better results than improving other CLIR modules such as IR engines or the expansion of queries.", "paper_title": "SINAI at CLEF 2005: Multi-8 two-years-on and multi-8 merging-only tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000012"}
