For popular files, we derive, with regard to BitTorrent, an expression for the optimal time seeders should support leechers. For unpopular files, we extend an existing model by taking into account leechers' power consumption dependent on the load. Leechers are assumed to build a temporary cluster within the P2P-overlay. We determine the required number of active leechers to cope with a given load and compare results from an analytical model to simulation. We demonstrate that it is possible to reach almost optimal energy efficiency for the download scenario by comparing the local case without cooperation with the distributed case where leechers cooperate.", "paper_title": "Energy efficient peer-to-peer file sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000310428700005"}
