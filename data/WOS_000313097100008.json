Since the arrival of the direct linear transformation method and its later revisions, new methods have been developed by several authors, such as: Tsai, Heikkila and Zhang. Most of these have been based on the pinhole model, including distortion correction. Some of these methods, such as Tsai method, allow the use of two different techniques for determining calibration parameters: a non-coplanar calibration technique using three-dimensional (3D) calibration objects, and a coplanar technique that uses two-dimensional (2D) calibration objects. The calibration performed by observing a 3D calibration object has good accuracy, and produces very efficient results; however, the calibration object must be accurate enough and requires an elaborate configuration. In contrast, the use of 2D calibration objects yields less accurate results, is much more flexible, and does not require complex calibration objects that are costly to produce. This article compares these two different calibration procedures from the perspective of stereo measurement. Particular attention was focused on the accuracy of the calculated camera parameters, the reconstruction error in the computer image coordinates and in the world coordinate system and advanced image-processing techniques for subpixel detection during the comparison. The purpose of this work is to establish a basis and selection criteria for choosing one of these techniques for camera calibration, according to the accuracy required in each of the many applications using photogrammetric vision: robot calibration methods, trajectory generation algorithms, articulated measuring arm calibration, and photogrammetric systems.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Tsai calibration method using two- and three-dimensional calibration objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000313097100008"}
