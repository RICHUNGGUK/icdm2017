The improvement involves adding a new hybrid differential evolution (HDE) operator into the krill, updating process for the purpose of dealing with optimization problems more efficiently. The introduced HDE operator inspires the intensification and lets the krill perform local search within the defined region. DEKH is validated by 26 functions. From the results, the proposed methods are able to find more accurate solution than the KH and other methods. In addition, the robustness of the DEKH algorithm and the influence of the initial population size on convergence and performance are investigated by a series of experiments.", "paper_title": "Hybrid krill herd algorithm with differential evolution for global numerical optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387600006"}
