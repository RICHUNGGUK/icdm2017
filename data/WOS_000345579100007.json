However, existing solutions, which usually rely on a high-performance server with large storage capacity, are not scalable for detailed analysis of a large volume of traffic data. In this article, we present a traffic monitoring and analysis system for large-scale networks based on Hadoop, an open-source distributed computing platform for big data processing on commodity hardware. This system has been deployed in the core network of a large cellular network and extensively evaluated. The results demonstrate that the system can efficiently processes 4.2 Tbytes of traffic data from 123 Gb/s links with high performance and low cost every day.", "paper_title": "Monitoring and Analyzing Big Traffic Data of a Large-Scale Cellular Network with Hadoop", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579100007"}
