Starting with the idea that ontologies are the right way to formalize domain knowledge and that Bayesian networks are the right tool for probabilistic reasoning, we propose an approach for extracting a Bayesian network from a populated ontology and for reasoning over it. The paper presents the theory behind the approach, its design and examples of its use.", "paper_title": "Mining Bayesian networks out of ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000302240800009"}
