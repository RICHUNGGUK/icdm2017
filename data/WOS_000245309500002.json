As a special case the well established \"step-leap\" representation is examined. In the step-leap representation, each melodic diatonic interval is classified as a step (+/- s), a leap (+/- l) or a unison (u). Binary don't care symbols are used to represent the possible overlapping between the various abstract categories e.g. * = s, * = l and # = -s, # = -l. We propose an O(n + d(n - d) + z)-time algorithm for computing all maximal-pairs in a given sequence x = x[l..n], where x contains d occurrences of binary don't cares and z is the number of reported maximal-pairs.
