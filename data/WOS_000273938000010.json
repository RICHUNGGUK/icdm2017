The main interest here is to construct a next day predictor for the peak and hourly load. To this end the load data are organized into profiles according to day type and temperature interval. For each load profile, we use a specialized adaptive recursive digital filter, for which parameters are estimated on-line by using a recursive algorithm. As a result, the complete forecasting system is nonlinear and the prediction is computed based on the type and on the temperature interval of the next day. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is illustrated by a numerical example, in which we compare performance of the proposed approach to a non-specialized and a naive predictors, by using the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of the forecasting errors.
