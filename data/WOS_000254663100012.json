Design/methodology/approach - Assumptions are tested by comparing analytical prediction to numerical simulation results. Findings - This study validates the analytical model for a solid sample. Research limitations/implications - This research only focuses on solid samples. Originality/value - This paper allows a broader study on the relevance of modulated calorimetry on liquid samples.", "paper_title": "Inductive modulated calorimetry: analytical model versus numerical simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254663100012"}
