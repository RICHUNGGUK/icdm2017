In this paper, we shall fix a set partition of the natural numbers N, ( N-1,N-..., N-s), and we study the distribution of descents, levels, and rises according to whether the first letter of the descent, rise, or level lies in N-i over the set of words over the alphabet [k] = {1,..., k}. In particular, we refine and generalize some of the results by Burstein and Mansour.", "paper_title": "Counting descents, rises, and levels, with prescribed first element, in words", "paper_id": "WOS:000258476200001"}
