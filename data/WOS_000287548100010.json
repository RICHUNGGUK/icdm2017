To verify this principle, a clamping prototype (size: phi 32 x 130 mm) is constructed and tested. It generates a clamping force of 1050 N with an initial experimental set-up, and, a clamping force up to 1525 N with a modified set-up employing a hydro-press bench clamp. The theoretical and numerical analyses are carried out and suggest that the mechanism may generate a clamping force up to 2148 N with an adequate rigid guide-way. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
