To the author's best knowledge, it enables the first integrated multi-Gbps data link in D-band by saving power hungry frequency synthesizer, high speed data convertors and complicated digital signal processor. The Tx and Rx occupy 0.03 and 0.12 mm(2) chip areas, respectively. To validate the communication at 140 GHz carrier frequency, a data link has been built to demonstrate up to 2.5 Gbps data rate with power consumption of 115/120 mW for Tx/Rx respectively.", "paper_title": "Integrated D-band transmitter and receiver for wireless data communication in 65 nm CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347527800017"}
