Here, q is a prime power, q = p(k), where k > 1, and k is odd. Our algorithmic approach improves the corresponding exponentiation resulted from the better rewritten exponent. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first major improvement to the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm, for example, the number of multiplications can be reduced to at least 60 percent on the average when p equivalent to 1 (mod 16). Several numerical examples are given that show the speedup of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Improved Computation of Square Roots in Specific Finite Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000261846600005"}
