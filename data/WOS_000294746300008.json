However, for large-scale design optimization of automotive body structure, with the increasing number of design variable and enhanced nonlinearity degree of structural performance, polynomial response surface which is commonly used for vehicle design optimization often suffers exponentially increased computation burden and serious loss of approximation accuracy. In this paper, support vector regression, along with other four complex metamodeling techniques including moving least square, artificial neural network, radial basis function and Kriging, is investigated for approximating frontal crashworthiness performance which is one of the most highly nonlinear performances. It aims at testing support vector regression and providing advanced metamodeling technique for RBDO of automotive body structure. Approximation results are compared in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Based on the frontal crashworthiness example, it is found that support vector regression and moving least square are preferable techniques to approximate structural performances with good accuracy. But support vector regression is recommended for its computational efficiency and better approximation potential. Moreover, the ensemble of support vector regression, moving least square, Kriging and artificial neural network is an effective alternative and is proved, in the RBDO example for the lightweight design of front body structure, to outperform any other single metamodel. The remarkable predominance indicates that the ensemble of support vector regression, moving least square, Kriging and artificial neural network holds great potential in approximating highly nonlinear performances for RBDO of automotive body structure.
