In this paper, we investigate the k-error linear complexity of p(2)-periodic binary sequences defined from the polynomial quotients modulo p, which are the generalizations of the well-studied Fermat quotients. Indeed, first we determine exact values of the k-error linear complexity over the finite field F-2 for these binary sequences under the assumption of 2 being a primitive root modulo p(2), and then we determine their k-error linear complexity over the finite field F-p. Theoretical results obtained indicate that such sequences possess 'good' error linear complexity.", "paper_title": "On the k-error linear complexity of binary sequences derived from polynomial quotients", "paper_id": "WOS:000359801900013"}
