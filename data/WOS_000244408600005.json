New product development has long been recognized as one of the corporate core functions to be competitive on an increasingly competitive global market. However, developing new products is a process involving risk and uncertainty. In order to solve this stochastic problem, companies need to evaluate their new product initiatives carefully and make accurate decisions. For this reason, a systematic decision process for selecting more rational new product ideas is proposed. Basically, two stages of decision-making are described: the identification of nondominated new product candidates and the selection of the best new product idea. These stages are composed of an integrated approach based on a fuzzy heuristic multi-attribute utility method and a hierarchical fuzzy TOPSIS method. Finally, an application is given to demonstrate the potential of the methodology.
