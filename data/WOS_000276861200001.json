Most existing camera handoff algorithms concentrate on data association, namely consistent labeling, where images of the same object are identified across different cameras. However, there exist many unsolved questions in developing an efficient camera handoff algorithm. In this paper, we first design a trackability measure to quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness of object tracking so that camera handoff can be triggered timely and the camera to which the object of interest is transferred can be selected optimally. Three components are considered: resolution, distance to the edge of the camera's field of view (FOV), and occlusion. In addition, most existing real-time object tracking systems see a decrease in the frame rate as the number of tracked objects increases. To address this issue, our handoff algorithm employs an adaptive resource management mechanism to dynamically allocate cameras' resources to multiple objects with different priorities so that the required minimum frame rate is maintained. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed camera handoff algorithm can achieve a substantially improved overall tracking rate by 20% in comparison with the algorithm presented by Khan and Shah.
