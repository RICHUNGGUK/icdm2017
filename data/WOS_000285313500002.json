We focus mainly on finite subsets in discrete groups, reviewing the classical results in this area, and generalizing them to a much broader context. For example, the worst-case efficiency when S has k elements is of order 1/log k. We show that if n(k) grows at a suitable rate with k, then almost every k-subset of any given group with order n comes close to this worst-case bound. In contrast, if n(k) grows very rapidly, or if k is fixed and n ->infinity, then almost every k-subset of the cyclic group with order n comes close to the optimal efficiency.
