The proposed method consists of three steps: 1) multi-resolution image sequences are constructed by a multi-resolution model, in which pixels between two neighboring resolutions are linked by computing parent-child distance, 2) the evolution of local variance at multi-resolution is studied, on which images are segmented based on image sequence and 3) an actual segmented result corresponding to the original image is obtained by using the parent-child link. The experimental results show that we can get favorable segmentation performance by using this method.", "paper_title": "A multi-resolution image segmentation method based on evolution of local variance", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300066"}
