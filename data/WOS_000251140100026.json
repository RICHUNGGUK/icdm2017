Our analysis begins from the observation that in a two-dimensional space the Yee algorithm approximates the Laplacian operator via a strongly anisotropic 5-point approximation. It is demonstrated that with the aid of a transversely extended-curl operator any 9-point Laplacian can be mapped into FDTD update equations. Our analysis shows that the mapping of an isotropic Laplacian approximation results in an isotropic and less dispersive FDTD scheme. The properties of the extended curl are further explored and it is proved that a unity Courant number can be achieved without the resulting scheme suffering from grid decoupling. Additionally, the case, of a 25-point isotropic Laplacian is examined and it is shown that the corresponding scheme is fourth order accurate in space and exhibits isotropy up to sixth order. Representative numerical simulations are performed that validate the theoretically derived results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
