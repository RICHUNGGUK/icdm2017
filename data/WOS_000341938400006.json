Design/methodology/approach - In order to overcome the shortcomings that the agents have only three attitudes with respect to the conflict issues in Pawlak conflict information system, so that it is too stiff to describe and portray the real conflict problems, the thought and methodology of the intuitionistic fuzzy set is employed to soften the agents' attitudes of the conflict issues, and then a novel conflict analysis model is constructed. This method, to begin with, the intuitionistic fuzzy number is used to express the opposition and support degree with respect to the conflict issues from agents, and then the similarity measure method is utilized to define conflict coefficient; what is more, the conflict degrees between any two agents can be obtained, and then the alliances are determined by setting different threshold values. Finally, an example illustrates the validity and rationality of the proposed method. Findings - The novel conflict analysis model proposed in the paper can well describe and resolve a real-life conflict problems such as the conflict of national territory, employee and employer. Research limitations/implications - The proposed model can only do with the conflict problems in which there do not exit the correlations among conflict issues, while it does not cope with the conflict problems with the mutually interrelated conflict issues. Originality/value - The paper succeeds in softening the Pawlak conflict analysis information system, and describing and dealing with the actual conflict problems.", "paper_title": "Conflict analysis model and application based on intuitionistic fuzzy number", "paper_id": "WOS:000341938400006"}
