The intraventricular blood flow is analysed here for akinetic and dyskinetic myocardial motion corresponding to the presence of an ischaemic pathology. This study is performed through a 3D numerical model of the left ventricular flow. Results show that the presence of an anterior-inferior wall infarction leads to the shortening and weakening of the diastolic mitral jet. A region of stagnating flow is found near the apex and close to the ischaemic wall. These results are in agreement with previous clinical findings based on echographic imaging. The described phenomena are also noticed for moderate degrees of the ischaemic pathology and suggest a potential value of the study of the intraventricular flow to develop early diagnostic indicators.", "paper_title": "Intraventricular vortex flow changes in the infarcted left ventricle: numerical results in an idealised 3D shape", "paper_id": "WOS:000287536600010"}
