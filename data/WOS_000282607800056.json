Knowledge for decision making can be categorized as domain specific and general. Applying domain knowledge in intelligent systems is not new, but applying general knowledge to support business decision making is a possible way to obtain an edge over competitors. For this reason, the paper focuses primarily on designing a general knowledge mediation infrastructure (GKMI) which supports the use of general knowledge from multiple heterogeneous sources, and provides an unified access point for typical multi-agent systems (MAS) to access that knowledge. The finite state automaton (FSA) is used to model and analyze the commonsense inference ability of GKMI. By carrying out two use cases of GKMI for MAS development and operation the effectiveness of this infrastructure is examined. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
