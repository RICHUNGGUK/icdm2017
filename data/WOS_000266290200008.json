The combinational parameters of LS-SVM were optimized by adaptive random search technique (ARST). ARST could search the optimal combinational parameters of LS-SVM from the solution space in a simple and quick way. The developed LS-SVM model was compared with the model established by multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis using the same data sets. Generally, the LS-SVM model performed slightly better than the MLR model with respect to goodness-of-fit, predictivity, and applicability domain (AD). The ADS of the LS-SVM and MLR models were described on the basis of leverages and standardized residuals. Both the LS-SVM and MLR models had wide ADS within a given reliability (standardized residual < 3 SE units), but the LS-SVM model was superior for compounds with high leverages.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Soil Organic Carbon Normalized Sorption Coefficient (K-oc) Using Least Squares-Support Vector Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000266290200008"}
