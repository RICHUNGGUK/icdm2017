The movement of the train is made thanks to a technique of sliding meshes and a conservative treatment of the faces between two domains. All parts of the development are thought with the aim to reduce the computational time. In particular, non-reflecting boundary conditions for non-structured three-dimensional meshes are developed in order to limit the calculation domain. Validations of the methodology are presented on different test cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
