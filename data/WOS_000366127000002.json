The positioning results visual effect is also unsatisfied. To solve this problem, we design and realize a comprehensive method to implement RFID indoor localization algorithms in a geographic information system. In our method, the RFID indoor targets positioning results can display in the real geographic environment, which can improve the application value of the results. First, we establish the geographic environment using geographic information system in order to combine RFID indoor positioning results with the real environment. Then we design a distributed system architecture to filter the useless data and implement the positioning algorithm. In this way, indoor targets real-time positioning and the results visualization display are realized. And the positioning results can also be combined with the real geographic information environment. System test results indicate that this method achieves ideal indoor positioning data display effect under well indoor-positioning precision.", "paper_title": "A Comprehensive Method to Combine RFID Indoor Targets Positioning with Real Geographic Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000366127000002"}
