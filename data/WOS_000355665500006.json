First, we obtain a simple algorithm that computes a permanent of an n x n matrix over an arbitrary commutative ring with at most dn non-zero entries using O-star(2((1-1/(3.55d))) n) time and ring operations, (1) improving and simplifying the recent result of Izumi and Wadayama[FOCS 2012]. Second, we present a simple algorithm for counting perfect matchings in an n-vertex graph in O-star(2(n/2)) time and polynomial space; our algorithm matches the complexity bounds of the algorithm of Bjorklund [SODA 2012], but relies on inclusion-exclusion principle instead of algebraic transformations. Third, we show a combinatorial lemma that bounds the number of \"Hamiltonian-like\" structures in a graph of bounded average degree. Using this result, we show that 1. a minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle in an n-vertex graph with average degree bounded by d can be found in O-star(2((1-epsilon d)n)) time and exponential space for a constant eddepending only on epsilon(d); 2. the number of perfect matchings in an n-vertex graph with average degree bounded by d can be computed in O-star(2((1-epsilon'd)n/2)) time and exponential space, for a constant epsilon(d)' depending only on d. The algorithm for minimum weight Hamiltonian cycle generalizes the recent results of Bjorklund et al. [TALG 2012] on graphs of bounded degree. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
