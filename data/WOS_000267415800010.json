It is also necessary for many real life video database applications to incorporate uncertainty, which naturally occurs due to the complex and subjective semantic content of video data. In this study, firstly, we introduce a fuzzy conceptual data model to represent the semantic content of video data. For that purpose, UML (unified modeling language) is utilized and extended to represent uncertain information along with video specific properties. Secondly, we present an intelligent fuzzy object-oriented database framework for video database applications. The introduced fuzzy conceptual model is used in this framework, which provides modeling of complex and rich semantic content and knowledge of video data including uncertainty. Moreover, it supports various flexible queries including (fuzzy) semantic, temporal and (fuzzy) spatial queries, based on the video data model. We think that the presented conceptual data model and the framework can be used for any video database application. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
