It provides access control, end-to-end confidentiality, and anditability, while maintaining advantages of file swarming. This paper presents an initial performance evaluation. As compared with BitTorrent, the performance overhead of encryption in most cases is negligible, at worst 15%. In a real-world higher latency network, the extra overhead of encryption would be significantly lower.", "paper_title": "SecureTorrent: A security framework for file swarming", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500054"}
