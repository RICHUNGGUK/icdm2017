Two generic model problems are solved and the roles of various physical parameters involved in the problem formulation are assessed. It is shown that the efficiency of an optimization procedure heavily relies on a careful parametric study of wave propagation and correct physical interpretation of its results.", "paper_title": "The energy generation and transmission in compound elastic cylindrical shells with heavy internal fluid loading - from parametric studies to optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242613500001"}
