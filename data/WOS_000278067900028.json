Feasible offset pairs were given as first order generalized Boolean functions in algebraic normal form. New offset pairs were described in a conjecture of Li, leading to new 64-QAM Golay complementary sequences. The proof of the conjecture is presented.", "paper_title": "New 64-QAM Golay Complementary Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000278067900028"}
