The purpose of this paper is to propose a novel control for four-quadrant AC-DC converters to suppress the generated electromagnetic interference (EMI). Design/methodology/approach - A chaotic carrier plays an important role to implement the chaotic PWM control. The relationship between the EMI distribution and carrier frequency is given by deducing and analyzing the harmonic components of the AC-DC converter. The comparison of chaotic PWM control and random PWM control in suppressing EMI are provided. Findings - The simulation results prove the effectiveness of the proposed chaotic PWM control on EMI reduction. Research limitations/implications - The effects of EMI suppression under different chaotic carriers will be theoretically analyzed in the future work. Practical implications - The proposed chaotic PWM control can suppress EME for converters without adding additional devices or components, therefore, without increasing the volume, weight and cost of converters. Originality/value - In this paper, a novel chaotic pulse width modulation (PWM) control is proposed and implemented into a four-quadrant AC-DC converter for electromagnetic interference (EMI) suppression, moreover, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of the input AC current is also improved under chaotic PWM control.", "paper_title": "The application of chaotic PWM control for EMI suppression", "paper_id": "WOS:000318456300003"}
