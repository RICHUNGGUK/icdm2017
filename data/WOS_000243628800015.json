In the present paper, the idea of variable selection is extended. Unlike in traditional variable selection methods, where the deleted variables and the variables included in the regression model are essentially weighted with discrete values 0 and 1, respectively, the strategy adopted in this paper is to weight the variables with continuous non-negative values. A recently proposed global optimization method, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to search for the weights of variables optimizing the training of a calibration set and the prediction of an independent validation set. Since variable selection is just a special case of variable weighting, the latter is expected to be more rational and flexible. Variable weighting would reduce the negative influence of wavelengths with undesirable qualities while retaining the useful information carried by them. Variable weighting would also prevent the possible spoiling of the multi-channel advantage of the model by variable selection, which would happen when the number of selected wavelengths is small. Two real data sets are investigated and the results of variable-weighted PLS and those of PLS are compared to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
