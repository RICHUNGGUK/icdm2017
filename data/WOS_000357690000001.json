Motion-compensated inter-frame prediction, which has been used widely in low-bit-rate television coding, is an efficient method for reducing temporal redundancy in a sequence of video signals. To this end, the proposed scheme combines motion compensation with non-causal prediction based on an interpolative, but not Markov, representation. Nevertheless, energy dispersion occurs in the scheme as a result of the interpolative prediction transform matrix being non-orthogonal. To solve this problem, we have introduced a new conditional pel replenishment method. On the other hand, we have applied rotation scanning, which is also applied for feedback quantization, as a quantizer. Simulation results show that the proposed coding scheme achieves an approximate 44 dB when entropy is less than 1 bit/pixel.", "paper_title": "A Novel Encoding Method for P-frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000357690000001"}
