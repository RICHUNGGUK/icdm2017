A class of flux type boundary conditions is used for the clothing assemblies. To maintain physical conservations, a splitting semi-implicit finite volume method on a structured hexahedron mesh is proposed for solving the system of nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction equations, in which the calculation of liquid water content absorbed by fiber is decoupled from the rest of the computation. Four types of clothing assemblies are investigated and comparisons with experimental measurements are also presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
