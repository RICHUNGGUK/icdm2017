We learn from the fit literature that users are motivated to use a technology because they perceive it to be a better fit over and above alternative methods. This article reflects upon technological developments in information systems, particularly those that use location information as their central component for providing services. By drawing on locatability, we are able to recast the traditional fit models by differentiating between under-, over-, and ideal fit conditions. A wireless laboratory experiment with 112 subjects tests how differing fit levels impact individual performance across various tasks performed with locatable technology. For the experiment, a wireless environment is created that provides faster transmission rates and better localization accuracy than any Currently existing cellular phone infrastructure. Findings conclude that Subjects perceive differences between under- and ideal fit conditions when exposed to tasks that include localization components.
