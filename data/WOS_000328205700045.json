The computational results revealed that when doping the (super) alkali atomMinto the tetrahedral P4 molecule, the original dual spherical aromaticity of the P-4 moiety is broken and new s electron cloud is formed on the face of P4 part interacting with the M atom. It was found that interaction of the (super) alkali atom with the s electron cloud is a novel mode to produce diffuse excess electrons effectively to achieve a considerable beta(0) value. Further, beyond the alkali atom, employing the superalkali unit can be a more effective approach to significantly enhance the first hyperpolarizability of the systems, due to the much lower vertical ionization potential. These results were further supported by the case of the (super) alkali atom interacting with the cyclopropane C3H6 molecule with its typical s aromatic electron cloud. Moreover, the beta(u) values of the M@P-4 series are nonmonotonic dependent on alkali atomic number, namely, 1440 au (M= Na)< 18110 beta(u) (Li)<22490 au (K), inferring that the distance between the alkali atom and the interacting surface with the s electron cloud in P4 is a crucial geometrical factor in determining their first hyperpolarizabilities. These intriguing findings will be advantageous for promoting the design of novel high-performance nonlinear optical materials.", "paper_title": "(Super)alkali atoms interacting with the sigma electron cloud: a novel interaction mode triggers large nonlinear optical response of M@P-4 and M@C3H6 (M=Li, Na, K and Li3O)", "paper_id": "WOS:000328205700045"}
