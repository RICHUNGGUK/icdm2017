This control approach is based on a genealogical decision tree for both regulation and tracking control problems. The idea behind this control strategy consists of associating Gaussian distributions to both the norms of the control actions and the tracking errors. This stochastic search model can be interpreted as a simple genetic particle evolution model with a natural birth and death interpretation. It converges on probability. A numerical example dealing with the control of a fluidized bed combustion power plant illustrates the feasibility and the performance of this control algorithm.", "paper_title": "Open-loop regulation and tracking control based on a genealogical decision tree", "paper_id": "WOS:000238327700016"}
