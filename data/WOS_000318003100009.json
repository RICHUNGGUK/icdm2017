This paper presents a comparison of two soft computing-based schemes: Artificial neural networks and support vector machines for the projection of LMP. Our system has useful power system parameters as inputs and the LMP as output. Experimental results obtained suggest that although both methods give highly accurate results, support vector machines slightly outperform artificial neural networks and do so with manageable computational time costs.", "paper_title": "A soft computing approach to projecting locational marginal price", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100009"}
