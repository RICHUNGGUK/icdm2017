Besides the traditional genetic operators of selection, crossover, and mutation, Mendel's principles are included, in the form of an operator in the genetic algorithm's evolution process. In the quantitative analysis of exchange rates determination, the Mendel-GA examines the exchange rate fluctuations at the short-run horizon. Specifically, the aim is to revisit the determination of high-frequency exchange rates and examine the differences between the method of genetic algorithms and that of the traditional estimation methods. A simulation with a given initial conditions has been devised in MATLAB, and it is shown that the Mendel-GA can work valuably as a tool for the exchange rates estimation modelling with high-frequency data.
