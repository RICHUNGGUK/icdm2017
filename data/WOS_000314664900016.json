Condition monitoring is an appropriate way of the maintenance technique that is applicable in the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery faults. A unique flexible algorithm is proposed for classifying the condition of centrifugal pump based on support vector machine hyper-parameters optimization and artificial neural networks (ANNs) which are composed of eight distinct steps. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector classification with genetic algorithm (SVC-GA) and support vector classification with particle swarm optimization (SVC-PSO) algorithm have been considered in a flexible algorithm to perform accurate classification in the manufacturing area. SVC-GA, SVC-PSO and ANN have been used together due to their importance and capabilities in classifying domain. Also, the superiority of the proposed hybrid algorithm (SVC with GA and PSO) is shown by comparing its results with SVC performance. Two types of faults through six features, flow, temperature, suction pressure, discharge pressure, velocity, and vibration, have been classified with proposed integrated algorithm. To test the robustness of the efficiency results of the proposed method, the ability of proposed flexible algorithm in dealing with noisy and corrupted data is analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
