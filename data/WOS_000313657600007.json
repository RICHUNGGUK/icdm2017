In order to launch the regulation service for grid-use of electric-drive vehicles, a smart control interface called an aggregator between the grid and the vehicles has been developed. In this paper, a particle swarm optimization (PSO), as well as its modified version (MPSO) based approach is presented for optimal sitting and sizing of aggregator controlled public car park for vehicle fleets in modern power system, which is convenient to the optimal charger control of PHEVs. The optimal location and sizing is calculated by minimizing the power loss and voltage deviations. The proposed approach is tested on IEEE 14 bus system.", "paper_title": "Sitting and sizing of aggregator controlled park for plug-in hybrid electric vehicle based on particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600007"}
