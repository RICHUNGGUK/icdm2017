The synthesis is achieved by computing the motion equations of a dynamical model controlled by a sensory motor feedback loop with a nonparametric learning approach. The analysis is directly applied on end-effector trajectories captured from human motion. We have developed a Dynamic Programming Piecewise Linear Approximation model (DPPLA) that generates the discretization of these 3D Cartesian trajectories. The DPPLA algorithm leads to the identification of discrete target-patterns that constitute an adaptive sampling of the initial end-point trajectory. These sequences of samples non uniformly distributed along the trajectory are used as input of our sensory motor system. The synthesis of motion is illustrated on a dynamical model of a hand-arm system, each arm being represented by seven degrees of freedom. We show that the algorithm works on multi-dimensional variables and reduces the information flow at the command level with a good compression rate, thus providing a technique for motion data indexing and retrieval. Furthermore, the adaptive sampling seems to be correlated with some invariant law of human motion.", "paper_title": "Adaptive sampling of motion trajectories for discrete task-based analysis and synthesis of gesture", "paper_id": "WOS:000237042600025"}
