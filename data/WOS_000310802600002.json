Some simple general algebraic criteria are derived based on practical stability theory of nonautonomous dynamical system. A distinctive feature of this work is that the parameter mismatch not only exists in system parameters, but also in the external excitation ones. More reasonably, the values of parameter mismatch can be uncertain. Besides, a single state feedback control including an approximate differentiation filter only needs to know information about one state, which provides an advantage over the use of full-state model-based observers. It is shown that the approaches developed here further extend the ideas and techniques presented in recent literature. As a direct application of the new theoretical results, the obtained results are applied to a typical horizontal platform system and the representative forced Duffing-Van der Pol oscillator. Subsequently, numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the criteria and the robustness of the control technique.", "paper_title": "PRACTICAL SYNCHRONIZATION OF NONAUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAIN PARAMETER MISMATCH VIA A SINGLE STATE FEEDBACK CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000310802600002"}
