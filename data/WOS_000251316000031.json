Within this scheme, the interactions of the molecule with the surrounding fluid (solvent) are explicitly taken into account. By generating polymers of various initial configurations and lengths we map the probability distibutions of the passage times of the DNA through the nanopore. A scaling law behavior for the most probable of these times with respect to length is derived, and shown to exhibit an exponent that is in a good agreement with the experimental findings. The essential features of the DNA dynamics as it passes through the pore are explored.", "paper_title": "Exploring DNA translocation through a nanopore via a multiscale Lattice-Boltzmann Molecular-Dynamics methodology", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000031"}
