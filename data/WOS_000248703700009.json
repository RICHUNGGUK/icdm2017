It is composed of a technique to automatically generate a training data set plus an efficient algorithm to learn fuzzy controllers. The proposed approach obtains a highly interpretable knowledge base in a very reduced time, and the designer only has to define the number of membership functions and the universe of discourse of each variable, together with a scoring function. In addition, the learned fuzzy controllers are general because the training set is composed of a number of automatically generated examples that cover the universe of discourse of each variable uniformly and with a predefined precision. The methodology has been applied to the design of a wall-following and moving object following behavior. Several tests in simulated environments using the Nomad 200 robot software and a comparison with another. learning method show the performance and advantages of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Quick design of fuzzy controllers with good interpretability in mobile robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000248703700009"}
