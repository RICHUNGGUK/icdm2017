Database models, especially relational databases, have been the leader in last few decades, enabling information to be efficiently stored and queried. On the other hand, ontologies have appeared as an alternative to databases in applications that require a more 'enriched' meaning. However, there is controversy regarding the best information modeling technique, as both models present similar characteristics. In this paper, we present a review of how ontologies and databases are related, of what their main differences are and of the mechanisms used to communicate with each other.", "paper_title": "Ontologies versus relational databases: are they so different?
