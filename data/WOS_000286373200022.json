The intuitionistic fuzzy set theory considers another uncertainty parameter which is the hesitation degree that arises while defining the membership function and thus the cluster centers may converge to a desirable location than the cluster centers obtained using fuzzy C means algorithm. Also a new objective function which is the intuitionistic fuzzy entropy is incorporated in the conventional fuzzy C means clustering algorithm. This is done to maximize the good points in the class. This clustering method is used in clustering different regions of the CT scan brain images and these may be used to identify the abnormalities in the brain. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in contrast to conventional fuzzy C means algorithms and also type II fuzzy algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.
