Through the use of Self Organized Maps (SOMs) a Tolerant Observation Model (TOM) is built, while odometer-dependent transition probabilities are used for building an Odometer-Dependent Motion Model (ODMM). By using the Viterbi Algorithm and establishing a trigger value when evaluating the state-transition updates, the presented approach can easily take care of Position Tracking (PT), Global Localization (GL) and Robot Kidnapping (RK) with an ease of implementation difficult to achieve in most of the state-of-the-art localization algorithms. Also, an optimization is presented to allow the algorithm to run in standard microprocessors in real time, without the need of huge probability gridmaps.", "paper_title": "Odometry-Based Viterbi Localization with Artificial Neural Networks and Laser Range Finders for Mobile Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000300706800006"}
