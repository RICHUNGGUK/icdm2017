In particular, we show that the recently established h-index is a particular case of the Sugeno integral, and that the number of citations corresponds to the Choquet integral. In both cases, they use the same fuzzy measure. The results presented here permit one to envision new indexes defined in terms of fuzzy integrals using other types of fuzzy measures. A few considerations in this respect are also included in this paper. Indexes for taking into account recent research and the publisher credibility are outlined.", "paper_title": "The h-index and the number of citations: Two fuzzy integrals", "paper_id": "WOS:000256670200018"}
