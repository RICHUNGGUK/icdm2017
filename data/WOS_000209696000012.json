In this paper, we study bulk or stream-like data dissemination in DTNs. Segmented network coding is introduced to provide best-effort services and its performance in terms of sustained throughput is analyzed. To our best knowledge, we are the first to give the closed-form expression of the maximum sustained throughput using feedbackless segmented network coding in DTNs. A protocol is also proposed and simulation results show that it approaches the theoretical bound asymptotically.", "paper_title": "On the Throughput of Feedbackless Segmented Network Coding in Delay Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696000012"}
