This study uses an innovative handwriting recognition technology to confirm user identity and to manage door security. Smart phones are used for security system management and control actions, and identity confirmation is performed in two stages. In the first stage, the user enters a user name and password into a smart phone and waits for successful identity recognition. In the second stage, the user must write a text or symbol pattern previously set into the smart phone. After successful identification in the second stage, the user is given permission to control the electronic lock and enter the door. The proposed home security system is implemented using a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) with associative memory for training and recognition. The RNN used in the handwriting recognition step performs some recognition iterative processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
