Drawing on research into knowledge sourcing and consumer switching behavior; the authors develop an integrated model to understand individuals choices between internal and external knowledge sources in contemporary work settings, where information technology has made both easily accessible. A lest of the model using survey data collected from an international consulting firm yields an important new insight: satisfied individuals in knowledge reuse friendly environments are likely to use internal knowledge sources while they may also be tempted by easily accessible external knowledge sources. The implications for researchers and practitioners are also discussed.", "paper_title": "In or Out: An Integrated Model of Individual Knowledge Source Choice", "paper_id": "WOS:000299851900003"}
