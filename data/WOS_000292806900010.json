Although many approaches have been proposed for improving evolvability, most indications are that it remains challenging to deliver the required levels of evolvability. In this paper, we present a theoretical approach to how the concept of systems theoretic stability can be applied to the evolvability of software architectures of informal ion systems. We define and formalize the transformation of a set of basic functional requirements into a set of instantiations of software constructs. We define this transformation using both a static and a dynamic perspective. In the latter perspective, we formulate the postulate that information systems should be stable against new requirements. Based on this postulate, we derive a number of design theorems for software implementation. Using this transformation we use theoretical arguments to derive that these theorems contribute to achieving stability. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
