The input module of the system consists of only low-cost cameras (webcams) and does not need an electronic tablet. Online signature data are obtained from the images captured by the webcams by tracking the pen tip. The pen tip tracking is implemented by the sequential Monte Carlo method. Then, the distance between the input signature data and reference signature data enrolled in advance is computed. Finally, the input signature is classified as genuine or a forgery by comparing the distance with a threshold. In this paper, we consider seven camera positions. We performed experiments using a private database consisting of 150 genuine signatures to decide the best camera position. The experimental results show that we should place the webcam to the side of the hand. Moreover, we evaluated the proposed system with a camera placed to the side of the hand against a different database consisting of 390 genuine signatures and 1560 skilled forged signatures. The proposed system achieved an equal error rate of 4.1% against this database. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
