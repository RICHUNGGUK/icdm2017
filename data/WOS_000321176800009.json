We prove that it is NP-complete to determine the injective chromatic number even restricted to some special bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we show that for every epsilon > 0, it is impossible to efficiently approximate the injective chromatic number of any bipartite graph within a factor of n(1/3-epsilon) unless ZPP = NP. For the max-injective coloring problem, we prove that there is a constant approximation algorithm on power chordal graphs with bounded injective chromatic number. We also devise a constant approximation algorithm for max-injective coloring some bipartite graphs. For the on-line injective coloring problem, we prove that First Fit (FF) injectively colors P-3-free graphs perfectly, where First Fit is an on-line algorithm that simply assigns the smallest available color to each vertex. We also prove that the number of colors used by FF* for bipartite graph G is bounded by 3/2 times the on-line injective chromatic number, where FF* is an on-line algorithm equivalent to FF proper coloring the complement of G. Moreover, we present an improved algorithm BFF, and prove that it is optimal for on-line injectively coloring bipartite graphs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
