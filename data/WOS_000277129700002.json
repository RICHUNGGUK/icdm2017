In this paper, we introduce several generalizations of the HA operator by using generalized and quasi-arithmetic means, fuzzy numbers and order inducing variables in the reordering step of the aggregation process. We present the fuzzy generalized hybrid averaging (FGHA) operator, the fuzzy induced generalized hybrid averaging (FIGHA) operator, the Quasi-FHA operator and the Quasi-FIHA operator. The main advantage of these operators is that they generalize a wide range of fuzzy aggregation operators that can be used in a wide range of applications such as decision making problems. For example, we could mention the fuzzy induced hybrid averaging (FIHA), the fuzzy weighted generalized mean (FWGM) and the fuzzy induced generalized OWA (FIGOWA). We end the paper with an application of the new approach in a decision making problem.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Generalized Hybrid Aggregation Operators and its Application in Fuzzy Decision Making", "paper_id": "WOS:000277129700002"}
