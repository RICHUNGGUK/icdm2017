Typically, the correlations that are induced are only qualified-that is, described by their presumed intensity. We quantify the population correlations induced under several strategies for simulating 0-1 knapsack problem instances and also for correlation-induction approaches used to simulate instances of the generalized assignment, capital budgeting (or multidimensional knapsack), and set-covering problems. We discuss implications of these correlation-induction methods for previous and future computational experiments on simulated optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Synthetic Optimization Problem Generation: Show Us the Correlations!", "paper_id": "WOS:000268558800009"}
