To provide greater abstraction and modelling convenience, these languages are becoming more syntactically rich, leading to a variety of questions about their expressive power. In this paper, we consider the expressiveness of Essence, a specification language with a rich variety of syntactic features. We identify natural fragments of Essence that capture the complexity classes P, NP, all levels Sigma(p)(i) of the polynomial-time hierarchy, and all levels k-NEXP of the nondeterministic exponential-time hierarchy. The union of these classes is the very large complexity class ELEMENTARY. One goal is to begin to understand which features play a role in the high expressive power of the language and which are purely features of convenience. We also discuss the formalization of arithmetic in Essence and related languages, a notion of capturing NP-search which is slightly different than that of capturing NP, and a conjectured limit to the expressive power of Essence. Our study is an application of descriptive complexity theory, and illustrates the value of taking a logic-based view of modelling and specification languages.", "paper_title": "Expressive power and abstraction in ESSENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000257589200005"}
