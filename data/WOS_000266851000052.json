With a small number of patterns available, data quality is of great importance in KDA applications. Recently, the authors have proposed to employ artificial rhythms and tempo cues to improve data quality: consistency and uniqueness of typing patterns. This paper examines whether improvement in uniqueness and consistency translates into improvement in authentication performance in real-world applications. In particular, we build various novelty detectors using typing patterns based on various strategies in which artificial rhythms and/or tempo cues are implemented. We show that artificial rhythms and tempo cues improve authentication accuracies and that they can be applicable in practical authentication systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
