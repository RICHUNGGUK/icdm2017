Existing interactive mesh composition tools focus on atomic copy-and-paste of pre-selected feature areas, and are either limited to copying surface displacements, or require the solution of variational optimization problems, which is too expensive for an interactive brush interface. In contrast, our GeoBrush method supports real-time continuous copying of arbitrary high-resolution surface features between irregular meshes, including topological handles. We achieve this by first establishing a correspondence between the source and target geometries using a novel generalized discrete exponential map parameterization. Next we roughly align the source geometry with the target shape using Green Coordinates with automatically-constructed cages. Finally, we compute an offset membrane to smoothly blend the pasted patch with C-1 continuity before stitching it into the target. The offset membrane is a solution of a bi-harmonic PDE, which is computed on the GPU in real time by exploiting the regular parametric domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GeoBrush with various editing scenarios, including detail enrichment and completion of scanned surfaces.", "paper_title": "GeoBrush: Interactive Mesh Geometry Cloning", "paper_id": "WOS:000289996100039"}
