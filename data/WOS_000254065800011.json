Today's ERP systems do not have the ability to exchange data from one cooperation partner to another in a flexibly automated way. That is why today's inter-company order processing is still done manually by telephone and fax. With a totally integrated order management, there are possible cost savings of up to 50% in order processing. Furthermore, it helps companies to optimize their logistic and delivery processes. myOpenFactory provides an industry wide inter-company order processing technology. The developed IT-platform is founded on service oriented architecture, allowing all platform functions to be executed by the connected ERP systems via web services. The described technical compatibility has been realized in cooperation with a group of leading suppliers of ERP software. Furthermore a standardized data model secures an interface free flow of information. Commercializing the myOpenFactory platform, a new internet business model has been developed-the myOpenFactory cooperative society.", "paper_title": "myOpenFactory", "paper_id": "WOS:000254065800011"}
