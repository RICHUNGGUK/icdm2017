Binary machines are a generalization of nonlinear feedback shift registers (NLFSRs) in which both connections, feedback and feedforward, are allowed and no chain connection between the register stages is required. An algorithm for constructing a shortest binary machine generating a given periodic binary sequence is presented.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of Binary Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000041"}
