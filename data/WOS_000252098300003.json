This paper proposes and compares two approaches (Bayesian and support vector machines) that can be used to segment the gastrointestinal tract into its four major topographic areas, allowing the automatic estimation of the clinically relevant gastric and intestinal sections and corresponding transit times. According to medical specialists, this can reduce exam annotation times by up to 12% (15 min). This automatic tool has been integrated into our CapView annotation software that is currently being used by three medical institutions.", "paper_title": "Automated topographic segmentation and transit time estimation in endoscopic capsule exams", "paper_id": "WOS:000252098300003"}
