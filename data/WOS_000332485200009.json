This workshop was held in conjunction with the 2013 SIGMOD conference in New York, NY, USA on June 23th, 2013. The goal of the workshop was to bring together researchers and practitioners to explore the state of the art in workflow-based programming for data-intensive applications, and the potential of cloud-based computing in this area. The program featured 4 paper presentations and two very well attended invited talks by Prof. Paul Watson, Newcastle University, UK and Dr Jelena Pjesivac-Grbovic from Google, Inc.", "paper_title": "Report from the second workshop on Scalable Workflow Enactment Engines and Technology (SWEET'13)", "paper_id": "WOS:000332485200009"}
