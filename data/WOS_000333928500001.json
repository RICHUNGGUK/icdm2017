Tasks were performed using 2 different intraoral sensor layouts. Reduction of undesired sensor activations while speaking as well as the influence of intraoral temperature variation on the signals of the intraoral interface was investigated. Results showed that intraoral target selection tasks were performed better when the respective sensor was located in the anterior area of the palate, reaching 78 and 16 activations per minute for repetitive and \"unordered\" sequences, respectively. Virtual target pointing and tracking tasks, of circles of 50, 70, and 100 pixels diameter, showed no significant difference in performance, reaching average pointing throughputs of 0.62 to 0.72 bits per second and relative time on target of 34% to 60%. Speaking tasks caused an average of 10 to 31 involuntary activations per minute in the anterior part of the palate. Intraoral temperature variation between 11.87 degrees C and 51.37 degrees C affected the sensor signal baseline in a range from -25.34% to 48.31%. Results from this study provide key design considerations to further increase the efficiency of tongue-computer interfaces for individuals with upper-limb mobility impairments.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Function Location on Typing and Pointing Tasks With an Intraoral Tongue-Computer Interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000333928500001"}
