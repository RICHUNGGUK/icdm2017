This problem originates from the application in digital halftoning, with the best known approximation factor being 5.83 (Asano et al., 2004). We show that if their radii are between two positive constants, then there exists a polynomial time approximation scheme. Our techniques are based on the width-bounded geometric separator recently developed in Fu and Wang (2004), Fu (2006).", "paper_title": "A PTAS for a disc covering problem using width-bounded separators", "paper_id": "WOS:000236792900007"}
