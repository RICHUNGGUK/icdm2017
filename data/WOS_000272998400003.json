For multiport devices, currently available techniques are expensive. We propose a new approach which is based on a system-theoretic tool, the Loewner matrix pencil constructed in the context of tangential interpolation. Several implementations are presented. They are fast, accurate, they build low order models and are especially designed for a large number of terminals. Moreover, they identify the underlying system, rather than merely fitting the measurements. The numerical results show that our algorithms yield smaller models in less time, when compared to vector fitting.", "paper_title": "A New Approach to Modeling Multiport Systems from Frequency-Domain Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000272998400003"}
