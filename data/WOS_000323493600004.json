Reducing the power consumption in IP over wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical networks is of great significance. From the perspective of traffic engineering, green grooming has performed well in terms of power savings. However, in a more realistic network, some traffic characteristics are not taken into account. Moreover, most methods of green grooming are applied to a single network. As the network scale continuously becomes larger, the backbone presents a multidomain structure. Considering the peak traffic distribution in the multidomain network, i.e., that the peak traffic tends to scatter over boundary nodes, we propose a novel hose-model separation to emulate the limited traffic information in a more realistic optical network. To maximize the power efficiency, we determine the inverse power-efficiency ratio by theoretical analysis. We then utilize a heuristic, referred to as minimizing the total inverse power-efficiency ratio (MTPR), to establish lightpaths. The simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of MTPR under different topologies and various traffic patterns.", "paper_title": "Green Grooming in a More Realistic and Multidomain Optical Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000323493600004"}
