Many OS algorithms and applications require accurate prediction of demand and supply of resources. However, configuring prediction algorithms is not easy, since the dynamics of the underlying data requires continuous observation of the prediction error and dynamic adaptation of the parameters to achieve high accuracy. Current prediction methods are either too costly to implement on resource-constrained devices or their parameterization is static, making them inappropriate and inaccurate for a wide range of datasets. This paper presents NWSLite, a prediction utility that addresses these shortcomings on resource-restricted platforms.", "paper_title": "NWSLite: A general-purpose, Nonparametric prediction utility for embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256880900010"}
