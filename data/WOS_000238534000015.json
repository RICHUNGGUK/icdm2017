An optimization scheme is applied to avoid obstacles in 3D space present in the robot's trajectory by using redundancy, and to prevent the robot from retracting and crashing into the base by setting a security envelop. The generation of the trajectory with obstacles avoidance is performed by calculating the differential inverse kinematics of the robot based on the generalized inverse function. The obstacles are modeled by hyper-surfaces in order to reduce calculations and improve the computation time. When the optimal trajectory is attained in presence of the imposed constraints, an adaptive control law is applied to the robot. Simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed approach.
