Through analysis of the creativity model, the mechanism of how computer support tool affects a designer's creativity and its major elements are identified. In terms of the characteristics of product design, incorporating cognitive science, information technology and design technology, a creative product design method and cognitive principles that such computer support tool should follow are presented. A preliminary prototype software system of computer-aided design for product innovation was developed, whose main function is to aid the designer's creative behavior, instead of the automation of conceptual design. Finally, an instance is given to demonstrate the practicability and validity of the prototype system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
