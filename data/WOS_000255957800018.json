However, most ACO methods have the drawback of controlling the diversification of the search process. In this paper, we propose a new ACO method by improving the rank-based ant system, which uses different sensitive ants to the pheromone trail to keep the diversity of obtained solutions. Some ants select a path in the standard way among available paths, which means that they tend to select a path with a large amount of pheromone trail, some ants tend to select a path with a small amount of pheromone trail, and the others always select a path at random. In addition, this method selects solutions for the ranking list according not only to the tour length but also to the difference between each solution and the iteration-best one at each iteration. Some numerical experiments show that the proposed method can effectively find better solutions than existing methods.", "paper_title": "A new rank-based ant system using different sensitive ants", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800018"}
