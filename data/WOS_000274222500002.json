We give a complete characterization of these symmetric signatures over all bases of size 1. These improve previous results by Cai and Choudhary (ICALP 2006, vol. 4051, pp. 703-714, 2006) where only symmetric signatures over the Hadamard basis (special basis of size 1) were obtained. In particular, we give a complete list of Boolean symmetric signatures over bases of size 1. It is an open problem whether signatures over bases of higher dimensions are strictly more powerful. The recent result by Valiant (FOCS 2006, pp. 509-517, 2006) seems to suggest that bases of size 2 might be indeed more powerful than bases of size 1. This result is with regard to a restrictive counting version of #SAT called #Pl-Rtw-Mon-3CNF. It is known that the problem is #P-hard, and its mod 2 version is aS center dot P-hard. Yet its mod 7 version is solvable in polynomial time by holographic algorithms. This was ac complished by a suitable symmetric signature over a basis of size 2. We show that the same unexpected holographic algorithm can be realized over a basis of size 1. Furthermore we prove that 7 is the only modulus for which such an \"accidental algorithm\" exists.", "paper_title": "On Symmetric Signatures in Holographic Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000274222500002"}
