In this note, S-lambda is investigated for all lambda by virtue of the Z(4)-valued quadratic forms over Galois rings. As a consequence, a new class of quaternary sequences with low correlation is obtained and the correlation distribution is also completely determined. It also turns out that the known optimal quaternary sequences S-lambda for particular lambda can be easily obtained from our approach.", "paper_title": "A CLASS OF QUATERNARY SEQUENCES WITH LOW CORRELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000354031100005"}
