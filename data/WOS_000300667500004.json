We show how the latter operation naturally gives rise to an algorithm for enumerating lattice polygons by their genus. We then report on an implementation of this algorithm, by means of which we produce the list of all lattice polygons (up to equivalence) whose genus is contained in {1,aEuro broken vertical bar,30}. In particular, we obtain the number of inequivalent lattice polygons for each of these genera. As a byproduct, we prove that the minimal possible genus for a lattice 15-gon is 45.", "paper_title": "Moving Out the Edges of a Lattice Polygon", "paper_id": "WOS:000300667500004"}
