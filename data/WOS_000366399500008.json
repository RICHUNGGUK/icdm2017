To maximize the profit, heterogeneous networks form a whole, which may either compete or cooperate with each other. In this paper, the healthcare monitor network architecture is introduced to build the competitive and cooperative mechanisms of heterogeneous networks which contain three networks, namely, cellular network, WLAN and WMAN. This paper considers the natural growth rate of the network with competitive and cooperative effects. Then, the stability of the proposed model and its equilibrium points are analyzed by the ordinary differential principle. Finally, simulation results show that the natural growth rate cannot increase the profit of the network, but effective cooperative among heterogeneous networks can increase the profit of each network, and competitive may decrease the profit of each network.", "paper_title": "Cooperative and Competitive Effect in Heterogeneous Networks of Healthcare System", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500008"}
