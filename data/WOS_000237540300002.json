This feature mandates the use of mechanisms able to determine whether a particular credential can be trusted at a given moment. This process is commonly named validation. Among available validation mechanisms, the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) stands out due to its ability to carry near real time certificate status information. Despite its importance for security, OCSP faces considerable challenges in the computational Grid (i.e. Proxy Certificate's validation) that are being studied at the Global Grid Forum's CA Operations Work Group (CAOPS-WG). As members of this group, we have implemented an OCSP validation infrastructure for the Globus Toolkit 4, composed of the CertiVeR Validation Service and our Open GRid Ocsp (OGRO) client library, which introduced the Grid Validation Policy. This paper summarizes our experiences on that work and the results obtained up to now. Furthermore we introduce the pre-validation concept, a mechanism analogous to the Authorization Push-Model, capable of improving OCSP validation performance in Grids. This paper also reports the results obtained with OGRO's prevalidation rules for Grid Services as a proof of concept.", "paper_title": "Using OGRO and CertiVeR to improve OCSP validation for grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300002"}
