Many quality metrics and methods have been proposed for revealing community structures at multiple resolution levels, while most existing methods need a tunable parameter in their quality metrics to determine the resolution level in advance. In this study, a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) for revealing multi-resolution community structures is proposed. The proposed MOEA-based community detection algorithm aims to find a set of tradeoff solutions which represent network partitions at different resolution levels in a single run. It adopts an efficient multi-objective immune algorithm to simultaneously optimize two contradictory objective functions, Modified Ratio Association and Ratio Cut. The optimization of Modified Ratio Association tends to divide a network into small communities, while the optimization of Ratio Cut tends to divide a network into large communities. The simultaneous optimization of these two contradictory objectives returns a set of tradeoff solutions between the two objectives. Each of these solutions corresponds to a network partition at one resolution level. Experiments on artificial and real-world networks show that the proposed method has the ability to reveal community structures of networks at different resolution levels in a single run.
