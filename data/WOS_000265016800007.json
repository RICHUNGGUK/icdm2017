The distributed transmission power focuses on reducing the power consumption and decreasing interferences. Wireless scheduling is used to improve the spectrum efficiency, and the routing selection mechanism determines the optimum routing selection. Simulation results show that the proposed joint optimisation mechanism can effectively improve the network throughput performance, decrease the power consumption and achieve better performances.", "paper_title": "Joint optimisation for power control, scheduling and routing algorithms in the infrastructure wireless mesh network", "paper_id": "WOS:000265016800007"}
