In this paper, a new continuous valued number system (CVNS) multiplication algorithm for low-resolution environment is proposed with accurate results. Using the proposed CVNS multiplication algorithm, VLSI implementation of a high-resolution mixed-signal CVNS synapse multiplier for neurochips with on-chip learning is realized. The proposed CVNS multiplication algorithm provides structures with lower NSR. Therefore, the proposed CVNS multiplication algorithm can be exploited to design robust CVNS Adaline for neurochips with on-chip learning.", "paper_title": "CVNS Synapse Multiplier for Robust Neurochips With On-Chip Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000364209000017"}
