Firstly, based on the segmented MTF cartilage compartments, we computed the contact area using the Euclidian distance transformation. The CA was defined as the area of the tibial superior surface and the femoral inferior surface that are less than a voxel width apart. Furthermore, the CI is computed point-by-point by assessing the first-and second-order general surface features over the contact area. Mathematically, it is the inverse distance between the local normal vectors (first-order features) scaled by the local normal curvatures (second-order features) along the local direction of principal knee motion in a local reference coordinate system formed by the directions of principal curvature and the surface normal vector. The abilities of the CA and the CI for diagnosing osteoarthritis (OA) at different levels (disease severity was assessed using the Kellgren and Lawrence Index, KL) were cross-validated on 288 knees at baseline. Longitudinal analysis was performed on 245 knees. The precision quantified on 31 scan-rescan pairs (RMS CV) for CA was 13.7% and for CI 7.5%. The CA increased with onset of the disease and then decreased with OA progression. The CI was highest in healthy and decreased with the onset of OA and further with disease progression. The CI showed an AUC of 0.69 (p < 0.0001) for separating KL = 0 and KL > 0. For separating KL < 1 or KL = 1 and KL > 1 knees, the AUC for CI was 0.73 (p < 0.0001). The CA demonstrated longitudinal responsiveness (SRM) at all stages of OA, whereas the CI did for advanced OA only. Eventually, the quantified CA and the CI might be suitable to help explaining OA onset, diagnosis of (early) OA, and measuring the efficacy of DMOADs in clinical trials.", "paper_title": "Automatic Quantification of Tibio-Femoral Contact Area and Congruity", "paper_id": "WOS:000305898500007"}
