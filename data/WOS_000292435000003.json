In contrast, we take the view in this paper that conflicts are often caused by statements that are inaccurate rather than completely false, suggesting to restore consistency by interpreting certain statements in a flexible way, rather than ignoring them completely. In accordance with this view, we propose a novel approach to merging which exploits extra-logical background information about the semantic relatedness of atomic propositions. Several merging operators are presented, which are based on different formalizations of this background knowledge, ranging from purely qualitative approaches, related to possibilistic logic, to quantitative approaches with a probabilistic flavor. Both syntactic and semantic characterizations are provided for each merging operator, and the computational complexity is analyzed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
