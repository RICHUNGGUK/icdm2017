This meta-information behaves as an added value over the obtained information or as an additional element to take into account during the proposition of the queries. The quality properties considered are freshness, availability and accuracy. We provide a set of formulas that allow estimating or calculating the values of these: properties, for the result of any multidimensional operation of a predefined basic set.", "paper_title": "Managing quality properties in a ROLAP environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000238486900010"}
