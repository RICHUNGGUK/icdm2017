In Proxy Mobile IPv6, new mobility entities such as the mobile access gateway and the local mobility anchor have been introduced. These mobility entities eliminate the burden of implementing host-based mobility stack and signaling cost concentrated to mobile hosts. However, there has been no attempt to apply paging technologies, which can also reduce the signaling cost focusing to the local mobility anchor, into Proxy Mobile IPv6. In this paper, we propose a paging mechanism for Proxy Mobile IPv6 to enable an efficient mobility management that reduces the location update signaling cost for the mobile hosts in the idle mode. The results of performance analysis are presented to demonstrate that the proposed paging mechanism provides the reduced signaling cost compared to Proxy Mobile IPv6 and improves the scalability by supporting large numbers of mobile hosts with the decreased signaling cost under various system parameters.", "paper_title": "Enabling a Paging Mechanism in Network-Based Localized Mobility Management Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271592800002"}
