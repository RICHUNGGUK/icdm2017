The algorithm is derived from the radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs) and is referred to as a bio-basis function neural network (BBFNN). The basic principle is to replace the radial basis function used by RBFNNs with a bio-basis function. Each basis in BBFNN is supported by a peptide. The bases collectively form a feature space, in which each basis represents a feature dimension. A linear classifier is constructed in the feature space for characterising a protein peptide in terms of functional status. The theoretical basis of BBFNN is that peptides, which perform the same function will have similar compositions of amino acids. Because of this, the similarity between peptides can have statistical significance for modelling while the proposed bio-basis function can well code this information from data. The application to two real cases shows that BBFNN outperformed multi-layer perceptrons and support vector machines. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
