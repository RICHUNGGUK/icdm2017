Therefore, extensions of the common service composition techniques are urgently needed in order to cover dependability aspects and a core concept for the dependability estimation of the target composite service. Since Web services-based workflows fit into the class of systems composed of multiple phases, this paper attempts to apply methodologies and tools for dependability analysis of Multiple Phased Systems (MPS) to this emerging category of dependability critical systems. The paper shows how this dependability analysis constitutes a very useful support to the service provider in choosing the most appropriate service alternatives to build up its own composite service.", "paper_title": "Dependability evaluation of web service-based processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239480100012"}
