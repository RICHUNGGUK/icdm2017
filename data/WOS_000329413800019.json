In this paper, we propose a decision system to classify DM fundus images into normal, clinically significant macular edema (CMSE), and non-clinically significant macular edema (non-CMSE) classes. The objective of the proposed decision system is three fold namely, to automatically extract textural features (both region specific and global), to effectively choose subset of discriminatory features, and to classify DM fundus images to their corresponding class of disease severity. The system uses a gamut of textural features and an ensemble classifier derived from four popular classifiers such as the hidden naive Bayes, naive Bayes, sequential minimal optimization (SMO), and the tree-based J48 classifiers. We achieved an average classification accuracy of 96.7% using five-fold cross validation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
