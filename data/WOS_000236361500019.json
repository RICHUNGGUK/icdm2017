The systems, with disturbances and nonaffine unknown functions, have low triangular structure, which generalizes both strict-feedback uncertain systems and pure-feedback ones. There do not exist any effective methods to stabilize this kind of systems. With some new conclusions for Nussbaum-Gain functions (NGF) and the idea of backstepping, semiglobal, uniformal, and ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop is proved at equilibrium point. The two problems, control directions and control singularity, are well dealt with. The effectiveness of proposed scheme is shown by simulation on a proper nonlinear system.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural network control for a class of low-triangular-structured nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236361500019"}
