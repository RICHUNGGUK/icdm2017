The proposed model uses a stick-breaking representation and is learned by a variational inference method. Due to the nature of Bayesian nonparametric approach, the problems of overfitting and underfitting are prevented. Moreover, the obstacle of estimating the correct number of clusters is sidestepped by assuming an infinite number of clusters. Compared to other approximation techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), which require high computational cost and whose convergence is difficult to diagnose, the whole inference process in the proposed variational learning framework is analytically tractable with closed-form solutions. Additionally, the proposed infinite Dirichlet mixture model with variational learning requires only a modest amount of computational power which makes it suitable to large applications. The effectiveness of our model is experimentally investigated through both synthetic data sets and challenging real-life multimedia applications namely image spam filtering and human action videos categorization.", "paper_title": "Variational learning for Dirichlet process mixtures of Dirichlet distributions and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500015"}
