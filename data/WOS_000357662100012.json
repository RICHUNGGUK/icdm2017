H-CRANs exploit the heterogeneity of macro and small cells from HetNets, enabling cellular networks to achieve higher spectral efficiency. Meanwhile, concepts from C-RANs involving baseband units and remote radio heads enable H-CRANs to insert a centralized point of processing for cellular networks, reducing capital and operational expenditures. In this article, we investigate resource sharing in H-CRANs at three levels: spectrum, infrastructure, and network. For each level, we discuss the benefits and challenges, highlighting key enabling technologies that make resource sharing feasible in H-CRANs, such as software defined radio, virtualization, network function virtualization, and software defined networking. Through these technologies, H-CRANs can be virtualized in an overlay network capable of achieving enhanced infrastructure and spectrum sharing.", "paper_title": "RESOURCE SHARING IN HETEROGENEOUS CLOUD RADIO ACCESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000357662100012"}
