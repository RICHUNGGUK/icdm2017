The main reaction step is HMF catalytic oxidation using aqueous acetic acid as solvent, Pt/ZrO2 as catalyst and air as oxidant. The first process investigated involves a mixed-suspension, mixed-product-removal crystallizer and a filter for separating solid FDCA from the solvent. The calculated minimum sale price of FDCA is 3157$/t, whereas, if pure oxygen is used as oxidant the FDCA price reduces to 2458$/t. Due to the high melting point of FDCA, the second alternative considered introduces trioctylamine as solvent to facilitate separation of FDCA from the solvent using distillation. The estimated FDCA price using this process is 3885$/t. Sensitivity analysis shows that selectivity and conversion have small impact on FDCA price, whereas plant capacity, catalyst and HMF costs have large effects on the price of FDCA.
