While processor caches can effectively reduce execution time there are several factors, such as cache size, system data sharing, and task execution schedule, which make it hard to quantify, predict, and optimize the cache usage of a DRE system. This article presents SMACK, a novel heuristic for estimating the hardware cache usage of a DRE system, and describes a method of varying the runtime behavior of DRE system software without (1) requiring extensive safety recertification or (2) violating the real-time scheduling deadlines. By using SMACK as a maximization target, we were able to reduce integrated DRE system execution time by an average of 2.4% and a maximum of 4.34%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
