For k = 1, ... , n, let l(k) be the line through the points e(k) and x*, let y(k) be the intersection point of l(k) with partial derivative K opposite to e(k), and let z(k) be the intersection point of l(k) with the linear subspace spanned by all points e(l), l = 1, ... , n except e(k). We give a lower bound on the barrier parameter nu of logarithmically homogeneous self-concordant barriers F : K-0 -> R on K in terms of the projective cross-ratios q(k) = ( e(k), x*; y(k), z(k)). Previously known lower bounds by Nesterov and Nemirovski can be obtained from our result as a special case. As an application, we construct an optimal barrier for the epigraph of the ||.||(infinity)-norm in R-n and compute lower bounds on the barrier parameter for the power cone and the epigraph of the ||.||(infinity)-norm in R-2.", "paper_title": "A lower bound on the barrier parameter of barriers for convex cones", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038100010"}
