Sensory signals from peripheral receptors can strongly impact the timing and amplitude of locomotor activity. This sensory information is gated centrally depending on the state of the system (i.e., rest vs. locomotion) but is also modulated according to the phase of a given task. Consequently, if one is to devise biologically relevant walking models it is imperative that these sensorimotor interactions at the spinal level be incorporated into the control system.", "paper_title": "Experiments and models of sensorimotor interactions during locomotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000242851700007"}
