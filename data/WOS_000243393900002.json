It shows that emergence of the network economy and network society necessitates a paradigm shift in the IS discipline, and that complexity science offers the apposite concepts and tools for effecting such a shift. To avoid confusion of fundamental complexity science concepts with the more colloquial uses of complexity terminology, the paper provides an introduction to concepts from complexity science for those in the IS field who are unacquainted with complexity theory. It then proceeds to explore the utility of these concepts for developing IS theory and practice for the emergent networked world.", "paper_title": "Complexity and information systems: the emergent domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000243393900002"}
