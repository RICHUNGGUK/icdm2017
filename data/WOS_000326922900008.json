Our approach is based on an approximation of physically correct shadows from distant Gaussian area light sources positioned behind the view plane, using iterative convolution. We present a theoretical and empirical analysis of this model and propose an efficient class of convolution kernels which provide high quality at interactive frame rates. Our GPU-based implementation supports arbitrary volumetric detail maps, requires no precomputation, and therefore allows for real-time modification of all rendering parameters.", "paper_title": "Instant Convolution Shadows for Volumetric Detail Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000326922900008"}
