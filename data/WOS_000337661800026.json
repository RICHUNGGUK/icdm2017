Our work revisits the multiple instance learning (MIL) formulation to alleviate the drifting problem in tracking, which addresses two key issues in the existing MIL based tracking-by-detection methods, i.e., the unselective treatment of instances in the positive bag during weak classifier updating and the lack of object prior knowledge in instance modeling. We tackle both issues in a principled way by using a robust SemiMILBoost algorithm, which treats instances in the positive bag as unlabeled while the ones in the negative bag as negative. To improve the discriminability of weak classifiers online, we iteratively update them with the pseudo-labels and importance of all instances in the positive bag, which are predicted by employing the instance-level semi-supervised learning technique with object prior knowledge during boosting. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art tracking methods on several challenging video sequences. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
