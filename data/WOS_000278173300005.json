However, the hysteresis nonlinearity and the creep reduce their fidelity and cause difficulties in the micromanipulation control procedure. Besides, variation of temperature and external loads could change the model parameters identified for the piezo actu-ator. In this paper, a novel feedforward-feedback controller is proposed. The modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii model is utilized to linearize the actuator hysteresis in feedforward scheme and a sliding mode based impedance control with perturbation estimation is used to cancel out the thermal and external load disturbances in feedback scheme. The efficiency of the proposed controller is verified by experiments.", "paper_title": "Robust impedance control of a piezoelectric stage under thermal and external load disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000278173300005"}
