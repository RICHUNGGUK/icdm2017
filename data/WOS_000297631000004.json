The characters are controlled individually by two different players-one player controls the attacker and the other controls the defender. A finite state machine of attacks and defenses based on topology coordinates is precomputed and used to control the virtual wrestlers during the game play. As the states are represented by topology coordinates, which is an abstract representation for the spatial relationship of the bodies, the players have much more degree of freedom to control the virtual characters even during attacks and defenses. Experimental results show the methodology can simulate realistic competitive interactions of wrestling in real time, which is difficult by previous methods.
