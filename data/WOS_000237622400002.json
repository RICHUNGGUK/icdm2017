In this paper, we utilize a nonconstant dividend growth model to \"capture\" lasting marginal productivity gained through the \"reinvestment\" of labor capital rather than the standard the one-time gain of reducing the labor force to realize labor productivity gains. This innovative methodology for capturing the productivity value of maintained employees enables the valuation of continuing marginal productivity gains and the management of workload for the affected employees at Intel. This methodology is applied to the valuation of a standard operating system and hardware upgrade.
