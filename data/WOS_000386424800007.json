By the advent of such applications, the support of advanced analysis queries such as the skyline and its variant operators for big uncertain data has become important. In this paper, we propose the effective parallel algorithms using MapReduce to process the probabilistic skyline queries for uncertain data modeled by both discrete and continuous models. We present three filtering methods to identify probabilistic non-skyline objects in advance. We next develop a single MapReduce phase algorithm PS-QP-MR by utilizing space partitioning based on a variant of quadtrees to distribute the instances of objects effectively and the enhanced algorithm PS-QPF-MR by applying the three filtering methods additionally. We also propose the workload balancing technique to balance the workload of reduce functions based on the number of machines available. Finally, we present the brute-force algorithms PS-BR-MR and PS-BRF-MR with partitioning randomly and applying the filtering methods. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of PS-QPF-MR compared to the other algorithms.", "paper_title": "Processing of Probabilistic Skyline Queries Using MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800007"}
