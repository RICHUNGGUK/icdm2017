Using spiking neural networks inspired by the visual system, an image can be decomposed into multiple visual image components. Based on specific visual image components and image features, a visual attention system is proposed to extract attention areas according to top-down volition-controlled signals. The hierarchical spiking neural networks are constructed with a conductance-based integrate-and-fire neuron model and a set of specific receptive fields in different levels. The simulation algorithm and properties of the networks are detailed in this paper. Simulation results show that the attention system is able to perform visual attention of objects based on specific image components or features, and a demonstration shows how the attention system can detect a house in a visual image. Using the proposed saliency index, attention areas of interest can be extracted from spike rate maps of multiple visual pathways, such as ON/OFF colour pathways. According to this visual attention principle, the visual image processing system can quickly focus on specific areas while ignoring other areas. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
