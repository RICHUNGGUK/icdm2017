The proposed cryptanalysis is based on a cryptographic feature/weakness of the Boolean function employed as the nonlinear filter. It is shown that the developed algorithm is significantly more efficient than the previously reported ones against LILI-128 and can recover the internal state with time complexities of pre-processing and processing of the order of 2(47) and 2(35), respectively, the space complexity of 2(47), and a sample of dimension approximately equal to 2(46). The developed cryptanalysis is also a practical confirmation on the significance of the so-called \"non-normality\" design criterion for Boolean functions. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
