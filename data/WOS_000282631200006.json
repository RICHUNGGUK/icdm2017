The contribution lies in the application and assessment of the Lagrange relaxation and the Dantzig-Wolfe methods, which allows us to efficiently decompose a real-time optimization problem. Furthermore, all nonlinearities are modeled by piecewise linear models, resulting in a mixed integer linear program, with the added benefit that error bounds on the solution can be computed. The merits of the method are studied by applying it to a semi-realistic model of the Troll west oil rim, a petroleum asset with severe production optimization challenges due to rate dependent gas-coning wells. This study indicates that both the Lagrange relaxation and in particular the Dantzig-Wolfe approach offers an interesting option for complex production systems. Moreover, the method compares favorably with the non-decomposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
