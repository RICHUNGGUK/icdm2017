We show the coincidence of recognizable trace series with those which are definable by restricted formulas from a weighted logics over traces. We use a translation technique from formulas over words to those over traces, and vice versa. This way, we show also the equivalence of aperiodic and first-order definable trace series.", "paper_title": "Weighted logics for traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200025"}
