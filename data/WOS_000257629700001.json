The cubature rules on which these algorithms are based use fractional parts of multiples of irrationals in combination with certain weights. Previous work led to algorithms with quadratic and cubic error convergence. We generalize these algorithms so that one can use them to obtain general higher order error convergence. The algorithms are open in the sense that extra steps can easily be taken in order to improve the result. They are also linear in the number of steps and their memory cost is low.
