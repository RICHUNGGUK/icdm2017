Tests demonstrate that for all members of the family, the network performance (end-to-end delay and packet loss ratio) compares favorably to the single-path Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol at moderate to high speeds, though there is a trade-off against control packet overhead. Where the design effort differs from other multi-path protocol reviewed is that different aspects of the performance are emphasised in different members of the protocol family.", "paper_title": "A flexible family of multi-path routing protocols over a MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000305322800003"}
