The goal is to determine an optimal set of storage nodes that minimizes overall communication cost. Prior work toward this problem assumed homogeneous channel cost, which may not be the case in many network environments. We generalize the optimal storage problem for a tree-structured network by considering heterogeneous channel costs. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the optimal solution are identified, and an algorithm that incurs a linear time cost is proposed. We have also conducted extensive simulations to validate the algorithm and to evaluate its performance.", "paper_title": "Optimal Storage Placement for Tree-Structured Networks with Heterogeneous Channel Costs", "paper_id": "WOS:000294421000004"}
