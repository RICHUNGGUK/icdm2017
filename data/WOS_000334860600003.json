Firstly, the probabilistic mix-valued logical control network is expressed in an algebraic form by the semi-tensor product method, based on which the optimal finite-horizon control problem is studied and a new algorithm for choosing a sequence of control actions is established to minimize a given cost functional over finite steps. Secondly, the first-passage model of probabilistic mix-valued logical networks is given and a new algorithm for designing the optimal control scheme is proposed to maximize the corresponding probability criterion. Finally, an illustrative example is studied to support our new results/algorithms.", "paper_title": "Two kinds of optimal controls for probabilistic mix-valued logical dynamic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000334860600003"}
