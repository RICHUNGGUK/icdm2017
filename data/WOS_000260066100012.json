This mapping is developed for the planar triangle surface derived from the conformal self-organizing map [C.-Y. Liou, Y.-T. Kuo, Conformal self-organizing map for a genus-zero manifold, Visual Comput. 21(5) (2005) 340-353]. It shows how to construct a seamless surface for the genus-zero manifold. The constructed surface is both seamless and continuous. The mapping between the model surface and the sphere surface is one-to-one and onto. This kind of surface can facilitate many applications of the self-organizing map. We show experiments in surface reconstructions and texture mappings. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
