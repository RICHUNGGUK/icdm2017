On the other hand, the current Internet architecture is host-centric rather than data-centric, and it is not practical to deploy a pure data-centric architecture overnight. This motivates an incrementally deployable network architecture that can efficiently support both data-centric and host-centric services. In this article we describe such an architecture called DCNA for the Internet. DCNA is based on the inclusion of a shim layer between the application layer and the transport layer along with appropriate interfaces to connect these layers. In addition to being data-centric and incrementally deployable, DCNA can also effectively support mobility and multi-homing.", "paper_title": "An Incrementally Deployable Network Architecture to Support Both Data-Centric and Host-Centric Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000345579100011"}
