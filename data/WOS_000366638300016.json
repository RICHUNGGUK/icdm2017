It provides a short overview on research and literature during the last two decades and pleads for a multiplicity of historical views. Design/methodology/approach - Historical research, review of literature. Findings - While it can be found that there was a growing historical interest in cybernetics, this cannot be claimed for the history of the American Society of Cybernetics (ASC) as an organization and a productive network. One reason seems to be the lack of archival sources. The article provides a proposal to reconstruct such an archive for the history of the ASC. Originality/value - Stimulation of historical awareness for and in cybernetics.", "paper_title": "Avec un \"s\": histories of cybernetics and the ASC", "paper_id": "WOS:000366638300016"}
