Earlier techniques have been impaired by the adaptive nature of unsolicited email spam. Inspired by adaptive algorithm, this paper introduces a modified machine learning technique of the human immune system called negative selection algorithm (NSA). A local selection differential evolution (DE) generates detectors at the random detector generation phase of NSA; code named NSA-DE. Local outlier factor (LOF) is implemented as fitness function to maximize the distance of generated spam detectors from the non-spam space. The problem of overlapping detectors is also solved by calculating the minimum and maximum distance of two overlapped detectors in the spam space. From the experiments, the results show that the detection accuracy of NSA-DE is 83.06% while the standard negative selection algorithm is 68.86% at 7000 generated detectors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
