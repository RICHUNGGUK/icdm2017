The core of the method is a simple, intuitive, and computationally efficient geometric rounding that simultaneously rounds multiple points in a multi-dimensional simplex to its vertices. Using this method we obtain in a systematic way known as well as new results for the hub location, metric labeling, winner determination and consistent labeling problems. A comprehensive comparison to the dependent randomized rounding method developed by Kleinberg and Tardos (J. ACM 49(5):616-639, 2002) and its variants is also conducted. Overall, our geometric rounding provides a simple and effective alternative for rounding various integer optimization problems.", "paper_title": "Geometric rounding: a dependent randomized rounding scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200017"}
