This can be used to estimate the ground state energy of the time-independent Schrodinger equation with a convex potential and relative error epsilon. Classical deterministic algorithms solving this problem have cost exponential in the number of its degrees of freedom d. We show a quantum algorithm, that is based on a perturbation method, for estimating the ground state energy with relative error epsilon. The cost of the algorithm is polynomial in d and epsilon(-1), while the number of qubits is polynomial in d and logs epsilon(-1) . In addition, we present an algorithm for preparing a quantum state that overlaps within 1 - delta, delta is an element of(0, 1), with the ground state eigenvector of the discretized Hamiltonian. This algorithm also approximates the ground state with relative error epsilon. The cost of the algorithm is polynomial in d, delta(-1) and delta(-1), while the number of qubits is polynomial in d, log epsilon(-1) and log delta(-1). (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
