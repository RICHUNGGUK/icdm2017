In this paper, we design a contention based distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol for the secondary users' channel access. The proposed MAC protocol allows collision-free access to the available data channels and eventually their utilization by secondary users, with spectrum sensing part being handled by exclusive sensing nodes. We further introduce the provision of reservation of free channels by secondaries for extended periods to increase utilization without causing harmful interference to primaries. We demonstrate how such extended access to resources can be tuned to provide differential quality of service to the secondary users. The effectiveness of the protocol is evaluated by performing analysis and simulation. We use blocking probability, secondary usage of a secondary user and performance degradation caused to primary incumbents as performance metrics. We obtain the conditions for such extended access and try to gauge the resulting increase in utilization. Under optimal conditions, the proposed scheme enables the secondary network to utilize all available channels. The proposed scheme is shown to outperform the most sophisticated existing MAC schemes for distributed secondary networks.", "paper_title": "Contention Based Multichannel MAC Protocol for Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344592900005"}
