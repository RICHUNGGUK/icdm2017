This block realizes a positive impedance inverter (gyrator) by using the log-domain wave method. A simple procedure for log-domain. filter development, using the proposed block, is outlined. This method results in circuits, which are simple in structure and very easy to design. An example of a second-order bandpass. filter is given and its functionality is verified through simulations.", "paper_title": "A LOG-DOMAIN WAVE POSITIVE IMPEDANCE INVERTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648300002"}
