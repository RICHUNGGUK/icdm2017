The input signal is generated in real time when the user enters with target string. Five features were extracted from this input signal (ASCII key code and four keystroke latencies) and four experiments using samples for genuine and impostor users were performed using two pattern classification technics. The best results were achieved by the HMM (EER=3.6%). This new approach brings security improvements to the process of user authentication, as well as it allows to include biometric authentication in mobile devices, such as cell phones.", "paper_title": "Biometric access control through numerical keyboards based on keystroke dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300085"}
