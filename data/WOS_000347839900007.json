The main motivation for developing this module is to deal with the computational complexity experienced during the calculation of the descriptors over large datasets. To accomplish this task, a multi-server computing platform named Tarenal was developed, which is suited for institutions with many workstations interconnected through a local network and without resources particularly destined for computation tasks. This new system was deployed in 337 workstations and it was perfectly integrated with the QuBiLS-MIDAS software. To illustrate the usability of the T-arenal platform, performance tests over a dataset comprised of 15000 compounds are carried out, yielding a 52 and 60 fold reduction in the sequential processing time for the 2Linear and 3-Linear indices, respectively. Therefore, it can be stated that the T-arenal based distribution of computation tasks constitutes a suitable strategy for performing high-throughput calculations of 3D Multi-Linear descriptors over thousands of chemical structures for posterior QSAR and/or ADME-Tox studies.", "paper_title": "Multi-Server Approach for High-Throughput Molecular Descriptors Calculation based on Multi-Linear Algebraic Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000347839900007"}
