An improved vegetation index, Excess Green minus Excess Red (ExG - ExR) was compared to the commonly used Excess Green (ExG), and the normalized difference (NDI) indices. The latter two indices used an Otsu threshold value to convert the index near-binary to a full-binary image. The indices were tested with digital color image sets of single plants grown and taken in a greenhouse and field images of young soybean plants. Vegetative index accuracies using a separation quality factor algorithm were compared to hand-extracted plant regions of interest. A quality factor of one represented a near perfect binary match of the computer extracted plant target compared to the hand-extracted plant region. The ExG - ExR index had the highest quality factor of 0.88 +/- 10.12 for all three weeks and soil-residue backgrounds for the greenhouse set. The ExG + Otsu and NDI - Otsu indices had similar but lower quality factors of 0.53 +/- 0.39 and 0.54 +/- 0.33 for the same sets, respectively. Field images of young soybeans against bare soil gave quality factors for both ExG - ExR and ExG + Otsu around 0.88 +/- 10.07. The quality factor of NDI + Otsu using the same field images was 0.25 +/- 10.08. The ExG - ExR index has a fixed, built-in zero threshold, so it does not need Otsu or any user selected threshold value. The ExG - ExR index worked especially well for fresh wheat straw backgrounds, where it was generally 55% more accurate than the ExG + Otsu and NDI + Otsu indices. Once a binary plant region of interest is identified with a vegetation index, other advanced image processing operations may be applied, such as identification of plant species for strategic weed control.
