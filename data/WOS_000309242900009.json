To enable the communications between AmI sensor networks and the most popular TCP/IP networks seamlessly, the best solution model is to run TCP/IP directly on WSNs (Mulligan et al. 2009; Hui and Culler 2008; Han and Mam 2007; Kim et al. 2007; Xiaohua et al. 2004; Dunkels et al. 2004; Dunkels et al. 2004; Dunkels 2001; Dunkels et al. 2004). In this case, an IP assignment method is required to assign each sensor node a unique IP address. SIPA (Dunkels et al. 2004) is the best known IP assignment method that uses spatial relations and locations of sensor nodes to assign their IP addresses. It has been applied in Contiki (Dunkels et al. 2004), a famous WSN operating system, to support the 6LowPAN protocol. In Chang et al. (2009), we proposed the SLIPA (Scan-Line IP Assignment) algorithm to improve the assignment success rate (ASR) obtained by SIPA. SLIPA can achieve a good ASR when sensor nodes are uniformly distributed. However, if sensor nodes are deployed by other distributions, the improvements would be limited. This paper proposes a new spatial IP assignment method, called SLIPA-Q (SLIPA with equal-quantity partition), to improve SLIPA. Experiments show that, by testing the proposed method 1,000 times with 1,000 randomly deployed sensor nodes, the average ASR obtained by SLIPA-Q is over two times of that obtained by SLIPA. Under the same 88% ASR, the average numbers of sensor nodes those can be successfully assigned by SLIPA-Q, SLIPA, and SIPA are 950, 850, and 135, respectively. Comparing to previous spatial IP assignment methods, SLIPA-Q can achieve dramatic improvements in ASR for assigning IP addresses to a large set of sensor nodes.", "paper_title": "A new spatial IP assignment method for IP-based wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000309242900009"}
