To approximate exchange correlation energy and corresponding potential, a special GGA parameterized by Wu-Cohen has been implemented. Our results of lattice constants, bulk moduli as well as for internal parameter with GGA-WC are found to be more reliable. This study reveals that value of internal parameter decreases with increasing volume whereas computed electronic band structure confirms the direct band gap behavior of ZnO in B4 and B3 phases while indirect band gap behavior in B1 phase. Moreover, two fold degeneracy at the maxima of valence band for B4 and B1 phases whereas three fold for B3 is observed. A detailed comparison with experimental and other first principles studies is also made.", "paper_title": "A COMPREHENSIVE DFT STUDY OF ZINC OXIDE IN DIFFERENT PHASES", "paper_id": "WOS:000305905500003"}
