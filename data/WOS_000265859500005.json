Design/methodology/approach - The paper analyses the privacy implications of particular characteristics of ubiquitous applications and discusses the fundamental principles and information practices used in digital environments for protecting individuals' private data. Findings - A significant trend towards shifting privacy protection responsibility from government to the individuals is identified. Also, specific directions for future research are provided with a focus on interdisciplinary research. Research limitations/implications - This paper identifies key research issues and provides directions for future research. Originality/value - This study contributes by identifying major challenges that should be addressed, so that a set of \"fair information principles\" can be applied in the context of ubiquitous environments. It also discusses the limitations of these principles and provides recommendations for future research.", "paper_title": "Privacy and fair information practices in ubiquitous environments Research challenges and future directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000265859500005"}
