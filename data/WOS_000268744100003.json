A central problem in the asymptotic theory of codes is to find lower bounds on alpha (q) (delta). In recent years several authors established various lower bounds on alpha (q) (delta). In this paper, we present a further improved lower bound by extending a result of Niederreiter and A-zbudak (Finite Fields Appl 13: 423-443, 2007). In particular, we show that the bound 1 - delta - A(q)(-1) + log (q) (1 + 2/q (3)) + log (q) (1 + (q - 1)/q (6)) can be achieved for certain values of q and certain ranges of delta.", "paper_title": "On improved asymptotic bounds for codes from global function fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000268744100003"}
