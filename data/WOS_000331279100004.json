Two parameters are adopted in our model, one is the communication rate P-a that denotes the connection strength in the organization and the other is the turnover rate P-b, that stands for the frequency of jumping among the organizations. Based on simulations, we analyze not only the degree distribution, the clustering coefficient, the average distance and the network diameter but also the group distribution which is closely related to their community structure. Moreover, we discover that the networks generated by the proposed model possess the small-world property and can well reproduce the networks of social contacts.", "paper_title": "A NEW DYNAMIC COMMUNITY MODEL FOR SOCIAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000331279100004"}
