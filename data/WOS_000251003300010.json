This tool is based on the languages DAML-S and OWL-S. It includes the ontology visualization and consistency verification which specifies the concepts that a Web Service interacts with. Starting from a service description interpreted by a computer and by the means used for accessing the service, it is possible to discover which software agents use the service. The tool can generate information in different formats to represent graphic information based on XML, such as the SVG format proposed by the W3C. The tool was developed in Java language. It is being used for the visualization of ontologies and for the semantic description of services in traffic information systems. The LISITT group ( Laboratorio Integrado de Sistemas Inteligentes y Tecnologias de la informacion de Trafico) developed this tool at the Robotics Institute at the University of Valencia.", "paper_title": "Visualization of ontologies to specify semantic descriptions of services", "paper_id": "WOS:000251003300010"}
