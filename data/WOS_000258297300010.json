In this paper, a new reversible watermarking algorithm based on wavelet lifting scheme is proposed. In the algorithm, the image is firstly divided into some no-overlapping blocks, and then the wavelet lifting scheme where on every block, is performed watermarking data is embedded into the image according to the attribute of the subband of every block. In order to guarantee the security of algorithm, chaotic system is used to shuffle the position of blocks. The interesting point and usefulness of the algorithm lies in the fact that the watermarked image can be exactly restored into the original image, and the watermarking is robust to cropping. The experimental results show the effectiveness of this scheme.", "paper_title": "Reversible watermarking algorithm based on wavelet lifting scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000258297300010"}
