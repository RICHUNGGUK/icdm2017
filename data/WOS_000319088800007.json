ANN results are compared with analytical four and five parameter models of PV module. The inputs of the models are the daily total irradiation, air temperature and module voltage, while the outputs are the current and power generated by the panel. Analytical models of PV modules, based on the manufacturer datasheet values, are simulated through Matlab/Simulink environment Multilayer perceptron is used to predict the operating current and power of the PV module. The best network configuration to predict panel current had a 3-7-4-1 topology. So, this two hidden layer topology was selected as the best model for predicting panel current with similar conditions. Results obtained from the PV module simulation and the optimal ANN model has been validated experimentally. Results showed that ANN model provide a better prediction of the current and power of the PV module than the analytical models. The coefficient of determination (R-2), mean square error (MSE) and the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) values for the optimal ANN model were 0.971, 0.002 and 0.107, respectively. A comparative study among ANN and analytical models was also carried out. Among the analytical models, the five-parameter model, with MAPE = 0.112, MSE = 0.0026 and R-2 = 0.919, gave better prediction than the four-parameter model (with MAPE = 0.152, MSE = 0.0052 and R-2 = 0.905). Overall, the 3-7-4-1 ANN model outperformed four-parameter model, and was marginally better than the five-parameter model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
