An array of carbon nanofibers (CNF) is to be used as the source of electron beams for lithography purposes. This tool is intended to replace the mask in the conventional photolithography process by controlling their charge emission using the \"Dose Control Circuitry\" (DCC). The large variation in the charge emitted between CNFs grown in identical conditions forced the controller design to be based on fixed dose rather than on fixed time. Compact digital control logic has been designed for controlling the operation of DCC. This system has been implemented in a 0.5 mu m CMOS process.", "paper_title": "Dose control circuit for digital electrostatic electron-beam array lithography", "paper_id": "WOS:000238267700008"}
