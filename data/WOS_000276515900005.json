On the other hand, project failure could, in an extreme case, cause an organisation to go out of business. Mapped against existing literature on ERP critical success factors, this paper examines environmental factors that impacted on the adoption of ERP by The Oman Telecommunication Company (Omantel). Design/methodology/approach - A case study methodology is used to study perceptions of the ERP system implementation project in Omantel. Findings - This paper highlights the particular problems of large organisations that. operate disparate legacy systems. Research limitations/implications - A single case study is conducted. This provides opportunities for further research in a number of varied settings. Originality/value - It is very important that experiences of ERP projects are shared across countries and sectors. This is because many ERP implementations are rolled out by multi-national corporations in several countries, often simultaneously. This is one of the few ERP studies that have been conducted by an internal member of staff. In these situations, it is not just a case of access, but that the respondents feel able to give practical answers.", "paper_title": "ERP implementation in Omantel: a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000276515900005"}
