Multiscale error diffusion (MED) algorithms try to achieve this by exploiting radially symmetric and noncausal error diffusion filters to guarantee spatial homogeneity. In this brief, an optimized diffusion filter is suggested to make the diffusion close to isotropic. When it is used with MED, the resulting output has a nearly ideal blue noise characteristic.", "paper_title": "Optimizing the Error Diffusion Filter for Blue Noise Halftoning With Multiscale Error Diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000312892000034"}
