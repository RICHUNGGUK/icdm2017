Consequently, likelihood-based interval estimation methods are often used in applied work. The loss in accuracy when approximate intervals are used is not necessarily a serious issue especially when we derive such intervals from O(n(-3/2)) accurate results like those in, for example, Fraser, D.A.S., Reid, N. and Wu, J., 1999, A simple general formula for tail probabilities for frequentist and bayesian inference. Biometrika, 86(2), 249-264. In this article, we obtain third-order accurate approximate confidence intervals for the location and scale parameters of the exponential inverse Gaussian distribution [Kanefuji, K. and Iwase, K., 1996, Exponential inverse Gaussian distribution. Computational Statistics, 11, 315-326.]. Results from a simulation study to compare these intervals with the first-order methods based on the asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators and the signed log-likelihood ratio are presented. We also illustrate the interval estimation methods using four published datasets.", "paper_title": "Interval estimation for the exponential inverse Gaussian distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000254508200005"}
