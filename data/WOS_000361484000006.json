We build poly-time active learning algorithms for them, where the learner is allowed to query the teacher with membership and equivalence queries. In order to express invariants in decidable logics, we invent a decidable subclass of QDAs, called elastic QDAs, and show translations to decidable theories of arrays and lists. We also prove that every QDA has a unique minimally-over-approximating elastic QDA, showing a robust technique for abstracting QDA-expressible properties to the decidable fragments expressed by elastic QDAs. We then give an application of these theoretically sound and efficient active learning algorithms to program verification by building a passive learning framework that efficiently learns adequate quantified linear data structure invariants from samples obtained from dynamic executions for a class of programs.", "paper_title": "Quantified data automata for linear data structures: a register automaton model with applications to learning invariants of programs manipulating arrays and lists", "paper_id": "WOS:000361484000006"}
