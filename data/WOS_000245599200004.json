The initial momentum parameterizes the whole geodesic and encodes the shape and form of the target image. Thus, methods such as principal component analysis (PCA) of the initial momentum leads to analysis of anatomical shape and form in target images without being restricted to small-deformation assumption in the analysis of linear displacements. We apply this approach to a study of dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT). The left hippocampus in the DAT group shows significant shape abnormality while the right hippocampus shows similar pattern of abnormality. Further, PCA of the initial momentum leads to correct classification of 12 out of 18 DAT subjects and 22 out of 26 control subjects.", "paper_title": "Large deformation diffeomorphism and momentum based hippocampal shape discrimination in dementia of the Alzheimer type", "paper_id": "WOS:000245599200004"}
