This paper studies the extensibility of the router control plane, which contains complicated modules such as routing protocol processing, router information management: etc. It is difficult to decide when to extending the control plane, and how many nodes are needed. Moreover, the module dispatching configurations is another issues. This paper describes the extensible architecture of the router system and the control plane. It defines three variables to evaluate the extensibility. And a two-step extensible model is provided to achieve the maximum extensibility under these evaluations. Finally, the experiments show that the model is correct and efficient.", "paper_title": "A novel control plane model of extensible routers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500005"}
