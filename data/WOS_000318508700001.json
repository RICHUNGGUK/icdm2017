Different techniques have been developed for analyzing Markovian models, for example, Markov Chain Monte Carlo based simulation, Markov Analyzer, and more recently probabilistic model-checking. However, these techniques either do not guarantee accurate analysis or are not scalable. Higher-order-logic theorem proving is a formal method that has the ability to overcome the above mentioned limitations. However, it is not mature enough to handle all sorts of Markovian models. In this paper, we propose a formalization of Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) that facilitates formal reasoning about time-homogeneous finite-state discrete-time Markov chain. In particular, we provide a formal verification on some of its important properties, such as joint probabilities, Chapman-Kolmogorov equation, reversibility property, using higher-order logic. To demonstrate the usefulness of our work, we analyze two applications: a simplified binary communication channel and the Automatic Mail Quality Measurement protocol.", "paper_title": "Formal Reasoning About Finite-State Discrete-Time Markov Chains in HOL", "paper_id": "WOS:000318508700001"}
