The Coupled Objects paradigm has emerged as a way to easily support these processes by dynamically coupling arbitrary user interface objects between heterogeneous applications. In this article we present an architecture for developing distributed collaborative applications using HTML5 and show its usage through the design and implementation of a series of collaborative systems in different scenarios. The experience of developing and using this architecture has shown that it is easy to use, robust and has good performance.", "paper_title": "Developing Distributed Collaborative Applications with HTML5 under the Coupled Objects Paradigm", "paper_id": "WOS:000350211700002"}
