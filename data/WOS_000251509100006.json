They claimed that their scheme satisfies the secrecy, the proxy protected, the unforgeability, the non-repudiation, and the known signers. However, in this paper, we show that their scheme cannot achieve the proxy protected, the unforgeability and the non-repudiation by demonstrating a conspiracy attack. In this attack, any t malicious proxy signers can collusively impersonate some other proxy signers to generate proxy signatures.", "paper_title": "Security analysis of the Pomykala-Barabasz scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000251509100006"}
