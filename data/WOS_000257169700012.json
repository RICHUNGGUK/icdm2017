It provides a graphical user interface for various tasks commonly used to infer the evolution of exonintron structure in protein-coding orthologs. Implemented tasks include the identification of conserved homologous intron sites in protein alignments, as well as the estimation of ancestral intron content, lineage-specific intron losses and gains. Estimates are computed either with parsimony, or with a probabilistic model that incorporates rate variation across lineages and intron sites.", "paper_title": "Malin: maximum likelihood analysis of intron evolution in eukaryotes", "paper_id": "WOS:000257169700012"}
