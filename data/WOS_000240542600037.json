Even though the space-time code (STC) is a good answer for overcoming the intensive fading of indoor channel, it needs larger size and higher cost for additional antennas. The cooperative scheme is another good solution which gives transmit diversity only with the existing hardware. However, classical cooperative schemes cannot provide full rate. In this paper, a new cooperate diversity scheme for code division multiple access (CDMA) system that provides full rate is presented. Moreover, because cooperative system supplies bad performance when the channel condition between the source and relay is poor, a technique that intelligently selects mode according to it is adopted. We apply the proposed scheme to the direct sequence ultra wideband (DS-UWB) system and evaluate its performance.", "paper_title": "Intelligent wireless home network based on cooperative DS-UWB system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600037"}
