Performance was verified using SPICE simulations with a 0.13 mu m, 1.2 V technology and compared to that of the best-in-class asynchronous transceivers in terms of forward and backward latencies, throughput, energy per bit transfer and design complexity. Results demonstrate the superior overall performance of the new transceiver.", "paper_title": "Robust Two-Phase RZ Asynchronous SoC Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000290998700014"}
