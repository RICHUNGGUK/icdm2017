For the resulting minimax model, we develop a reformulation that facilitates a direct solution procedure using commercial software or via a proposed alternating heuristic. We examine certain related stability and convergence issues, demonstrate special convergence cases, and provide insights into the computational performance of the solution procedures.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Network Interdiction Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000285982300006"}
