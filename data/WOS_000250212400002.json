The two approaches of using the rational function approximation technique, asymptotic waveform evaluation (AWE) and model-based parameter estimation (MBPE), both have been investigated and compared by theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. The numerical results acquired by the developed computing algorithm of integrating the hybrid FE/BI/MLFMA with the RFAT are presented in the article, demonstrating that the rational function approximation technique can greatly speed up the hybrid FE/Bl/MLFMA to acquire wide-band and wide-angle backscatter RCS by complex targets.
