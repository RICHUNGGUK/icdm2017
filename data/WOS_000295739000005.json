The cooperation between the encoders has a two-fold purpose: to generate empirical state coordination between the encoders, and to share information about the private messages that each encoder has. For two-way cooperation, this two-fold purpose is achieved by double-binning, where the first layer of binning is used to generate the state coordination similarly to the two-way source coding, and the second layer of binning is used to transmit information about the private messages. The complete result provides the framework and perspective for addressing a complex level of cooperation that mixes states and messages in an optimal way.", "paper_title": "Message and State Cooperation in Multiple Access Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000005"}
