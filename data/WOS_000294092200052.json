The NGHS algorithm includes two important operations: position updating and genetic mutation with a low probability. The former can enhance the convergence of the NGHS, and the latter can effectively prevent the NGHS from being trapped into the local optimum. Based on a large number of experiments, the NGHS has demonstrated stronger convergence and stability than original harmony search (HS) algorithm and its two improved algorithms (IHS and SGHS).
