However, it suffers from the problem of the curse of dimensionality in high dimensional space. To solve this problem, many adaptive OF nearest neighbor classifiers were proposed. In this paper, a locally adaptive nearest neighbor classification method based on supervised learning style which works well for the multi-classification problems is proposed. In this method, the ellipsoid clustering learning is applied to estimate an effective metric. This metric is then used in the K-NN classification. Finally, the experimental results show that it is an efficient and robust approach for multi-classification.", "paper_title": "Adaptive nearest neighbor classifier based on supervised ellipsoid clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000069"}
