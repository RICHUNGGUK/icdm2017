After introducing a Data Grid architecture that supports efficient data access for the Grid job, the dynamic data replication algorithms are put forward. Combined with different Grid scheduling heuristics, the performances of the data replication algorithms are evaluated with various simulations. The simulation results demonstrate that the dynamic replication algorithms can reduce the job turnaround time remarkably. In particular, the combination of shortest turnaround time scheduling heuristic (STT) and centralized dynamic replication with response-time oriented replica placement (CDR_RTPlace) exhibits remarkable performance in diverse system environments and job workloads.
