Typically, users are asked to memorize several faces that, during login, need to be recognized among distractor faces. In the present study, we analyzed the impact of memory load (4, 6, 8 to-be-remembered faces) and retention interval (hour, day, week, month) on performance in 72 participants. We found no evidence for strong performance decrements when memory load increased. Longer retention intervals yielded a slight increase of login failures, but post hoc analyses indicated that this was mainly due to worse performance of few individuals in the upper part of our age distribution. Display search times increased with longer retention interval, probably reflecting decay or retrieval problems in long-term memory. Users utilized global scanning strategies within the search arrays. Implications for face-based authentication system design are discussed.", "paper_title": "Visual Search in Authentication Systems Based on Memorized Faces: Effects of Memory Load and Retention Interval", "paper_id": "WOS:000337180300008"}
