Personnel specifications have greatest impact on total efficiency. They can enhance total efficiency of critical personnel attributes. This study presents an intelligent integrated decision support system (DSS) for forecasting and optimization of complex personnel efficiency. DSS assesses the impact of personnel efficiency by data envelopment analysis (DEA), artificial neural network (ANN), rough set theory (RST), and K-Means clustering algorithm. DEA has two roles in this study. It provides data to ANN and finally it selects the best reduct through ANN results. Reduct is described as a minimum subset of features, completely discriminating all objects in a data set. The reduct selection is achieved by RST. ANN has two roles in the integrated algorithm. ANN results are basis for selecting the best reduct and it is used for forecasting total efficiency. Finally. K-Means algorithm is used to develop the DSS. A procedure is proposed to develop the DSS with stated tools and completed rule base. The DSS could help managers to forecast and optimize efficiencies by selected attributes and grouping inferred efficiency. Also, it is an ideal tool for careful forecasting and planning. The proposed DSS is applied to an actual banking system and its superiorities and advantages are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
