However, situations with more than fifty percent of outliers often occur in practice. The efficient identification of objects from a noisier background is thus a difficult problem. In this paper, a highly robust estimator is formulated to tackle such a difficulty. The proposed estimator is called the regression density decomposition (RDD) estimator. The computational analysis of the estimator and its properties are discussed and a simulated annealing algorithm is proposed for its implementation. It is demonstrated that the RDD estimator can resist a very large proportion of noisy data, even more than fifty percent. It is successfully applied to some simulated and real-life noisy data sets. It appears that the estimator can solve efficiently and effectively general regression problems, pattern recognition, computer vision and data mining problems. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
