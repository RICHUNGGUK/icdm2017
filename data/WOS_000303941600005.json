All transport equations are solved using the finite volume formulation on a staggered grid system and multi-grid acceleration. Quantitative aspects of two and three-dimensional flows in a lid-driven cavity for Reynolds number Re = 1000 show good agreement with benchmark results. An analysis of the flow evolution demonstrates that, with increments in Re beyond a certain critical value Rec, the steady flow becomes unstable and bifurcates into unsteady flow. It is observed that the transition from steadiness to unsteadiness follows the classical Hopf bifurcation. The time-dependent velocity distribution is studied in detail and the critical Reynolds number is localized for both 2D and 3D cases. Benchmark solutions for 2D and 3D lid-driven cavity flows are performed for Re = 1500 and 6000.", "paper_title": "PREDICTION OF UNSTEADY STATES IN LID-DRIVEN CAVITIES FILLED WITH AN INCOMPRESSIBLE VISCOUS FLUID", "paper_id": "WOS:000303941600005"}
