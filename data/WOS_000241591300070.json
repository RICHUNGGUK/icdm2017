The Dynamic Configuration and Distribution Protocol (DCDP) is an efficient approach, which extends DHCP to a stateless autoconfiguration protocol for wired and wireless networks. However, the distribution randomness in the DCDP results in an unbalanced distribution of address resources, which wastes the limited network address space and, subsequently, incurs scalability problems. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which can implement a more balanced distribution of address resources than DCDP. As the address distribution process continues, almost every node holds address resources. Thus, a new node can obtain its address almost immediately, when it joins the network. Finally, the simulation shows that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Gradient-based autoconfiguration for hybrid mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300070"}
