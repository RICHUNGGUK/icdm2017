In this paper, an active steganalysis scheme is proposed by analyzing and modeling histogram abnormality in the interpolation-error domain of sub-sampled images with the general Gaussian distribution (GGD) features. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier is trained by estimated parameters of GGD, and then a quantitative algorithm is presented to estimate the embedding length and locations. The experimental results show that the proposed active steganalysis scheme is effective in not only detecting the IEB method but also estimating its message length and embedding locations.
