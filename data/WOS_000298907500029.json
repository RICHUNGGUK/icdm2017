The post-nonlinear (PNL) mixture model is more realistic and accurate than the linear instantaneous mixture model in many practical situations. In this paper, we address the problem of extracting the desired source as the first output from the PNL mixture. The prior knowledge about the desired source, such as its rough template (reference), is assumed to be available. Two approaches of extracting PNL signal with reference are discussed. Then a novel algorithm which alternately optimizes the contrast function and the closeness measure between the estimated output and the reference signal is proposed. The inverse of the unknown nonlinear function in the PNL mixture model is approximated by the multi-layer perception (MLP) network. The correctness and validity of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by our experiment results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
