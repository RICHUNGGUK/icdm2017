With a majority voting protocol, a location survives for read/write operations if and only if it is accessible to more than half of the replicas. The problem is to find out the optimal placements for a given number of data replicas in a ring network. When the number of replicas is odd, it was conjectured by Hu et al. [X-D. Hu, X.-H.Jia, D.-Z. Du, D.-Y. Li, H.-J. Huang, Placement of data replicas for optimal data availability in ring networks, J. Parallel Distrib. Comput., 61 (2001) 1412-1424] that every uniform placement is optimal, which is proved by Shekhar and Wu later. However, when the number of replicas is even, it was pointed out by Hu et al. that uniform placements are not optimal and the optimal placement problem may be very complicated. In this paper, we study the optimal placement problem in a ring network with majority voting protocol and an even number of replicas, and give a complete characterization of optimal placements when the number of replicas is not too large compared with the number of locations.
