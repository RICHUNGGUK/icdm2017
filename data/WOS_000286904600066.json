Among the operational issues in reentrant hybrid flow shops, we focus on the scheduling problem that determines the allocation of jobs to the machines at each stage as well as the sequence of the jobs assigned to each machine. Unlike the theoretical approach on reentrant hybrid flow shop scheduling, we suggest a real-time scheduling mechanism with a decision tree when selecting appropriate dispatching rules. The decision tree, one of the commonly used data mining techniques, is adopted to eliminate the computational burden required to carry out simulation runs to select dispatching rules. To illustrate the mechanism suggested in this study, a case study was performed on a thin film transistor-liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) manufacturing line and the results are reported for various system performance measures.
