The concept of hybrid discretization consists in the combination of different modelling approaches for the three-dimensional structural elements. Where most of the non-linear phenomena are expected to occur, refined meshes and more complex constitutive relations are adopted. Elsewhere, simplified structural models are considered. Special attention is devoted to the definition of adequate techniques to treat the transition zones between different structural models. The efficiency and accuracy of alternative kinematic constraint techniques are studied and assessed. The paper ends with two validation examples that test the accuracy and the computational performance of the proposed methodology. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
