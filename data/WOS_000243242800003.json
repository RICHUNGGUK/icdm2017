First, it describes the Platform-Independent Component Modeling Language (PICML), which is a DSML that enables developers to define component interfaces, QoS parameters and software building rules, and also generates descriptor files that facilitate system deployment. Second, it applies PICML to an unmanned air vehicle (UAV) application portion of an emergency response system to show how PICML resolves key component-based DRE system development challenges. Our results show that the capabilities provided by PICML-combined with its design- and deployment-time validation capabilities-eliminates many common errors associated with conventional techniques, thereby increasing the effectiveness of applying QoS-enabled component middleware technologies to the DRE system domain.
