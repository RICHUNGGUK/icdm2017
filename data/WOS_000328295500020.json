The design of access control policy in heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) becomes more challenging especially for the heterogeneous multiple access protocols of each radio network. In this paper, a Markov model is proposed to analyze the performance of three access control policies for HWNs. The first policy is the optimal radio access technology (O-RAT) selection, where the incoming traffic always tries to access one network with the maximum service rate before admission. The second policy intends to allocate the same data to all networks. And the traffic will leave the system if it is accomplished first by one of these networks, which is formulated as the aggregated multi-radio access (A-MRA) technology. The third policy is named the parallel multi-radio access (P-MRA) transmission, in which the incoming traffic is split into different networks. The traffic is served with the sum of the service rates provided by overall networks. Numerical and simulate results show the effectiveness of our analytical framework and the performance gain of the three access control policies. As illustrated with some representative results, the P-MRA policy shows superior performance gain to the other two policies independent on the specific parameters of the different multiple access protocols due to the multiplexing gain.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of three multi-radio access control policies in heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500020"}
