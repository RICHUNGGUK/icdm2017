ASIt is a scientific project aiming to account for minimally different variants within a sample of closely related languages; it is part of the Edisyn network, the goal of which is to establish a European network of researchers in the area of language syntax that use similar standards with respect to methodology of data collection, data storage and annotation, data retrieval and cartography. In this context, ASIt is defined as a curated database which builds on dialectal data gathered during a twenty-year-long survey investigating the distribution of several grammatical phenomena across the dialects of Italy. Both the ASIt linguistic linked dataset and the Resource Description Framework Schema (RDF/S) on which it is based are publicly available and released with a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0). We report the characteristics of the data exposed by ASIt, the statistics about the evolution of the data in the last two years, and the possible usages of the dataset, such as the generation of linguistic maps.", "paper_title": "A curated and evolving linguistic linked dataset", "paper_id": "WOS:000209437200006"}
