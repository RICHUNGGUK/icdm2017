Comparison of different clustering algorithms shows that SOMs perform better in grouping high dimensional gene profiles when a lot of noise is present in the data. Qualitative analysis of the clustering results prove that SOMs allow an in-depth interpretation of gene profiles with biological relevance.", "paper_title": "Interpreting gene profiles from biomedical literature mining with self organizing maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300093"}
