BFA learning hierarchically nests three levels of inverse problems, i.e., inference of binary code for each observation, parameter estimation and model selection. Under Bayesian Ying-Yang (BYY) framework, the first level becomes an intractable Binary Quadratic Programming (BQP) problem, while model selection can be conducted automatically during parameter learning. We conduct extensive experiments to reveal that the performance order of four BQP methods is reversed from making BQP optimization to making BYY automatic model selection, which implies that learning is not merely optimization. Moreover, the BFA learning algorithm is further developed with priors over parameters to improve the performance. Finally, based on BFA, we empirically compare BYY with Variational Bayes (VB) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
