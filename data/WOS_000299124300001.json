In a service-oriented environment, the data, information, and knowledge are often consumed or produced by complex, distributed geoscientific workflows or service chains. In order for the chaining results to be consumable, sufficient metadata for data products to be delivered by service chains must be provided. This paper proposes automatic generation of geospatial metadata for Earth science virtual data products. A virtual data product is represented using process models, and can be materialized on demand by dynamically binding and chaining archived data and services, as opposed to requiring that Earth science data products be physically archived. Semantics-enabled geospatial metadata is generated, validated, and propagated during the materialization of a virtual data product. The generated metadata not only provides a context in which end-users can interpret data products before intensive execution of service chains, but also assures semantic consistency of the service chains.", "paper_title": "Automatic geospatial metadata generation for earth science virtual data products", "paper_id": "WOS:000299124300001"}
