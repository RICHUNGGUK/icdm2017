An approach based on the weighting matrix is introduced to meet the requirement that the peak value of controlled output is often required into a certain range. Then, a dynamic model of high-order multi-agent systems is established. Using a feedback controller and interactions from the neighbours including uncertainties, a linear control protocol is proposed for the systems with networks under fixed or switching topologies. Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived to make all the agents reach robust consensus with the prescribed L-2 - L-infinity performance. A numerical simulation is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.", "paper_title": "Robust L-2 - L-infinity consensus control for uncertain high-order multi-agent systems with time-delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300011"}
