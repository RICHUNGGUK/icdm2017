Current interfaces for RBM are predominantly text-based and command-line driven. Better visual tools are needed to make RBM accessible to a broad range of users, to make specification of models less error prone and to improve workflows. We present RULEBENDER, an open-source visual interface that facilitates interactive debugging, simulation and analysis of RBMs.", "paper_title": "RuleBender: a visual interface for rule-based modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000291261300028"}
