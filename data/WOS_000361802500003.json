Our study is motivated by the fact that previously published results on VNS approaches on the TSPPDL suggest that the perturbation operation has the most significant effect on solution quality. We propose a new perturbation operator for the TSPPDL that achieves better results on average than the existing best approach. We also devise new perturbation operators for the TSPPDF that combine request removal and request insertion operations, and investigate which combination of request removal and request insertion operations produces the best results. Our resultant VNS that employs our best perturbation operator outperforms the best existing TSPPDF approach on benchmark test data.", "paper_title": "A study of perturbation operators for the pickup and delivery traveling salesman problem with LIFO or FIFO loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000361802500003"}
