The surge force, roll moment and yaw moment are perceived as control inputs, while the position, roll angle and yaw angle are to be controlled. Hierarchical sliding mode technique is employed to deal with the underactuation of the system. In order to cope with the uncertainties and nonlinearities, the radial basis function neural network is incorporated with hierarchical sliding mode technique. Stability is proved based on Lyapunov stability theorem. Various simulations under random wave disturbances are conducted to verify the performance of the designed controllers.", "paper_title": "Path following of underactuated surface vessels with fin roll reduction based on neural network and hierarchical sliding mode technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005900002"}
