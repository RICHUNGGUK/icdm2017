In this paper, main features of new geo-information era are discussed. This new era is characterized by these features: serviced users are extended from professionals to all public users, the users are data and information providers as well, geospatial data provided are no longer measurement-by-specification but measurement-on-demand through smart sensor web, and services are transferred from being data-driven to applicationdriven. Such problems as out-of-order issues in geographic data collection and information proliferation, quality issues in geographic information updating, security issues in geographic information services, privacy issues in sharing geographic information and property issues in sharing geographic information, which are brought about by new geo-information era, especially those confronted in geoinformation science and geo-spatial information industry, are analyzed. Then strategies concerning standards, planning, laws, technology and applications are proposed.", "paper_title": "The new era for geo-information", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800015"}
