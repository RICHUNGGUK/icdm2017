This study used partial least squares to test the hypotheses and analyze the data. The results of this study indicated that all these four customer-community relationships can enhance post-purchase behaviors by improving individual community participation or identification. The findings are of benefit to both academics and practitioners and this research is one of the first to demonstrate how to manage digital customer relationships on social media brand community.", "paper_title": "Re-purchase intentions and virtual customer relationships on social media brand community", "paper_id": "WOS:000360336900001"}
