Using this new idea, the notion of interval valued (alpha, beta)-fuzzy sub-polygroups in a polygroup, which is a generalization of a fuzzy sub-polygroup, is defined, and related properties are investigated. In particular, the study of interval valued (epsilon, epsilon Vq)-fuzzy sub-polygroups in a polygroup is dealt with. Finally, we consider the concept of implication-based interval valued fuzzy sub-polygroups in a polygroups.", "paper_title": "Generalized fuzzy polygroups endowed with interval valued membership functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258878600002"}
