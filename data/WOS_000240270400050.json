In the experimental studies, we examine the limitations of the designed attributes and the behavior of three machine learning classifiers. With the objective to increase the final performance of the system, we scrutinize the influence of the combination of lexical and semantic information, as well as techniques for classifier combination.", "paper_title": "Paraphrase identification on the basis of supervised machine learning techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400050"}
