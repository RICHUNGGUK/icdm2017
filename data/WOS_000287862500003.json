This is an extremely important issue because, if the stability of a solution is not guaranteed, the equipment that is being used can be damaged, which can also cause serious accidents. It is true that in some research papers this problem has been considered, but this concerns continuous-time NN only. At the same time, there are many systems that are better described in the discrete time domain such as population of animals, the annual expenses in an industry, the interest earned by a bank, or the prediction of the distribution of loads stored every hour in a warehouse. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider the stability of the discrete-time NN. This paper makes several important contributions. 1) A theorem is stated and proven which guarantees uniform stability of a general discrete-time system. 2) It is proven that the backpropagation (BP) algorithm with a new time-varying rate is uniformly stable for online identification and the identification error converges to a small zone bounded by the uncertainty. 3) It is proven that the weights' error is bounded by the initial weights' error, i.e., overfitting is eliminated in the proposed algorithm. 4) The BP algorithm is applied to predict the distribution of loads that a transelevator receives from a trailer and places in the deposits in a warehouse every hour, so that the deposits in the warehouse are reserved in advance using the prediction results. 5) The BP algorithm is compared with the recursive least square (RLS) algorithm and with the Takagi-Sugeno type fuzzy inference system in the problem of predicting the distribution of loads in a warehouse, giving that the first and the second are stable and the third is unstable. 6) The BP algorithm is compared with the RLS algorithm and with the Kalman filter algorithm in a synthetic example.", "paper_title": "Uniformly Stable Backpropagation Algorithm to Train a Feedforward Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000287862500003"}
