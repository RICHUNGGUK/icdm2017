The radiation force of ultrasound is used to scan the object at a resonant frequency of the object. The vibration of the object is measured by laser and the resulting acoustic emission from the object is measured by a hydrop one. It is shown that the measured signal is proportional to the alue of the mode shape at the focal point of the ultrasound beam. Experimental studies are carried out on a mechanical heart valve and arterial phantoms. The mode images on the valve are made by the hydrophone measurement and confirmed by finite-element method simulations. Compared with conventional B-scan imaging on arterial phantoms, the mode imaging can show not only the interface of the artery and the gelatin, but also the vibration modes of the artery. The images taken on the phantom surface suggest that an image of an interior artery can be made by vibration measurements on the surface of the body. However, the image of the artery can be improved if the vibration of the artery is measured directly. Imaging of the structure in the gelatin or tissue can be enhanced by small bubbles and contrast agents.", "paper_title": "Vibration mode imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000247016400009"}
