A multidisciplinary process is described that enables parametric creation of detailed finite element models and its loads. Iteratively different flight conditions are trimmed and corresponding pressure distributions calculated by the higher-order subsonic and supersonic panel code HISSS. Each defined loading condition is used for the iterative structural sizing of the primary structure. Based on finite element idealization, a mass estimation of all structural masses is performed. The primary and secondary masses are fed back into the closed overall aircraft optimization loop of PrADO until this iterative procedure shows convergence on calculated aircraft variables (e.g., aircraft masses and static engine thrust). This automated process enables further configuration improvements using manual parametric variations or optimization features of PrADO with an objective function being defined by fuel consumption, aircraft mass, or direct operating costs. Different structural solutions and their integration in the global model are presented for passenger versions of a 700 passenger BWB with special consideration of a pressurized cabin. As an example, structural masses and parametric studies on the influence of the center body rib spacing are presented and compared by weight breakdowns.", "paper_title": "Blended wing body structures in multidisciplinary pre-design", "paper_id": "WOS:000256087600009"}
