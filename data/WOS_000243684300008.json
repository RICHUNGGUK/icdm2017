Three criteria were selected to compare the ANN model with the available empirical models: the best fit line for predicted lateral load capacity (Q(p)) and measured lateral load capacity (Q(m)), the mean and standard deviation of the ratio Q(p)/Q(m) and the cumulative probability for Q(p)/Q(m). Different sensitivity analysis to identify the most important input parameters is discussed. A neural interpretation diagram is presented showing the effects of input parameters. A model equation is presented based on neural network parameters. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
