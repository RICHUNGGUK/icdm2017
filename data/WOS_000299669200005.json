Working with mobility information allows richer protocol simulations, particularly in dense networks, but requires complex set-ups to measure. On the other hand, contact information is easier to measure but only allows for simplistic simulation models. In a contact trace a lot of node movement information is irretrievably lost so the original positions and velocities are in general out of reach. In this paper, we propose a fast heuristic algorithm, inspired by dynamic force-based graph drawing, capable of inferring a plausible movement from any contact trace, and evaluate it on both synthetic and real-life contact traces. Our results reveal that (i) the quality of the inferred mobility is directly linked to the precision of the measured contact trace, and (ii) the simple addition of appropriate anticipation forces between nodes leads to an accurate inferred mobility.
