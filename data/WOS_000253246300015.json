Linear state-space models, also known as linear dynamical models, have been applied to model genetic networks from gene expression time series data, but existing works have not taken into account available structural information. Without structural constraints, estimated models may contradict biological knowledge and estimation methods may over-fit. Results: In this report, we extended expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms to incorporate prior network structure and to estimate genetic regulatory networks that can track and predict gene expression profiles. We applied our method to synthetic data and to SOS data and showed that our method significantly outperforms the regular EM without structural constraints.", "paper_title": "Structural systems identification of genetic regulatory networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000253246300015"}
