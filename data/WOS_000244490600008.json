The 3D graphic representation resolves degeneracy completely and is mathematically proven to eliminate circuit formation. As an application, we make a comparison for 5 RNA pseudoknot sequences based on the new 3D graphic representation.", "paper_title": "On 3D graphical representation of RNA secondary structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000244490600008"}
