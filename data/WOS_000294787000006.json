Here, the design of a segmented ambulatory microrobot with a flexible backbone is presented. A dynamic model describing the motion of the microrobot is used to determine body parameters. A three-segment microrobot was fabricated using the Smart Composite Microstructures process and piezoelectric bimorph actuators, and forward locomotion on a flat surface was demonstrated. The footprint of the 750 mg microrobot is 3.5 by 3.5 cm, and it has potential advantages over rigid body hexapedal microrobots in climbing, versatility, and stability.", "paper_title": "Myriapod-like ambulation of a segmented microrobot", "paper_id": "WOS:000294787000006"}
