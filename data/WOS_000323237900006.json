How do academic library collections support research and teaching activities of academic staff? How do reading patterns of articles, books, and other materials differ? What is the role of the academic library collections in teaching and learning? Design/methodology/approach - The paper provides insight into the values and outcomes of scholarly reading, identifies overall reading patterns, and illuminates issues academics address. Approximately 2,000 academic staff members from six UK universities completed a web-based survey. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected through the survey. The survey used the critical incident of last reading by academics to gather information on the purpose, outcomes, and values of scholarly readings and access to library collections. The survey concluded with open-ended comments, which is the focus of this article. Findings - The open-ended comments focused on the importance of article readings to all work activities, in particular research. They also placed emphasis on the value of the library's e-journal collections, but they had some issues with electronic access. The role of book reading was also discussed. Research limitations/implications - Open-ended comments are only one way of measuring the value of scholarly reading and library collections. Ongoing studies and examinations of the findings from the other sections of this study will add to the overall findings of the value of the academic library. Originality/value - This paper further illustrates the essential role of scholarly reading and the library's collections on the academic enterprise. This type of qualitative \"story\" helps libraries demonstrate their value and assess areas of concern.", "paper_title": "Value of academic reading and value of the library in academics' own words", "paper_id": "WOS:000323237900006"}
