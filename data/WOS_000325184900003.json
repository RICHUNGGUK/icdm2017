Overcoming such problems like uncertainties and nonlinear characteristics in the model of two-link manipulator is the principal goal of this paper. To approach to this aim, a neural network is combined with a linear robust control in which the result has the advantages of, the first, approximated nonlinear elements and the second, the guaranteed robustness. To design the proposed controller, at first, multivariable feedback linearization is employed to convert the nonlinear model to linear one. Second, the unknown parameters of the system are identified by neural network based on a new proposed learning rule. Third, Mixed linear feedback-H (aaEuro parts per thousand) robust control method is proposed to stabilize the closed loop system. The closed loop system based on the proposed controller is analyzed and some numerical simulations are performed. Results show suitable responses of the closed loop system.", "paper_title": "Neural Network Identification Based Multivariable Feedback Linearization Robust Control for a Two-Link Manipulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000325184900003"}
