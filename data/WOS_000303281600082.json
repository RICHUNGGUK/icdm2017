Moreover, there is an increasing demand to access social networks by mobile phones, i.e., around 30% globally. Social networking has become a reality, and it generates an incredible amount of information that is sometimes difficult for users to process, especially from mobile phones. Several links, activities, and recommendations are proposed by networked friends every hour, which together are nearly impossible to manage. There is a need to filter and make accessible such information to users, which is the motivation behind developing a mobile recommender that exploits social network information. Thus, in this paper, we propose the design and the implementation of a SOcial Mobile Activity Recommender (SOMAR) that can integrate Facebook social network mobile data and sensor data to propose activities to the user (e.g., concert or computer science seminar). The recommendations are completely calculated in situ in the mobile device with an embedded data mining component. We analyze how to compute and update the social graph in case of changes in social relationships or user context. The paper also presents a case study to analyze the performance of the method.
