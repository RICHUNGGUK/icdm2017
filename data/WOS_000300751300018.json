We assume that the spare system for replacement is available only by an order and the lead time for delivering the spare follows exponential distribution. Moreover, we also suppose that the repair facility may be subject to failure during the repair period. Under these assumptions, by using the geometric process and the supplementary variable technique, some important reliability indices such as the system availability, rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) and the probability that the system is waiting for replacement are derived. An ordering policy N - 1 and a replacement policy N based on the number of failures of the system are also considered. Furthermore, employing several Lemmas, the explicit expression of the average cost rate is derived. Meanwhile, the optimum value N* for minimizing the average cost rate could be determined numerically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
