We analyze the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) and present compact expressions for the ESC in the high signal-to-noise ratio regime. We also examine the impact of large scale antenna arrays at either the source or the destination. For large antenna arrays at the source, we confirm that the ESC is solely determined by the channel between the relay and the destination. For very large antenna arrays at the destination, we confirm that the ESC is solely determined by the channel between the source and the relay.", "paper_title": "Secure Transmission with Optimal Power Allocation in Untrusted Relay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300013"}
