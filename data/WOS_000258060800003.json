In this paper, we study joint spectrum allocation and scheduling problems in cognitive radio wireless networks with the objectives of achieving fair spectrum sharing. A novel Multi-Channel Contention Graph (MCCG) is proposed to characterize the impact of interference under the protocol model in such networks. Based on the MCCG, we present an optimal algorithm to compute maximum throughput solutions. As simply maximizing throughput may result in a severe bias on resource allocation, we take fairness into consideration by presenting optimal algorithms as well as fast heuristics to compute fair solutions based on a simplified max-min fairness model and the well-known proportional fairness model. Numerical results show that the performance given by our heuristic algorithms is very close to that of the optimal solution, and our proportional fair algorithms achieve a good tradeoff between throughput and fairness. In addition, we extend our research to the physical interference model, and propose effective heuristics for solving the corresponding problems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
