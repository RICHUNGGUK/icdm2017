This formalism has been incorporated into TRAJELIX, a new module within the SIMULAID framework (http://inka.mssm.edu/similar to mezei/simulaid/) that is capable of monitoring distortions of alpha-helices in terms of their displacement, global and local tilting, rotation around their axes, compression/extension, winding/unwinding, and bending. Accurate evaluation of these global and local structural properties of the helix can help study possible intramolecular and intermolecular changes in the helix packing of alpha-helical membrane proteins, as shown here in an application to the interacting helical domains of rhodopsin dimers. Quantification of the dynamic structural behavior of alpha-helical membrane proteins is critical for our understanding of signal transduction, and may enable structure-based design of more specific and efficient drugs.", "paper_title": "TRAJELIX: A computational tool for the geometric characterization of protein helices during molecular dynamics simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238342700003"}
