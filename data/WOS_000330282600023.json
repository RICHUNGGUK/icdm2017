Usually, classical error-correcting codes obtained from a maximal curve have good parameters. However, the quantum stabilizer codes obtained from such classical error-correcting codes via Euclidean or Hermitian self-orthogonality do not always possess good parameters. In this paper, the Hermitian self-orthogonality of algebraic geometry codes obtained from two maximal curves is investigated. It turns out that the stabilizer quantum codes produced from such Hermitian self-orthogonal classical codes have good parameters.", "paper_title": "Quantum Stabilizer Codes from Maximal Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600023"}
