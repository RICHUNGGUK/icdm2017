This popularity has been studied by analysis of the links between Web resources. Link-based page ranking models such as PageRank and HITS assign a global weight to each page regardless of its location. This popularity measurement has shown successful on general search engines. However unlike general search engines, location-based search engines should retrieve and rank higher the pages which are more popular locally. The best results for a location-based query are those which are not only relevant to the topic but also popular with or cited by local users. Current ranking models are often less effective for these queries since they are unable to estimate the local popularity. We offer a model for calculating the local popularity of Web resources using back link locations. Our model automatically assigns correct locations to the links and content and uses them to calculate new geo-rank scores for each page. The experiments show more accurate geo-ranking of search engine results when this model is used for processing location-based queries.", "paper_title": "Using Local Popularity of Web Resources for Geo-Ranking of Search Engine Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000264621800003"}
