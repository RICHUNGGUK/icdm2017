The solution to the equations must be consistent with a high-scale boundary condition on supersymmetry breaking parameters, as well as a weak-scale boundary condition on gauge couplings, Yukawa couplings and the Higgs potential parameters. Solution method: Nested iterative algorithm. Running time: A few seconds per parameter point. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
