In this paper we investigate some properties of the extended Carlitz's q-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials by using p-adic q-integral on Z(p). From these properties, we derive some interesting identities on the extended Carlitz's q-Bernoulli numbers and polynomials.", "paper_title": "SOME IDENTITIES ON THE EXTENDED CARLITZ'S q-BERNOULLI NUMBERS AND POLYNOMIALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529600015"}
