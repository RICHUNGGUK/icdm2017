By using the IBM City Simulator [1] to create the city plan and motions of all MNs, simulation results show that our AVME scheme on heterogeneous wireless networks can achieve higher level of predication accuracy for next handoff than traditional cell-based prediction scheme does on a single wireless network, but with less resources and computations.", "paper_title": "An area-based vertical motion estimation on heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000019"}
