This crucial problem is posed in SLM microscopic images analyses, such as edge detection and stereo matching. This paper analyses the noise sources based on the structure of SLM, establishes an image model and explores the variation of random noise with various magnifications. Then a non-uniformity correction method which combines a fitting calibration algorithm and an extended vector median filter speeded up with a fast algorithm is used to remove noise. The experimental results demonstrate the validity of our theoretical model and the effectiveness of non-uniformity correction method of the SLM micro stereovision system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
