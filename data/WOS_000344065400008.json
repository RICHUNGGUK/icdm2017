The main novelty of the system is first that it is designed to optimise the zoomed video quality when viewing life events, via adaptation of the streamed video quality, across multi-video streams with a variable network quality of service. Second, it also personalises the live video zooming with respect to users' zooming preferences, easing the user interaction needed for the zooming task. The experimental results indicate that the system is not only able to zoom effectively, but that it can also maintain the visual quality of the video at the same time. The ePlayer is also able to infer a user's zooming preferences via dynamically clustering a user's zooming regions of interest when viewing live sports video content.", "paper_title": "Personalising live zooming using the ePlayer", "paper_id": "WOS:000344065400008"}
