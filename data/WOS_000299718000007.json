This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel pipeline circuit-switched switch to support guaranteed throughput. The proposed circuit-switched switch, based on a backtracking probing path setup, operates with a source-synchronous wave-pipeline approach. The switch can support a dead- and live-lock free dynamic path-setup scheme and can achieve high bandwidth and high area and energy efficiency. A silicon-proven prototype of a 16-bit-data 5-bidirectional-port switch in a four-metal-layer 0.18-mu m CMOS standard-cell technology can yield an aggregate data bandwidth of up to 73.84 Gb/s, while occupying only a modest area of 0.0315 mm(2). The synthe-sizable implementation of the proposed switch also results in a cost-effective design, fast development time, and portability.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of Backtracking Wave-Pipeline Switch to Support Guaranteed Throughput in Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000299718000007"}
