A program based on an automated procedure to simulate a cracked fuselage is developed. It may create a 3-dimensional panel model using parametrisation. The stress around the crack tips will be captured and the dynamic stress intensity factor can be obtained at every moment of the blast automatically. A typical curved panel model which consists of 7 frames and 8 stringers is calculated. The calculation results show that the form of the dynamic SIF curve is similar to that of the load curve while the peak point of the dynamic SIF curve occurs a little later than that of the load curves due to the inertia effect. The longer the crack is, the more obvious the effect is. The peak SIF value of the crack under blast load is bigger than that under the static load for certain crack length. The longer the crack is, the bigger the difference between the dynamic peak SIF value and static SIF is. At the same time, the load time has an effect on the dynamic SIF curve and its peak value. These results show good agreement with theoretical principles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
