Further binding sites of the selected oligonucleotides are required not to cluster anywhere else. We present an implementation of algorithms which design such oligonucleotide sets and exemplify the existence of COMBO-FISH probe sets by designing labelling sets for 29 genes and subsets thereof. The algorithms can be trivially parallelised and run on clusters, grids, and clouds. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
