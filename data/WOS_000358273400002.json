Using a longitudinal survey of workplace IT continuance among insurance agents at a large insurance company in Taiwan, we demonstrate that the above influences are interdependent, complementary, and have crossover effects. This study advances IT continuance research by theorizing and validating a unifying model that extends prior perspectives and by explaining interrelationships between these perspectives.", "paper_title": "A unified model of IT continuance: three complementary perspectives and crossover effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000358273400002"}
