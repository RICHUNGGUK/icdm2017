The traditional reversible embedding schemes are not suitable for images compressed using vector quantization (VQ) and usually require the use of the location map for reversibility. In this paper, we propose a reversible embedding scheme for VQ-compressed images that is based on side matching and relocation. The new method achieves reversibility without using the location map. The experimental results show that the proposed method is practical for VQ-compressed images and provides high image quality and embedding capacity.", "paper_title": "Reversible steganography for VQ-compressed images using side matching and relocation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246145600007"}
