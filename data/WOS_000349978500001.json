Enterprises are able to share common facilities, services, and infrastructures. It becomes a common practice for manufacturers to use third-party logistics to handle the flow of materials both within and outside the industrial parks. This paper presents a software service for manufacturers to share and manage their transport services provided by multiple fleets. This service-oriented fleet management shell encompasses a range of facilities that can be customized by manufacturers for fleet advanced planning and scheduling (FAPS). The FAPS shell possesses several key innovations. First, auto-ID/RFID technologies are used in industrial parks to create a smart work environment for enhancing real-time information sharing throughout the process of material handling. Second, the real-time information is utilized for coordinating the decisions and operations of different parties involved in fleet planning, scheduling, execution, and control. Third, XML-based configuration data models are applied to standardize web-based user interfaces and components in the FAPS shell in order to maximize system integrity and scalability, third-party customizability and usability. Fourth, a service-oriented architecture (SOA) is adopted to cultivate a loosely coupled system in order to realize the FAPS shell. Finally, real-time facilities are provided for different users to manage various resources and operations as well as to monitor transportation execution. A case study illustrates how FAPS shell facilitates and rationalizes operations and behaviors in fleet management. Qualitative improvements in terms of adaptive and collaborative decision making, real-time visibility and traceability, paperless operation ambience, and system flexibility are obtained from this case.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable Auto-ID Enabled Software as a Service (SaaS) Shell for Real-Time Fleet Management in Industrial Parks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349978500001"}
