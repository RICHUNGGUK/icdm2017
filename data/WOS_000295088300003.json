However, they fail for algorithms whose termination is essentially due to an inductive argument. Therefore, we show how to couple the dependency pair method for termination of TRSs with inductive theorem proving. As confirmed by the implementation of our new approach in the tool AProVE, now TRS termination techniques are also successful on this important class of algorithms.", "paper_title": "Proving Termination by Dependency Pairs and Inductive Theorem Proving", "paper_id": "WOS:000295088300003"}
