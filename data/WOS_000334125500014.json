Concretely, -generalized semantic resolution for lattice-valued propositional logic (L(n)x L-2)P(X) is equivalently transformed into that for lattice-valued propositional logic LnP(X)(i {1,2...,n}). A similar conclusion is obtained between the alpha-generalized semantic resolution for linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued propositional logic LV(nx2)P(X) and that for lattice-valued propositional logic LV(n)P(X)(i {1,2,...,n}). Secondly, the generalized semantic resolution for lattice-valued propositional logic LnP(X) based on a chain-type truth-valued field is investigated and its soundness and weak completeness are given. The Presented work provides some foundations for resolution-based automated reasoning in linguistic truth-valued lattice-valued logic based on lattice implication algebra.", "paper_title": "a- Generalized Semantic Resolution Method in Linguistic Truth- valued Propositional Logic L V ( n epsilon 2) P(", "paper_id": "WOS:000334125500014"}
