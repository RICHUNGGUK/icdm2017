Prior to our work, most anonymous HIBE schemes have long ciphertexts increased according to the hierarchical depth of recipient. The size of the ciphertext in our scheme does not depend on the depth of the hierarchy. Moreover, our scheme achieves the lowest computational cost because during the decryption phase the computational cost of decryption is constant. The security can be proven under reasonable assumptions without using random oracles. Our scheme achieves selective-ID security notion.", "paper_title": "Anonymous Hierarchical Identity-Based Encryption with Short Ciphertexts", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300007"}
