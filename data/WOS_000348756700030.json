The model is a coupled system that consists of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with a generalized Navier boundary condition and Cahn-Hilliard equation in conserved form. In both schemes the projection method is used to deal with the Navier-Stokes equations and stabilization approach is used for the non-convex Ginzburg-Landau bulk potential. By some subtle explicit-implicit treatments, we obtain a linear coupled energy stable scheme for systems with dynamic contact line conditions and a linear decoupled energy stable scheme for systems with static contact line conditions. An efficient spectral-Galerkin spatial discretization method is implemented to verify the accuracy and efficiency of proposed schemes. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes are very efficient and accurate. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
