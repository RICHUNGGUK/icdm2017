Screen area from the given computer display image should be segmented and corrected primarily before perceiving the content displayed on the screen. An automatic approach is proposed to the segmentation and deformation correction of screen area for a computer display image. Due to some inherent characteristics existing on ordinary computer displays, the segmentation can be performed by contour tracing. After contouring the screen area, its four corner locations can be readily identified. By approximating the obtained corners to the closest normal screen region, the deformed screen image can be further restored with affine transformation. As a computer vision application on the \"look at\" screen image, the effectively segmented screen region can be fixed after a little time. The experiments demonstrate that about 70% cases can be fixed under 33 processed frames, others under 51 processed frames, and thus confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "SCREEN IMAGE SEGMENTATION AND CORRECTION FOR A COMPUTER DISPLAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000338020800007"}
