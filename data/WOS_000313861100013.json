Such a graph is called an instance of the stable marriage problem with strict preferences and incomplete lists. A matching M* is popular if for every matching M in G, the number of vertices that prefer M to M* is at most the number of vertices that prefer M* to M. Every stable matching of G is popular, however a stable matching is a minimum cardinality popular matching. The complexity of computing a maximum cardinality popular matching was unknown. In this paper we show a simple characterization of popular matchings in G = (A boolean OR B, E). We also show a sufficient condition for a popular matching to be a maximum cardinality popular matching. We construct a matching that satisfies our characterization and sufficient condition in O(mn(0)) time, where m = \\E\\ and n(0) = min(\\A\\, \\B\\). Thus the maximum cardinality popular matching problem in G = (A boolean OR B, E) can be solved in O(mn(0)) time. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
