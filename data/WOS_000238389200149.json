In this paper, we propose a dispatcher as part of a message routing component in publish/subscribe WSNs. Some works consider link-based solutions to support real-time parameters in WSNs. These works do not take into account the dynamic behavior of WSNs with probable damaged nodes and links. The use of dispatcher can reduce the average message delay, whether the message has high priority or low priority. The dispatcher uses a scheduler to support real-time. parameters, such as delay, and selects messages from two separate queues, namely, QoS queue and non-QoS queue. Simulation results show that our approach really reduces the average delay and increases the delivery rate for both QoS messages and non-QoS messages.", "paper_title": "A publish-subscribe middleware for real-time wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200149"}
