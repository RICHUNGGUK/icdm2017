Our approach is based on Lagrangian duality, where the inequalities are dualized, and only a basic set of constraints is maintained explicitly. This leads to function evaluations requiring to solve a relatively simple semidefinite program. Our approach provides accurate solutions to semidefinite relaxations of the Max-Cut and the Equipartition problem, which are not achievable by direct approaches based only on interior-point methods.", "paper_title": "Computational experience with a bundle approach for semidefinite cutting plane relaxations of Max-Cut and Equipartition", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100016"}
