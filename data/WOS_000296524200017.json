The h-degree (d(h)) of a node is the number d(h) if this node has at least d(h) links with other nodes and the strength of each of these links is greater than or equal to d(h). Based on the notion of h-degree other notions are developed such as h-centrality and h-centralization, leading to a new set of indicators characterizing nodes in a network. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
