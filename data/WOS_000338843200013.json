The hyper-torus performs better than mesh type networks with a similar number of nodes in terms of the network cost. In this paper, we prove that if is even, the bisection width of is , whereas it is if it is odd. Second, we show that contains a Hamiltonian cycle. In addition, its one-to-all and all-to-all broadcasting algorithms are introduced. All of these broadcasting algorithms are asymptotically optimal.", "paper_title": "Some properties and algorithms for the hyper-torus network", "paper_id": "WOS:000338843200013"}
