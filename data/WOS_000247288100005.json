A main issue is then to find the subset of genes whose degeneration is responsible of a certain type of cancer. In this paper, starting from a paradigmatic classification problem of two kinds of Leukaemia, we discuss the use of data-mining techniques in such a context. Particular attention is devoted not only to the classification method but also to all the data analysis steps including data pre-processing and information retrieval.", "paper_title": "An unsupervised clustering approach for leukaemia classification based on DNA micro-arrays data", "paper_id": "WOS:000247288100005"}
