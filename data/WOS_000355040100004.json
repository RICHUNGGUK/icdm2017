Generally, typical BI users consist of financial analysts, marketing planners, and general managers. However, most of them are not familiar with BI's core technologies. In order to help corporate executives better assess BI vendors, evaluation criteria are separated into marketing requirements (MRs) and technical attributes (TM), respectively. In particular, a fuzzy MCDM (multi-criteria decision making) based QFD (quality function deployment) is proposed as follows: (1) fuzzy Delphi is used to aggregate the performance scores of BI vendors, (2) fuzzy DEMATEL (decision making and trial laboratory) is conducted to recognize the causalities between MRs and TAs, and (3) fuzzy AHP (analytical hierarchy process) is employed to recommend optimal BI systems. For better benchmarking, the strengths and weaknesses of three competitive BI vendors (i.e. SAP, SAS, and Microsoft) are concurrently visualized through displaying a line diagram (in terms of TM) and a radar diagram (in terms of MRs). More importantly, experimental results demonstrate that supplier assessment and supplier recommendation have been successfully accomplished. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
