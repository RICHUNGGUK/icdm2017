The new formulation makes use of an adaptive modified bat algorithm and a novel self-adaptive wavelet mutation strategy for the establishment of new robust algorithm for the present problem. In addition, this work improves the modeling process of wind-thermal system in the MGS problem by considering the possible uncertainties when scheduling the generators of power system of the problem. The proposed model can concurrently capture the uncertainty effect of load and wind speed variations. The feasibility and efficiency of the proposed method is examined using two test systems.", "paper_title": "A new stochastic framework for optimal generation scheduling considering wind power sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600046"}
