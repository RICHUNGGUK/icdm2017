We implemented an OWL-log reasoner coupled to the OWL reasoner Pellet and explored different query-answering strategies. We conducted an experimental study using a modified version of the LUBM benchmark in order to evaluate and compare the efficiency of the strategies. Also, to validate OWL-log's usefulness we developed a prototype based on the Web ontology browsing and editing tool Swoop.", "paper_title": "Integrating datalog with OWL: Exploring the AL-log approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240061200044"}
