Low-quality datasets have a very bad impact over the quality of the discovered association rules, and one might legitimately wonder if a so-called \"interesting\" rule noted LHS -> RHS is meaningful when 30% of the LHS data are not up-to-date anymore, 20% of the RHS data are not accurate, and 15% of the LHS data come from a data source that is well-known for its bad credibility. This paper presents an overview of data quality characterization and management techniques that can be advantageously employed for improving the quality awareness of the knowledge discovery and data mining processes. We propose to integrate data quality indicators for quality aware association rule mining. We propose a cost-based probabilistic model for selecting legitimately interesting rules. Experiments on the challenging KDD-Cup-98 datasets show that variations on data quality have a great impact on the cost and quality of discovered association rules and confirm our approach for the integrated management of data quality indicators into the KDD process that ensure the quality of data mining results.", "paper_title": "Data quality awareness: a case study for cost optimal association rule mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000244320500005"}
