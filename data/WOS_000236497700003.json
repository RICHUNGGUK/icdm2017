The paper first introduces a holistic architecture that describes the key functions required to support inter-domain QoS, and then proceeds to present results from two major components of the architecture. A genetic algorithm for QoS-aware offline inter-domain traffic engineering is first presented, and it is shown through simulation studies how this can optimise the apportionment of QoS provisioning between adjacent domains. Secondly, QoS enhancements to BGP are proposed and the results of a testbed implementation are described, demonstrating how this QoS-enhanced BGP can deliver inter-domain QoS routing.
