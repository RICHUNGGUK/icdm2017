A rotordynamic model was developed to expedite the controller design, and enabled modeling of the spindle's performance under the influence of cutting forces. A modal controller, including a negative stiffness compensation scheme, was implemented. A cross-feedback controller partly compensates the gyroscopic effect. The spindle with these controllers has a maximum speed of 150,000 rpm (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A miniature milling spindle with Active Magnetic Bearings", "paper_id": "WOS:000276438900005"}
