The key role played by transport resonances into entanglement formation between the single-particle states is shown. Both reflected and transmitted components of the scattered particle wavefunction are used to evaluate the quantum correlations between the incident carrier and the bound particle(s) in the dots. Our investigation provides a guideline for the analysis of decoherence effects due to the Coulomb scattering in semiconductor quantum dots structures.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT CREATION IN SEMICONDUCTOR QUANTUM DOT CHARGE QUBIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800012"}
