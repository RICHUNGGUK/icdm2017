Linear error-correcting codes are used to extend the net's structure in a way that allows for the algebraic detection and correction of non-reachable net markings. The presented methodology is based on modulo-p Hamming codes-which are optimal for the modulo-p correction of single errors-but also works with any other linear error-correcting code.", "paper_title": "Error-correcting Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000291060900005"}
