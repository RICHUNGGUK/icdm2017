Cas-Designer rapidly provides the list of all possible guide RNA sequences in a given input DNA sequence and their potential off-target sites including bulge-type sites in a genome of choice. In addition, the program assigns an out-of-frame score to each target site to help users choose appropriate sites for gene knockout. Cas-Designer shows the results in an interactive table and provides user-friendly filter functions.", "paper_title": "Cas-Designer: a web-based tool for choice of CRISPR-Cas9 target sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000366630400024"}
