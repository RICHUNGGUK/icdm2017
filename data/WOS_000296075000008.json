After outlining the motivation behind noise-based computation schemes, we present a short summary of our ongoing efforts in the introduction, development and design of several noise-based deterministic multivalued logic schemes and elements. In particular, we describe classical, instantaneous, continuum, spike and random-telegraph-signal based schemes with applications such as circuits that emulate the brain's functioning and string verification via a slow communication channel.", "paper_title": "Noise-based Deterministic Logic and Computing: a Brief Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000296075000008"}
