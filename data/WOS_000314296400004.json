A partial Steiner (n, r, l)-system is complete if every set of l vertices is contained in exactly one edge. In a hypergraph H, the independence number alpha(H) denotes the maximum size of a set of vertices in H containing no edge. In this article we prove the following. Given integers r, l such that r >= 2l - 1 >= 3, we prove that there exists a partial Steiner (n, r, l)-system H such that alpha(H) less than or similar to (l - 1/r - 1(r)l)(1/r-1) n(r-l/r-1)(log n)(1/r-1) as n -> infinity. This improves earlier results of Phelps and Rodl, and Rodl and Sinajova. We conjecture that it is best possible as it matches the independence number of a random r-uniform hypergraph of the same density. If l = 2 or l = 3, then for infinitely many r the partial Steiner systems constructed are complete for infinitely many n.", "paper_title": "On the Independence Number of Steiner Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314296400004"}
