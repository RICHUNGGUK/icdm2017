Specifically, we focus on the approximation of the Jacobian pseudo inverse by the extended Jacobian algorithm. The algorithms are defined as certain dynamic systems driven by the task space error, and identified with vector field distributions. The distribution corresponding to the Jacobian pseudo inverse is non-integrable, while that associated with the extended Jacobian is integrable. Two methods of devising the approximating extended Jacobian algorithm are examined. The first method is referred to as differential geometric, and relies on the approximation of a non-integrable distribution (in fact: a codistribution) by an integrable one. As an alternative, the approximation problem has been formulated as the minimization of an approximation error functional, and solved using the methods of the calculus of variations. Performance of the obtained extended Jacobian inverse kinematics algorithms has been compared by means of computer simulations involving the kinematics model of the 7 dof industrial manipulator POLYCRANK. It is concluded that the differential geometric method offers a rapid, while the variational method a systematic tool for solving inverse kinematic problems.", "paper_title": "Approximation of Jacobian Inverse Kinematics Algorithms: Differential Geometric vs. Variational Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000310084800002"}
