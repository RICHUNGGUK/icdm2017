An automated procedure is introduced to perform the segmentation of the organs of the seedlings from the thermal contrasts in the images. Results of the automated procedure were assessed visually by expert operators in a separate procedure. This constitutes a new application of thermal imaging as a non invasive imaging providing functional information on the physiology of the seedlings. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
