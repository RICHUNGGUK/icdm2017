We establish the following two complementary results: 1) for an arbitrary memoryless network, among all distributed memoryless sources of a given correlation, Gaussian sources are least compressible, that is, they admit the smallest set of achievable distortion tuples and 2) for any memoryless source to be communicated over a memoryless additive-noise network, among all noise processes of a given correlation, Gaussian noise admits the smallest achievable set of distortion tuples. We establish these results constructively by showing how schemes for the corresponding Gaussian problems can be applied to achieve similar performance for (source or noise) distributions that are not necessarily Gaussian but have the same covariance.", "paper_title": "Network Compression: Worst Case Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000356301600020"}
