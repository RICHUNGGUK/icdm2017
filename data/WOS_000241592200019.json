These dynamic environments require new security paradigms and automatic mechanisms to minimize user intervention. Our goal is the definition of a new concept of distance that considers the current domain constraints and the user preferences. This paper addresses some of the problems of these complex environments by using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) techniques. We also propose collaborative mechanisms for automatic environment marking. Based on these ideas we have developed PervsIM, a decision mechanism that selects the most appropriate network or peer to interact with. Besides we have defined an embedded access control module which ensures that PervsIM decisions are followed by all applications. Furthermore, several simulation results and implementation details outline how these results can be incorporated in today's mobile devices.", "paper_title": "Context awareness in network selection for dynamic environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241592200019"}
