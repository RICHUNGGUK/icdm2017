In this paper, the operational times are modeled and introduced into the matrix system model to activate the matrix system functioning. Different types of time include parts input, for operations and processing, for resources arriving, and time for finished goods or products output are developed for designing manufacturing systems. Therefore, different time matrices Ts (i.e., T-u, T-v, T-r, T-y) are constructed in this paper. Those time matrices are the key factors for integrating the manufacturing systems to approach the real time manufacturing world. Here, the key procedure for developing those time matrices is to develop and integrate the manufacturing matrix framework with the techniques of max/plus algebra. The result of this paper is to introduce and establish time into the matrix manufacturing system to approach the real world production situation. System simulation is also provided in this paper to demonstrate the integration between matrix formulation and time matrices. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
