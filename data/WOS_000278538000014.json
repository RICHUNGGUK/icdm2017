First, we introduce the concepts of likelihood-based comparison relations for intervals. Then, we propose the concept of likelihood-based comparison relations for type-1 fuzzy sets and interval type-2 fuzzy sets. Then, we present a new method to rank fuzzy sets by using fuzzy targets based on the proposed likelihood-based comparison relations for fuzzy sets. Finally, we present a new fuzzy decision-making method based on the proposed likelihood-based comparison relations for fuzzy sets and the proposed fuzzy ranking method. The proposed fuzzy decision-making method has the advantage that the evaluated values can either be represented by crisp values, intervals, type-1 fuzzy sets or interval type-2 fuzzy sets. It can overcome the drawbacks of Huynh et al.'s method due to the fact that Huynh et al.'s method cannot deal with the ranking of interval type-2 fuzzy sets for fuzzy decision-making and cannot distinguish the ranking order between the alternatives in some situations.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Decision-Making Based on Likelihood-Based Comparison Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000278538000014"}
