The experiments were designed to investigate whether torque perception was determined by the spatial or by the temporal characteristics of the rotary switch. In Experiment I, manual detection thresholds of torque variation were measured with raised sinusoidal torque profiles that varied in spatial period from 2.8 degree to 180 degree per cycle. In Experiment II, the same was measured for torque profiles that varied in temporal frequency from 2 to 300 Hz. Experiment III was similar to Experiment 1 except that the participants were required to turn the rotary switch at two different speeds for each of seven spatially specified torque profiles (spatial period: 2.8 degree to 90 degree per cycle). A comparison of the thresholds obtained in Experiment III and those in Experiments I and II suggests that the detection of torque variations depends on the spatial, not temporal, specification of the torque profiles. Our results can potentially shed new light on the design and engineering specification of rotary switches.", "paper_title": "Manual Detection of Spatial and Temporal Torque Variation through a Rotary Switch", "paper_id": "WOS:000207898000003"}
