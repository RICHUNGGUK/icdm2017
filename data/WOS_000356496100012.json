Error-correcting codes (ECCs) can be used to achieve near-perfect reliability, but come at a high implementation cost especially when the underlying PUF is very noisy. When designing a PUF-based key generator, a more reliable PUF will result in a less complex ECC decoder and a smaller PUF footprint, and hence, an overall more efficient implementation. This paper proposes novel insight and resulting method for reducing noise on memory-based PRs, based on adapting supply voltage ramp-up time to ambient temperature. Circuit simulations on 45 nm low-power CMOS, as well as silicon measurements are presented to validate the proposed method. Our results demonstrate that choosing an appropriate voltage ramp-up for enrollment and adapting it according to the ambient temperature at key-reconstruction is a powerful method which makes memory-based PR noise up to 3x smaller. In addition, this paper investigates the competitiveness of integrating the proposed method in a commercial product; the investigation is done in two phases. First by determining the saved area, and second by implementing a circuit that maps the ambient temperature into an appropriate voltage ramp-up. The results show that the new system costs up to 82.1% less area while it delivers up to 3x higher reproducibility.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Voltage Ramp-Up Time Adaptation for Temperature Noise Reduction on Memory-Based PUF Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000356496100012"}
