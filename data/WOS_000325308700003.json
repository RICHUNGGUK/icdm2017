Let u be a vertex of G. A vertex v is called an i-neighbor of u if d(G)(u, v) = i. A 1-neighbor of u is simply called a neighbor of u. Let s and t be two nonnegative integers. Suppose f is an assignment of nonnegative integers to the vertices of G. If the following three conditions are satisfied, then f is called an (s, t)-relaxed L(2,1)-labeling of G: (I) for any two adjacent vertices u and v of G, f (u) not equal f(v); (2) for any vertex u of G, there are at most s neighbors of u receiving labels from {f (u) - 1, f (u) + 1}; (3) for any vertex u of G, the number of 2-neighbors of u assigned the label f (u) is at most t. The minimum span of (s, t)-relaxed L(2,1)-labelings of G is called the (s, t)-relaxed L(2,1)-labeling number of G, denoted by lambda(s,t)(2,1)(G). It is clear that lambda(0,0)(2,1)(G) is the so-called L(2,1)-labeling number of G. In this paper, the (s, t)-relaxed L(2,1)-labeling number of the square lattice is determined for each pair of two nonnegative integers s and t. And this provides a series of channel assignment schemes for the corresponding channel assignment problem on the square lattice. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
