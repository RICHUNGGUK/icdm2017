It outperforms conventional recurrent neural networks in the field of multivariate time series prediction. Often ESN works beautifully. But sometimes it works poorly because of ill-posed problem. To solve it, we propose a new model on the basis of ESNs, termed as fast subspace decomposition echo state network (FSDESN). The core of the model is to utilize fast subspace decomposition algorithm for extracting a compact subspace out of a redundant large-scale reservoir matrix in order to remove approximate collinear components, overcome the ill-posed problem, and improve generalization performance. Experimental results on two multivariate benchmark datasets substantiate the effectiveness and characteristics of FSDESN.", "paper_title": "Predicting Multivariate Time Series Using Subspace Echo State Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000351176000006"}
