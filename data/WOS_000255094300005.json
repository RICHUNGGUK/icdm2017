It can be applied in parameter analysis of structures, particularly with multiple variables, at which repeated calculations are required. The MD-AWE is proposed at first, and then an adaptive hopping technique similar to the complex frequency hopping (CFH) technique to expand the approximation region of MD-AWE is delivered, and this technique also helps to reduce the memory usage by taking lower order of MD-AWE. In the end, two examples are given with good results, which show the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.
