Our approach describes the behavior of the immune network proposed by Jerne and considers that the cell-cell interactions routine results in maintenance of memory in a dynamic equilibrium. The critical values of the concentrations of antigens for the validity of the model and a phases diagram with three different phases are also obtained. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
