The XY piezo stage is composed of two piezoelectric actuators within a leaf spring mechanism. The study applies two feedback controllers, a Proportional-Integral-Derivative controller and a repetitive controller, to achieve precision trajectory tracking and evaluate performance against benchmarks. Moreover, the investigation applies a double-feedforward compensation approach that integrates a Zero-Phase-Error-Tracking-Controller and an adaptive plant inversion compensator adapted by a Least-Mean-Square algorithm, based on an inverse Prandtl-Ishlinskii model, to improve tracking control performance further. Performance analysis and comparison of the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed control structure improves dynamic tracking accuracy of the XY piezo stage. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
