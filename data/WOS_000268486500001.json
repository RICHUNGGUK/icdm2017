Previous algorithms are based on multicommodity flows that take time (O) over tilde (m + n(2)). Our algorithm iteratively employs max- flow computations to embed an expander flow, thus providing a certificate of expansion. Our technique can also be extended to yield an O(log(2) n)-(pseudo-) approximation algorithm for the edge-separator problem with a similar running time.", "paper_title": "Graph Partitioning using Single Commodity Flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000268486500001"}
