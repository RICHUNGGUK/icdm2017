On the other hand in kernel tricks, a kernel maps data into a higher dimensional feature space where the resulting structure of the learning task is linearly separable, while the kernel is the inner product of this feature space and can also be viewed as a similarity function. It has been reported there is an overlap between family of kernels and collection of fuzzy similarity relations. This fact motivates the idea in this paper to use some kernels as fuzzy similarity relations and develop kernel based fuzzy rough sets. First, we consider Gaussian kernel and propose Gaussian kernel based fuzzy rough sets. Second we introduce parameterized attribute reduction with the derived model of fuzzy rough sets. Structures of attribute reduction are investigated and an algorithm with discernibility matrix to find all reducts is developed. Finally, a heuristic algorithm is designed to compute reducts with Gaussian kernel fuzzy rough sets. Several experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the idea.
