We propose partially precomputed A* (PPA*), which is much faster than A* at runtime, and uses much less memory than completely precalculating all shortest paths with an algorithm such as Floyd-Warshall. At runtime, PPA is very similar to A*, so it is simple and safe to integrate into existing video game code bases.", "paper_title": "Partially Precomputed A*", "paper_id": "WOS:000295473500003"}
