Occasionally, one requires that (d, k)-sequences do not contain a specific pattern w. Therefore, distribution results concerning pattern occurrence in (d, k)-sequences are of interest. In this paper we study the distribution of the waiting time until the r-th occurrence of a pattern w in a random (d, k)-sequence generated by a Markov source. Numerical examples are also provided.", "paper_title": "Waiting time distributions for pattern occurrence in a constrained sequence", "paper_id": "WOS:000253283600019"}
