The temptation to re-use these materials is very high. Even source codes are easily available through a simple search on the Web. There is a need of detecting potential instances of source code re-use. Source code re-use detection has usually been approached comparing source codes in their compiled version. When dealing with cross-language source code re-use, traditional approaches can deal only with the programming languages supported by the compiler. We assume that a source code is a piece of text, with its syntax and structure, so we aim at applying models for free text re-use detection to source code. In this paper we compare a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) approach with previously used text re-use detection models for measuring cross-language similarity in source code. The LSA-based approach shows slightly better results than the other models, being able to distinguish between re-used and related source codes with a high performance.", "paper_title": "Cross-Language Source Code Re-Use Detection Using Latent Semantic Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000376441500002"}
