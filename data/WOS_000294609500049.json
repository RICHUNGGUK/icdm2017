We first present a theory of heap decompositions that forms the basis of our approach; we then describe a full analysis algorithm that is fully symbolic and efficient. We demonstrate the precision and scalability of our approach for verification of real C and C++ programs.", "paper_title": "Precise and Compact Modular Procedure Summaries for Heap Manipulating Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000294609500049"}
