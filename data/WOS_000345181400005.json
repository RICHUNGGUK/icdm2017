So far, numerous applications and services have been proposed, such as retrieval service. The retrieval, however, faces a big challenge in IoT because the data belongs to different domains and user interaction with the surrounding environment is constrained. This paper proposes Acrost, a retrieval system based on topic discovery and semantic awareness in IoT environment. The initial contents with interesting information is obtained through the combination of two topic centric collectors. The metadata is extracted by aggregating regular expression-based and conditional random fields-based approaches. Moreover, the semantic-aware retrieval is achieved by parsing the query and ranking the relevance of contents. In addition, we present a case study on academic conference retrieval to validate the proposed approaches. Experimental results show that the proposed system can significantly improve the response time and efficiency of topic self-adaptive retrieval manner.
