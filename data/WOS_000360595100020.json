To adapt to new process states, these soft sensors require adaptation mechanisms. As the performance of adaptive soft sensors depends on the quality of its database and the size of which will have some upper limit, a database monitoring index (DMI) has been developed. Additional information is only added to the database if it has a sufficiently high DMI value. In this study, we propose a DMI optimization method and adaptive database management scheme. DMI hyperparameters are set automatically using an initial database, and the main database adapts to new process states by storing data with large prediction errors. Case studies using simulated and real industrial datasets confirm that the proposed scheme enables soft sensors to operate with high predictive accuracy over the long term. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
