The proposed architectures are extensions of 2-level reconfigurable architectures where the reconfiguration operations on the lowest level correspond to the reconfiguration operations of standard 1-level reconfigurable architectures. and the reconfigurable units are simple switches. It is shown that finding an optimal number of reconfiguration levels and a corresponding reconfiguration scheme that minimizes the number of reconfiguration bits for a given algorithm can be done in polynomial time. But finding the optimal number of reconfiguration levels is NP-hard for heterogeneous multi-level architectures, where the number of reconfiguration levels varies for the different reconfigurable units. Experimental results for different test applications show that 3-4 reconfiguration levels are optimal with respect to the number of reconfiguration bits needed. The number of reconfiguration bits is reduced by 35-86% compared to 1-level reconfiguration and by 8-34% compared to 2-level reconfiguration. The heterogeneous architecture reduces the number of necessary reconfiguration bits by additional 1-5% and also needs less SRAM cells. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
