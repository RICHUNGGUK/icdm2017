In the game, the MeNB controls and prices the available spectrum resource which the PeNBs can purchase and use to serve the Pico-cell as well as offload some macro-users. Both kinds of nodes try to maximize their own utility which is consisted of user data rates, earning and expenditures on spectrum trading. During the dynamic interaction of the game, the interference coordination features of the LTE-A SON, such as almost blank sub-frames (ABS) of enhanced inter-cell interference coordination (eICIC) and cell range expansion (CRE), are employed so that the change of spectrum allocation can be fully exploited. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve the throughput of victim users with slight network total throughput degradation.", "paper_title": "A Stackelberg Game Based Inter-tier Spectrum Sharing Scheme for LTE-A SON", "paper_id": "WOS:000360003900003"}
