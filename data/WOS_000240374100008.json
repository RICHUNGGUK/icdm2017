The geometry of the molecule has been optimized, infrared spectrum (vibrational modes and intensities) and the electronic properties of the molecule have been calculated in its ground state. It has been found that DPS molecule kinetically may not be stable however it is thermodynamically stable.", "paper_title": "Structural and electronic properties of dipropyl sulfide: A theoretical investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240374100008"}
