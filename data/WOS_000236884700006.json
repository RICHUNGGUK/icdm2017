In particular, we show that it is possible to have private exponents smaller than N-1/4 which are resistant to all known small private exponent attacks. This allows for instances of RSA with short CRT-exponents and short public exponents. In addition, the number of bits required to store the private key information can be significantly reduced in this variant.", "paper_title": "Another look at small RSA exponents", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884700006"}
