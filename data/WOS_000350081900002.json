A stability theorem for linear fractional-order systems with time delay is presented. And, a comparison theorem for a class of fractional-order systems with time delay is shown. The existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point for fractional-order Hopfield neural networks with time delay are proved. Furthermore, the global asymptotic stability conditions of fractional-order neural networks with time delay are obtained. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
