To extract critical factors of PRM evaluation and estimate relative weight among the criteria, the analytic network process (ANP) is utilised. In addition, we propose a heuristic-based approach, called GP-TBM, based on a hybrid of the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm by introducing the balance modulating (BM) mechanism to solving the mathematical model to find the optimal supply chain network pattern. In the GP-TBM, the parameters are designed by the Taguchi method. Finally, a case of a {4-3-3-3} supply chain network structure is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, and GP-TBM compared with standard PSO and GA. The empirical analysis results demonstrate GP-TBM is superior to standard PSO and GA in the proposed supply chain planning problems.", "paper_title": "Unbalanced supply chain design using the analytic network process and a hybrid heuristic-based algorithm with balance modulating mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000308614200004"}
