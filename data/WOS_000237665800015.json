We use the Floresta Sinta(c)tica with the Bikel multi-lingual parsing engine and evaluate performance on both PARSEVAL and unlabeled dependencies. We explore several configurations, both in terms of parameterizing the parser and in terms of enhancements to the trees used for training the parser. Our best configuration achieves 80.6% dependency accuracy on unseen test material, well above adjacency baselines and on par with previous results for unlabeled dependencies.", "paper_title": "Adaptation of data and models for probabilistic parsing of Portuguese", "paper_id": "WOS:000237665800015"}
