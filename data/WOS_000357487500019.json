The key motivation of this paper is to develop a new hybrid, particle-based simulation that inherits advantages from both powerful finite element methods and popular mesh-free methods, while overcoming certain disadvantages of both types of methods. Our method stems from two novel aspects: (1) a physical model built upon an improved mechanical framework and the adaptive smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), an improved variant of traditional SPH, which can handle complicated anisotropic elastic behaviors with little extra cost; and (2) a hybrid, adaptive particle system that serves for more accurate fracture modeling with richer details. At the physical level, in order to facilitate better control during the formation of fracture and improve its time performance, we develop a physical framework based on contact mechanics and adopt the stress and energy analysis on the anisotropic SPH numerical integration to pinpoint fracture generation and propagation. At the geometric level, in order to reduce time consumption and enhance accuracy in rigid dynamics and fracture generation, we employ hybrid, fully adaptive particles in the vicinity of fracture regions via geometric subdivision. Our novel approach can facilitate the user to control the generation of cracks with low computational cost and retain high-fidelity crack details during animation. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the controllability, effectiveness, and accuracy of our method when simulating various brittle fracture patterns for anisotropic materials.", "paper_title": "Novel adaptive SPH with geometric subdivision for brittle fracture animation of anisotropic materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500019"}
