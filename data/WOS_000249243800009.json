Although bound-constrained optimization has been studied extensively in both theory and practice, so far no study has formally applied its techniques to NME In this letter, we propose two projected gradient methods for NMF, both of which exhibit strong optimization properties. We discuss efficient implementations and demonstrate that one of the proposed methods converges faster than the popular multiplicative update approach. A simple Matlab code is also provided.", "paper_title": "Projected gradient methods for nonnegative matrix factorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243800009"}
