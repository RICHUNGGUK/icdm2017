While most of these models are based on the solutions to some approximate forms of the fully 1D St. Venant equations, it is desirable to have a 1D code that can deal with those highly dynamic and complex flows under certain flood conditions, with full consideration of the convective and source terms. This paper therefore presents a Godunov-type alternative for solving the 1D inhomogeneous shallow water equations with complex source terms. The model is also implemented with a wetting and drying condition to avoid producing negative water depth. The proposed model is validated by a selection of steady and transient hydraulic problems with reference solutions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
