Our aim is to help automate this often tedious task. We compute the map by optimizing the compatibility of corresponding warped image neighborhoods using an adaptation of structural similarity. The optimization is regularized by a thin-plate spline and may be guided by a few user-drawn points. We parameterize the map over a halfway domain and show that this representation offers many benefits. The map is able to treat the image pair symmetrically, model simple occlusions continuously, span partially overlapping images, and define extrapolated correspondences. Moreover, it enables direct evaluation of the morph in a pixel shader without mesh rasterization. We improve the morphs by optimizing quadratic motion paths and by seamlessly extending content beyond the image boundaries. We parallelize the algorithm on a GPU to achieve a responsive interface and demonstrate challenging morphs obtained with little effort.", "paper_title": "Automating Image Morphing Using Structural Similarity on a Halfway Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000342894500008"}
