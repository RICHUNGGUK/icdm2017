Design/methodology/approach - Sampling of air gap field solution data allows for a Fourier decomposition of magnetic forces and flux densities. A two-dimensional convolution gives insight into the spectral decomposition of forces responsible for acoustic noise, vibration and higher torque harmonics. Findings - The proposed approach seems especially suitable for synchronous machine models. The influence of magnetic circuit design parameters that are difficult to calculate analytically on the harmonic air gap content can be analyzed and the spectral force decomposition illustrated by means of space vectors. Originality/value - The approach is generalized to the convolution and analysis of arbitrarily sampled two-dimensional data in this paper.", "paper_title": "Convolution approach for analysis of magnetic forces in electrical machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800015"}
