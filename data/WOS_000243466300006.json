Most existing routing and MAC protocols consider homogeneous ad hoc networks, in which all nodes are modeled as the same, i.e., they have the same communication capabilities and characteristics. Although a homogeneous network model is simple and easy to analyze, it misses important characteristics of many realistic MANETs such as military battlefield ad hoc networks. In addition, a homogeneous ad hoc network suffers from poor performance and scalability. In many ad hoc networks, multiple types of nodes do co-exist; and some nodes have larger transmission power, higher transmission data rate, and better processing capability, are more reliable and robust than other nodes. Hence, a hybrid network model is more realistic and provides many advantages for designing better routing and MAC protocols. In this paper, we present a new routing protocol called Hybrid Routing, which is specifically designed for hybrid MANETs. In addition, a novel MAC protocol is jointly designed for hybrid MANETs. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed routing MAC protocols have very good performance.", "paper_title": "Joint design of routing and medium access control for hybrid mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243466300006"}
