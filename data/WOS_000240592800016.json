We argue that the two schemes need to be treated as a single scheme to securely provide the PEKS service that BDOP envisioned. We formally define such a scheme, which we call \"PKE/PEKS\" and its security against chosen ciphertext attack, which we call \"IND-PKE/PEKS-CCA\". We then construct a highly efficient PKE/PEKS scheme using the PEKS scheme presented by BDOP and a variation of ElGamal encryption scheme and show that it is IND-PKE/PEKS-CCA secure in the random oracle model assuming that the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem is intractable. We also propose a generic construction of PKE/PEKS, which is slightly less efficient than the first one. Finally, we present two extensions of a PKE/PEKS scheme to the multi-receiver setting and multi-keyword setting.", "paper_title": "On the integration of public key data encryption and public key encryption with keyword search", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800016"}
