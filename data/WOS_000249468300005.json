In this paper, we study intersection-closed classes that contain the concepts invariant under an operation satisfying a certain algebraic condition. We give a learning algorithm in the exact model with equivalence queries for such classes. This algorithm utilizes a novel encoding scheme, which we call a signature. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
