It is based on the knowledge of the hydrodynamic limit of the model considered, but is able to compute solutions for either dilute or dense regimes. Several applications are presented for Boltzmann-like equations. This method is particularly efficient for numerical simulations of the granular gases equation with dissipative energy: it allows to study accurately the long time behavior of this equation and is very well suited for the study of clustering phenomena.
