Lifetime is one of the most important considerations for WSNs due to their inherent energy constraints, and various protocols have been proposed to overcome these difficulties. This study proposes a novel distributed reclustering routing protocol: Predictive and Adaptive Routing Protocol using Energy Welfare (PARPEW). PARPEW incorporates the concept of energy welfare (EW) to achieve both energy efficiency and energy balance simultaneously. PARPEW is equipped with a cluster head (CH) shift mechanism that utilizes predictive energy after transmission for the computation of EW. The average case time complexity of the shift mechanism belongs to O(vertical bar C vertical bar(2)), where vertical bar C vertical bar is the average number of sensors in a cluster in the WSN. Experimental results demonstrate that the new protocol is capable of significantly prolonging the lifetime of WSNs under various scenarios.", "paper_title": "A Distributed Reclustering Hierarchy Routing Protocol Using Social Welfare in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303766400001"}
