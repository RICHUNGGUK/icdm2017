We first formulate upwind and symmetric schemes for hyperbolic equations with non-conservative terms. Then we propose upwind numerical schemes for conservative and non-conservative systems, based on a Riemann solver, the initial conditions of which are evolved non-linearly in time, prior to a simple linearization that leads to closed-form solutions. The Riemann solver is easily applied to complicated hyperbolic systems. Finally, as an example, we formulate conservative schemes for the three-dimensional Euler equations for general compressible materials and give numerical results for a variety of test problems for ideal gases in one and two space dimensions.
