Our enhancement of the PROMETHEE with intuitionistic fuzzy set, named IF-PROMETHEE, takes not only intuitionistic fuzzy preferences, but also intuitionistic fuzzy weights into account. Two practical examples are carried out to illustrate the applicability and efficiency of our proposed method in solving multi-criteria decision making problems. The first example concerning the evaluation of alternative energy exploitation projects shows that IF-PROMETHEE can depict more comprehensive preference information than PROMETHEE and F-PROMETHEE. The second example further illustrates the application of IF-PROMETHEE.", "paper_title": "Multi-criteria decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy PROMETHEE", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424500011"}
