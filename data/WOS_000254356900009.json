One of the solutions is the use of mobile ad-hoe networks (MANET). In this paper, we consider the situation in a building after a big fire, explosion or earthquake. Rescue workers equipped with PDAs, which are wireless connected, explore the dynamically changing world. Each individual builds up a local world map based on their local exploration and observation. The local maps are fused via the MANET structure and provide an up to date map of the dynamically changing world. Such maps can be used for mitigation, escape or rescue work.", "paper_title": "Fusion of local maps in mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254356900009"}
