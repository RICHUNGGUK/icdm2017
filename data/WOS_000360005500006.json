In this article, we present a survey of different techniques for fast visualization of IS. The main classes of visualization algorithms are identified along with the advantages of each in the context of the different types of IS commonly used in computer graphics. We focus closely on polygonization methods, as they are the most suited to fast visualization. Classification and comparison of existing approaches are presented using criteria extracted from current research. This enables the identification of the best strategies according to the number of specific requirements, such as speed, accuracy, quality, or stylization.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Implicit Surface Polygonization", "paper_id": "WOS:000360005500006"}
