In this article, we present the result of such an opportunity in the form of a methodology and software that is currently used by the Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service in France. Furthermore, this tool may be used in conjunction with other GIS-MCDA applications with a single decision maker, multiple decision makers or even where the decision has a hierarchical structure.", "paper_title": "MODEL: a multicriteria ordinal evaluation tool for GIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361190600010"}
