Compared to most existing fuzzy co-clustering algorithms, FCR is able to generate fuzzy word clusters that capture the natural distribution of words, which may be beneficial for information retrieval. We discuss the principle behind the algorithm through some theoretical discussions and illustrations. These, together with experiments on two standard datasets show that FCR can discover the naturally existing document-word co-clusters. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
