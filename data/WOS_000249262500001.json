To address this problem, a kind of serial algorithm was developed to generate viewshed on large grid-based digital elevation models (DEMs). We first divided the whole DEM into rectangular blocks in row and column directions (called block partitioning), then processed these blocks with four axes followed by four sectors sequentially. When processing the particular block, we adopted the ' reference plane' algorithm to calculate the visibility of the target point on the block, and adjusted the calculation sequence according to the different spatial relationships between the block and the viewpoint since the viewpoint is not always inside the DEM. By adopting the ' Reference Plane' algorithm and using a block partitioning method to segment and load the DEM dynamically, it is possible to generate viewshed efficiently in PC-based environments. Experiments showed that the divided block should be dynamically loaded whole into computer main memory when partitioning, and the suggested approach retains the accuracy of the reference plane algorithm and has near linear compute complexity.", "paper_title": "A partition-based serial algorithm for generating viewshed on massive DEMs", "paper_id": "WOS:000249262500001"}
