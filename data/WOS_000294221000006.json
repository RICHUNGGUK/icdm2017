The proposed fractional step method is a first-order accurate scheme, named semi-incremental fractional step method, which is a general form of the previous first-order fractional step methods, i.e. non-incremental and incremental schemes. One of the most important advantages of the proposed scheme is its capability to use large time step sizes for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. DLSM method uses moving least-squares shape functions for function approximation and discrete least-squares technique for discretization of the governing differential equations and their boundary conditions. As there is no need for a background mesh, the DLSM method can be called a truly meshless method and enjoys symmetric and positive-definite properties. Several numerical examples are used to demonstrate the ability and the efficiency of the proposed scheme and the discrete least-squares meshless method. The results are shown to compare favorably with those of the previously published works.
