Although the issue of user anonymity has been addressed in digital signature field by introducing the concepts of ring and group signatures, they are not suitable to anonymously authenticate a user in wireless mobile applications, because these signature schemes need infrastructure support and heavy computational costs which is beyond the computational ability of a smart card embedded in a hand-held device. In this paper, we propose an anonymous authentication scheme which also supports Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Our scheme is very efficient since it mainly uses hash and XOR operations. Moreover, our scheme possesses many good virtues of existing authentication schemes.", "paper_title": "Efficient password-based authentication and key exchange scheme preserving user privacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000045"}
