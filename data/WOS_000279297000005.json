In the increasingly mobile environment of today, multimedia query formats need to be applicable to mobile devices, which, compared to desktop PCs, have specific limitations such as small screen size, limited memory and processing power and high bandwidth cost. As a potential solution to multimedia querying in mobile environments, this paper introduces two concepts: query streaming and its application as targeted browsing. Targeted browsing is a technique for multimedia query-by-content designed especially for mobile devices while query streaming is a method for continually updating a query by sending additional terms to an existing query. This paper describes an implementation of query streaming that combines the Multimedia Query Format (MQF) (a standard communication language for querying multimedia databases) with Fragment Request Units (FRU) and Fragment Update Units (FUU) (which provide a standard way of randomly accessing fragments of XML documents). For efficient compression of the multimedia query XML files, the use of binary compression using MPEG BiM is proposed and a number of use case scenarios are examined. Results show that the proposed solution to provide a significant reduction in the file size required to perform multimedia querying. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
