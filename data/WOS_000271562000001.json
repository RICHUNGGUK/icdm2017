A framework and an algorithm for general loss functions are presented. and the flexibility of the approach is indicated by some examples, showcasing the ease with which the method can handle application-specific loss functions. Both didactical examples and real-life applications are provided, using the zero-one, the L1 and the squared loss functions, as well as combinations thereof. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
