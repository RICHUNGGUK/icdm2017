The method generalizes the \"trimming\" technique of Megiddo [5] in a nontrivial way. This result allows an improved O(n log n) time algorithm for the weighted 3-center and 4-center problems.", "paper_title": "An optimal algorithm for the continuous/discrete weighted 2-center problem in trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000236886100019"}
