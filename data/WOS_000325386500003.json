This obliges the user to deal with simple thresholds and impedes her/him from evaluating the mined subgraphs by defining different \"goodness\" (i.e., multiobjective) criteria regarding the characteristics of the subgraphs. In previous papers, we defined a multiobjective GBDM framework to perform bi-objective graph mining in terms of sub-graph support and size maximization. Two different search methods were considered with this aim, a multiobjective beam search and a multiobjective evolutionary programming (MOEP). In this contribution, we extend the latter formulation to a three-objective framework by incorporating another classical graph mining objective, the subgraph diameter. The proposed MOEP method for multiobjective GBDM is tested on five synthetic and real-world datasets and its performance is compared against single and multiobjective subgraph mining approaches based on the classical Subdue technique in GBDM. The results highlight the application of multiobjective subgraph mining allows us to discover more diversified subgraphs in the objective space. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
