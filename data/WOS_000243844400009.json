The technique is based on the state space representation of quasi-static models. Fault diagnosability characterises the faults that can be discriminated using the available sensors in a system. The method can be used to select the minimum set of sensors that guarantee discriminability of an anticipated set of faults. The approach is applied on a two-tanks system benchmark and is compared to a diagnosability analysis method based on structural analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
