We employ the value at risk (VaR) and expected shortfall (ES) as proxies for the extreme risk inherent from trading a bond position. In particular, we concern ourselves with the average tail behavior of the real-world profit/loss distribution for a bond position. We investigate the risk behaviors of a bond position under some stochastic interest rate models including the Merton model, the Vasicek model, and the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model.
