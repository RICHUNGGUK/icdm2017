Numerical investigations have been carried out for different heights and positions of the bi-partition at Reynolds number of 250. Key computational issues involved are the computation of fluid forces acting on the square cylinder, the vortex shedding frequency and the impact of such bluff body on the flow pattern. A particular attention is paid to drag and lift coefficients on the square cylinder. The predicted results from MRT-LBE simulations show that in most cases, the interaction was beneficial insofar as the drag of the square block was lower with the bi-partition than without it. Fluctuating side forces due to vortex shedding from the main body were also reduced for most bi-partition positions.
