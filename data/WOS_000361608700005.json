A flexible and extendible control strategy is applied for smart charging and discharging of energy storage elements to lower the operational cost of energy storage elements and reduce the peak load of the smart gird. A Multi-Agent System (MAS) was developed according to the industrial standards for providing a plug and play platform for managing distributed and moving energy storage elements. Short-term management of energy storage elements is mathematically formulated as a nonlinear mixed-integer optimization problem. An intelligent energy management strategy was implemented on the multi-agent system to provide short-term energy storage requirements in smart grid. Simulation outcomes show the potential capability of the multi- agent system approach for managing distributed and moving energy storage systems in smart grid and effectiveness of the proposed control and management strategy.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent system for managing distributed energy storage and electrical vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000361608700005"}
