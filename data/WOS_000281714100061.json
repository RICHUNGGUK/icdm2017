Networks are defined as a collection of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) LIGAND reactions with an optional associated Enzyme Classification (EC) number for each reaction. Additional custom reactions can be defined by the user. Reactions within the network can be assigned flux constraints and compartmentalization is supported for each reaction in addition to the support for reactions that occur across compartment boundaries. Exported networks are fully SBML L2V4 compatible with an optional L2V1 export for compatibility with old versions of the COBRA toolbox.", "paper_title": "MetNetMaker: a free and open-source tool for the creation of novel metabolic networks in SBML format", "paper_id": "WOS:000281714100061"}
