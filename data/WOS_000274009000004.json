The approach enables people and devices to discover and connect with communication partners based on their co-locations. It also provides non-smart objects, including home appliances, everyday objects, and places, with virtual counterparts, which both represent them and work as proxies for their targets. We present the design for this approach and describe its implementation and applications.", "paper_title": "Location-aware communications in smart environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000274009000004"}
