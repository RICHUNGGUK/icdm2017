Design/methodology/approach - The approach is an in-depth investigation of the information-processing infrastructure underlying the value chain activities. Findings - This study leads to the process-wide information organism approach and further delivers a business process analysis framework for describing and measuring mechanisms of managing the information flow underlying the strategic business process. Originality/value - The information-processing infrastructure underlying the value chain and thus the business process has been identified, and an analytical framework for describing and measuring mechanisms of managing the information flow underlying the strategic business process has been proposed.", "paper_title": "The process-wide information organism approach for the business process analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241397100012"}
