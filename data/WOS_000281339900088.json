This approach drastically reduces the number of points supplied by the GPS device and it permits a \"support-map\" to be generated in which the main characteristics of the trips for each user are taken into account. Hence, in contrast with other similar approaches, total independence from a street-map database is achieved. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
