Text fields are transformed into a special knowledge representation named AP-structure based on the Apriori algorithm of the mining area. Once the abstract data type is obtained, the text fields can be summarized, mined, and queried in a easy way. The operations to query these fields are the main aim of this paper.", "paper_title": "Enhancing short text retrieval in databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000052"}
