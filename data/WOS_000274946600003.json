These graphs are generalizations of the alternating group graph AG(n). We look at the case when the 3-cycles form a \"tree-like structure,\" and analyze its fault resiliency. We present a number of structural theorems and prove that even with linearly many vertices deleted, the remaining graph has a large connected component containing almost all vertices.
