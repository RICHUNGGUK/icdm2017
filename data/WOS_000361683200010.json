Besides, e-beam direct write is being pursued as an alternative solution for chip production in the sub-22 nm regime. To improve the throughput of e-beam lithography, character projection method is commonly employed and a critical problem is to pack as many useful characters as possible onto the stencil. In this paper, we consider three enhancements in packed stencil design over previous works. First, the fact that the pattern of a character can be located anywhere within its enclosing projection region is exploited to facilitate flexible blank space sharing. Second, the use of multiple shaping apertures with different sizes is explored. Third, the use of overlapping shots for printing some characters is investigated. For the packed stencil design problem with flexible blank space sharing and multiple shaping apertures, two dynamic programming-based algorithms are proposed, one allows overlapping shots and the other does not. Experimental results show that the proposed enhancement and the associated algorithms can significantly reduce the total shot count and hence improve the throughput of e-beam lithography.", "paper_title": "Flexible Packed Stencil Design With Multiple Shaping Apertures and Overlapping Shots for E-beam Lithography", "paper_id": "WOS:000361683200010"}
