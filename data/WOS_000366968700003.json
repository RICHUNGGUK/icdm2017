The protocol is implemented by Microsoft Corporation based on ITU-T T.120 family protocols. The major advantage distinguishing the RDP from other remote desktop schemes, such as the frame-buffer approach, is that the protocol is based on preferably sending graphic device interface (GDI) information from a server, instead of full bitmap images. This paper proposes a remote collaboration system based, designed and implemented on RDP architecture. The proposed system consisting of a cross control scheme with bus re-encryption architecture provides the full capabilities of all remote collaborations, such as remote control, application access and sharing among all RDP clients. In addition, it provides the RDP packets recording and replaying scheme to for replaying all of the detailed tracks through which a multiparty conference traveled. The performance modeling and evaluation show the practicality of the system and that it offers a scalable model for modern cloud services.", "paper_title": "Design and Performance Modeling of an Efficient Remote Collaboration System", "paper_id": "WOS:000366968700003"}
