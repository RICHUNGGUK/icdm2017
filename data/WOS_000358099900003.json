Among various non-destructive assessing methods, the feasibility of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system was investigated in this paper. Hyperspectral images of beef samples were collected in an abattoir production line and used for predicting the beef tenderness and pH value. Support vector machine (SVM) was applied to construct the prediction equation. Before utilizing the original HSI spectral profiles directly, we propose to use singular spectrum analysis (SSA) as a pre-processing approach, where SSA has been proven to be an effective technique for time-series analysis in diverse applications. The results indicate that SSA can remove the instrumental noise of HSI system effectively and therefore improve the prediction performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
