HRV series can be derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals obtained from single-night polysomnography (PSG) recordings. Conventionally, the HRV spectral features are extracted from the spectrum of an HRV series with fixed boundaries specifying bands of very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), and high frequency (HF). However, because they are fixed, they may fail to accurately reflect certain aspects of autonomic nervous activity which in turn may limit their discriminative power, e.g. in sleep and wake classification. This is in part related to the fact that the sympathetic tone (partially reflected in the LF band) and the respiratory activity (modulated in the HF band) vary over time. In order to minimize the impact of these variations, we adapt the HRV spectral boundaries using time-frequency analysis. Experiments were conducted on a data set acquired from two groups with 15 healthy and 15 insomnia subjects each. Results show that adapting the HRV spectral features significantly increased their discriminative power when classifying sleep and wake. Additionally, this method also provided a significant improvement of the overall classification performance when used in combination with other HRV non-spectral features. Furthermore, compared with the use of actigraphy, the classification performed better when combining it with the HRV features.", "paper_title": "Spectral Boundary Adaptation on Heart Rate Variability for Sleep and Wake Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000336744300004"}
