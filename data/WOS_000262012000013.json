It was validated up to 20 GHz using measured performance parameters of more than 70 single-ended and differentially driven spirals covering 0.2- to 8.3 nH inductance values. Excellent accuracy, full geometrical scalability, compactness and high capability for implementation in circuit simulators promote the proposed model as a reliable time-saving design tool. Two circuital example, i.e., 5-GHz down-converter and 10-GHz VCO, are also presented to demonstrate its use in practical cases. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
