For this purpose, the authors have implemented two models of pedestrian dynamics: continuous Social Forces model and discrete, cellular automata-based Social Distances model. The presented simulations refer to outdoor, large-area pedestrian movement.", "paper_title": "Discrete vs. Continuous Approach in Crowd Dynamics Modeling Using GPU Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000329154400002"}
