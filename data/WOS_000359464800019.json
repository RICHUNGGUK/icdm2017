In this letter, an efficient partial single relay selection scheme is proposed for wireless communications. The conventional schemes such as the best harmonic mean and the threshold-based relay selection should know channel state informaion (CSI), or noise variance at all stations in advance. But the proposed scheme does not require any priori information. It uses a characteristic of the repeated signal pattern at candidates of the relay station. Simulation results show that the performance of proposed scheme is very close to the best harmonic mean relay selection scheme as one of the optimal relay selection schemes.", "paper_title": "Efficient Partial Single Relay Selection Scheme forWireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464800019"}
