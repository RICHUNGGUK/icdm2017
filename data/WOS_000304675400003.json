This paper proposes an efficient secret sharing scheme for secret image. The protocol allows each participant to share a secret gray image with the rest of participants. In our scheme, a secret digital image is divided into n pieces, which are further distributed into n participants. The secret digital image can be reconstructed if and only if r or more legal participants cooperate together. These schemes have no pixel expansion. It is general in nature and can be applied on any image size. The proposed scheme is based on the chaotic map and the Chinese Remainder theorem. The security of the scheme is analyzed and the protocol is proven to be secure and be able to resist statistic and exhaustive attacks.", "paper_title": "SECRET IMAGE SHARING BASED ON CHAOTIC MAP AND CHINESE REMAINDER THEOREM", "paper_id": "WOS:000304675400003"}
