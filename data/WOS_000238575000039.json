The interest is associated with his navigation patterns. The interest navigation patterns represent different interest of the users. In this paper, hybrid Markov model is proposed for interest navigation pattern discovery. The novel model is better in prediction overlay rate and prediction correct rate than traditional Markov models. User group interest is also defined in this paper. The probability of user group interest navigation from one page to another is computed by navigation path characteristics and time characteristics. Compared with the previous ones, the results of the experiment show that the performance is improved efficiently by the hybrid Markov model.", "paper_title": "Mining interest navigation patterns based on hybrid Markov model", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000039"}
