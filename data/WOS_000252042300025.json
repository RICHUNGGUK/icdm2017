Simulations of three two-dimensional test problems are presented and in each case we analyze the energy of the magnetic field as it evolves towards its equilibrium state. Our numerical results highlight the accuracy and efficiency of the ELLAM approach for convection-dominated problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
