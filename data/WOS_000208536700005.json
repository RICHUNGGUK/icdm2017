One of these challenges is the creation of such kind of interfaces, which is currently being tackled by the OpenInterface project. The other challenge is related to the lack of experience of evaluating multimodal interfaces, which raises the question of how to check usability in such interfaces. In this context, this paper presents a new contribution to the OpenInterface project by adding data glove support, which is illustrated by prototyping a viewer for large size images. This application is also presented as a case study for usability evaluation, trying to translate our experience of multiple evaluations conducted at our VR lab.", "paper_title": "Prototyping and evaluating glove-based multimodal interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000208536700005"}
