Comm., 11 (2006), 1-7]. Recently, Mursaleen and Edely [On the invariant mean and statistical convergence, Appl. Math. Letters, 22 (2009) 1700-1704] used the concept of invariant mean and density to study some new type of convergence methods. In this paper we generalize these two methods by using the concept of ideal convergence and invariant mean. Further we apply our method to prove a Korovkin type approximation theorem along with an example in support of our result.", "paper_title": "I-Summability and I-approximation through invariant mean", "paper_id": "WOS:000300530000007"}
