The experimental data stored in this warehouse are heterogeneous, they may be imprecise, the data warehouse itself is incomplete by nature. The MIEL++ system - which is partially commercialized - is composed of three databases which are queried simultaneously, and which are expressed in three different data models: the relational model, the Conceptual Graph model and XML. Those models have been extended in order to allow the representation of fuzzy values. In the MIEL++ language, used to query the data warehouse, the end-users can express preferences in their queries by means of fuzzy sets. Fuzzy pattern matching techniques are used in order to compare preferences and imprecise values.", "paper_title": "The MIEL plus plus architecture when RDB, CGs and XML meet for the sake of risk assessment in food products", "paper_id": "WOS:000239625500011"}
