In this study they extend earlier work by using a performability model to track resource usage and resource failures. Results from the transient Markov chain analysis are used to estimate the software reliability at a given system execution time.", "paper_title": "Automated generation of test cases using a performability model", "paper_id": "WOS:000289459800002"}
