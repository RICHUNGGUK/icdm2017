In this paper we focus on the relationship between regular circular languages and languages generated by finite circular splicing systems. We survey the known results towards a characterization of the intersection between these two classes and provide new contributions on the open problem of finding this characterization. First, we exhibit a non-regular circular language generated by a circular simple system thus disproving a known result in this area. Then we give new results related to a restrictive class of circular splicing systems, the marked systems. Precisely, we review in a graph theoretical setting the recently obtained characterization of marked systems generating regular circular languages. In particular, we define a slight variant of marked systems, that is the g-marked systems, and we introduce the graph associated with a g-marked system. We show that a g-marked system generates a regular circular language if and only if its associated graph is a cograph. Furthermore, we prove that the class of g-marked systems generating regular circular languages is closed under a complement operation applied to systems. We also prove that marked systems with self-splicing generate only regular circular languages.", "paper_title": "On the regularity of circular splicing languages: a survey and new developments", "paper_id": "WOS:000278267300009"}
