The area is the region bounded by the path and the x-axis. We first establish a bijection between the area of paths in M-k(n) supercript stop and some lattice paths of length n+1. Then, by using a rejection technique, we obtain a linear algorithm with an average time complexity (k mod 2 +1)(n+1).", "paper_title": "Non uniform random generation of generalized Motzkin paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000236641300004"}
