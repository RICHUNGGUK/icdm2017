However, the role of representations in dynamic environments has been largely neglected so far. In this paper, we empirically compaxe and analyze three different representations on the basis of a dynamic multi-dimensional knapsack problem. Our results indicate that indirect representations are particularly suitable for the dynamic multi-dimensional knapsack problem, because they implicitly provide a heuristic adaptation mechanism that improves the current solutions after a change.", "paper_title": "The role of representations in dynamic knapsack problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900074"}
