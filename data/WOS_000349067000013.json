In this paper, a fast-updated high-utility-pattern trees for transaction deletion (FUHUP-DEL) algorithm is proposed to handle transaction deletion for efficiently updating discovered high utility itemsets in decremental mining. The HUP-tree structure is adopted in the proposed algorithm for reducing the computations of re-scan database in a level-wise way. Experiments show that the proposed FUHUP-DEL algorithm outperforms the batch two-phase approach.", "paper_title": "A Fast Updated High Utility Pattern Trees for Transaction Deletion", "paper_id": "WOS:000349067000013"}
