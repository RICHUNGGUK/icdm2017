Its dual constructs a high entropy distribution upon which weak learners and training labels are uncorrelated. This manuscript studies this primal-dual relationship under a broad family of losses, including the exponential loss of AdaBoost and the logistic loss, revealing: Weak learnability aids the whole loss family: for any epsilon > 0, O(ln(1/epsilon)) iterations suffice to produce a predictor with empirical risk epsilon-close to the infimum; The circumstances granting the existence of an empirical risk minimizer may be characterized in terms of the primal and dual problems, yielding a new proof of the known rate O(ln(1/epsilon)); Arbitrary instances may be decomposed into the above two, granting rate O(1/epsilon), with a matching lower bound provided for the logistic loss.", "paper_title": "A Primal-Dual Convergence Analysis of Boosting", "paper_id": "WOS:000303772100004"}
