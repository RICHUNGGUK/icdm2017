When each road is a double lane, the model only exists in three conflict points among three directions of flows. We introduce three-phase traffic signal and two types of signal controlling strategies, i.e. fixed signal phase order as well as adaptive signal phase order strategy, to control the traffic flow at the intersection. The phase diagram, the capacity and the average travel time of the system are investigated and compared under both strategies. The simulation results show that the traffic adaptive signal strategy is better than the fixed signal phase order strategy.", "paper_title": "TRAFFIC FLOW AT A SIGNAL CONTROLLED T-SHAPED INTERSECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088500010"}
