This work describes a methodology that enables the architect to directly interact with the encoding of designs they find aesthetically pleasing. Broadening interaction beyond simple evaluation increases the amount of feedback and bias a user can apply to the search. Increased feedback will have the effect of directing the algorithm to more fruitful areas of the search space. We conduct trials on two interfaces for making localised changes to a design in order to evaluate if the user is capable of directing search. In addition, an examination of the locality of changes made by the users provides an insight into how they explore the search space. The results show that a suitably designed interface is capable of directing search and that the participants used different magnitudes of change during directed search.", "paper_title": "A methodology for user directed search in evolutionary design", "paper_id": "WOS:000320392000002"}
