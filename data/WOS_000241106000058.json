By defining the distance of a linguistic preference relation to the set of consistent linguistic preference relations, we present a consistency index of linguistic preference relations and develop a consistency measure method for linguistic preference relations. This method is performed to ensure that the decision maker is being neither random nor illogical in his or her pairwise comparisons using the linguistic label set. At last, we discuss two consistency properties on group decision making using linguistic preference relations. These properties are of vital importance for group decision making with linguistic preference relations.", "paper_title": "Consistency measures of linguistic preference relations and its properties in group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000058"}
