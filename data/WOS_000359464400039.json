One is that the scheme is selectively secure. The other is that the time of decryption is long. To address these problems, we present a method of converting a predicate encryption supporting inner product (IPE) scheme into a PKMDRQ scheme. By taking advantage of this approach, an instance is also proposed. The comparison between the previous work and ours shows that our scheme is more efficient over the time complexity. Moreover, our scheme is adaptively secure.", "paper_title": "Approach for Constructing Public Key Encryption with Multi-Dimensional Range Query", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400039"}
