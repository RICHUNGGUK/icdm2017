Given that such content may originate from 'notseen thus far' data collections and/or data sources, the challenging issue is to achieve the return of investment on existing services, adapting to new information without changing existing business-logic implementation. To address this need, we introduce DOLAR (Data Object Language And Runtime), a service-neutral framework which virtualizes the information space to avoid invasive, time-consuming, and expensive source-code extensions that frequently break applications. Specifically, DOLAR automates the introduction of new business-logic objects in terms of the proposed virtual 'content objects'. Such user-specified virtual objects align to storage artifacts and help realize uniform 'store-to-user' data flows atop heterogeneous sources, while offering the reverse 'user-to-store' flows with identical effectiveness and ease of use. In addition, the suggested virtual object composition schemes help decouple business logic from any content origin, storage and/or structural details, allowing applications to support novel types of items without modifying their service provisions. We expect that content-rich applications will benefit from our approach and demonstrate how DOLAR has assisted in the cost-effective development and gradual expansion of a production-quality digital library. Experimentation shows that our approach imposes minimal overheads and DOLAR-based applications scale as well as any underlying datastore(s).
