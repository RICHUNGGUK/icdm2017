In this work, for better system performance, we apply the soft output and the soft feedback structure as well as the soft decision channel decoding. Moreover, to improve packet error rate (PER) and bit error rate (BER), we search for the optimal scaling factor of the transfer function in the output layer of the MLP/BP neural networks and add small random disturbances to the training data. As compared with the conventional MLP/BP-based DFEs and the soft output MLP/BP-based DFEs, the proposed MLP/BP-based soft DFEs under multi-path fading channels can improve over 3-0.6 dB at PER=10(-1) and over 3.3-0.8 dB at BER=10(-3).", "paper_title": "MLP/BP-based soft decision feedback equalization with bit-interleaved TCM for wireless applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929500025"}
