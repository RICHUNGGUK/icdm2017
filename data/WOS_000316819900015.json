The current handles for users to explore, make, and break connections between devices seem to disappear in overly complex menu structures displayed on small screens. This paper tackles the problem of establishing connections between devices in a smart home environment, by introducing an interaction model that we call semantic connections. Two prototypes are demonstrated that introduce both a tangible and an augmented reality approach toward exploring, making, and breaking connections. In the augmented reality approach, connections between real-world objects are visualized by displaying visible lines and icons from a mobile device containing a pico projector. In the tangible approach, objects in the environment are tagged and can be scanned and interacted with, to explore connection possibilities, and manipulate the connections. We discuss the technical implementation of a pilot study setup used to evaluate both our interaction approaches. We conclude the paper with the results of a user study that shows how the interaction approaches influence the mental models users construct after interacting with our setup.", "paper_title": "Configuring and controlling ubiquitous computing infrastructure with semantic connections: a tangible and an AR approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000316819900015"}
