Information Technology (IT) has the potential to be a key enabler of firm productivity. IS researchers have suggested strong association between investments in IT and firm productivity. Yet, uncertainty and concern about the actual impact of IT on firm productivity remain. This calls for an urgent need for research on how firms can leverage IT for productivity gains. Through a case study, this research aims to answer the above question by developing a process model that explicates the roles of firm capabilities in driving IT-enabled productivity.
