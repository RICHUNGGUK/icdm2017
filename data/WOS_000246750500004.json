We propose and investigate three novel linear delayed SIR models for different cases of recovery response. Because the recovery strategies respond with some time-delays as happens in practice, it is found that the unsuitable recovery strength may not suppress the prevalent epidemics and even lead to oscillations. Therefore, it is strongly suggested that the administrative authorities should apply control strategies of recovery as soon as possible on the small prevalent viruses before they spread into a disaster of infections.", "paper_title": "On the stability of epidemic spreading in small-world networks: how prompt the recovery should be?", "paper_id": "WOS:000246750500004"}
