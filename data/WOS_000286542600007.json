Two kinds of time-varying delays are considered: one is differentiable with bounded delay derivative the other is continuous without constraints on the delay derivative. In order to investigate the mean square exponential stability in stochastic genetic regulatory networks, some novel rate-dependent/independent mean square exponential stability criteria are derived by constructing Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. The sufficient conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Moreover, illustrative examples are used to substantiate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of our results.
