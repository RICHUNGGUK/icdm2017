The recursive feature elimination method was used for improving prediction performance and selecting molecular descriptors responsible for distinguishing Syk inhibitors and non-inhibitors. Among four machine learning models, SVM produces the best performance at 99.18% for inhibitors and 98.82% for non-inhibitors, respectively, indicating that the SVM is potentially useful for facilitating the discovery of Syk inhibitors.
