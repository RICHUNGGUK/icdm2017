It may provide various applications by connecting all the existing communication networks. To ensure the reliability of end-to-end transmission in the hierarchical environments, fault management is of great importance. Current relative algorithms are designed for specific network, not suited to these complex conditions. Meanwhile, the utilization of existing facilities should be considered for implementation feasibility. In this paper, we propose a layered fault management scheme for IoT with uniform fault managing procedure control and separate layer functions. Flexible and effective monitoring model would be set in selected observing points around the networks. Advanced fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) is adopted to realize integrated evaluation and prediction of the possible fault. The observing points could adjust the weighting rule in the model to suit the practical network condition and work independently. After further confirmation among neighbor points, fault recovery therapy could be handed over to the corresponding network with existing counter-measures. The proposed design suits well to the efficiency and feasibility requirements of IoT. Simulation results further prove its desirable behavior.", "paper_title": "Layered Fault Management Scheme for End-to-end Transmission in Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000316762900004"}
