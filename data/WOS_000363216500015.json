Previous approaches required the use of boundary particles to prevent particles from sticking to the boundary. We address this issue by correcting the fundamental equations of SPH with the integration of a kernel function. Our approach is able to directly handle triangle mesh boundaries without the need for boundary particles. We also show how our approach can be integrated into a position-based fluid framework.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Boundary Handling with a Modified Density Calculation for SPH", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500015"}
