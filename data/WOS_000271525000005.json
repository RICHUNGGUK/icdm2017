We introduce a phase field to represent the shape of the crack with a regulaxization parameter epsilon > 0 and we approximate the Francfort-Marigo type energy using the idea of Ambrosio and Tortorelli. The phase field model is derived as a gradient flow of this regularized energy. We show several numerical examples of the crack growth computed with an adaptive mesh finite element method.", "paper_title": "PHASE FIELD MODEL FOR MODE III CRACK GROWTH IN TWO DIMENSIONAL ELASTICITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000271525000005"}
