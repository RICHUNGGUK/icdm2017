Different techniques for ncRNA structure prediction such as dynamic programming (DP), genetic algorithm (GA), artificial neural network (ANN) and stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) are discussed. The basic concepts of metagenomics along with their biological basis are mentioned and the relevance of ncRNAs in metagenomics is also explored. Similarity and composition based computational methods for analyzing noncoding sequences in metagenomes are then mentioned along with their biological findings. An extensive bibliography is included.
