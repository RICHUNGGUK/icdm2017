To account for the adoption and use of IMPS by the Indian consumers, this study seeks to compare three competing sets of attributes borrowed from three recognized pieces of work in the area of innovations adoption. This study aims to examine which of the three sets of attributes better predicts the adoption of IMPS in an Indian context. The research model is empirically tested and validated against the data gathered from 323 respondents from different cities in India. The findings are analysed using the SPSS analysis tool, which are then discussed to derive the key conclusions from this study. The research implications are stated, limitations listed and suggestions for future research on this technology are then finally made.", "paper_title": "Examining the role of three sets of innovation attributes for determining adoption of the interbank mobile payment service", "paper_id": "WOS:000361523800007"}
