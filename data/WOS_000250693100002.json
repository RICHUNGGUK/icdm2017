The resource location problem in an interconnection network is one of the facility location problems. Finding absorbants of a digraph corresponds to solving a kind of resource location problem. In this paper, we establish bounds on the absorbant number for G(B)(n, d), and we give some sufficient conditions for the absorbant number of G(B)(n, d) to achieve the bounds. When d divides n, the extremal digraphs achieving the upper bound are characterized by determining their absorbants. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
