Three initial decomposition pathways including the N-NO2 bond fission, HONO elimination and C-N bond dissociation were considered for the complexes formed by HMX with H+ (PHMX1 and PHMX2) or with NH4+ (AHMX). We found that H+ and NH4+ did not evidently induce the HMX to trigger the N-NO2 heterolysis because the energy barrier of N-NO2 heterolysis was found to be higher than the bond dissociation energy of N-NO2 homolytic cleavage. Meanwhile, the transition state barriers of the HONO elimination from the complexes were found to be similar to that from the isolated HMX, which means that the HONO elimination reaction of HMX was not affected by the H+ and NH4+. As for the ring-opening reaction of HMX due to the C-N bond dissociation, the calculated potential energy profile showed that the energy of the complex (AHMX) went uphill along the C-N bond length and no transition state existed on the curve. However, the transition state energy barriers of C-N bond dissociation were calculated to be only 5.0 kcal/mol and 5.5 kcal/mol for the PHMX1 and PHMX2 complexes, respectively, which were much lower than the C-N bond dissociation energy of isolated HMX Moreover, among the three initial decomposition reactions, the C-N bond dissociation was also the most energetically favorable pathway for the PHMX1 and PHMX2. Our calculation results showed that the H+ can significantly promote the initial thermal decomposition of C-N bond of HMX, which, however, is influenced by NH4+ slightly. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
