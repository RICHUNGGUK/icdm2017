A fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme is developed to accommodate the permanent fault. It further shows that for the intermittent fault, the formation stability can be maintained under some conditions of fault appearance and disappearance without requiring to take any FTC action. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fault Tolerant Formations Control of UAVs Subject to Permanent and Intermittent Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000329629400038"}
