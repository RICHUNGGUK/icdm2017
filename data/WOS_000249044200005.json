Since both the scheduling methods in grid computing and optical networks are limited to be directly used to achieve optical grid scheduling, we propose a new, to the best of our knowledge, joint scheduling model by extending the classic list scheduling algorithm to achieve communication contention aware task scheduling for the optical grid applications. An effective adaptive routing scheme is also proposed to improve the performance of the extended list scheduling. The impacts of different routing schemes on the extended list scheduling are comparatively investigated by simulations.
