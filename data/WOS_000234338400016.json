In this paper, a scatter search (SS) metaheuristic is presented aiming to deal with the optimum disassembly sequence problem for the case of complex products with sequence-dependent disassembly costs, and assuming that only one component can be released at each time. The algorithm was tested over a set of 48 products consisting of 25, 50, 75 and 100 right-angled parallelepiped components, connected by different kinds of joints. A feasible disassembly sequence, consisting on the reverse of the assembly sequence, is always usable. Comparing by using some statistical analysis the costs of the sequence proposed by the SS algorithm with those corresponding to the reverse order, efficiency of the metaheuristic is shown up.
