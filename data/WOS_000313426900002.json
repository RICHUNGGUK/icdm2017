Each logical qubit is made up of two physical qubits and it is invariant over a collective-noise channel. We also analyze the security and show that it is not possible to forge valid message authentication codes for an adversary even if he/she has unlimited computational resources in the two schemes.", "paper_title": "ROBUST MESSAGE AUTHENTICATION OVER A COLLECTIVE-NOISE CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000313426900002"}
