This serious game, called Prog&Play, is built on an open source real-time strategy game. Its goal is to be compatible with different students, teachers and institutions. We based its evaluation on an iterative process that allows to implement the game and carry out experimentations in several contexts. Through this assessment, we define a framework which has been tested by third parties and we analyse both positive and negative points to improve the project. Evaluation is indeed beneficial and enables you to establish communication about the implemented practices.", "paper_title": "Experimental Feedback on Prog&Play: A Serious Game for Programming Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000287701100005"}
