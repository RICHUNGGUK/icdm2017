Indeed, accurate understanding of the current situation can allow the device to proactively provide information and propose services to users in mobility. Of course, to recognize the situation is a challenging task, due to such factors as the variety of possible situations, uncertain and imprecise data, and different user's preferences and behavior. In this framework, we propose a robust and general rule-based approach to manage situation awareness. We adopt Semantic Web reasoning, fuzzy logic modeling, and genetic algorithms to handle, respectively, situational/contextual inference, uncertain input processing, and adaptation to the user's behavior. We exploit an agent-oriented architecture so as to provide both functional and structural interoperability in an open environment. The system is evaluated by means of a real-world case study concerning resource recommendation. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
