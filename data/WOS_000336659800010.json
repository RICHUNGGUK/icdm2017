Unsupervised learning has the advantage of compensating for missing annotated data, and is thus promising to be effective to identify cis-regulatory elements and modules. We introduced a Conditional Random Fields model, referred to as CRFEM, to integrate sequence features and long-range dependency of genomic sequences such as epigenetic features to identify cis-regulatory elements and modules at the same time. The proposed method is able to automatically learn model parameters with no labeled data and explicitly optimize the predictive probability of cis-regulatory elements and modules. In comparison with existing methods, our method is more accurate and can be used for genome-wide studies of gene regulation.", "paper_title": "Identifying Cis-Regulatory Elements and Modules Using Conditional Random Fields", "paper_id": "WOS:000336659800010"}
