In this paper, we show that by merely upsampling, we can improve sub-pixel correspondence estimation. In addition, we identify the regularization bias problem and explore its relationship to image resolution. We propose a general upsampiing framework to compute sub-pixel color matching for different computer vision problems. Various experiments were performed on motion estimation and stereo matching data. We are able to reduce errors by up to 30%, which would otherwise be very difficult to achieve through other conventional optimization methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
