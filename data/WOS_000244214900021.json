In this paper, we consider two descendent subtree-comparison problems on phylogenetic trees. Given a set of k phylogenetic trees whose leaves are drawn from {1, 2,..., n} and the leaves for two arbitrary trees are not necessary the same, we first present a linear-time algorithm to final all the maximal leaf-agreement descendent subtrees. Based on this result, we also present a linear-time algorithm to find all the maximal leaf-agreement isomorphic descendent subtrees. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
