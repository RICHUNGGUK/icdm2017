As sets of allowed transformation to match shapes we consider translations, rigid motions, and similarities. We present a generic probabilistic algorithm based on random sampling for matching shapes which are modelled by sets of curves. The algorithm is applicable to the three considered classes of transformations. We analyze which similarity measure is optimized by the algorithm and give rigorous bounds on the number of samples necessary to get a prespecified approximation to the optimal match within a prespecified probability.
