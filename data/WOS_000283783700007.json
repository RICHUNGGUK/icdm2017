The software design is aimed at the algorithmic-level decrease of the computational load of the large-scale RS image enhancement tasks via incorporating into the fixed-point iterative reconstruction/enhancement procedures the convex convergence enforcement regularization by constructing the proper projectors onto convex sets (POCS) in the solution domain. The established POCS-regularized iterative techniques are performed separately along the range and azimuth directions over the RS scene frame making an optimal use of the sparseness properties of the employed sensor system modulation format. The hardware design is oriented on employing the Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Array XC4VSX35-10ff668 and performing the image enhancement/reconstruction tasks in a computationally efficient parallel fashion that meets the near-real time imaging system requirements. Finally, we report some simulation results and discuss the implementation performance issues related to enhancement of the real-world RS imagery indicative of the significantly increased performance efficiency gained with the developed approach.", "paper_title": "Convex regularization-based hardware/software co-design for real-time enhancement of remote sensing imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000283783700007"}
