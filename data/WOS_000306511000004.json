Different types of parking strategies are considered as potential tools for improving campus mobility and meeting increased parking demand. Limited information is available on how removing on-street parking from the center of a university campus, relocating motorists to park on the periphery of campus, will impact the neighboring transportation system. Although dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) is a valuable tool for evaluating such impacts, most previous studies have used DTA with mesoscopic models. Thus, there is also limited guidance on the application of DTA within microscopic simulation models. The purpose of this study was to test a novel methodology for evaluating the mobility impact of relocating parking. The authors developed a method of utilizing DTA within a microscopic traffic simulation model. This model was applied to a case study capturing the changes in traffic patterns and volumes as a result of university parking changes. The authors found the methodology efficient and repeatable, and identified several simulator challenges with this new application. The case study findings suggest that, due to the significant number of motorists searching for the high-demand parking in the core of campus, relocating this parking to periphery lots will reduce the average travel time, even when accounting for the increased walking time.", "paper_title": "Applying dynamic traffic assignment in modeling permit-restricted parking utilizing microscopic traffic simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306511000004"}
