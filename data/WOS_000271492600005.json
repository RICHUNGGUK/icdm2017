Thus, such equalization schemes could suffer from significant performance degradation in fast-fading channels. This paper proposes a frequency domain equalization algorithm to mitigate the effect of fast time-varying fading. First, a mathematical expression is derived to quantify the total interference resulting from the time variation of the channel. Then, the proposed approach attempts to eliminate the effect of time-variations of the channel. This cancellation allows efficient use of the classical FDE structures in fast time-varying fading environments, although they are built upon the quasi-static channel model. Simulation results of bit-error-rate performance are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Frequency Domain Equalization Algorithm for Fast Time-Varying Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000271492600005"}
