These enhancements are applicable to both single and multiobjective problems. Their combined use allows the optimization of complex 3D electromagnetic devices. Design/methodology/approach - DE is improved by a combination of techniques which are applied in a cascade way and their single and combined effect is tested on well-known benchmarks and domain-specific applications. Findings - It is shown that the combined use of enhancement techniques provides substantial improvements in the speed of convergence for both single and multiobjective problems. Research limitations/implications - The increased speed of convergence may come at the price of a somewhat decreased robustness. However, such behavior is justified by the CPU time constraints under which the optimization has to be performed. Practical implications - The proposed approach appears to be an efficient general purpose stochastic optimizer for electromagnetic design problems. Originality/value - This paper explorers the combined use of many of the most recent and successful algorithmic improvements to DE and applies them to both single and multiobjective problems.", "paper_title": "A hybrid multiobjective differential evolution method for electromagnetic device optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000299462400013"}
