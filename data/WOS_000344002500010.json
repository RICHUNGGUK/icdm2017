While the roles of lightpaths have been discussed specifically in fault localization as well as fault recovery phases, these existing works only take a sporadic, piecemeal view of these roles by studying each of them individually as a separate lightpath routing problem. In this paper, we instead take an integrated, systematic view by considering these multiple roles jointly as one single lightpath routing problem. In particular, we propose a new design model to fulfill the lightpath layout requirements in both identifying fiber link failures for fault localization and ensuring IP topology connectivity for fault recovery. With a much smaller formulation size, our new model significantly outperforms the existing counterpart in computational efficiency, scalability, and solution quality.", "paper_title": "Integrated design of fault localization and survivable mapping in IP over transparent WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344002500010"}
