Even the versions asking whether a graph has a coloring with few colors or a labeling with few labels remain NP-hard on graphs of small maximum degree. This paper studies enumeration and counting problems on edge colorings, total colorings and L(2,1)-labelings of graphs. One part deals with the enumeration of all edge 3-colorings, all total 4-colorings and all L(2,1)-labelings of span 5 of a given connected cubic graph. Branching algorithms to solve these enumeration problems are established. They imply upper bounds on the maximum number of edge 3-colorings, total 4-colorings and L(2,1)-labelings of span 5 in any n-vertex connected cubic graphs. Corresponding combinatorial lower bounds are also provided. The other part of the paper studies dynamic programming algorithms solving counting problems. On one hand, algorithms to count the number of edge k-colorings and total k-colorings for graphs of bounded pathwidth are given. On the other hand, an algorithm to count the number of L(2,1)-labelings of span 4 for graphs of maximum degree three are given.", "paper_title": "Colorings with few Colors: Counting, Enumeration and Combinatorial Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000317611100003"}
