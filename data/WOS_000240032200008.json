However, this relationship is weak and in specific individuals cannot be found. This result prevents the utilization of the SAP-PTT relationship to derive arterial pressure changes from PTT measures on an individual basis. We propose a local linear approach to study the SAP-PTT relationship. This approach is based on the definition of short SAP-PTT sequences characterized by SAP increase (decrease) and PTT decrease (increase) and on their search in the SAP and PTT beat-to-beat series. This local approach was applied to PTT and SAP series derived from 13 healthy humans during incremental supine dynamic exercise (at 10, 20 and 30% of the nominal individual maximum effort) and compared to the global approach. While global approach failed in some subjects, local analysis allowed the extraction of the gain of the SAP-PTT relationship in all subjects both at rest and during exercise. When both local and global analyses were successful, the local SAP-PTT gain is more negative than the global one as a likely result of noise reduction.", "paper_title": "Global versus local linear beat-to-beat analysis of the relationship between arterial pressure and pulse transit time during dynamic exercise", "paper_id": "WOS:000240032200008"}
