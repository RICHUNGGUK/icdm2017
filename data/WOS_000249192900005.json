Multi-sender methods are the best existing solutions to video streaming on P2P networks. In this paper, we propose use of a multicast method on the top of an arbitrary multi-sender method so that all requesting peers receive almost the same expected bit-rate. Experimental results, derived from implementation of the proposed algorithm on Pastry P2P network confirm our claim. Another advantage of our method over the existing methods is its scalability with the number of receivers. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
