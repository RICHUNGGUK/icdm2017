This algorithm can be considered as a discretized implementation of adaptive heat diffusion equation, and is carried out by multiple successive steps. The denoised output from one iteration is taken as the input to the next. The proper iteration number is determined by total denoising amount which is measured by noise variance. The selected local window sizes are also relatively stable. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
