A function F is an involution if F(F(x)) = x. The proposed CED technique exploits the involution property and checks if x = F(F(x)). Unlike traditional time redundancy based CED methods, this technique can detect both permanent and transient faults.", "paper_title": "Concurrent error detection for involutional functions with applications in fault-tolerant cryptographic hardware design", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000018"}
