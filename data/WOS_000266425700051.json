For successful classification of honeycombed HRCT images, a complete set of methods and algorithms is described from segmentation to extraction to feature selection to classification. Wavelet energy is selected as a feature for classification using K-means clustering. Test data of 20 patients are used to validate the method.", "paper_title": "Differentiating Honeycombed Images from Normal HRCT Lung Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425700051"}
