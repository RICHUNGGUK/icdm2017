We present two types of self-stabilizing algorithms for finding disjoint independent sets R and B. In one type, R is maximal independent in G and B is maximal independent in the induced subgraph G[V-R]. In the second type, R is maximal independent in G[V-B] and B is maximal independent in G[V-R]. Both the central and distributed schedulers are considered.", "paper_title": "Linear-Time Self-Stabilizing Algorithms for Disjoint Independent Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000326655700009"}
