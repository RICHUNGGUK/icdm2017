The proposed system is based on wireless sensor networks. In the MNDWSN system, each disabled person uses a handheld smart phone device. Three types of disabilities are studied in this paper: (1) blind, (2) deaf, and (3) on wheelchair. We experimented with a three-floor university building. Sensor nodes and cameras are scattered in all rooms and hallways. Smart phones are used to communicate with the sensor nodes to take instructions to navigate through the appropriate path. Dijkstra's algorithm is used for navigation. MNDWSN also monitors the disabled person while navigating. The proposed system is compared to a baseline reference experiment. Results show improvement of 34% compared to the baseline reference experiment.", "paper_title": "MNDWSN for Helping People with Different Disabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000339756900001"}
