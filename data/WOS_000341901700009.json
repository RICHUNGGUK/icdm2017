The current study assessed the impact of augmenting text with visual prosodic cues to improve expressive reading in beginning readers. Customized reading software was developed to present text augmented with prosodic cues to convey changes in pitch, duration and/or intensity. Prosodic modulation was derived from the recordings of a fluent adult model and rendered as a set of visual cues that could be presented in isolation or in combination. To establish baseline measures, eight children aged 7-8 first read a five-chapter story in standard text format. In the subsequent three sessions, participants were trained to use each augmented text cue with the guidance of an auditory model. They also had the opportunity to practice reading aloud in each cue condition. At the post-training session, participants re-recorded the baseline story with each chapter read in one of the different cue conditions (standard, pitch, duration, intensity and combination). Post-training and baseline recordings were acoustically analyzed to assess changes in reading expressivity. Despite large individual differences in how each participant implemented the prosodic cues, as a group, there were notable improvements in marking pitch accents and elongating word duration to convey linguistic contrasts. In fact, even after only three training sessions, participants appeared to have generalized implementation of pitch and word duration cues when reading standard text at post-training. In contrast, while participants manipulated pause duration when provided with explicit visual cues, they did not transfer these cues to standard text at post-training. These findings suggest that beginning readers could benefit from explicit visual prosodic cues and that even limited exposure may be sufficient to learn and generalize skills. Further discussion focuses on the implications of this work on struggling readers and second language learners. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
