Differences of learners' abilities and their learning styles have affected the learning outcomes significantly. Meanwhile, with the development of E-Learning technologies, learners can be provided more effective learning environment to optimize their performance. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of learning styles on learner's performance in e-learning environment, and use this learning style data to make recommendations for learners, instructors, and contents of online courses. Data analysis in this research represented by user performance gathered from an E-learning platform (Blackboard), where this user performance data is represented by actions performed by platform's users. A 10-fold cross validation was used to create and test the model, and the data was analyzed by the WEKA software. Classification accuracy, MAE, and the ROC area have been observed. The results show that the accuracy of classification by means of NBTree technique had the highest correct value at 69.697% and it could be applied to develop Felder Silverman's learning style while taking into consideration students' preference. Moreover, students' performance increased by more than 12%.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Learning Styles on Learner's Performance in E-Learning Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000369851100004"}
