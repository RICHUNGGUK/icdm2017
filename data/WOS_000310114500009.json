Due to some theoretical and numerical challenges, the above static failure theories have not been implemented in topology optimization. By substituting failure formulas that are non-differentiable with respect to the stress components and design variables with differentiable approximation formulas, it is possible to utilize these failure criteria to design mechanical structures that minimize mass.
