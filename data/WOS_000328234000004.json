Prior research has mostly neglected the influence of human factors on the efficiency of order picking systems. This paper develops a mathematical model that investigates the impact of learning and forgetting of a heterogeneous workforce on order picking time and, consequently, on storage assignment decisions. In particular, the paper investigates when to change a storage assignment and when to keep it if learning and forgetting occur among the members of an order picking workforce. The results show that learning and forgetting should be considered in order to achieve a proper planning of storage assignment strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
