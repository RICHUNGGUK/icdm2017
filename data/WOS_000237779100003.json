The definition was motivated by the attempt at proposing the pricing theory based on the theory of conjugate duality in optimization. We show that this concept of arbitrage fails, to have a basic property of other common concepts used in pricing theory - it depends on the underlying probability measure more than through its null sets. However, we show that the interesting pricing results obtained by conjugate duality axe still valid if it is only assumed that the market admits no free lunch rather than no free lunch in the limit.", "paper_title": "Notes on free lunch in the limit and pricing by conjugate duality theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000237779100003"}
