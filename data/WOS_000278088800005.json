Moreover, at each time step each agent moves to a random neighboring location distributed according to a normal distribution with zero mean and a small standard deviation. The purpose of the paper is to find which types of interactions reduce the number of extremists.", "paper_title": "EVOLUTION OF EXTREMIST OPINIONS IN A POPULATION OF INTERACTING AGENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000278088800005"}
