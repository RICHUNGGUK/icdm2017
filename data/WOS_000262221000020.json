It is shown that the stability with H(infinity), disturbance attenuation performance can be established for the closed-loop fuzzy control systems if there exists a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, and moreover, the functional and the corresponding controller can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities that are numerically feasible. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the efficiency and the advantage of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Piecewise H(infinity) Controller Design of Uncertain Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000262221000020"}
