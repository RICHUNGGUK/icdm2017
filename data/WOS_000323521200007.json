This common objective motivated us to develop and evaluate a system that puts ubiquitous computing technologies into the rehabilitation process of people with acquired brain injury. Thus, in this paper, we present and evaluate a system that shows adaptive manuals for daily-life activities for people with acquired brain injury. This first evaluation allowed us to validate our approach and also to extract valuable information about these systems as well as environmental factors that may affect the patients.", "paper_title": "Adaptive manuals as assistive technology to support and train people with acquired brain injury in their daily life activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000323521200007"}
