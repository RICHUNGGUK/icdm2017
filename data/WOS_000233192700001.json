With this decomposition, a geometric constraint problem can be reduced into basic merge patterns, which are the smallest problems we need to solve in order to solve the original problem in certain sense. Based on the C-tree decomposition algorithm, we implemented a software package MMP/Geometer. Experimental results show that MMP/Geometer finds the smallest decomposition for all the testing examples efficiently. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
