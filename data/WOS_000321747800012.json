In TrioVis, the variant data are organized by grouping each variant based on the laws of Mendelian inheritance. Taking three Variant Call Format files as input, TrioVis allows the user to test different coverage thresholds (i.e. different levels of stringency), to find the optimal threshold values tailored to their hypotheses and to gain insights into the global effects of filtering through interaction.", "paper_title": "TrioVis: a visualization approach for filtering genomic variants of parent-child trios", "paper_id": "WOS:000321747800012"}
