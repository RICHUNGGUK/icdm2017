This is based on the average brightness of the brain ventricle area which is brighter in MRI images. Compared numerically by using various types of measurements, the proposed method can detect the brain ventricle area better than the existing methods.", "paper_title": "A new curve control function for the detection of the brain ventricle area", "paper_id": "WOS:000251226900022"}
