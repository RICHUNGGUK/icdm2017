We prove exponentially small upper bounds for classes of polynomials with certain linear algebraic properties. As a corollary, we obtain exponential lower bounds on the size necessary to compute parity by depth-3 circuits with a MAJORITY gate at the top, MOD (q) gates at the middle level and AND gates at the input level, when the polynomials corresponding to the depth-2 MOD (q) au < AND subcircuits satisfy our conditions. Our methods also yield lower bounds for depth-3 MAJau < MOD (q) au < MOD (2) circuits (under certain restrictions) for computing parity. Our technique is based on a new general representation of the correlation using exponential sums, that allows to take advantage of the linear algebraic structure of the corresponding polynomials. Our results include Goldman's result (Goldmann in Inf. Process. Lett. 53:321-327, 1995) on the correlation between parity and degree one polynomials as a special case. We also present a general expression for representing correlation, that can be used to yield our results as well as to derive the bounds of Cai, Green, and Thierauf (Math. Syst. Theory 29:245-258, 1996) for symmetric polynomials, using ideas of the Cai et al. (Math. Syst. Theory 29:245-258, 1996) proof. The classes of polynomials for which we obtain exponentially small upper bounds include polynomials of very large degree and with a very large number of terms, that previous techniques did not apply to.", "paper_title": "On the Correlation Between Parity and Modular Polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000299515500006"}
