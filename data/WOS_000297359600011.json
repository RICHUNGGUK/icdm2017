The systems which are feasible under the partitioned paradigm are flagged as \"infeasible\" sometimes. In this paper, we present a novel efficient DBF(eDBF) partitioned scheduling algorithm. A criterion which tracks the demand bound function exactly as needed is used to avoid the incorrect judgment in determining whether a processor can accommodate an additional task in the new algorithm. We give the pseudo code of the new algorithm on least-number processors and fixed-number processors respectively. Then, we prove the correctness of, and evaluated the effectiveness of this new algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that eDBF has better performance than DBF* and Density algorithms.", "paper_title": "The partitioned scheduling of sporadic task systems on multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000297359600011"}
