In this paper, an integrated simulation environment is introduced, where the system parameters of future THz communication systems can be estimated under realistic hardware and propagation conditions. It is shown how this simulation environment can be used to determine the most critical parameters in the whole system and may be used to derive requirements for the development of hardware components. Exemplary simulation results, taking into account various factors of influence (different modulation schemes, antenna gains and wall materials), are presented.", "paper_title": "An integrated simulation environment for the investigation of future THz communication systems: Extended version", "paper_id": "WOS:000256134400006"}
