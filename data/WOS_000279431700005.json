This category of tasks includes piercing, painting or iron welding on some specific points of the rigid object's surface. For this kind of tasks to become feasible the CAD data of the rigid object should be registered into the robot's workspace frame, so that the robot arm becomes aware of the position and orientation of the rigid body with reference to its own flange or base coordinate frame. In order to achieve this goal several techniques from the fields of image processing, 3D modeling and robot kinematics should be combined. This paper provides a convenient combination of such methods that can be used for the successful on-line registration of a rigid object's CAD data to the robot's workspace frame.", "paper_title": "A METHOD FOR THE REGISTRATION OF A KNOWN CAD MODEL INTO THE WORKSPACE FRAME OF A ROBOT", "paper_id": "WOS:000279431700005"}
