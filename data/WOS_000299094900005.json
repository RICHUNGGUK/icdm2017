This allows specifying virtual organizations with their shared and individual (semantic and pragmatic) contexts, decisions, and actions/events for rule-based collaboration between the distributed members. The (semi-)autonomous agents use rule engines and Semantic Web rules to describe and execute derivation and reaction logic which declaratively implements the organizational semiotics and the different distributed system/agent topologies with their negotiation/coordination mechanisms. They employ ontologies in their knowledge bases to represent semantic domain vocabularies, normative pragmatics and pragmatic context of event-based conversations and actions.", "paper_title": "RULE RESPONDER: RULE-BASED AGENTS FOR THE SEMANTIC-PRAGMATIC WEB", "paper_id": "WOS:000299094900005"}
