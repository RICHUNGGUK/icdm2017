This method identifies the high density neighborhoods from the data first and then selects the central points of the neighborhoods as initial centers. The recently published Neighborhood-Based Clustering (NBC) algorithm is used to search for high density neighborhoods. The new clustering algorithm NK-means integrates NBC into the k-means clustering process to improve the performance of the k-means algorithm while preserving the k-means efficiency. NBC is enhanced with a new cell-based neighborhood search method to accelerate the search for initial cluster centers. A merging method is employed to filter out insignificant initial centers to avoid too many clusters being generated. Experimental results on synthetic data sets have shown significant improvements in clustering accuracy in comparison with the random k-means and the refinement k-means algorithms.", "paper_title": "Neighborhood density method for selecting initial cluster centers in k-means clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600023"}
