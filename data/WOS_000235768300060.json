Because previous image quality evaluation methods estimate an iris image whether bad or else by the resolution and the definition of the iris part, they just can deal with few types among them, For saving the time occupied by the localization in images real-time estimation, improving friendly interaction of an iris identification system, decreasing the localization failure on account of importing the bad-image, this paper proposes a method of real-time pre-estimation using the compound BP neural network. Multiple independent BP neural networks are used to extract both the overall contour feature and the local of an iris image and to calculate the pre-estimation output by different training weights. The experimental result is shown that the method can detects most types of the bad-image with comparatively low error rate and the pre-estimation network has fairly large throughput. It should satisfy the pre-estimation requirement of a real-time iris identification system.", "paper_title": "Iris image real-time pre-estimation using compound BP neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300060"}
