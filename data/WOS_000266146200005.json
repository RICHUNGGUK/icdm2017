Valls V. Quintanilla S. Preemption in resource-constrained project scheduling. European journal of Operational Research 2008:189:1136-152) revealed the potential benefits of allowing one interruption when scheduling activities in a resource-constrained project. This paper further investigates the effect of interruption oil project length in more general cases. To achieve this, a new model that covers most practical applications of discrete activity preemption is proposed and a metaheuristic algorithm for the problem is developed. Computational experiments on the standard j120 and j30 sets generated using ProGen study the difference in makespan between allowing m interruptions per activity, m = 0, 1, 2,.... In the second part of the paper the usefulness of preemption in the presence of due dates is analysed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
