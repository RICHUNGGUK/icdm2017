This article examines the utility of family support (tangible and emotional) and Internet self-efficacy (general and communication) in predicting middle aged (aged 50-64) and older adults' (over the age of 65) perceived effects of e-learning. A total of 290 adult participants aged over 50 who were registered in community college and senior learning center courses completed the measure of perceived family support. Internet self-efficacy and the effects of e-learning By using structural equation modeling (SEM) and model invariance analysis, the results indicate that emotional family support plays a main role in predicting the effects of e-learning, mediated by general and communication Internet self-efficacy. Emotional family support has both direct and indirect influences on adults' perceived effects of e-learning. Tangible support significantly predicts adults' perceived effects of e-learning, mediated by Internet self-efficacy. Compared to male adult learners, female adults rely more on tangible family support for increasing their Internet self-efficacy Similar patterns were presented by older participants The similarities between women and older adults imply that the gender issue is not specifically related to sex itself, but relates to the complexity of the social context of these disadvantaged learners. The findings provide researchers, adult education practitioners and e-learning program planners with a direction towards understanding e-learning for middle and older aged adults.
