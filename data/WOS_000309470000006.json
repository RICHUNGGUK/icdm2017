As a consequence it follows that many related sequences are either k-automatic or k-regular. These include many sequences previously studied in the literature, such as the recurrence function, the appearance function, and the repetitivity index. We also give some new characterizations of the class of k-regular sequences. Many results extend to other sequences defined in terms of Pisot numeration systems.", "paper_title": "ENUMERATION AND DECIDABLE PROPERTIES OF AUTOMATIC SEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000006"}
