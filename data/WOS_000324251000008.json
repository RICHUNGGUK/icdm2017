This poses challenges to image registration methods, particularly to those driven by intensity values. We address these difficulties in a novel diffeomorphic registration technique for tumor tracking in series of 2-D liver ultrasound. Our method has two main characteristics: 1) each voxel is described by three image features: intensity, local phase, and phase congruency; 2) we compute a set of forces from either local information (Demons-type of forces), or spatial correspondences supplied by a block-matching scheme, from each image feature. A family of update deformation fields which are defined by these forces, and inform upon the local or regional contribution of each image feature are then composed to form the final transformation. The method is diffeomorphic, which ensures the invertibility of deformations. The qualitative and quantitative results yielded by both synthetic and real clinical data show the suitability of our method for the application at hand.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Feature-Based Diffeomorphic Registration for Tumor Tracking in 2-D Liver Ultrasound Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000324251000008"}
