More precisely, they are formal series developments of differential operators indexed over rooted trees, and can be used to represent a large class of numerical methods. The theory of backward error analysis for differential equations has a particularly nice description when applied to methods represented by Butcher series. For the study of differential equations evolving on more general manifolds, a generalization of Butcher series has been introduced, called the Lie-Butcher series. This paper presents the theory of backward error analysis for methods based on Lie-Butcher series.", "paper_title": "Backward Error Analysis and the Substitution Law for Lie Group Integrators", "paper_id": "WOS:000316397700002"}
