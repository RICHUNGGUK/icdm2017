This session concentrates on discussing Intelligent Agents and uses some applications to demonstrate the theories reported. An update on last years session [1] is included to report on several key advances in technology that further enable the ongoing development of multi-agent systems. A brief summary of the impediments presented to researchers is also provided to highlight why innovation must be used to sustain the evolution of Artificial Intelligence. This year a variety of challenges and concepts are presented, together with a collection of thoughts about the direction and vision of Intelligent Agents ands their Applciations.", "paper_title": "Intelligent agents and their applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600063"}
