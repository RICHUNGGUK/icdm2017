Such a challenge calls for a multi-objective optimization. Here, a generating multi-objective optimization method called normalized normal constraint method, which attains a set of optimal solutions and allows the designer to explore design alternatives before making the final decision, is coupled with a local-global search called constrained globalized bounded Nelder-Mead method. The proposed approach is applied to the design of a Z-shaped composite bracket for optimization of structural and manufacturing objectives. Comparison of the results with non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) shows that when only a small number of function evaluations are possible and a few Pareto optima are desired, the proposed method outperforms NSGA-II in terms of convergence to the true Pareto frontier. The results are validated by an enumeration search and by exploring the neighbourhood of the final solutions.", "paper_title": "Pareto frontier for simultaneous structural and manufacturing optimization of a composite part", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500034"}
