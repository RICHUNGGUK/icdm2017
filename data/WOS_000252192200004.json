TTIS is a novel artificial immune system, which is comprised of three computing tiers and based on the normal model. The three tiers include inherent immune tier, adaptive immune tier and parallel immune tier. The tri-tier immune model is built on some theories of human immune system and has many good features, such as adaptability, immunity, memory, learning, and robustness. At the same time, for such immune robot, a novel normal model for the robot software is also proposed. The normal model is built on the space-time properties of each component in the robot software and can uniquely identify the normal state of the robot software. Such tri-tier immune system based on the normal model is suitable for anti-virus and fault diagnosis, which enable the immune robot to detect all viruses and faults in the robot software, recognize many viruses and faults, eliminate the viruses and faults, and repair the damaged robot software to its normal state. Meanwhile, simulation results show that the tri-tier immune system has the properties of immunity, security and robustness.", "paper_title": "Tri-tier immune system in anti-virus and software fault diagnosis of mobile immune robot based on normal model", "paper_id": "WOS:000252192200004"}
