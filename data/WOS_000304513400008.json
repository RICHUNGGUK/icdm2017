Fragment charge distribution and electrostatic potential analysis indicate that the presence of electron-withdrawing and -donation groups leads to the redistribution of charges and obvious polarization effects to the unsymmetrical phthalocyanine series. Peripheral methyloxy/methoxycarbonyl groups introduced onto phthalocyanine ring were revealed to destroy the degeneracy of LUMOs, resulting in. significant Q-band splitting for the unsymmetrical phthalocyanine compounds. In addition, metal-free and zinc phthalocyanine compounds display similar electronic structures and absorptions due to the almost none contribution of the zinc atom or inner hydrogens to the frontier molecular orbitals. The microscopic mechanism of the UV-Vis spectra has been clarified on the basis of multi-band photon-induced electron transference. These theoretical studies would be helpful for the molecular design of novel unsymmetrical phthalocyanines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
