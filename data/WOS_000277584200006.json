A well-known result in quantum mechanics says that by performing two-outcome measurements, Alice and Bob can produce correlations that cannot be obtained locally, i.e., with shared randomness alone. We show that by using only two bits of communication, Alice and Bob can classically simulate any such correlations. All previous protocols for exact simulation required the communication to grow to infinity with the dimension d. Our protocol and analysis are based on a power series method, resembling Krivine's bound on Grothendieck's constant, and on the computation of volumes of spherical tetrahedra.", "paper_title": "SIMULATING QUANTUM CORRELATIONS WITH FINITE COMMUNICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000277584200006"}
