Examples of such problems are combinatorial minimum weight product problems such as, e.g., the following: Given a graph G = (V, E) and two edge weights a, b : E -> R+ find an s-t path P that minimizes a(P)b(P), the product of its edge weights relative to a and b.", "paper_title": "Quadratic programming and combinatorial minimum weight product problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900007"}
