The OpenMP programming paradigm is used to achieve modest parallelism on a shared-memory computer for the industrial petroleum system modeling package PetroMod. The significant advantage of this shared-memory parallelization approach is the simplicity of the OpenMP paradigm allowing a smooth transition to a parallel program by incrementally parallelizing a serial code. The process of using OpenMP to parallelize PetroMod is outlined and performance results on a Sun Fire E2900 are reported. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
