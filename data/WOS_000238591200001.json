The proposed approach is specialized for XML, almost automatic, semantic and \"light\". Further, an original peculiarity is that it is parametric w.r.t. a \"severity\" level against which the integration task is performed. The paper describes the approach in all details, illustrates various theoretical results, presents the experiments we have performed for testing it and, finally, compares it with various related approaches already proposed in the literature.
