Such a configuration is called an empty convex hexagon. In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative. We show that every set that contains the vertex set of a convex 9-gon also contains an empty convex hexagon.", "paper_title": "Empty convex hexagons in planar point sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000253753900016"}
