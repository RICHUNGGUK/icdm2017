These methods have become particularly important in the field of variational image processing, which frequently requires the minimization of nondifferentiable objectives. This paper considers accelerated (i.e., fast) variants of two common alternating direction methods: the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and the alternating minimization algorithm (AMA). The proposed acceleration is of the form first proposed by Nesterov for gradient descent methods. In the case that the objective function is strongly convex, global convergence bounds are provided for both classical and accelerated variants of the methods. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the fast methods for a wide variety of problems.", "paper_title": "Fast Alternating Direction Optimization Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000343228200005"}
