Based on the notion of Willems' behavioral controllability [1, 2], we introduce a new concept related to the controllability of discrete event systems. By using the controllability proposed here and the notion related to achievable behaviors [3, 4], we show that the behavioral controllability for a given specification with respect to language is equivalent to the existence of a controller, so that an interconnected system satisfies the specification exactly. A proposed controller here is represented by the intersection of the behavior of a given plant and that of a given (controllable) specification. We also clarify that our controllers for a given specification fit the properties of well-known supervisory controllers proposed and developed by Ramadge and Wonham [5].", "paper_title": "On controllability of discrete event systems in a behavioral framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000244781200002"}
