Unlike other topology control schemes, we implement the topology control for heterogeneous wireless backbone networks by generating a scale-free topological model. Our topological model is based on both the scale-free network concept and directed proximity graph theory. And the topological characteristics of wireless networks are also considered while designing it. In this model, during nodes' growth and preferential attachment, each new node connects to the existing nodes in its directed attachable proximity in terms of a certain probability at each time-step. Each node's directed attachable proximity graph is generated from its directed reachable proximity graph that is built by regulating its transmission power based on locally collected information. Meanwhile, an optimized solution of selecting the model parameters is proposed. When analyzing the algorithmic properties, we also offer some correlative definitions, models, theorems and corollary for this kind of topology controls as theoretical references. The simulation experiments are provided to validate our claims.", "paper_title": "A Scale-Free Topological Model for Heterogeneous Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332680500007"}
