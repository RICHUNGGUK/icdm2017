The existence of unique solutions of the semi-discrete and fully discrete H-1-Galerkin mixed finite element methods is proved, and optimal error estimates are established. Our method can simultaneously approximate the scalar unknown and the vector flux effectively, without requiring the LBB consistency condition. Finally, some numerical results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of our method.", "paper_title": "H-1-Galerkin mixed finite element method for the regularized long wave equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236622400005"}
