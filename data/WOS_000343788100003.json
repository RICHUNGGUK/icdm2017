This article describes the R package LS2Wstat which employs a recent wavelet-based test of stationarity for locally stationary random fields to assess such spatial homogeneity. By embedding this test within a quadtree image segmentation procedure we are also able to identify texture regions within an image.", "paper_title": "A Multiscale Test of Spatial Stationarity for Textured Images in R", "paper_id": "WOS:000343788100003"}
