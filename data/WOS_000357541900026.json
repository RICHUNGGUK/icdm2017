The ITMM is a spatial domain decomposition method proposed for massively parallel computations. A Fourier analysis of the PBJ-based iterations applied to S-N diamond-difference equations in 1D slab and 2D Cartesian geometries is performed. It is carried out for infinite-medium problems with homogeneous material properties. To analyze the performance of the ITMM with the PBJ algorithm and evaluate its potential in scalability we consider a limiting case of one spatial cell per subdomain. The analysis shows that in such limit the spectral radius of the iteration method is one without regard to values of the scattering ratio and optical thickness of the spatial cells. This implies lack of convergence in infinite medium. Numerical results of finite-medium problems are presented. They demonstrate effects of finite size of spatial domain on the performance of the iteration algorithm as well as its asymptotic behavior when the extent of the spatial domain increases. These numerical experiments also show that for finite domains iterative convergence to a finite criterion is achievable in a multiple of the sum of number of cells in each dimension.
