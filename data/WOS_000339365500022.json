This method is applicable to a range of refractive indices of the film less than the refractive index of the substrate and a very wide range of layer thicknesses from 20 mu m to at least 200 mu m. It is very useful in some cases where the thickness of the substrate cannot be determined using conventional methods such as a Vernier caliper or micrometer screw.", "paper_title": "Extraction of material parameters of a bi-layer structure using Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500022"}
