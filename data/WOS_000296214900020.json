Seamless bra cups are made by one-step forming technology. The three-dimensional (3D) cup shape is formed by using high temperatures and pressures with flexible polyurethane foams. Nevertheless, the mold head design process and control of the bra cup molding process are highly complicated and error prone. There is limited knowledge about the effects of foam properties, molding parameters and foam cup geometric parameters on molding process optimization. This research presents a response surface methodology as the approach for parametric design and process parameter optimization of bra cup molding. The proposed approach integrates 3D scanning via reverse engineering, parameterized-based remeshing and registration algorithm, non-linear mathematical prediction models for cup shape conformity, a model of foam shrinkage and example-based bra cup design and grading to optimize the bra cup development and production process. The experimental results show that this method is highly effective and more timesaving in the design and development of new products, as well as providing consistent quality control of the bra cup molding process.
