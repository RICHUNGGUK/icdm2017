The numerical solutions to simulate the posterior distribution are available, but incur high computational cost. In this paper, we introduce an approximation to the prior/posterior distribution of the parameters in the beta distribution and propose an analytically tractable (closed form) Bayesian approach to the parameter estimation. The approach is based on the variational inference (VI) framework. Following the principles of the VI framework and utilizing the relative convexity bound, the extended factorized approximation method is applied to approximate the distribution of the parameters in BMM. In a fully Bayesian model where all of the parameters of the BMM are considered as variables and assigned proper distributions, our approach can asymptotically find the optimal estimate of the parameters posterior distribution. Also, the model complexity can be determined based on the data. The closed-form solution is proposed so that no iterative numerical calculation is required. Meanwhile, our approach avoids the drawback of overfitting in the conventional expectation maximization algorithm. The good performance of this approach is verified by experiments with both synthetic and real data.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Estimation of Beta Mixture Models with Variational Inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000294910000004"}
