In particular, large sets of genes can be used to search for enriched state transition network maps (NMs) and features facilitating the interpretation of genomic-scale experiments such as microarrays. One NM collects all the catalogued states of a protein as well as the mutual transitions between the states. For the returned NM, graph visualization is provided for easy understanding and to guide further analysis.", "paper_title": "MPSQ: a web tool for protein-state searching", "paper_id": "WOS:000259973500028"}
