The main contributions are the integration of these concepts in a GA crossover operator. The proposed methodology is applied to a single machine scheduling problem with sequence-dependent setup times for the objective of minimizing the total tardiness. A sensitivity analysis of the hybrid approach is carried out to compare the performance of the GA and the hybrid genetic algorithm (HGA) approaches on different benchmarks from the literature. The numerical experiments demonstrate the HGA efficiency and effectiveness which generates solutions that approach those of the known reference sets and improves several lower bounds.
