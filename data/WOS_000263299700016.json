The ROM is obtained by seeking a solution belonging to the POD subspace and that at the same time minimizes the Navier-Stokes residuals. We propose a modified ROM that directly incorporates the pressure term in the model. The ROM is then stabilized making use of a method based on the fine scale equations. An improvement of the POD solution subspace is performed, thanks to a hybrid method that couples direct numerical simulations and reduced order model simulations. The methods proposed are tested on the two-dimensional confined square cylinder wake flow in laminar regime. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
