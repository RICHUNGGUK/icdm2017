We suggest that BI has an important role to play in helping organisations implement and monitor sustainable practices. We pay particular attention to one phase of any BI project, the information planning phase, i.e., the systematic way of defining relevant information in order to integrate it in reporting activities. Using grounded theory, the main contribution of our study is to propose a conceptual model that seeks to support the process of integration of socio-environmental indicators into organizational strategy for sustainability.
