By using the analysis method and inequality technique, several sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the global exponential stability of the addressed neural network. These results generalize the existing relevant stability results. Two examples with simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of impulsive Cohen-Grossberg neural network with unbounded discrete time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000252398100006"}
