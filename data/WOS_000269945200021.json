An optimal mechatronic design requires that, among the structural and control parameters, an optimal choice has to be made with respect to design specifications in the different domains. Two main challenges are treated in this paper: the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the difficulty in modeling serial machines with flexible components and their embedded controllers. The optimization problem is treated using the direct design strategy which considers simultaneously structural and control parameters as variables and adopts non-convex optimization algorithms. Linear time-invariant and gain-scheduling PID controllers are addressed. This methodology is exploited for the multi-objective optimization of a pick-and-place assembly robot with a gripper carried by a variable-length flexible beam. The resulting design tradeoffs between system accuracy and control efforts demonstrate the advantage of an integrated design approach for mechatronic systems with con figuration-dependent dynamics.
