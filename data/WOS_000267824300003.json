Each digital ray dig(op) approximates the Euclidean line segment (op) over bar between o and p. The set of all digital rays satisfies a set of axioms analogous to the Euclidean axioms. We measure the approximation quality by the maximum Hausdorff distance between a digital ray and its Euclidean counterpart and establish an asymptotically tight Theta(log n) bound in the n x n grid. The proof of the bound is based on discrepancy theory and a simple construction algorithm. Without a monotonicity property for digital rays the bound is improved to O(1). Digital rays enable us to define the family of digital star-shaped regions centered at o, which we use to design efficient algorithms for image processing problems.", "paper_title": "Consistent Digital Rays", "paper_id": "WOS:000267824300003"}
