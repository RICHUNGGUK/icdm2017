However, batch architectures are not an adequate choice for designing real-time systems in which data updates and reads must be satisfied with very low latency. Thus, gathering and consuming high volumes of data at high velocities is an emerging challenge which we specifically address in the scope of innovative scenarios based on semantic data (RDF) management. The Linked Open Data initiative or emergent projects in the Internet of Things are examples of such scenarios. This paper describes a new architecture (referred to as Soup) which separates the complexities of Big Semantic Data storage and indexing from real-time data acquisition and consumption. This decision relies on the use of two optimized datastores which respectively store historical (big) data and run-time data. It ensures efficient volume management and high processing velocity, but adds the need of coordinating both datastores. SOLID proposes a 3-tiered architecture in which each responsibility is specifically addressed. Besides its theoretical description, we also propose and evaluate a SOLID prototype built on top of binary RDF and state-of-the-art triplestores. Our experimental numbers report that SOLID achieves large savings in data storage (it uses up to 5 times less space than the compared triplestores), while provides efficient SPARQL resolution over the Big Semantic Data (in the order of 10-20 ms for the studied queries). These experiments also show that Soun ensures lowlatency operations because data effectively managed in real-time remain small, so do not suffer Big Data issues. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
