Design/methodology/approach - Electrical, mass transfer and electro-kinetic equations are combined in order to derive a non-linear lumped circuit. The dynamic circuit model is tested in realistic operating conditions. Findings - An original equivalent circuit model for simulating the transient behavior of passive PEMFCs is proposed. The PEMFC is represented as a non-linear equivalent circuit with controlled lumped parameters depending on pressure, temperature, hydration, and system capacity. Research limitations/implications - Lumped parameters are synthesized assuming a one-dimensional fuel cell model since layer thicknesses are much smaller than other dimensions. Heat generation and transfer are not modeled even though lumped parameters depend on temperature. Practical implications - The proposed circuit model can be implemented directly in circuit simulators for designing power management units needed to interface small-passive PEMFCs and portable electronics such as PDAs, laptops, or mobile phones. Originality/value - The fuel cell is represented as a non-linear controlled generator whose parameters are derived directly from multiphysics equations rather than empirical relationships. The dynamic behaviour of PEMFCs can be simulated on completely different times scales, i.e. during transients or during the discharge phase.", "paper_title": "A novel circuit model of a proton exchange membrane fuel cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800017"}
