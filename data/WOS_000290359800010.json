We present four deterministic and purely combinatorial algorithms for this problem, and give theoretical guarantees for their worst-case approximation ratios. Two of these algorithms are novel, whereas the rest are adaptation of earlier approaches. An experimental evaluation of the algorithms in terms of attained profit and execution time reveals that the theoretically best algorithm performs only marginally better than one of the new algorithms, while at the same time being several orders of magnitude slower. Furthermore, an extremely fast greedy heuristic with nonconstant approximation ratio performs reasonably well and may be favored over the other algorithms whenever it is crucial to minimize execution time.
