In this topic, bit allocation is crucial since it is directly related with actual bit generation and the coding quality. Meanwhile, the rate-distortion-optimization (RDO) based mode-decision technique also affects performance a lot for the strong relation among mode, bits, and quality. This paper presents a multi-stage rate control scheme for R-D optimized H.264/AVC encoders under CBR video transmission. To enhance the precision of the complexity estimation and bit allocation, a frequency-domain parameter named mean-absolute-transform-difference (MATD) is adopted to represent frame and macroblock (MB) residual complexity. Second, the MATD ratio is utilized to enhance the accuracy of frame layer bit prediction. Then, by considering the bit usage status of whole sequence, a measurement combining forward and backward bit analysis is proposed to adjust the Lagrange multiplier lambda(MODE) on frame layer to optimize the mode decision for all MBs within the current frame. On the next stage, bits are allocated on MB layer by proposed remaining complexity analysis. Computed QP is further adjusted according to predicted MB texture bits. Simulation results show the PSNR improvement is up to 1.13 dB by using our algorithm, and the stress of output buffer control is also largely released compared with the recommended rate control in H.264/AVC reference software JM13.2.", "paper_title": "Constant Bit-Rate Multi-Stage Rate Control for Rate-Distortion Optimized H.264/AVC Encoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342100007"}
