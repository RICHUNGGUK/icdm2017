The network is based on a cortical columnar model described earlier. It realizes dynamic links with the help of specialized columns that evaluate similarities between the activity distributions of local feature cell populations, are subject to a topology constraint, and gate the transfer of feature information between the neural fields. Correspondence finding requires little time (estimated to 10-40ms in physiological terms) and is robust to noise in feature signals.", "paper_title": "Rapid correspondence finding in networks of cortical columns", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100070"}
