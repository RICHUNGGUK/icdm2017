Ranking problem has recently been considered and formulated as a machine learning problem. Among the various learning-torank methods, the ranking support vector machines (SVMs) have been widely applied in various applications because of its state-of-the-art performance. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking method based on a probabilistic generative model approach. The proposed method utilizes multi-support vector domain description (multi-SVDD) and constructs pseudo-conditional probabilities for data pairs, thus enabling the construction of an efficient posterior probability function of relevance judgment of data pairs. Results of experiments on both synthetic and real large-scale datasets show that the proposed method can efficiently learn ranking functions better than ranking SVMs. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic generative ranking method based on multi-support vector domain description", "paper_id": "WOS:000323808200010"}
