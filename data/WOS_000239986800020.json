The method consists of training a NN for the k-step prediction of a physiological signal, and then examining the connection-weight-space (CWS) of the NN to extract information about the signal generator mechanism. We de. ne a novel feature, Normalized Vector Separation (gamma(ij)), to measure the separation of two arbitrary states \"i\" and \"j\" in the CWS and use it to track the state changes of the generating system. The performance of the method is examined via synthetic signals and clinical EEG. Synthetic data indicates that gamma(ij) can track the system down to a SNR of 3.5 dB. Clinical data obtained from three patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy of the brain showed that EEG could be modeled (within a root-means-squared-error of 0.01) by the proposed method, and the blood perfusion state of the brain could be monitored via gamma(ij), with small NNs having no more than 21 connection weight altogether.", "paper_title": "Tracking the states of a nonlinear and nonstationary system in the weight-space of artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239986800020"}
