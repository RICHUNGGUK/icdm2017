Subtle changes in molecular structure as a consequence of a single gene mutation can lead to catastrophic failure at the organ level, such as heart failure from reentrant arrhythmias that lead to ventricular fibrillation. But information flows equally in the reverse direction: Mechanoreceptors at the cell level sense the mechanical load on the musculoskeletal system and influence gene expression via signal transduction pathways. Thus, interpreting the interactions that occur across the length scales from genes and proteins to cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems requires a multiscale mathematical modeling framework. At present, the Physiome Project consists of the markup languages and associated tools for authoring, validating, displaying, and executing models, together with model databases that have been published in peer- reviewed journals.", "paper_title": "Multiscale modeling: Physiome project standards, tools, and databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000241907100008"}
