Recently, several axiomatic definitions of information granulation have been introduced. In this paper, we try to improve these axiomatic definitions and give a universal construction of information granulation by relating information granulations with a class of functions of multiple variables. We show that the improved axiomatic definition has some concrete information granulations in the literature as instances.", "paper_title": "An Improved Axiomatic Definition of Information Granulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000311587400006"}
