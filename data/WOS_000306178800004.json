These spanners need to be fault tolerant in resource-constrained ad hoc networks. In this paper, we have proposed three spanners, called fault-tolerant local Delaunay triangulation (FTLDel), fault-tolerant relative neighborhood graph (FTRNG), and fault-tolerant Gabriel graph (FTGG). The fault-tolerant spanners provide reliability to the network by avoiding heavy packet loss and retaining useful geometric properties. The performance of fault-tolerant spanners FTLDel, FTRNG, and FTGG are evaluated using the network simulator ns2.28.
