The principle of predictive control is adopted to overcome the effects of network. time delay. The necessary and sufficient conditions on the stability of the closed-loop NCS are derived, which provides useful analytical stability criteria. The closed-loop networked predictive control system with bounded random network delay is stable if the corresponding switched system is stable. Simulation and real-time results give an illustration of the proposed control strategies.", "paper_title": "Design and stability criteria of networked predictive control systems with random network delay in the feedback channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000244499400003"}
