The variation takes place under the feed line of a 4-element array that gives the change in relative phase shift. The phase shift achieved from different combinations of EBGS lying under the feed lines is used in personal computer aided antenna design software, PCAAD 4.0, to see the beam steering capacity. Then the same feed lines are connected with four microstrip patches to yield a 4-elements phased array antenna. The 4-elements phased array antenna is simulated in electromagnetic (EM) software Zeland IE3D. Finally, the design is fabricated with the help of milling machine that takes the help of ISOPRO and QUICKCAM software. It can be seen that the beam steering angle increases with the increase of FFs. Thus a novel FF of EBGS based phased array antenna is developed.
