Most importantly, to design a robot rationally, one must have a strong understanding of the design parameters of the manipulator, and of the characteristics of the robot relative to its kinematical and dynamical requirements. Development of a robot capable of fast movements or high payloads is progressed by the analysis of dynamic characteristics, DOF positioning, actuator selection, structure of links, and so on. This paper highlights the design of a robot manipulator scaled down from its final form, when it will passively be handled by a human for man-machine cooperation. The requirements of the system include its having 6-DOF and the capacity for a high payload in the condition of its maximum reach. The primary investigation factors are motion range, performance within the motion area, and reliability during the handling of heavy materials. Traditionally, the mechanical design of robots has been viewed as a problem of packaging motors and electronics into a reasonable structure. This process usually transpires with heavy reliance on designer experience. Not surprisingly, the traditional design process contains no formally defined rules for achieving desirable results, as there is little opportunity for quantitative feedback during the formative stages. This work primarily focuses on the selection of proper joint types and link lengths, considering a specific task type and motion requirements of the curtain wall installation process in the construction site based on the result of experiment of proto type system of this study.", "paper_title": "Methodology for the kinematical selection of a manipulator for a specified task", "paper_id": "WOS:000244684400005"}
