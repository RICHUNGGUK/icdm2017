Our construction renders in a compositional way the control flow aspects present in pi-calculus process expressions, by adapting the existing graph-theoretic net composition operators. Those aspects which are related to term rewriting, as well as name binding, are handled through special inscriptions of places, transitions and arcs, together with a suitable choice of the initial marking.", "paper_title": "Petri net semantics of the finite pi-calculus terms", "paper_id": "WOS:000236576400003"}
