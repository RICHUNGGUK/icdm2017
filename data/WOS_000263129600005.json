The PCMFS is a physics-based meshfree numerical technique for real time simulation of surgical procedures. Since computational speed has a significant role in simulation of surgical procedures, model order reduction methods have been compared for relative gains in efficiency and computational accuracy. Of these methods, TBR results in the highest accuracy with an average error which is within 3.37% of the full model while MT results in the highest efficiency with a computational cost reduction of 54.2% compared to the full model.", "paper_title": "A comparison of some model order reduction methods for fast simulation of soft tissue response using the point collocation-based method of finite spheres", "paper_id": "WOS:000263129600005"}
