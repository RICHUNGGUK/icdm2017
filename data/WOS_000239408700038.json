It is shown that the recursive construction of MOGCS is inherent in these characterizations. Previously known constructions of ZCZ sequences and MOGCS are shown to be special cases of this characterization. The notion of mutually orthogonal ZCZ sequence sets is also introduced.", "paper_title": "A new framework for constructing mutually orthogonal complementary sets and ZCZ sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700038"}
