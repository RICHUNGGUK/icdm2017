Theoretical features of the associated optimization problems are studied, and sparse suboptimal solutions are searched for. Rates of approximate optimization are estimated for sequences of suboptimal solutions formed by linear combinations of n-tuples of computational units, and statistical learning bounds are derived. As hypothesis sets, reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces and their subsets are considered.", "paper_title": "Regularization Techniques and Suboptimal Solutions to Optimization Problems in Learning from Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000274652100008"}
