A kind of notions of compositions was investigated by Sato [10] and Manzini [6] for linear cellular automata, we extend the notion to general cellular automata on groups and investigated their properties. We observe the all unions and compositions generated by one-dimensional 2-neighborhood cellular automata over Z(2) including non-linear cellular automata. Next we prove that the composition is right-distributive over union, but is not left-distributive. Finally, we conclude by showing reformulation of our definition of cellular automata on group which admit more than three states. We also show our formulation contains the representation using formal power series for linear cellular automata in Manzini [6].", "paper_title": "A Formulation of Composition for Cellular Automata on Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000332590900009"}
