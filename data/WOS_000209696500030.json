A practical utility function is designed for each station in which the QoS requirement and energy consumption are considered. An Evolutionary Stable Strategy (ESS) of the game corresponds to the desired AP selection outcome, which remains stable even if the stations occasionally select inappropriate APs. A distributed learning algorithm based on replicator dynamics is developed to obtain the ESS with only local information. Simulation results verify the convergence and effectiveness of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Access Point Selection under QoS Requirements in Variable Channel-Width WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696500030"}
