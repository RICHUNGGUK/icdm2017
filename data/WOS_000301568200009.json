With imperfect channel state information (CSI), traditional scheduling algorithms for the multiuser MIMO system based on the zero forcing precoding scheme will lose some performance due to the multi-user interference (MUI). In order to improve the system average throughput, we study the robust multiuser MIMO scheduling problem with imperfect CSI. From the average capacity formula, we derive a robust factor which can transform the robust multiuser MIMO scheduling problem into the traditional one, thus most existing nonrobust scheduling algorithms can be robust if this factor is adopted. Simulation results show that compared with the traditional algorithms, the proposed robust algorithms can improve the system average throughput significantly under the CSI error environment.", "paper_title": "Robust multiuser MIMO scheduling algorithms with imperfect CSI", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200009"}
