In the network, temporal relations are embedded in the network by adding feedback connections on the first layer of the network, and wavelet basis function is used as fuzzy membership function. An adaptive control scheme based on RFWNN is proposed, in which, two RFWNNs are used to identify and control plant respectively. Simulation experiments are made by applying proposed adaptive control scheme on robotic tracking control problem to confirm its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Adaptive control based on recurrent fuzzy wavelet neural network and its application on robotic tracking control", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000171"}
