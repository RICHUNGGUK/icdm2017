For the synthesis of active sonar returns, we synthesized active sonar returns based on ray tracing algorithm for 3D highlight models. Then, a fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) was applied to the sonar returns to extract the angular position information depending on the target aspect by utilizing separation capability of the time-delayed combination of linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals in the FrFT domain. With the FrFT-based features, three different target angular positions were classified using neural networks.", "paper_title": "Target Angular Position Classification with Synthesized Active Sonar Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300018"}
