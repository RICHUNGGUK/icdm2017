We show that hybrid logic is very well-suited to express the semantic structure of the ambient calculus and how features of hybrid logic can be exploited to reduce the \"administrative overhead\" of the analysis specification and thus simplify it. Finally, we use HyLoTab, a fully automated theorem prover for hybrid logic, both as a convenient platform for a prototype implementation as well as to formally prove the correctness of the analysis.
