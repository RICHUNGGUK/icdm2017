In the present paper, this vague concept is put into a mathematically rigorous form. To this end, we proceed analogously to the case of sharply bordered subsets, for which the Steiner point is frequently used. The function assigning to each convex subset its Steiner point is characterised by three properties; here, we study functions whose domains consist of fuzzy sets and which fulfil analogous properties. Although uniqueness can no longer be achieved, we give a complete characterisation of what we call Steiner points of fuzzy sets. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
