Under the assumption that eye-hand coupling influences observed movements, a motor continuity hypothesis is exploited to account for how gaze shifts are constrained by hand movements. A Bayesian model of such coupling is presented in the form of a novel Dynamic Bayesian Network, namely an Input-Output Coupled Hidden Markov Model. Simulation results are compared to those obtained by eye-tracked human subjects involved in drawing experiments.", "paper_title": "What the draughtsman's hand tells the draughtsman's eye: A sensorimotor account of drawing", "paper_id": "WOS:000258879900015"}
