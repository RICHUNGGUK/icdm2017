This has been the catalyst for many different techniques with this article presenting a comprehensive review of geometric distortion measurement, the diverse metrics applied, and their impact on shape coding. The respective performance of these measuring strategies is analyzed from both a RD and complexity perspective, with a recent distortion measurement technique based on arc-length-parameterization being comparatively evaluated. Some contemporary research challenges are also investigated, including schemes to effectively quantify shape deformation.", "paper_title": "Geometric Distortion Measurement for Shape Coding: A Contemporary Review", "paper_id": "WOS:000297145500006"}
