Nevertheless, the temporal resolution is usually poor so that rapid deformation cannot be measured due to the long revisit time of radar satellites. Bistatic SAR Differential Interferometry technique using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) as illuminator has a shorter revisit time, whereas the measurement accuracy is constrained by low signal power, narrow bandwidth and atmospheric delay error. To cope with these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel subsidence monitoring technique based on Space-Surface bistatic Differential Interferometry (SS-DI) with GNSS transmitters, where two stations consist of a reference one and a measurement one that are deployed on the ground. First, we applied a space differential processing between two stations to cancel identical errors such as tropospheric and ionospheric errors etc. Then we used a long time coherent integration to improve the signal noise ratio. Subsequently, we also utilized a time differential processing to construct double differential equations with respect to unknown deformation variables. Finally, we solved the equations to obtain a highly accurate estimation of three dimension deformation. Furthermore, an SS-DI experiment using Beidou-2 as transmitters was carried out to validate the proposed method, where a high accuracy (0.01 mm) device was utilized to simulate subsidence deformation. The experimental results reveal that the proposed method has better performance of spatial measurement accuracy of 0.53 mm compared with differential GPS method.", "paper_title": "A novel subsidence monitoring technique based on space-surface bistatic differential interferometry using GNSS as transmitters", "paper_id": "WOS:000356404200005"}
