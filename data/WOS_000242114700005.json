Design/methodology/approach - Based on the appraisal factors (including the patent transferor, patent transferee, patent features, and patent trading specifications) and regression model, a patent trading system is developed with an automatic patent appraisal function. Findings - Based on the case study, it is found that the system performance is better if the non-critical factors can be identified and dropped out from the appraisal model. Practical implications - The proposed model and platform can enhance patent trading performance and, therefore, the enterprise R&D tasks can be accomplished more efficiently. Originality/value - This study proposes quantitative models of patent appraisal factors and a multiple regression model for patent appraisal to present an automatic patent price determination mechanism.", "paper_title": "A multiple regression model for patent appraisal", "paper_id": "WOS:000242114700005"}
