Current methods for graph pattern query processing have performance deficiency caused by inefficiencies of the underlying reachability index and costly merge-join operations on huge amounts of tuple-formatted intermediate results. To overcome the above problems, this paper contributes in the following aspects to boost graph pattern query evaluation. First, we propose an improved hop-based reachability indexing scheme 3-Hop* which gains faster reachability query evaluation, less indexing costs and better scalabilities than state-of-the-art hop-based methods. Second, we propose a two-stage node filtering algorithm based on 3-Hop* to answer tree pattern queries more efficiently. Tree pattern queries serve as the underlying facility for graph pattern query evaluation. Furthermore, we use a graph representation of the intermediate results during node filtering and final results enumeration. Experiments on real-life and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Scaling Hop-Based Reachability Indexing for Fast Graph Pattern Query Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000343607500016"}
