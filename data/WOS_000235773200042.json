The difficulty Sterns from the need for fast and robust detection of known objects in the scene given their 3D models, or a set of 2D images or both. This paper proposes a method that conducts a statistical analysis of the appearance of model patches from all possible viewpoints in the scene and incorporates the 3D geometry during both matching and the pose estimation processes. Thereby the appearance information from the 3D model and real images are combined with synthesized images in order to learn the variations in the multiple view feature descriptors using PCA. Furthermore, by analyzing the computed visibility distribution of each patch from different viewpoints, a reliability measure for each patch is estimated. This reliability measure is used to further constrain the classification problem. This results in a more scalable representation reducing the effect of the complexity of the 3D model on the run-time matching performance. Moreover, as required in many real-time applications this approach can yield a reliability measure for the estimated pose. Experimental results show how the pose of complex objects can be estimated efficiently from a single test linage.", "paper_title": "Fusion of 3D and appearance models for fast object detection and pose estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200042"}
