Energy transfer, momentum change, and scattering processes of argon gas atoms from W(1 1 0) surface are discussed. A new model of argon-tungsten (Ar-W) interaction is proposed. Based on the new proposed model, one can simplify the boundary conditions of this problem. The new boundary conditions are proved to be in line with previous experimental and theoretical results. This paper demonstrates how to proceed normalization and further conversion of the MD simulation results into boundary conditions. Application of the new proposed boundary conditions for Ar-W interactions provides a significant speedup of computations. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Inc.
