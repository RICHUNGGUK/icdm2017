A calibrated projector-camera system is applied for automatic registration, radiometric scanning and superimposition. A second modulation of the projected light on the surface of such media results in a high dynamic range visualization. This holds application potential for a variety of domains, such as radiology, astronomy, optical microscopy, conservation and restoration of historic art, modern art and entertainment installations.", "paper_title": "Superimposing Dynamic Range", "paper_id": "WOS:000266986100044"}
