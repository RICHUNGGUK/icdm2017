We present a non-linear model to estimate the remaining useful life of a system based on monitored degradation signals. A diffusion process with a nonlinear drift coefficient with a constant threshold was transformed to a linear model with a variable threshold to characterize the dynamics and nonlinearity of the degradation process. This new diffusion process contrasts sharply with existing models that use a linear drift, and also with models that use a linear drift based on transformed data that were originally nonlinear. Both existing models are based on a constant threshold. To estimate the remaining useful life, an analytical approximation to the distribution of the first hitting time of the diffusion process crossing a threshold level is obtained in a closed form by a time-space transformation under a mild assumption. The unknown parameters in the established model are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation approach, and goodness of fit measures are applied. The usefulness of the proposed model is demonstrated by several real-world examples. The results reveal that considering nonlinearity in the degradation process can significantly improve the accuracy of remaining useful life estimation.", "paper_title": "Remaining Useful Life Estimation Based on a Nonlinear Diffusion Degradation Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500007"}
