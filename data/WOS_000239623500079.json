It has a good performance on the data with compact super-sphere distributions, but tends to fail in the data organized in more complex and unknown shapes. In this paper, we analyze in detail the characteristic property of data clustering and propose a novel dissimilarity measure, named density-sensitive distance metric, which can describe the distribution characteristic of data clustering. By using this dissimilarity measure, a density-sensitive K-Means clustering algorithm is given, which has the ability to identify complex non-convex clusters compared with the original K-Means algorithm. The experimental results on both artificial data sets and real-world problems assess the validity of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A modified K-means clustering with a density-sensitive distance metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500079"}
