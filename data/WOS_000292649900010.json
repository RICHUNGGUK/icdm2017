The modulator employs transmission lines and transconductors as main components and does not require switches in the loop filter as in the case of switched-capacitor (discrete-time) filters. In addition, the proposed complex modulator does not require a quadrature mixer in the receiver. As main feature, the modulator architecture introduces an innovative way to produce the I and Q outputs that is immune to path mismatch due to the sharing of all the analog circuitry for both paths. The one-bit second-order modulator ADC is able to convert IF signals at fs/2 and 3fs/2 (fs = 50 MHz), achieving an ENOB = 10 bits within a 1 MHz signal bandwidth. Therefore the modulator may be feasible for the typical IF frequencies used in cellular base stations. Furthermore, it provides an image rejection grater than 70 dB. The 0.35 mu m BiCMOS chip consumes 28 mW at 3.3 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A one-path subsampling quadrature receiver based on a I I\" pound modulator with distributed resonators", "paper_id": "WOS:000292649900010"}
