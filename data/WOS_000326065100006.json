Under the assumption that the risk-free rate, the volatility, and the average jump intensity are fuzzy numbers, this paper presents the jump-diffusion approach to price vulnerable options in fuzzy environments. We also provide the crisp possibilistic mean jump-diffusion model to price European vulnerable call options and the secant method to obtain the belief degree. Finally, the performance of our model and the algorithm is illustrated with some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "The Fuzzy Jump-Diffusion Model to Pricing European Vulnerable Options", "paper_id": "WOS:000326065100006"}
