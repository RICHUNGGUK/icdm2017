The method starts with a denoising source separation (DSS) of the recordings, and is followed by either an independent component analysis (ICA) or a temporal decorrelation algorithm (FastICA and TDSEP, respectively). This two-step method was compared with DSS, ICA and TDSEP alone. The tests were performed with simulated data based on real EEG signal, to guarantee the existence of a \"ground truth\". The most efficient algorithm, for proper component extraction (regardless of the amount of a-activity in their spectra) is a combination of DSS and ICA. It provided also more stable results than ICA alone. TDSEP, in combination with DSS, was efficient only for the extraction of the components with prominent alpha-activity.", "paper_title": "Comparison of BSS methods for the detection of alpha-activity components in EEG", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300054"}
