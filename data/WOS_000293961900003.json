The new model is based on a generalization of the Stauffer-Grimson background model, where each mixture component is modeled as a dynamic texture. We derive an online K-means algorithm for updating the parameters using a set of sufficient statistics of the model. Finally, we report on experimental results, which show that the proposed background model both quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods in scenes containing significant background motions.", "paper_title": "Generalized Stauffer-Grimson background subtraction for dynamic scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000293961900003"}
