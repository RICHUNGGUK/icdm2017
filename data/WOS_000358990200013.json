To solve this problem, Luo et al. proposed an efficient certificateless online/offline signcryption (COOSC) scheme for IOT. They have also demonstrated that their scheme is provably in the random oracle model. However, in this paper, we will show their scheme is vulnerable to the private key compromised problem, i.e., an adversary could get a user's private key through an intercepted message. The analysis show that Luo et al.'s scheme is not suitable for the IOT.", "paper_title": "On the security of a certificateless online/offline signcryption for Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000358990200013"}
