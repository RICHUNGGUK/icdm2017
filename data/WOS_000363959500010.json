Under the assumption that the degree d of this variety is given, and the power moments of the Lebesgue measure on are known up to order 3d, we describe an algorithmic procedure for obtaining a polynomial vanishing on . The particular case of semi-algebraic sets defined by a single polynomial inequality raises an intriguing question related to the finite determinateness of the full moment sequence. The more general case of a measure with density equal to the exponential of a polynomial is treated in parallel. Our approach relies on Stokes' Theorem on spaces with singularities and simple Hankel-type matrix identities.", "paper_title": "Algebraic-exponential Data Recovery from Moments", "paper_id": "WOS:000363959500010"}
