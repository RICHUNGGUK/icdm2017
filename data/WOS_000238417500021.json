A mobile node chooses a suitable Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) according to its average dwell time and its number of connecting correspondent nodes. Furthermore, a higher MAP may adjust the threshold of MAP selection algorithm periodically according to its traffic load.", "paper_title": "An efficient mobility management scheme for two-level HMIPv6 networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500021"}
