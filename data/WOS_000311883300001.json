In this framework there are various choices for the splitting at the level of the PDEs and many choices for their numerical discretization. Some of the existing flux splitting schemes fall within this framework. For the Euler equations we propose a new flux splitting and study the associated two systems of differential equations, called the advection system and the pressure system. For each of the splittings studied we analyse the resulting two systems of differential equations and propose discretization schemes of the Godunov type. These schemes are simple, robust and accurate when compared with existing methods. Moreover, they enjoy a most desirable property: recognition of contact discontinuities and shear waves.
