Moreover, by deriving the temperature coecient (TC) of the reference current, the temperature compensation condition equations together with a design method of minimizing the thermal drift in a required temperature range are presented. Based on these, the circuit is designed in a standard 0.18 mu m CMOS process and achieves a very low TC of only 16.9 ppm/C in a temperature range between -40 degrees C and 120 degrees C, with 1 degrees A reference current at 27 degrees C. Besides, the current reference can operate at supply voltage down to 1.3 V, with a good supply regulation of 0.5%/V. At 27 degrees C, its power consumption is 8.93 degrees W.", "paper_title": "A VERY LOW-TC SECOND-ORDER TEMPERATURE-COMPENSATED CMOS CURRENT REFERENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000334692700012"}
