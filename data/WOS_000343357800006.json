The optimization procedure is applied to a single pore, subject to operating conditions which reflect a typical pore in the bulk of the foam, far removed from the influences of the macroscopic boundaries of the porous region. Constraints are imposed upon the geometry to ensure the pore structure arrived at may be manufactured by a reasonable process, and to ensure the validity of the analysis. The optimal, ellipsoidal pore geometry obtained is found to achieve a significant reduction in the resistance to convective thermal exchange between constituents, at the cost of an increased resistance to fluid flow.
