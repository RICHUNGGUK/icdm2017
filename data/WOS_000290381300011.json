We have studied some desired properties of the developed operators, such as idempotency, boundary, etc. Moreover, we have developed two approaches to deal with group decision making problems under linguistic environment. If the weighting vector of the decision makers is known, we develop an approach which is based on the 2-tuple linguistic weighted PA operator. On the other hand, if the weighting vector of the decision makers is unknown, we develop another approach which is based on the 2TLPOWA operator. Finally, a practical example is given to illustrate the multiple attribute group decision making process, a comparative study to fuzzy additive weighted averaging (FAWA) operator method is also demonstrated.
