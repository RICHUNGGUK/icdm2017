In this paper, we propose a new 3-D motion estimation method based on matrix completion. Taking a reconstructed 3-D mesh as the underlying scene representation, this method automatically estimates motions of 3-D objects. A \"separating + merging\" framework is introduced to multiview 3-D motion estimation. In the separating step, initial motions are first estimated for each view with a neighboring view. Then, in the merging step, the motions obtained by each view are merged together and optimized by low-rank matrix completion method. The most accurate motion estimation for each vertex in the recovered matrix is further selected by three spatiotemporal criteria. Experimental results on data sets with synthetic motions and real motions show that our method can reliably estimate 3-D motions.", "paper_title": "Three-Dimensional Motion Estimation via Matrix Completion", "paper_id": "WOS:000302097000020"}
