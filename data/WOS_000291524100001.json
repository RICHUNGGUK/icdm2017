Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the scatternet constructed by BGN algorithm is efficient in terms of the number of bridge nodes, average data transmission distance, network reliablity and overall network traffic.", "paper_title": "BGN: A novel scattemet formation algorithm for bluetooth-based sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291524100001"}
