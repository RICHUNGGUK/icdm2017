Although the optimality of a marker sequence can be determined in several ways, we consider minimum preparation cost as a key objective in clothing production. The traditional algorithms and the simple evolutionary algorithms used in marker optimization today have relied on minimizing the number of markers, which only indirectly reduces production costs. In this paper we propose a hybrid self-adaptive evolutionary algorithm (HSA-EA) for marker optimization that improves the results of the previous algorithms and successfully deals with the objective of minimum preparation cost.
