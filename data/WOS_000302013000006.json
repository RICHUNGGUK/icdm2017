The proposed framework is based on a switched system approach, and relies on a supervisory switching within a family of pre-computed candidate controllers without individual fault detection and isolation schemes. Each fault set can be accommodated either by one candidate controller or by a set of controllers under an appropriate switching law. Two aircraft examples are included to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "SUPERVISORY FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL WITH INTEGRATED FAULT DETECTION AND ISOLATION: A SWITCHED SYSTEM APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000302013000006"}
