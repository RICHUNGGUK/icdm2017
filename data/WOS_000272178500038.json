In particular, rigid multibody dynamic analysis is utilized to calculate dynamic loads of a multibody system and a structural optimization algorithm using equivalent static loads transformed from the dynamic loads are used to design the flexible components in the multibody dynamic system. The equivalent static loads, which are derived from equations of motion, are used as multiple loading conditions of linear structural optimization. A simple example is solved to verify the proposed methodology and the pelvis part of the biped humanoid, a complex multibody system which consists of many bodies and joints, is redesigned using the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Optimization of flexible components of multibody systems via equivalent static loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500038"}
