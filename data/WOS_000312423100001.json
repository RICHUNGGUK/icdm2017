The main theoretical lens is organizational control theories. Results show that CRM use strengthened formal control and informal control simultaneously. Formal control was significantly boosted by enhanced outcome measurability and process visibility of sales work. CRM use also facilitated informal control, by serving as the carrier of new institutional processes and sales philosophy, which bolstered clan control, and by functioning as tools for self-control.
