These technologies are usually considered as alternates for static RAM, dynamic RAM, and Flash. In this paper, a novel digital circuit, the multistate register, is proposed. The multistate register is different from conventional types of memory, and is used to store multiple data bits, where only a single bit is active and the remaining data bits are idle. The active bit is stored within a CMOS flip flop, while the idle bits are stored in an RRAM crossbar co-located with the flip flop. It is demonstrated that additional states require an area overhead of 1.4% per state for a 64-state register. The use of multistate registers as pipeline registers is demonstrated for a novel multithreading architecture-continuous flow multithreading (CFMT), where the total area overhead in the CPU pipeline is only 2.5% for 16 threads compared with a single thread CMOS pipeline. The use of multistate registers in the CFMT microarchitecture enables higher performance processors (40% average performance improvement) with relatively low energy (6.5% average energy reduction) and area overhead.", "paper_title": "Multistate Register Based on Resistive RAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100016"}
