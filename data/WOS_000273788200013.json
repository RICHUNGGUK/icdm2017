The idea is to characterize the temporal evolution of the symptoms of this ill-known disease by modelling patients' data in a Fuzzy Temporal Constraint Network. We discuss how the system is able to manage both fuzzy qualitative and metric constraints allowing to represent in a flexible manner the symptoms of different patients. In this way it is possible to deduce characteristic periods of an ill-known disease such as SARS was. A new user interface is included into the architecture of the System.", "paper_title": "Temporal-based medical diagnoses using a Fuzzy Temporal Reasoning System", "paper_id": "WOS:000273788200013"}
