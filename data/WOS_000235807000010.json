The workshop brought together researchers and practitioners from two communities: aspect-oriented software development (AOSD) and software model engineering. It provided a forum for discussing the state of the art in modeling crosscutting concerns at different stages of the software development process: requirements elicitation and analysis, software architecture, detailed design, and mapping to aspect-oriented programming constructs. This paper gives an overview of the accepted submissions, and summarizes the results of the different discussion groups.", "paper_title": "Report of the 7th International Workshop on Aspect-Oriented Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000010"}
