A core problem in such missions is the ability to visit distant places in rough terrain. Traditionally, the motion of modular robots is modeled using locomotion generators that can provide various gaits, e.g. crawling or walking. However, pure locomotion generation cannot ensure that desired places in a complex environment with obstacles will in fact be reached. These cases require several locomotion generators providing motion primitives that are switched using a planning process that takes the obstacles into account. In this paper, we present a novel motion planning method for modular robots equipped with elementary motion primitives. The utilization of primitives significantly reduces the complexity of the motion planning which enables plans to be created for robots of arbitrary shapes. The primitives used here do not need to cope with environmental changes, which can therefore be realized using simple locomotion generators that are scalable, i.e., the primitives can provide motion for robots with many modules. As the motion primitives are realized using locomotion generators, no reconfiguration is required and the proposed approach can thus be used even for modular robots without self-reconfiguration capabilities. The performance of the proposed algorithm has been experimentally verified in various environments, in physical simulations and also in hardware experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
