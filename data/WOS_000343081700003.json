We also present a new hybrid public-key encryption scheme that has this feature, which is based on the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. We have proven that the new hybrid public-key encryption scheme is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack in the standard model. The \"full public verifiability\" feature means that the new scheme has a shorter ciphertext and reduces the security requirements of the symmetric encryption scheme. Therefore, our new scheme does not need any message authentication code, even when the one-time symmetric encryption scheme is passive attacks secure. Compared with all existing publickey encryption schemes that are secure to the adaptive chosen ciphertext attack, our new scheme has a shorter ciphertext, efficient tight security reduction, and fewer requirements ( if the symmetric encryption scheme can resist passive attacks).", "paper_title": "Tight chosen ciphertext attack (CCA)-secure hybrid encryption scheme with full public verifiability", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700003"}
