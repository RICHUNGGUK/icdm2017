We aim to visualize this behavior by extracting topologically relevant flow volumes from statistics accumulated during particle traversal of the flow field. To guarantee a sufficiently dense sampling of the flow field, we use adaptive time-surfaces for the computation of these trajectory statistics. The proposed volume extraction technique operates in parameter space of the computed time-surfaces and facilitates fast extraction of boundary geometry at different levels of detail. Our results visualize flow transfer functions in the form of volumes for extrema of different time-surface statistics and demonstrate their benefit for flow analysis. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
