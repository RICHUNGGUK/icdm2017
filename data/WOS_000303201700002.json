We investigate the fundamental relationship between event detection and energy efficiency. We quantify event detection performance by deriving the closed forms of detection delay and detectability with a relatively simple model. We also characterize the intrinsic tradeoff that exists between detection performance and system lifetime, which helps flexible design decisions for sensor networks. In addition, we propose a fully localized algorithm called CAS to cooperatively determine sensor wakeups. Without relying on location information, the distributed algorithm is easy to implement and scalable to network density and scale. Theoretical bounds of event detection are also studied to facilitate comparative study. Comprehensive experiments are conducted and results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves event detection performance in terms of detection latency and detection probability. It reduces as high as 31% of detection delay and increases as much as 25% of detectability compared with the random independent scheme.", "paper_title": "Optimizing event detection in low duty-cycled sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303201700002"}
