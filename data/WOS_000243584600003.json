A full-order dynamic output feedback H-infinity control design approach is developed by combining a fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov function and a transformation on the controller parameters, which leads to sufficient conditions in the form of strict linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The fuzzy-basis-dependent results are less conservative due to the generality of the fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov function used which includes the fuzzy-basis-independent one as a special case. It has been shown that the underling full-order dynamic output feedback He,, control problem can be solved as LMI optimization problems that can be computed numerically very efficiently. Finally, two numerical examples, concerning the control of a discrete-time chaotic Lorenz system and an inverted pendulum, are given to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Dynamic output feedback H-infinity control of discrete-time fuzzy systems: a fuzzy-basis-dependent Lyapunov function approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000243584600003"}
