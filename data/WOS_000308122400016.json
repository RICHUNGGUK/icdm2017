At the end of this activity, they deliver precise geometric schemas as solutions to particular problems. More research on this topic is needed to develop productive tools. The authors propose orthogonal compartment placement (OCP) as a new approach to this activity. OCP includes a problem formulation and a solution method in which qualitative and quantitative knowledge are combined. Topological knowledge underlies human spatial reasoning. Computers can adequately perform repetitive topological reasoning. We believe that OCP is the first approach in CAAD to incorporate a full relational algebra to generate floor plan layouts. Based on block algebra (BA) and constraint satisfaction (CS), OCP can generate candidate solutions that correspond to distinct topological options. The analysis of a case study using a prototype tool is included. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
