We parallelize LSM with space decomposition, turning it into an embarrassingly parallel algorithm. The program is implemented with Parallel Virtual Machine and ALGLIB. Our method gives accurate option prices with excellent speedup. Although this paper focuses on the pricing of options, the methodology is applicable to much more complex financial derivatives.", "paper_title": "Accelerating the least-square Monte Carlo method with parallel computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000360390700019"}
