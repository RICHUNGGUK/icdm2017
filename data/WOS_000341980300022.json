Single-letter upper and lower bounds are for the maximum achievable key rate. The bounds are shown to match for a large class of private channels. A counter-example shows that the bounds do not match in general, and a better cooperative scheme can narrow the gap.", "paper_title": "Multiterminal Secret Key Agreement", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300022"}
