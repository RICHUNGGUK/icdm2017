We focus on supporting drivers in poor visibility conditions. Fog is one of the causes that lead to lack of visibility. In this paper, we propose a method of judging fog density by using in-vehicle camera images and millimeter-wave (mm-W) radar data. This method determines fog density by evaluating both the visibility of a preceding vehicle and the distance to it. Experiments showed that judgments made by the proposed method achieve a precision rate of 85% when compared to the ground-truth obtained by human judgments.", "paper_title": "Fog density recognition by in-vehicle camera and millimeter wave radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700010"}
