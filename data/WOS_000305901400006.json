The novelty of this proposal relies on the fact that this is the first proposal to use a PID to control a network parameter in PONs. As the PID takes into account present, past and possible future errors in the bandwidth adjustment, this self-adapting technique results in a very robust process. Simulation results exhibit that not only is it faster and more stable than other algorithms, but also it auto-adapts the resources very efficiently when facing real time changes in the network parameters or in the bandwidth conditions. In fact, the standard deviation of the difference between the allocated and the guaranteed bandwidth is reduced by up to 50% and the convergence speed is up to four times quicker than other proposals.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a PID Controller for the Bandwidth Assignment in Long-Reach PONs", "paper_id": "WOS:000305901400006"}
