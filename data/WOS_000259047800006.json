The feature of this protocol is that the sender encodes the secret message directly on a sequence of particle states and faithfully transmits them to an arbitrary one of two receivers without revealing any information to a potential eavesdropper. On the other hand, we construct the efficient quantum circuit to implement the QSDC by means of primitive operations in quantum computation.", "paper_title": "Controlled quantum secure direct communication with W state", "paper_id": "WOS:000259047800006"}
