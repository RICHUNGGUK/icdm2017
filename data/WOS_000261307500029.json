A co-variant of the popular clonal selection principle called as the Objective Switching Clonal Selection Algorithm (OSCSA) has been developed and implemented successfully for the multi-objective design optimization of composites. The problem is formulated with multiple objectives of minimizing weight and the total cost of the composite component to achieve if specified strength. The primary optimization variables are-the number of layers, its stacking sequence (the orientation of the layers) and thickness of each layer. The classical lamination theory is utilized to determine the stresses in the component and the design is evaluated based on three failure criteria; failure-mechanism-based failure criteria, maximum stress failure criteria and the Tsai-Wu failure criteria. The optimization method is validated for a number of different loading configurations-uniaxial, biaxial and bending loads. The design optimization has been carried for both variable stacking sequences as well as fixed standard stacking schemes and a comparative study of the different design configurations evolved has been presented.
