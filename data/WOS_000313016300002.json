Therefore, it is important to be aware of the limitations of data provided by ISI. This article deals with a limitation that disproportionally affects the Social Sciences: ISI's misclassification of journal articles containing original research into the \"review\" or \"proceedings paper\" category. I report on a comprehensive, 11 year analysis, of document categories for 27 journals in nine Social Science and Science disciplines. I show that although ISI's \"proceedings paper\" and \"review\" classifications seem to work fairly well in the Sciences, they illustrate a profound misunderstanding of research and publication practices in the Social Sciences.", "paper_title": "Document categories in the ISI Web of Knowledge: Misunderstanding the Social Sciences?", "paper_id": "WOS:000313016300002"}
