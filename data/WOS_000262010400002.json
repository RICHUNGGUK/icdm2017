This paper shows, however. that it is NP-hard to generate a minimum complete test set for stuck-at faults oil the wires of a reversible circuit using a polynomial time reduction from 3SAT to the problem. We also show non-trivial lower hounds for the size of a minimum complete test set.", "paper_title": "On Fault Testing for Reversible Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400002"}
