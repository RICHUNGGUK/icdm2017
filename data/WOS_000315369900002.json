In contrast, the matrixized classifier is supposed to consider both the class and the individual structures, and thus gets a superior performance to the vectorized classifier. In this paper, we explore one middle granularity named the cluster between the class and individual, and introduce the cluster structure that means the structure within each class into the matrixized classifier design. Doing so can simultaneously utilize the class, the cluster, and the individual structures in the way that is from global to point. Therefore, the proposed classifier design here owns the three-fold structural information, and can bring the classification performance to an improving trend. In practice, we adopt the Modification of Ho-Kashyap algorithm with Squared approximation of the misclassification errors (MHKS) as the learning paradigm and develop a Three-fold Structured MHKS named TSMHKS. The advantage of the three-fold structural learning framework is considering different close degrees between samples so as to improve the performance. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the TSMHKS. Furthermore, we discuss the theoretical and experimental generalization bound of the proposed algorithm.
