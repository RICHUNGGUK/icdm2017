Then different types of traffic that an SGCN is anticipated to carry are studied along with their QoS requirements. Subsequently, a number of critical challenges from the wireless technology and networking perspectives are addressed. They include wireless mesh routing and QoS provisioning to efficiently support realtime and non-real-time traffic, intelligent data filtering, and fusion to reduce redundancy and minimize network traffic while ensuring information integrity, optimal network design, and, finally, security concerns.", "paper_title": "CHALLENGES AND RESEARCH OPPORTUNITIES IN WIRELESS COMMUNICATION NETWORKS FOR SMART GRID", "paper_id": "WOS:000321278800013"}
