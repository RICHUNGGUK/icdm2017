This paper presents a fast pedestrian detection method using color information. It firstly scans a pair of sequential gray-scale frames to select candidates using both appearance and motion feature; and then uses information of each color channel (RGB) to do a further confirmation with Support vector machine based classifiers. Compared with pedestrian detection systems that only use gray-scale information. the system using our method has almost the same detection speed: at the same time. it also gets a better detection rate and false-positive rate. The experiment in a pedestrian detection system with a single optical camera proves the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Fast pedestrian detection using color information", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800068"}
