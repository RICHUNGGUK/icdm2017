Starting with the physically meaningful block model, we present a novel approach to simplify the block model and propose a simplified physical knowledge-based (SPK) model. The SPK model's performance was experimentally assessed by two types of PAs (a LDMOS Doherty PA and a GaN Doherty PA) and two signals (a single carrier 16QAM signal and a 2-carrier WCDMA signal). All experimental results prove the superiority of the SPK model. Compared with the 1st-dynamic deviation reduction (DDR) approach and the 2nd-simplified DDR approach, the SPK approach achieves average ACPR improvements of 4.4 dB and 2.5 dB, respectively.
