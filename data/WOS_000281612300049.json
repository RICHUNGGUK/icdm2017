Filippov theory is utilized to study the viability, namely, the existence of the solution of the Cauchy problem. Under some conditions, the existence and the asymptotical stability of a periodic solution are derived. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
