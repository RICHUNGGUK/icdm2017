Both correctness and performance are considered important issues in the design of such systems. To guarantee the correctness of results, voting-based and trust-based sabotage-tolerance mechanisms are generally used. However, these mechanisms suffer from two potential shortcomings: waste of resources due to running redundant replications of the task, and increased turnaround times due to the inability to deal with dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a priority-based list scheduling (PUS) system for sabotage-tolerance with deadline tasks. it is based on the classification of volunteers according to their credibility and result return probability. Using these two parameters, our desktop grid system can provide both correct results and shorter turnaround times. In addition, simulation results show that compared to existing result verification mechanisms, the PUS can reduce resource waste in result verification without increasing turnaround times.", "paper_title": "Priority based list scheduling for sabotage-tolerance with deadline tasks in desktop grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000256577700006"}
