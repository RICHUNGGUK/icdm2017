This in turn led to a misstatement in the description of a family of graphs demonstrating the tightness of the main result. In this short note, we fix this inaccuracy and also take the opportunity. kindly provided by the editors, to close a gap in the proofs of two of the technical lemmas. We like to point the readers to http:/ /www.math.tau.ac.il/(similar to)krivelev/papers.html, where a corrected version of the article appears. (C) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
