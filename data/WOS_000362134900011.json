The design and development of an advanced system, equipped with dedicated hardware in the loop, for cooperative training of operators involved in the last mile of navigation is presented. Indeed, the article describes the software and hardware development of a distributed and interoperable system composed by two simulators (the bridge ship simulator and control tower simulator). Multiple problems are faced and solved including (i) the motion of the ship at sea that is based on a 6 Degree Of Freedom (DOF) model for surge, sway and yaw and closed form expressions for pitch, roll and heave and its validation; (ii) the development of the 3D geometric models and related virtual environments of a real marine port and vessel (to provide the trainees with the sensation to experience a real port and ship environment); (iii) the design of a bridge ship replica, the bridge hardware integration and the design of the visualization system; (iv) the design and development of the control tower simulator; (v) the integration of the bridge ship simulator and control tower simulator through the IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture standard for distributed simulation.
