One such optimization problem is topology design of distributed local area networks (DLANs). The problem is defined as a multi-objective optimization problem requiring simultaneous optimization of monetary cost, average network delay, hop count between communicating nodes, and reliability under a set of constraints. This paper presents a multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm to efficiently solve the DLAN topology design problem. Fuzzy logic is incorporated in the PSO algorithm to handle the multi-objective nature of the problem. Specifically, a recently proposed fuzzy aggregation operator, namely the unified And-Or operator (Khan and Engelbrecht in Inf. Sci. 177: 2692-2711, 2007), is used to aggregate the objectives. The proposed fuzzy PSO (FPSO) algorithm is empirically evaluated through a preliminary sensitivity analysis of the PSO parameters. FPSO is also compared with fuzzy simulated annealing and fuzzy ant colony optimization algorithms. Results suggest that the fuzzy PSO is a suitable algorithm for solving the DLAN topology design problem.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy particle swarm optimization algorithm for computer communication network topology design", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200010"}
