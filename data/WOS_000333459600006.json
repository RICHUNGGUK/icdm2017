The proposed method allows for an arbitrary number of materials, produces high-quality tetrahedral meshes with upper and lower bounds on dihedral angles, and guarantees geometric fidelity. Moreover, the method is combinatoric so its implementation enables rapid mesh construction. These meshes are structured in a way that also allows grading, to reduce element counts in regions of homogeneity. Additionally, we provide proofs showing that both element quality and geometric fidelity are bounded using this approach.", "paper_title": "Lattice Cleaving: A Multimaterial Tetrahedral Meshing Algorithm with Guarantees", "paper_id": "WOS:000333459600006"}
