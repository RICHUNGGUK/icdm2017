To provide statistical testing procedures for community detection in social networks, a scanning method has been developed based on the likelihood of Poisson random graph. However, the scan statistics did not consider detecting communities of the attributes with power-law distribution. Power-law distribution, generally followed by network attributes, is conspicuous in many scientific situations. This paper aims at extending the scanning method to analyze a social network in which attributes follow power-law distribution. Besides the theoretical construction, simulation studies are performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, and an authorship network is used to demonstrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Power-law distributions of attributes in community detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300020"}
