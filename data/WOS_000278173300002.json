Sufficient conditions for internal stability and L-1-performance analysis are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Based on the results, a simple approach to the design of a linear state-feedback controller is presented to stabilize robustly the uncertain time-delay systems and achieve a desired level of disturbance attenuation. All the obtained conditions are delay-dependent. A numerical example is included to illustrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Persistent bounded disturbance rejection for uncertain time-delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278173300002"}
