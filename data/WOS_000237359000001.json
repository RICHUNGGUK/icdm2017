In addition, we present a new learning method that acquires recursive forms of these structures from traces of successful problem solving. We report experiments in three different domains that demonstrate the generality of this approach. In closing, we review related work on learning complex skills and discuss directions for future research on this topic.", "paper_title": "Learning recursive control programs from problem solving", "paper_id": "WOS:000237359000001"}
