We propose a threshold policy that makes a crashing decision contingent on a project's current status; crashing an activity to compensate delayed starting time from a predetermined threshold. First, we present a dynamic programming (DP) formulation to find the threshold values, and prove that the resulting threshold policy is optimal for a serial-graph project. Since the above optimality does not hold generally, we develop a DP-based procedure to construct a threshold policy for arbitrary-graph projects. We show through the computational experiments that our threshold policy is rapidly constructed by this procedure, and its cost is not very far from the theoretical lower bound. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
