However, there is no comprehensive non-redundant database for all such human genes. Results: We leveraged the effective platform of GeneCards, the human gene compendium, together with the power of fRNAdb and additional primary sources, to judiciously unify all ncRNA gene entries obtainable from 15 different primary sources. Overlapping entries were clustered to unified locations based on an algorithm employing genomic coordinates. This allowed GeneCards' gamut of relevant entries to rise similar to 5-fold, resulting in similar to 80 000 human non-redundant ncRNAs, belonging to 14 classes. Such 'grand unification' within a regularly updated data structure will assist future ncRNA research.", "paper_title": "Non-redundant compendium of human ncRNA genes in GeneCards", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722800014"}
