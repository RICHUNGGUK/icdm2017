This work is motivated by the growing need for end-to-end virtual services to support high-volume data transfer applications such as large data Center, grid applications and storage area networks over multi-domain networks. The virtualization of network services has to deal with some important issues, such as dynamic provisioning, sharing control, isolation and security. We have developed and implemented a solution called user control Virtual Service that allows the user to deploy and share different virtual services over a multi-domain network. UCVS is a network-driven virtual service solution that enables the coordinated provisioning and reuse of physical and virtualized computing, storage and network resources from shared pools. UCVS ensures that applications are dynamically supported throughout multi-domain infrastructure. UCVS also achieves cross-technology orchestration, helping further progress towards a service-oriented infrastructure.
