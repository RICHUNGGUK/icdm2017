Due to the moderate complexity of their targeted operations, these accelerators must be managed with minimal run-time overhead. In this paper, we present a methodology for applying flow-shop scheduling techniques to make effective, low-overhead use of fine-grained DSP accelerators. We formulate the underlying scheduling approach in terms of general flow-shop scheduling concepts, and demonstrate our methodology concretely by applying it to MPEG-4 video decoding. We present quantitative experiments on a soft processor that runs on a field-programmable gate array, and provide insight on trends and trade-offs among different flow-shop scheduling approaches when applied to run-time management of fine-grained acceleration.", "paper_title": "A Low-overhead Scheduling Methodology for Fine-grained Acceleration of Signal Processing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278580800006"}
