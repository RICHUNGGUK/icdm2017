Due to the scarcity of data in high dimensions, full nonparametric estimation of the likelihood functions for each population is impractical. Instead, we propose to build a class of estimated nonparametric candidate likelihood models based on a Markov property and to provide multiple likelihood estimates that are useful for guiding a classification algorithm. Our density estimates require only estimates of one and two-dimensional marginal distributions, which can effectively get around the curse of dimensionality problem. A classification algorithm based on those estimated likelihoods is presented. A modification to it utilizing variable selection of differences in log of estimated marginal densities is also suggested to specifically handle high dimensional data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
