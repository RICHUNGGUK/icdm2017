However, it is not efficient for the macroblock types to be coded by the mb_skip_run and mb_type syntax elements separately. In this paper, we propose an efficient coding method based on the new single combined syntax element of mb_skip_run and mbjype, as well as the effective VLC code. Simulation results show that the proposed method offers a further efficiency gain for various coding conditions. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
