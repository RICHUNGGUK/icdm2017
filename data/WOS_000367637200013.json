Existing consolidation mechanisms are not efficient in cloud data centers, which have heterogeneous hardware infrastructure, huge scale, and highly variable non-stationary workloads. We use game theory to develop a novel distributed mechanism for both heterogeneous and homogeneous data centers of cloud computing. Our mathematical analysis shows that our mechanism converges after a finite number of migrations. In addition, we show that our worst case power consumption is only 23% more than the theoretical minimum. In order to validate our claim, we preform simulation in CloudSim with real workload traces from Google data centers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
