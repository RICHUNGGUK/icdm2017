Signals are described through sparse linear combinations of signal-atoms over a redundant-dictionary. Therefore, we propose a novel super-resolution framework using an overcomplete-dictionary based on effective imagerepresentations such as edges, contours and high-order structures. This scheme recovers the vector of common sparse-representations between low-resolution and corresponding high-resolution imagepatches by solving the l(1)-regularized least-squared problem; subsequently, it reconstructs the HR output by multiplying it with the learned dictionary. The dictionary used in the proposed-technique contains more effective image-representations than those in previous approaches because it contains featuredescriptors such as edges, contours and motion-selective features. Therefore, the proposed-technique is more robust to various types of distortion. A saliency-map quickens this technique by confining the optimization-process to visually salient regions. Experimental analyses confirm the effectiveness of the proposed-scheme, and its quantitative and qualitative performance as compared with other state-of-the-art super-resolution algorithms.
