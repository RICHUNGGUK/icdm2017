In current modelling systems, however, the semantics of such families are unclear and ambiguous. We present the Declarative Family of Objects Model (DFOM), which enables us to adequately specify and maintain family semantics. In this model, not only geometry, but also topology is specified declaratively, by means of constraints. A family of objects is modelled by a DFOM with multiple realizations. A member of the family is modelled by adding constraints, e.g. to set dimension variables, until a single realization remains. The declarative approach guarantees that the realization of a family member is also a realization of the family. The realization of a family member is found by solving first the geometric constraints, and then the topological constraints. From the geometric solution, a cellular model is constructed. Topological constraints indirectly specify which combinations of cellular model entities are allowed in the realization. The system of topological constraints is mapped to a Boolean constraint satisfaction problem. The realization is found by solving this problem using a SAT solver. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
