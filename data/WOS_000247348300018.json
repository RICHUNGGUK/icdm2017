This interface allows modelers to automatically convert models, represented in the toolbox's own format (SBmodels) to SBML files. Since SBmodels do not explicitly contain all the information that is required to generate SBML, the necessary information is gathered by parsing SBmodels. The export can be done in two different ways. First, it is possible to call the export from the command line, thereby directly converting a model to an SBML file. The second option is to inspect and edit the conversion results with the help of a graphical user interface and to subsequently export the model to SBML.", "paper_title": "SBML export interface for the systems biology toolbox for MATLAB", "paper_id": "WOS:000247348300018"}
