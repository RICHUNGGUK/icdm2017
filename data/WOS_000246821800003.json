Sensor radios available so far have been engineered for consumer-grade applications, featuring low cost, low power, and minimal radio complexity. In order to utilize such radios for factory applications, their channel characteristics and link quality must be investigated for optimal design and reliability assessment. In this paper, a series of measurements were made with IEEE 802.15.4-compliant sensor radios to study both their spatial and temporal characteristics with respect to the factory surroundings found in a university machine shop. Critical communication properties were investigated in terms of received signal strength, link quality indication, and packet error rate. It is found that received signal strength shows dependency on surrounding structures, radio link qualities with respect to received signal strength and link quality indication are stable before a grey zone is reached, and average link quality indicator serves as a better packet success rate indication than average received signal strength indication. The findings in this paper provide a useful guidance to the ongoing explorations for a methodology to predict radio performance at any location within a given factory floor plan and to online assess the time-variant link qualities.", "paper_title": "Channel characterization and link quality assessment of IEEE 802.15.4-compliant radio for factory environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000246821800003"}
