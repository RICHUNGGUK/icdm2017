We describe a new, efficient initialization procedure for such open systems. With this procedure, an n-qubit device that is originally maximally mixed, but is in contact with a heat bath of bias epsilon >> 2(-n), can be almost perfectly initialized. This performance is optimal due to a newly discovered threshold effect: For bias epsilon << 2(-n) no cooling procedure can, even in principle (running indefinitely without any decoherence), significantly initialize even a single qubit.", "paper_title": "Physical limits of heat-bath algorithmic cooling", "paper_id": "WOS:000246299400010"}
