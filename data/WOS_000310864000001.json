We explore the lowness notions associated with these randomness notions. While these bounded notions seem far from classical notions with infinite tests like Martin-Lof and Demuth randomness, the lowness notions associated with bounded randomness turn out to be intertwined with the lowness notions for these two concepts. In fact, in one case, we get a new and likely very useful characterization of K-triviality. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
