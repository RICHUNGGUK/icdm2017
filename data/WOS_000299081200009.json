A k-connected m-dominating set (kmCDS) is necessary for fault tolerance and routing flexibility. In order to construct a kmCDS with the minimum size, some approximation algorithms have been proposed in literature. However, the proposed algorithms either only consider some special cases where k=1, 2 or ka parts per thousand currency signm, or not easy to implement, or cannot provide performance ratio. In this paper, we propose a centralized heuristic algorithm, CSAA, which is easy to implement, and two distributed algorithms, DDA and DPA, which are deterministic and probabilistic methods respectively, to construct a kmCDS for general k and m. Theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that our algorithms are efficient and effective.", "paper_title": "On the construction of k-connected m-dominating sets in wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000299081200009"}
