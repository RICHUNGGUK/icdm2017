First, a unified model of networked control system is proposed, which has two significant features: (a) the fault statistics of each sensor is individually quantified and (b) stochastic sensor faults and nonideal network Quality of Services (QoS), such as data dropout and network-induced delay, are coupled in a unified framework. Secondly, based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and the stochastic analysis technique, sufficient network-QoS-dependent conditions are derived for the stability analysis and controller design, respectively. Moreover, a modified cone complementary linearisation (CCL) algorithm is also introduced to solve the nonlinear matrix inequalities in the controller design. Finally, two examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
