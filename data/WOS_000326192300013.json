Human-centric driver assistance systems, with integrated sensing, processing and networking, aim to find solutions to this problem and other relevant issues. The key technology in such systems is the capability to automatically understand and characterize driver behaviors. In this paper, we propose a novel, efficient feature extraction approach for driving postures from a video camera, which consists of Homomorphic filter, skin-like regions segmentation, canny edge detection, connected regions detection, small connected regions deletion and spatial scale ratio calculation. With features extracted from a driving posture dataset we created at Southeast University (SEU), holdout and cross-validation experiments on driving posture classification are then conducted using Bayes classifier. Compared with a number of commonly used classification methods including naive Bayes classifier, subspace classifier, linear perception classifier and Parzen classifier, the holdout and cross-validation experiments show that the Bayes classifier offers better classification performance than the other four classifiers. Among the four predefined classes, i.e., grasping the steering wheel, operating the shift gear, eating a cake and talking on a cellular phone, the class of talking on a cellular phone is the most difficult to classify. With Bayes classifier, the classification accuracies of talking on a cellular phone are over 90 % in holdout and cross-validation experiments, which shows the effectiveness of the proposed feature extraction method and the importance of Bayes classifier in automatically understanding and characterizing driver behaviors towards human-centric driver assistance systems.", "paper_title": "Vision-based Classification of Driving Postures by Efficient Feature Extraction and Bayesian Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000326192300013"}
