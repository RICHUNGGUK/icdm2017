By using OCT, we obtain tomograms and two-dimensional images of LCD panels. Based on these images, we construct three-dimensional images of the LCD panel and confirm the three-dimensional shape and vertical location of eventual defects with in the LCD panel. This nondestructive and effective defect-inspection method for LCD using OCT that gives direct results and is applicable for detecting defects in flat panel or flexible displays.
