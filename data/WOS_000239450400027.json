However, training a SVM is very costly in terms of time and memory consumption when the data set is large. In contrast, the SVM decision function is fully determined by a small subset of the training data, called support vectors. Therefore, removing any training samples that are not relevant to support vectors might have no effect on building the proper decision function. In this paper, an effective hybrid method is proposed to remove from the training set the data that is irrelevant to the final decision function, and thus the number of vectors for SVM training becomes small and the training time can be decreased greatly. Experimental results show that a significant amount of training data can be discarded by our methods without compromising the generalization capability of SVM.", "paper_title": "A hybrid method for speeding SVM training", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400027"}
