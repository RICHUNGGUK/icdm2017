Some mathematical properties of the new family including asymptotes and shapes, moments, quantile and generating functions, extreme values and order statistics are fully investigated. We propose the log-exponentiated Weibull geometric and log-exponentiated log-logistic geometric regression models to cope with censored data. The model parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. Three examples with real data expose quite well the new family.", "paper_title": "The exponentiated G geometric family of distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000349904400010"}
