Compatibility operators such as cardinality, orientation, density, and multidimensional length act on both in raw data and information granules which are formed from raw data providing a framework for human-like information processing where information granulation is intrinsic. Granular computing, as a computational concept, is not new, however it is only relatively recent when this concept has been formalised computationally via the use of Computational Intelligence methods such as Fuzzy Logic and Rough Sets. Neutrosophy is a unifying field in logics that extents the concept of fuzzy sets into a three-valued logic that uses an indeterminacy value, and it is the basis of neutrosophic logic, neutrosophic probability, neutrosophic statistics and interval valued neutrosophic theory. In this paper we present a new framework for creating Granular Computing Neural-Fuzzy modelling structures via the use of Neutrosophic Logic to address the issue of uncertainty during the data granulation process. The theoretical and computational aspects of the approach are presented and discussed in this paper, as well as a case study using real industrial data. The case study under investigation is the predictive modelling of the Charpy Toughness of heat-treated steel; a process that exhibits very high uncertainty in the measurements due to the thermomechanical complexity of the Charpy test itself. The results show that the proposed approach leads to more meaningful and simpler granular models, with a better generalisation performance as compared to other recent modelling attempts on the same data set.
