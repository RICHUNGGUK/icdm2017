Based on the information shared by the yard storage subsystem and the YC scheduling subsystem, and the interaction between these subsystems, a coordination scheduling model, which is composed of a storage subsystem model, a YC scheduling subsystem and a coordinate controller model, is developed. A coupling algorithm, which is based on a genetic mechanism, is developed to solve the coordination scheduling problem. The algorithm adopts the genetic selection, crossover and mutation operations to adjust the yard storage plan and the YC scheduling plan. The performance of the coordination scheduling model and that of the proposed coupling algorithm are confirmed with reference to a numerical example. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
