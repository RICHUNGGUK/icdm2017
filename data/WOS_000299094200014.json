In this paper, we consider geometric versions of the problem, where all points in a Euclidean space are candidates for network nodes, and present the first general approach for solving them. It enables us to obtain quasi-polynomial-time approximation schemes for basic variants of the buy-at-bulk geometric network design problem with polynomial total demand. Then, for instances with a single sink and low capacity links, we design fast polynomial-time, low-constant approximation algorithms.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS FOR BUY-AT-BULK GEOMETRIC NETWORK DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000299094200014"}
