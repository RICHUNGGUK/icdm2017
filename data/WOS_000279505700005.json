However, premature convergence is the major drawback of MODE, especially when there are numerous local Pareto optimal solutions. To overcome this problem, we propose a MODE with a diversity enhancement (MODE-DE) mechanism to prevent the algorithm becoming trapped in a locally optimal Pareto front. The proposed algorithm combines the current population with a number of randomly generated parameter vectors to increase the diversity of the differential vectors and thereby the diversity of the newly generated offspring. The performance of the MODE-DE algorithm was evaluated on a set of 19 benchmark problem codes available from http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/epnsugan. With the proposed method, the performances were either better than or equal to those of the MODE without the diversity enhancement.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective differential evolution with diversity enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000279505700005"}
