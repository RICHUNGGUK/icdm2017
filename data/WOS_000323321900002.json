The Blue Gene/Q Compute chip has 16 + 1 + 1 processor cores, each with a quad single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) floating-point unit, and a multi-versioned Level 2 cache that provides hardware support for transactional memory, speculative execution, and atomic operations. The Blue Gene/Q Compute chip further contains dual on-chip memory controllers for directly attached DDR3 (double data rate type 3) memory and sophisticated networking logic for chip-to-chip communications.", "paper_title": "Design of the IBM Blue Gene/Q Compute chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000323321900002"}
