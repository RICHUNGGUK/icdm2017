The differential transform method (DTM) is used to compute approximate solutions of the nonlinear ordinary Abel differential equations. The results are compared with the results obtained by the classical Runge-Kutta (RK4) method. Figures are presented to show the reliability and simplicity of the method.", "paper_title": "SOLUTION OF HIGHER-ORDER ABEL EQUATIONS BY DIFFERENTIAL TRANSFORM METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000309187800001"}
