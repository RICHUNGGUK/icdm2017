Approximation procedures, such as penalized quasi-likelihood, are computationally efficient, but the resulting estimators can be seriously biased for binary responses. Gauss-Hermite quadrature and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) integration based methods can yield more accurate estimation, but they are computationally much more intensive. Estimation methods that can achieve both computational efficiency and estimation accuracy are still under development. This paper proposes an efficient direct sampling based Monte Carlo EM algorithm (DSMCEM) for latent variable models with binary responses. Mixed effects and item factor analysis models with binary responses are used to illustrate this algorithm. Results from two simulation studies and a real data example suggest that, as compared with MCMC based EM, DSMCEM can significantly improve computational efficiency as well as produce equally accurate parameter estimates. Other aspects and extensions of the algorithm are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
