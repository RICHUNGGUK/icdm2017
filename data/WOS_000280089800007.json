In this paper, a team situation awareness measure (TSAM) method using a semantic utility function is proposed. The semantic utility function is used to clarify the semantics of qualitative information expressed in linguistic terms. The individual and team situation awareness are treated as linguistic possibility distributions on the potential decisions in a dynamic decision environment. In the TSAM method, team situation awareness is generated through reasoning and aggregating individual situation awareness based on a multi-level hierarchy mental model of the team. Individual and team mental models are composed of key drivers and significant variables. An illustrative example in telecoms customer churn prediction is given to explain the effectiveness and the main steps of the TSAM method.", "paper_title": "Team situation awareness measure using semantic utility functions for supporting dynamic decision-making", "paper_id": "WOS:000280089800007"}
