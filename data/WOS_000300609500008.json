Compared to digital circuits, designing fault-tolerant analog circuits is a difficult and knowledge-intensive task. A simple but powerful method for robustness is a redundancy approach to use multiple circuits instead of single one. For example, if component failures occur, other redundant components can replace the functions of broken parts and the system can still work. However, there are several research issues to make the redundant system automatically. In this paper, we used evolutionary computation to generate multiple analog circuits automatically and then we combined the solutions to generate robust outputs. Evolutionary computation is a natural way to produce multiple redundant solutions because it is a population-based search. Experimental results on the evolution of the low-pass, high-pass and band-stop filters show that the combination of multiple evolved analog circuits produces results that are more robust than those of the best single circuit.
