The goal is to minimize the span of a feasible assignment. This channel assignment problem can be modeled with distance-dependent graph labelings. A k-L(2,1)-labeling of a graph G is a mapping f from the vertex set of G to the set {0,1,2,aEuro broken vertical bar,k} such that |f(x)-f(y)|a parts per thousand yen2 if d(x,y)=1 and if d(x,y)=2, where d(x,y) is the distance between vertices x and y in G. The minimum k for which G admits an k-L(2,1)-labeling, denoted by lambda(G), is called the lambda-number of G. Very little is known about lambda-numbers of 3-regular graphs. In this paper we focus on an important subclass of 3-regular graphs called generalized Petersen graphs. For an integer na parts per thousand yen3, a graph G is called a generalized Petersen graph of order n if and only if G is a 3-regular graph consisting of two disjoint cycles (called inner and outer cycles) of length n, where each vertex of the outer (resp. inner) cycle is adjacent to exactly one vertex of the inner (resp. outer) cycle. In 2002, Georges and Mauro conjectured that lambda(G)a parts per thousand currency sign7 for all generalized Petersen graphs G of order na parts per thousand yen7. Later, Adams, Cass and Troxell proved that Georges and Mauro's conjecture is true for orders 7 and 8. In this paper it is shown that Georges and Mauro's conjecture is true for generalized Petersen graphs of orders 9, 10, 11 and 12.", "paper_title": "On L(2,1)-labeling of generalized Petersen graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000308969100008"}
