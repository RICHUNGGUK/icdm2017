The sufficient delay-dependent conditions for the synchronization of the network are established by introducing an equivalent network system with the Lyapunov stability theory. These conditions, which are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities, can be solved efficiently by the LMI toolbox of MATLAB. A simulation example is provided to show the validity of the proposed the synchronization conditions of the whole network.", "paper_title": "Synchronization for linear singularly perturbed complex networks with coupling delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100010"}
