We first prove that the set of maximal non-occluded line segments among n disjoint unit balls has complexity Omega(n(4)), which matches the trivial O(n(4)) upper bound. This improves the trivial Omega(n(2)) bound and also the Omega(n(3)) lower bound for the restricted setting of arbitrary-size balls (Devillers and Ramos, personal communication, 2001). This result settles, negatively, the natural conjecture that this set of line segments, or, equivalently, the visibility complex, has smaller worst-case complexity for disjoint fat objects than for skinny triangles. We also prove an Omega(n(3)) lower bound on the complexity of the set of non-occluded lines among n balls of arbitrary radii, improving on the trivial Omega(n(2)) bound. This new bound almost matches the recent O(n(3+epsilon)) upper bound (Rubin, 26th Annual ACM Symposium on Computational Geometry-SCG' 10, pp. 58-67, 2010).", "paper_title": "On the Complexity of Sets of Free Lines and Line Segments Among Balls in Three Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000304114600006"}
