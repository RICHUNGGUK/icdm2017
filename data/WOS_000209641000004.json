An agent can become aware of propositional propositions but also of other agents or of herself. The dual operation to becoming aware, forgetting, can also be modelled. Our proposals are based on a novel notion of structural similarity that we call awareness bisimulation, the obvious notion of modal similarity for structures encoding knowledge and awareness.", "paper_title": "Semantics for Knowledge and Change of Awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000209641000004"}
