We consider a heterogeneous WSN which consists of a large number of sensor nodes, a few DCs, and a static Base Station (BS). The sensor nodes are static and are deployed uniformly in the terrain. The DCs have locomotion capabilities and their movement can be controlled. Each sensor node periodically sends sensed event packets to its nearest DC. The DCs aggregate the event packets received from the sensor nodes and send these aggregate event packets to the static BS. We address the following problem: the DCs should send the aggregate event packets to the BS with a given reliability while avoiding the hotspot regions such that the network lifetime is improved. Reliability is achieved by sending each aggregate event packet via multiple paths to the BS. The network lifetime is maximized by moving the DCs in such a way that the forwarding load is distributed among the sensor nodes. We propose both centralized and distributed approaches for finding a movement strategy of the DCs. We show via simulations that the proposed approaches achieve the required reliability and also maximize the network lifetime compared to the existing approaches. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
