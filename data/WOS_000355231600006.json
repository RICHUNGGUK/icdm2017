The major problem in such applications is that visual data provided are in general noisy, low resolution, prone to degradation due to lighting and other adverse effects. This paper proposes a novel face hallucination method with an aim of improving face recognition performance with the photography in social media data, which is modeled as a progressive process which explores the specific face characteristics and priors based on frequency bands analysis. In the first stage of our algorithm, initially estimated middle-resolution images are generated based on a patch-based learning method in discrete cosine transformation (DCT) domain as the first-scale restoration image. According to the relationship between the high-resolution face images and their lower resolution ones, the DC coefficients and AC coefficients are estimated separately. In the second stage, aiming at generating more refined high-resolution face images, a DCT up-sample algorithm emphasizing on low-frequency bands preserving is applied. Meanwhile, an interpolation-based method is presented in spatial domain to obtain high-frequency bands. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm effectively helps improving the recognition performance of low-resolution faces.", "paper_title": "Face hallucination and recognition in social network services", "paper_id": "WOS:000355231600006"}
