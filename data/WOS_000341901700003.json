University lectures and map-task dialogues are analyzed in order to evaluate if the prosodic strategies used when uttering disfluencies vary across speaking styles. Our results show that the distribution of disfluency types is not arbitrary across lectures and dialogues. Moreover, although there is a statistically significant cross-style strategy of prosodic contrast marking (pitch and energy increases) between the region to repair and the repair of fluency, this strategy is displayed differently depending on the specific speech task. The overall patterns observed in the lectures, with regularities ascribed for speaker and disfluency types, do not hold with the same strength for the dialogues, due to underlying specificities of the communicative purposes. The tempo patterns found for both speech tasks also confirm their distinct behaviour, evidencing the more dynamic tempo characteristics of dialogues. In university lectures, prosodic cues are given to the listener both for the units inside disfluent regions and between these and the adjacent contexts. This suggests a stronger prosodic contrast marking of disfluency fluency repair when compared to dialogues, as if teachers were monitoring the different regions the introduction to a disfluency, the disfluency itself and the beginning of the repair demarcating them in very contrastive ways.
