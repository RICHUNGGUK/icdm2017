We will present a Bayesian approach, in which the discriminant function assumes the role of the posterior probability. We will propose a probabilistic interpretation of expert rules and conditions of knowledge consistency for expert rules and learning sets. We will suggest how to measure the quality of learning materials and we will use the measure mentioned above for an algorithm that eliminates contradictions in the rule set. In this work several recognition algorithms will be described, based on either: (i) pure rules, or; (ii) rules together with learning sets. Furthermore, the original concept of information unification, which enables the formation of rules on the basis of learning set or learning set on the basis of rules will be proposed. The obtained conclusions will serve as a spring-board for the formulation of new project guidelines for this type of decision-making system. At the end, experimental results of the proposed algorithms will be presented, both from computer generated data and for a real problem from the medical diagnostics field.", "paper_title": "Combining classifiers under probabilistic models: experimental comparative analysis of methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000309065900005"}
