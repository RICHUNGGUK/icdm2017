Motion transitions are segues between two sequences of animation, and are important components for generating compelling animation streams in virtual environments and computer games. Methods involving linear blending are studied because of their efficiency, computational speed, and widespread use. Two methods of transition specification are detailed, center-aligned and start-end transitions. First, we compute a set of optimal weights for an underlying cost metric used to determine the transition points. We then evaluate the optimally weighted cost metric for generalizability, appeal, and robustness through a cross-validation and user study. Next, we develop methods for computing visually appealing blend lengths for two broad categories of motion. We empirically evaluate these results through user studies. Finally, we assess the importance of these techniques by determining the minimum sensitivity of viewers to transition durations, the just noticeable difference, for both center-aligned and start-end specifications.", "paper_title": "Synthesis and evaluation of linear motion transitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000255121300001"}
