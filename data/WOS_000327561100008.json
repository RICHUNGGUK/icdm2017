This characterisation has been performed by computed tomography (CT) by comparing newly manufactured encapsulations and samples that have been subjected to test conditions. Thus, it has been possible to draw conclusions both on the deviations of the nominal geometry of the encapsulations and on how this might affect their performance. This paper presents a scheme of dimensional verification from the point clouds obtained by CT. Finally, a combined threshold and scale factor correction technique of the tomography images is shown. This method is based on the simultaneous measurement of objective and master parts with known geometry. The results reveal the improvements achievable in the accuracy, given a particular machine configuration. The conclusions facilitate the improvement of the geometric design of these devices regarding their behaviour under test conditions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
