In particular, use of FSR-multiplexed wavelengths allows greatly reduced cross talk between upstream and downstream signals and also doubling of the available network bandwidth capacity, while maintaining the same N x N AWG in the central office. Alternatively, this allows significant increase in the number of end users served by the network. We provide theoretical and simulation studies of our bidirectional access network topology, and experimental proof of principal results. Three sets of simulations with data rates from 2.5, 5.0, and 10.0 Gbits/s have been performed for downstream and upstream transmissions. For the experimental part, eight ITU wavelengths were multiplexed at the exchange point and successfully transmitted at 2.5 Gbits/s for simultaneous bidirectional transmission. Bit-error-rate measurements show error-free transmission is achievable for both directions with minimal cross talk between the channels.
