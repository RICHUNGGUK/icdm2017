Recently Cichocki and coauthors have proposed a family of new algorithms based on the a-divergence for NMF However, it is an open problem to choose an optimal alpha. Methods and materials: In this paper, we tested such NMF variant with different a values on clustering cancer gene expression data for optimal a selection experimentally with 11 datasets. Results and conclusion: Our experimental results show that alpha = 1 and 2 are two special optimal cases for real applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
