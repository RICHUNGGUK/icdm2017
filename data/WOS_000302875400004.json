We study the behaviour of measurable events in probability spaces indexed by homogeneous trees. Precisely, we show that for every integer b >= 2 and every integer n >= 1 there exists an integer q(b,n) with the following property. If T is a homogeneous tree with branching number b and {A(t) : t is an element of T} is a family of measurable events in a probability space (Omega, Sigma, mu) satisfying mu(A(t)) >= epsilon > 0 for every t is an element of T, then for every 0 < theta < epsilon there exists a strong subtree S of T of infinite height, such that for every finite subset F of S of cardinality n >= 1 we have m(boolean AND(t is an element of F) A(t)) >= theta(q(b,n)). In fact, we can take q(b,n) = ((2(b) - 1)(2n-1) - 1) . (2(b) - 2)(-1). A finite version of this result is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Measurable Events Indexed by Trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000302875400004"}
