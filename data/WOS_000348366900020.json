Many parametric and non-parametric techniques are available for reliability estimation based on precise life time observations, without considering the uncertainty of individual observations. But life time observations are not precise measurements but more or less fuzzy. Therefore by considering life time measurements as precise numbers we may lose information and get misleading results. This study is aimed to present some non-parametric estimates for reliability functions based on fuzzy life time data", "paper_title": "Empirical reliability functions based on fuzzy life time data", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900020"}
