When appropriate metadata is missing, automatic queries are impossible and users have to inspect all elements visually. We compared two fundamentally different, but obvious display modes for this task and investigated the difference with respect to effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. The static mode is based on the page metaphor and presents successive pages with a static grid of items. The moving mode is based on the conveyor belt metaphor and lets a grid of items slide though the screen in a continuous flow. In our evaluation, we applied both modes to the common task of browsing images. We performed two experiments where 18 participants had to search for certain target images in a large image collection. The number of shown images per second (pace) was predefined in the first experiment, and under user control in the second one. We conclude that at a fixed pace, the mode has no significant impact on the recall. The perceived pace is generally slower for moving mode, which causes users to systematically choose for a faster real pace than in static mode at the cost of recall. keeping the average number of target images found per second equal for both modes.", "paper_title": "Effects of Presentation Mode and Pace Control on Performance in Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000344991700075"}
