Here a path begins at the root and ends at a leaf. In this paper we propose this problem as a useful query primitive for XML data, and provide new algorithms improving the previously best known time and space bounds.", "paper_title": "Matching subsequences in trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000238119900025"}
