It is well known that this conjecture is true for every centrally symmetric convex disk. For the non-symmetric case, we only know that the conjecture is true for triangles (Januszewski in Discrete Comput Geom 43:167-178, 2010). In this paper, we prove the conjecture for a class of convex disks (quarter-convex disks), which includes all triangles and convex quadrilaterals.", "paper_title": "On the Covering Densities of Quarter-Convex Disks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355340300011"}
