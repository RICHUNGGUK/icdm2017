A proper extraction is however in many cases required for visualisation or future processing steps. We use the example of 3D X-ray micro-Computed Tomography (ACT) data of narrow fractures through core samples from a dolomitic hydrocarbon reservoir (Hauptdolomit below the Vienna Basin, Austria). The extraction and eventual binary segmentation of the fractures in these datasets is required for porosity determination and permeability modelling. In this paper, we present the multiscale Hessian fracture filtering technique for extracting narrow fractures from a 3D image dataset. The second-order information in the Hessian matrix is used to distinguish planar features from the dataset. Different results are obtained for different scales of analysis in the calculation of the Hessian matrix. By combining these various scales of analysis, the final output is multiscale; i.e. narrow fractures of different apertures are detected. The presented technique is implemented and made available as macro code for the multiplatform public domain image processing software Image). Serial processing of blocks of data ensures that full 3D processing of relatively large datasets (example dataset: 1670 x 1670 x 1546 voxels) is possible on a desktop computer. Here, several hours of processing time are required, but interaction is only required in the beginning. Various post-processing steps (calibration, connectivity filtering, and binarisation) can be applied, depending on the goals of research. The multiscale Hessian fracture filtering technique provides very good results for extracting the narrow fractures in our example dataset, despite several drawbacks inherent to the use of the Hessian matrix. Although we apply the technique on a specific example, the general implementation makes the filter suitable for different types of 3D datasets and different research goals. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
