The walk model is improved using a genetic algorithm, but unlike previous approaches, the fitness is determined in a run that closely resembles the later application. We thus not only achieve high speeds, but also a high degree of flexibility. In addition to the walking model being flexible, we present a means of automatically calibrating the walking engine. This allows for highly precise robot control and greatly improved odometry accuracy. Lastly, we show how the motion model can be extended to integrate specialized motions to further increase locomotion speed without compromising flexibility.", "paper_title": "Reliable and precise, gait modeling for a quadruped robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100005"}
