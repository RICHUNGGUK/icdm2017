Processing big graph data introduces complex and multiple iterations that raise challenges such as parallel memory bottlenecks, deadlocks, and inefficiency. To tackle the challenges, we propose a novel technique for effectively processing big graph data on Cloud. Specifically, the big data will be compressed with its spatiotemporal features on Cloud. By exploring spatial data correlation, we partition a graph data set into clusters. In a cluster, the workload can be shared by the inference based on time series similarity. By exploiting temporal correlation, in each time series or a single graph edge, temporal data compression is conducted. A novel data driven scheduling is also developed for data processing optimisation. The experiment results demonstrate that the spatiotemporal compression and scheduling achieve significant performance gains in terms of data size and data fidelity loss. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
