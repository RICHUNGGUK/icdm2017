A set of orders is given, each one consisting of a pickup location and a delivery location, and it is required to send an item from the former location to the latter one. Repacking is not allowed, but collected items can be packed in several rows in such a way that each row must obey the LIFO principle. in this paper, a variable neighborhood search approach using four new neighborhood structures is presented to solve the problem.
