Two classes of TRSs inferable from positive data are presented, namely, simple flat TRSs and linear-bounded TRSs. These classes of TRSs are rich enough to include many divide-and-conquer programs' like addition, doubling, logarithm, tree-count, list-count, split, append, reverse, etc. The classes of simple flat TRSs and linear-bounded TRSs are incomparable, i.e., there are functions that can be computed by simple flat TRSs but not by linear-bounded TRSs and vice versa.
