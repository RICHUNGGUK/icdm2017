In this paper we study primary iterated altans and show, among other things, their connections with nanotubes and nanocaps. The question of classification of bipartite altans is also addressed. Using the results of Gutman we are able to enumerate Kekule structures of several nanocaps of arbitrary length.", "paper_title": "Iterated Altans and Their Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000365373800011"}
