Firstly, the co-positive type Lyapunov function method is applied to establish sufficient conditions of asymptotical stability for the addressed positive 2D T-S fuzzy system. Then, the l(1)-gain performance analysis for the positive 2D T-S fuzzy delayed system is studied. All the obtained results are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which are computationally tractable. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
