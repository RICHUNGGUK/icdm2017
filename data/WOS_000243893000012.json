The algorithm consists of two independent parts: MHD evolution and mesh-redistribution. The first part is a high-resolution, divergence-free, shock-capturing scheme on a fixed quadrangular mesh, while the second part is an iterative procedure. In each iteration, mesh points are first redistributed, and then a conservative-interpolation formula is used to calculate the remapped cell-averages of the mass, momentum, and total energy on the resulting new mesh; the magnetic potential is remapped to the new mesh in a non-conservative way and is reconstructed to give a divergence-free magnetic field on the new mesh. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve high numerical accuracy, track and resolve strong shock waves in ideal MHD problems, and preserve divergence-free property of the magnetic field. Numerical examples include the smooth Alfven wave problem, 2D and 2.5D shock tube problems, two rotor problems, the stringent blast problem, and the cloud-shock interaction problem.
