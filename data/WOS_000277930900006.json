In an experiment, 24 older adults (45-65) interacted with the text interface and one of the characters, conform a \"one-week diabetics scenario\" They experienced the virtual and physical character as more empathic and trustworthy than the text-based assistant, and expressed more conversational behavior with the characters However, it seems that the preference of interacting with the character or the text interface was influenced by the conscientiousness of the participant; more conscientious people liked the text interface better Older adults responded more negative to the characters that lacked the social behaviors than to the text interface Some differences between the virtual and physical character probably occurred due to the specific constraints of the physical character (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Persuasive robotic assistant for health self-management of older adults: Design and evaluation of social behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000277930900006"}
