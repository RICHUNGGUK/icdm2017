On the basis of the hybrid process modeling, off-line optimization and feed-forward neural control scheme (UNKS) the combined system for off-line optimization and adaptive adjustment of cutting parameters is built. This is an adaptive control system controlling the cutting force and maintaining constant roughness of the surface being milled by digital adaptation of cutting parameters. In this way it compensates all disturbances during the cutting process: tool wear, non-homogeneity of the workpiece material, vibrations, chatter, etc. The basic control principle is based on the control scheme (UNKS) consisting of two neural identifiers of the process dynamics and primary regulator. An overall procedure of hybrid modeling of cutting process used for creating the CNC milling simulator has been prepared. The experimental results show that not only does the milling system with the design controller have high robustness, and global stability, but also the machining efficiency of the milling system with the adaptive controller is 27% higher than for traditional CNC milling system.", "paper_title": "Modeling and adaptive force control of milling by using artificial techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200026"}
