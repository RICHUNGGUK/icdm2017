Our main methodology is the LR equivalence relation on reals: A (LR) B if and only if the notions of A-randomness and B-randomness coincide. We also show that there are c.e. sets that cannot be split into two c.e. sets of the same LR degree. Moreover, a c.e. set is low for random if and only if it computes no c.e. set with this property.", "paper_title": "Non-cupping, measure and computably enumerable splittings", "paper_id": "WOS:000264418400004"}
