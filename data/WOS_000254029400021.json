The bound of derivative of the time-varying delay can be an unknown constant. It is concluded that the stability result for linear switched systems still holds for such systems with time-varying delay under a certain delay bound. Moreover, the delay bound of guaranteeing system stability can be easily obtained based on linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). As a special case, when the time-varying delay becomes constant, the criterion obtained in this correspondence is less conservative than existing ones. The reason for less conservativeness is also explicitly explained in this correspondence. Simulation examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis for linear switched systems with time-varying delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029400021"}
