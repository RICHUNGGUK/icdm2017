Tunneling supports \"like-to-like\" IP connectivity across an \"unlike\" network, whereas translation supports \"like-to-unlike\" IP interconnectivity. No overarching strategy exists to address all possible scenarios. Because tunneling can keep the end-to-end model that the Internet is built on, the authors have developed a tunnel-based framework that solves the transition problems in backbone and access networks with different tunneling mechanisms.", "paper_title": "Tunnel-Based IPv6 Transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000316505700010"}
