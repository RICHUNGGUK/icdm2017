Among the fields influenced is that of Enterprise Knowledge Management, where the increase and maintenance of the employees' active participation in the organization's knowledge management activities is pursued through the adoption of social computing approaches. In this paper we consider a prominent and increasingly applied such approach, namely enterprise microblogging, and we propose a novel way to exploit its knowledge generation and sharing capabilities in order to effectively capture and formalize enterprise knowledge that is vague. Application and empirical evaluation of the framework indicates significant potential towards this goal.", "paper_title": "A Semantic Framework for Harvesting Vague Enterprise Knowledge from Microposts", "paper_id": "WOS:000334693400003"}
