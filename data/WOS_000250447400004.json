A bivalued watermark is embedded in the Fourier transform magnitude of the 3-D volume. The Fourier domain has been selected because of its scaling and rotation invariance. Furthermore, in order to decrease the detection time, a special symmetry of the watermark is exploited. The proposed method is proven to be resistant to 3-D lowpass filtering, noise addition, scaling, translation, cropping and rotation. Experimental results prove the robustness of this method against the above-mentioned attacks.", "paper_title": "Watermarking digital 3-d volumes in the discrete Fourier transform domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447400004"}
