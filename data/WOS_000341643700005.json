Their protocol is one of the most efficient k-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocols and is directly built from a 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol. However, their analysis shows that the proposed k-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol is insecure, though the primitive 1-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol is secure. The weakness is that with high probability the receiver in their protocol can get all n secret messages encrypted by the sender. Finally, they fix the serious flaw and introduce an improved k-out-of-n oblivious transfer protocol without increasing any cost.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis and Improvement of a k-out-of-n Oblivious Transfer Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000341643700005"}
