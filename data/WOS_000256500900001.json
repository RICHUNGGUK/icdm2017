Three dialects of the language are supported: the ISO standard VDM specification language with support for modular structuring, the extension VDM++ which supports object-oriented structuring and concurrency, and a version extending VDM++ with features for modeling and analysing distributed embedded real-time systems. VDMTools provides extensive static semantics checking, automatic code generation, round-trip mapping to UML class diagrams, documentation support, test coverage analysis and debugging support. The tools' focus is on supporting the cost-effective development and exploitation of formal models in industrial settings. The paper presents the components of VDMTools and reports recent experience using them for the development of large models.", "paper_title": "VDMTools: advances in support for formal modeling in VDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000256500900001"}
