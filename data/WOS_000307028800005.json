Existing electric power systems are composed by two cooperating infrastructures: the electric infrastructure, which is responsible for electricity generation and electricity transmission to customers; and information technology based control systems that monitor and control the physical parameters of the electric infrastructure and trigger appropriate reconfigurations in emergency situations. The interactions between these two cooperating infrastructures must be carefully analyzed to understand and characterize their (inter)dependencies, i.e., how the state of one infrastructure influences or is correlated to the state of the other. This paper proposes a model-based framework for quantitatively analyzing the propagation and impact of malfunctions in electric power systems. The framework is implemented using the stochastic activity network (SAN) formalism and is applied to concrete case studies that support the understanding and assessment of the impact of interdependencies. The results assist in developing countermeasures that can help reduce electric power system vulnerabilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
