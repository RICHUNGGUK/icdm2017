One of the main differences between the new framework and existing systems is that the new system is capable of performing all operations at run-time. Modules are detected, loaded and used at run-time. The framework needs no prior knowledge of the type and availability of components, thereby increasing the flexibility of the system. The functionality of the framework is demonstrated with the implementation of a simple set of components which, when coupled, form the basis for a numerical simulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
