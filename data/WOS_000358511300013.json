A lower supply voltage decreases the energy consumption at the cost of conversion speed. In this paper, a new index, the figure-of-merit (FoM)-delay (FD) product, is introduced to provide a balance between the energy efficiency and conversion speed. As a prototype, a 0.5 V, 420-MS/s, and 7-bit, flash ADC is developed using a 90-nm CMOS technology to demonstrate the validity of ULV operation. To overcome the challenges associated with a reduced supply voltage, a double-tail latched comparator with a variable capacitance calibration technique using metal-oxide-metal capacitors is implemented. An all-digital time-domain delay interpolation technique further enhances the resolution with very little additional power consumption. Using two-way time-interleaving, the prototype ADC achieves an effective number of bits (ENOB) of 5.5 bits while operating at 420 MS/s consuming a total power of 4.1 mW. The lowest measured FoM is the 195 fJ/conv.-step during single-channel operation at 210 MS/s, which results in an extremely low FD product of 0.93 pJ x ns/conv.-step.", "paper_title": "Ultralow-Voltage High-Speed Flash ADC Design Strategy Based on FoM-Delay Product", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300013"}
