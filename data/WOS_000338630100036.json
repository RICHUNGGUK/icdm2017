A generalization of the classical support function of convex subsets of R-d allows to transfer the concept of the convex hull to these systems of sets. Approximation properties of the generalized convex hull and its use for practical computations are investigated.", "paper_title": "Non-convex systems of sets for numerical analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100036"}
