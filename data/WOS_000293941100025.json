The waviness ratio R(w) is defined by the span length of wing to the spanwise length covered by the waviness. Five different waviness ratios of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 at fixed wavelength of 0.2C and wavy amplitude of 0.025C have been considered. The smooth wing and R(w) = 0.2 revealed the similar variation of lift coefficient C(L) according to the angle of attack alpha resulting in the same stall angle of 20 degrees, where the maximum lift appears. The case of R(w) = 0.6 presented the earliest occurrence of the stall at alpha = 12 degrees. The cases of R(w) = 1.0, 0.8 and 0.4 produced the same stall angle of alpha = 16 degrees In the post-stall region. C(L) for R(w) = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and 1.0 recovered and became larger than those of the smooth wing and R(w) = 0.2. A spiral formation of the limiting streamlines occurred in the wavy troughs, which derive relatively low pressure along the leading edge. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
