The benefits of the constructionist theory as a learning paradigm are widely recognized, because they support significant learning environments where students are actively related in implementing their own public artifacts; passing through passive to active learning states. Thus, the constructionist theory stresses the need to understand the student's thinking and to encourage them to reflect on their models as a means to improve them. This article aims to show the results derived from developing a constructionist platform for embedded systems and wireless communications education, using a dedicated methodology based on the constructionist theory.
