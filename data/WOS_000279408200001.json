Importantly, VTS enables a vehicle to become a multifunction mobile-services platform. Cars are now designed not only for transportation, but also to provide value-added services covering navigation, safety, security, information, communications and entertainment. Drivers or passengers can contact a call center via VTS to access aspired/desired services and information online. Therefore, VTS increases both the utility/functions and the safety of driving. Developing the optimal VTS that satisfies with consumers' needs has become the foremost concern of automobile producers. This study will attempt to identify the required VTS utilities between distinguishing characteristics/features of consumers and propose the ideal service combinations for the next e-era generation VTS. An evaluating model by six aspects to be considered/constructed, which encompasses 25 criteria, is built to identify consumers' needs for the next e-era generation VTS. In the paper, a Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) technique is used to construct the network relation-map (NRM) among the criteria of each aspect. These criteria are not mutually independent: instead, they have feedback mechanisms. The Analytical Network Process (ANP) based on NRM is used to determine the relative weightings among those criteria. Moreover, the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is used to determine and improve the gaps among the distinguishing characteristics/features of consumers' desired utilities with respect to services/provide the decision-maker of Telemetics Service Provider (TSP) for improving existing functions or planning further utilities in the next-generation VTS. Based on above NRM those results can be served as a suggestion for the TSP to improve the existing functions or plan further utilities/functions for reducing the gaps and satisfying the users' needs in next e-era generation VTS.
