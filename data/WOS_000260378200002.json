Data compression is one effective method for increasing capacity and reducing data transfer, however real-time performance is necessary for mobile multimedia device applications. We propose a mechanism that uses contiguous packing and a read/write ping-pong buffer along with the X-match and run-length compression/decompression algorithm to create a real-time compression layer. Compared to the internal packing scheme and best-fit method of Yim et al., our mechanism increases the compression ratio, improves the write response time by 60%, and stabilizes the read response time to make it suitable for real-time applications.", "paper_title": "The Real-Time Compression Layer for Flash Memory in Mobile Multimedia Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000260378200002"}
