First we give an overview on several existing security attacks to the physical layer in cognitive radio networks. We then discuss the related countermeasures on how to defend against these attacks. We further investigate one of the most important physical layer security parameters, the secrecy capacity of a cognitive radio network, and study the outage probability of secrecy capacity of a primary user from a theoretical point of view. Furthermore, we present performance results for secrecy capacity and outage probability between a node and its neighbors. Our work summarizes the current advances of the physical layer security and brings insights on physical layer security analysis in cognitive radio networks.", "paper_title": "On Physical Layer Security for Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320193800006"}
