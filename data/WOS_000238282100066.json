In this paper, a keyphrase extraction approach based on neural network is proposed. To determine whether a phrase is a keyphrase, the following features of a phrase in a given document are adopted: its term frequency and inverted document frequency, whether to appear in the title or headings (subheadings) of the given document, and its frequency appearing in the paragraphs of the given document. The algorithm is evaluated by the standard information retrieval metrics of precision and recall, and human assessment.", "paper_title": "Automatic keyphrases extraction from document using neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100066"}
