In contrast to a feedforward artificial neural network (such as a functional link artificial neural network (FLANN)), the proposed PFLARNN consists of a number of simple small-scale functional link artificial recurrent neural network (FLARNN) modules. Since those modules of PFLARNN can be performed simultaneously in a pipelined parallelism fashion, this would result in a significant improvement in its total computational efficiency. Moreover, nonlinearity of each module is introduced by enhancing the input pattern with nonlinear functional expansion. Therefore, the performance of the proposed filter can be further improved. Computer simulations demonstrate that with proper choice of functional expansion in the PFLARNN, this filter performs better than the FLANN and multilayer perceptron (MLP) for nonlinear dynamic system identification.
