In order to properly manage the product cost, vendors face serious challenges in resource-limited embedded systems. In this article, a self-adjusting flash translation layer is proposed with low memory requirements. The objective of the design is to provide efficient address mapping and low garbage collection overhead, while controlling main memory usage of the flash translation layer. The capability of the design is evaluated over realistic workloads and benchmarks. System performance is also guaranteed under low memory requirements.", "paper_title": "A Self-Adjusting Flash Translation Layer for Resource-Limited Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276385900002"}
