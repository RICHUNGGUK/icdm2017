This contribution presents a security analysis of the WAI module in the implementation plan with the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) model. The results indicate that if the elliptic curve encryption scheme ECES adopted is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2 attack), then its key-agreement protocol is secure in the CK model, and it realizes the mutual identity authentication between STA (station) and AP (access point).", "paper_title": "On the security of the authentication module of Chinese WLAN standard implementation plan", "paper_id": "WOS:000238570400023"}
