The design of an experimentally feasible quantum processor must draw upon results in multiple fields; from experimental efforts in system control and fabrication through to far more abstract areas such as quantum algorithms and error correction. Recently, the adaptation of topological coding models to physical systems in optics has illustrated a possible long-term pathway to truly large-scale QIP. As the topological model has well-defined protocols for Quantum Error Correction built in as part of its construction, a more grounded analysis of the classical processing requirements is possible. In this paper, we analyze the requirements for a classical processing system, designed specifically for the topological cluster state model. We demonstrate that via extensive parallelization, the construction of a classical \"front-end\" system capable of processing error correction data for a large topological computer is possible today.", "paper_title": "CLASSICAL PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS FOR A TOPOLOGICAL QUANTUM COMPUTING SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000278194600005"}
