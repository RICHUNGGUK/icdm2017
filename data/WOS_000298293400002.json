In this article we present a novel approach for mining user's regular tasks on the basis of temporal proximity of users' desktop actions without user intervention in a completely automatic, unobtrusive, and unsupervised manner. The proposed method is based on time-based clustering of a user's desktop actions and, in contrast to previous approaches, it does not enforce fixed time constraints on the mined actions, and typical transition times, when they exist, emerge from the logged activity data for that specific user. The performance of our technique was evaluated on a large data set of 724 days of desktop work by five knowledge workers. The results showed that our approach performed very well and was able to cluster those temporally proximate user actions that commonly used fix time window techniques fail to deal with. Notably, the main improvement is in the recall of the tasks, where our approach recalled 10.18% more actions than the predefined time window technique.", "paper_title": "Building User Task Space by Mining Temporally Proximate Desktop Actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000298293400002"}
