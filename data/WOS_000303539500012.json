We theoretically demonstrated that the intermolecular hydrogen bond C-1=O-1 center dot center dot center dot H-1-O-3 in the hydrogen-bonded C153-DAF(+) complex is significantly strengthened in the S-1 state by monitoring the spectral shifts of the C=O group and O-H group involved in the hydrogen bond C-1=O-1 center dot center dot center dot H-1-O-3. Moreover, the length of the hydrogen bond C-1=O-1 center dot center dot center dot H-1-O-3 between the oxygen atom and hydrogen atom decreased from 1.693 angstrom to 1.633 angstrom upon photoexcitation. This was also confirmed by the increase in the hydrogen-bond binding energy from 69.92 kJ mol(-1) in the ground state to 90.17 kJ mol(-1) in the excited state. Thus, the excited-state hydrogen-bond strengthening of the coumarin chromophore in an ionic liquid has been demonstrated theoretically for the first time.", "paper_title": "Time-dependent density functional theory study on the electronic excited-state hydrogen bonding of the chromophore coumarin 153 in a room-temperature ionic liquid", "paper_id": "WOS:000303539500012"}
