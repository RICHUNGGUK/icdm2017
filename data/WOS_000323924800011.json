Moreover, the peak-to-average power ratio of the OFDM signal is considered. We formulate the sidelobe suppression problem by APM as a quadratically constrained quadratic programming problem, which could be solved by numerical tools. Simulation results show that APM could provide well sidelobe suppression performance while the peak-to-average power ratio could be efficiently controlled at a desired level.", "paper_title": "Active point modification for sidelobe suppression with PAPR constraint in OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323924800011"}
