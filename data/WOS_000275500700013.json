We demonstrate that the smallest root of p(z) is a search direction that always decreases the modulus of f(z). Using this property, a new algorithm is proposed. We prove that the algorithm either finds a root or the estimate goes at infinity, without creating any accumlation points. In the special case of a polynomial, the algorithm allways finds a root. Numerical examples are also given.", "paper_title": "The Smaller Root Principle for Finding Roots of a Complex Number Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000275500700013"}
