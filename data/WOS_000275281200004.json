Mrkvicka and J. Rataj, On estimation of intrinsic volume densities of stationary random closed sets, Stoch. Proc. Appl. 118 (2008), 2, 213-231. In this note, a stronger asymptotic consistency is proved in dimension 2. The implementation of the method is discussed in detail. An important step is the determination of dilation radii in the discrete approximation, which differs from the standard techniques used for measuring parallel sets in image analysis. A method of reducing the bias is proposed and tested on simulated data.", "paper_title": "ON ESTIMATION OF INTRINSIC VOLUME DENSITIES OF STATIONARY RANDOM CLOSED SETS VIA PARALLEL SETS IN THE PLANE", "paper_id": "WOS:000275281200004"}
