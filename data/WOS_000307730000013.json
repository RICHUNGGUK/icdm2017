But inclusivity within this online encyclopedia is not a simple matter of just allowing anyone to contribute. In its quest for legitimacy as an encyclopedia, Wikipedia relies on outsiders to judge claims championed by rival editors.

In this article I examine the nature of these boundaries and the implications they have for inclusivity and credibility as revealed through the talk pages produced and sources used by a particular subset of Wikipedia's creatorsthose involved in writing articles on the topic of Philippine history.", "paper_title": "The inclusivity of Wikipedia and the drawing of expert boundaries: An examination of talk pages and reference lists", "paper_id": "WOS:000307730000013"}
