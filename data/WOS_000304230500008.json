Recently, Beliakov et al. [3] constructed some operations about intuitionistic fuzzy sets based on Archimedean t-conorm and t-norm, from which an aggregation principle is proposed for intuitionistic fuzzy information. In this paper, we propose some other operations on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, study their properties and relationships, and based on which, we study the properties of the aggregation principle proposed by Beliakov et al. (3), and give some specific intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators, which can be considered as the extensions of the known ones. In the end, we develop an approach for multi-criteria decision making under intuitionistic fuzzy environment, and illustrate an example to show the behavior of the proposed operators.
