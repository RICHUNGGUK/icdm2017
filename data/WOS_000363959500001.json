Previously-known functions with this property have all been of four variables. We also improve on the state of the art for functions of four variables by constructing a function g for which g(A) has cardinality at least ; the previously best-achieved bound was . Finally, we give an example of a five-variable function h for which h(A) has cardinality at least . Proving these results depends only on the Szemer,di-Trotter incidence theorem and an analoguous result for planes due to Edelsbrunner, Guibas and Sharir, each applied in the Erlangen-type framework of Elekes and Sharir. In particular the proofs do not employ the Guth-Katz polynomial partitioning technique or the theory of ruled surfaces. Although the growth exponents for f, g and h are stronger than those for previously-considered functions, it is not clear that they are necessarily sharp. So we pose a question as to whether the bounds on the cardinalities of f(A), g(A) and h(A) can be further strengthened.", "paper_title": "New Results for the Growth of Sets of Real Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000363959500001"}
