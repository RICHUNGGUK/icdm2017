A reasonable and efficient resource search algorithm is not only the key to resource sharing for users, but also a critical stage to P2P technology development. Firstly, this paper introduces some basic resource search algorithms on P2P network architecture. Secondly, the paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Above all, the paper focuses on the combination of the P2P resource search with some intelligent optimization algorithms, which have succeeded in many fields. The combination shows a good prospect, although being still immature now.", "paper_title": "Survey of search and optimization of P2P networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290276500001"}
