The key idea is to develop a measurement-based framework in which the postural position as it pertains to a given wireless link is first inferred based on the measured RF signal strength and packet drops. Then optimal power assignment is done by fitting those measurement results into a model describing the relationship between the assigned power and the resulting signal strength. A closed loop power control mechanism is then added for iterative convergence to the optimal power level as a response to both intra-and-inter posture body movements. This provides a practical paradigm for on-body power assignment, which cannot leverage the existing mechanisms in the literature that rely on localization, which is not realistic for on-body sensors. Extensive experimental results are provided to demonstrate the model building and algorithm performance on a prototype body area network. The proposed mechanism has also been compared with a number of other closed loop mechanisms and an experimental benchmark.", "paper_title": "Transmission Power Assignment with Postural Position Inference for On-Body Wireless Communication Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000282763900014"}
