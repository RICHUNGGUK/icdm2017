In this work, a three-dimensional fracture model in the context of the combined finite-discrete element method is applied to investigate the structural integrity of two types of concrete armour units under dynamic and extreme loading conditions. Dolosse units are simulated in drop tests and pendulum tests, and Core-Loc units of prototype scale are simulated under an imaginary extreme loading condition. The whole structural response of concrete armour units is accurately captured and the results provide a better understanding of damage and reserve stability of such systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
