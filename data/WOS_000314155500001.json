To reduce the NLOS errors, a prior knowledge-based correction strategy (PKCS) is proposed to locate the robot.. is strategy consists of two steps: NLOS identification and mitigation. We propose an NLOS identification method by applying the statistical theory.. en we correct the NLOS errors by subtracting the expected NLOS errors. Finally, the residual weighting algorithm is employed to estimate the location of the robot. Simulation results show that the proposed strategy significantly improves the accuracy of localization in mixed LOS/NLOS indoor environment.", "paper_title": "An Indoor Mobile Localization Strategy for Robot in NLOS Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000314155500001"}
