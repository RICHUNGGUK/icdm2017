The histon is an encrustation of histogram such that the elements in the histon are the set of all the pixels that can be classified as possibly belonging to the same segment. In rough-set theoretic sense, the histogram correlates with the lower approximation and the histon correlates with upper approximation. The roughness measure at every intensity level is calculated and then a thresholding method is applied for image segmentation. The proposed approach is compared with the histogram-based approach and the histon based approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields better segmentation.
