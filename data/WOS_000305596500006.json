The discovery of CK2 inhibitors has thus attracted much attention in recent years. In this investigation, a hybrid virtual screening approach based on Bayesian classification model, pharmacophore hypothesis and molecular docking was proposed and employed to identify CK2 inhibitors. We first established a naive Bayes classification model of CK2 inhibitors/non-inhibitors and pharmacophore hypotheses of CK2 inhibitors. The docking parameters and scoring functions were also optimized in advance. The three virtual screening methods were sequentially used to screen two large chemical libraries, Specs and Enamine, for retrieving new CK2 inhibitors. Finally 30 compounds were selected from the final hits for in vitro CK2 kinase inhibitory assays. Five compounds with completely novel scaffolds showed a good inhibitory potency against CK2, which have good potentials for a future hit-to-lead optimization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
