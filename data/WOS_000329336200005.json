TCDS locates the position and trace the movement of mobile subscriber on the road to detect traffic congestion based on people calling habits that they are more likely to make a call when staying. Compared with other road monitoring system, TCDS has lower cost with satisfactory accuracy. To verify the effectiveness, we take Wuhan, a provincial capital of China, as our experiment place. Without utilizing any camera or smart phone, TCDS is able to decrease the cost with high accuracy and monitor large area of the city.", "paper_title": "Traffic Congestion Detecting Based on Cellular Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000329336200005"}
