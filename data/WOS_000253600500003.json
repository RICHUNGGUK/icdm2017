This knowledge was accumulated while developing and operating the Viuva Negra (VN) crawler to feed a search engine and a Web archive for the Portuguese Web for four years. The design, implementation and evaluation of the VN crawler are also presented as a case study of a Web crawler design. The case study tested provides crawling techniques that may be useful for the further development of crawlers.
