Fan-planar drawings have been recently introduced by Kaufmann and Ueckerdt [35], who proved that every n-vertex fan-planar drawing has at most 5n - 10 edges, and that this bound is tight for n >= 20. We extend their result from both the combinatorial and the algorithmic point of view. We prove tight bounds on the density of constrained versions of fan-planar drawings and study the relationship between fan-planarity and k-planarity. Also, we prove that testing fan-planarity in the variable embedding setting is NP-complete. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
