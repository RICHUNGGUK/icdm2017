We provide an evaluation of the performances of some of the popular model selection criteria, particularly of deviance information criterion (DIC) and weighted L (WL) measure, for comparison among a set of candidate MNAR models. In addition, we seek to provide deviance and quadratic loss-based model selection criteria with alternative penalty terms targeting directly the MNAR models. This work is motivated by the need in the literature to understand the performances of these important model selection criteria for comparison among a set of MNAR models. A Monte Carlo simulation experiment is designed to assess the finite sample performances of these model selection criteria in the context of interest under different scenarios for missingness amounts. Some naturally driven DIC and WL extensions are also discussed and evaluated.", "paper_title": "Performances of Bayesian model selection criteria for generalized linear models with non-ignorably missing covariates", "paper_id": "WOS:000335214900004"}
