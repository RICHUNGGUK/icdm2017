The basis of the method is the principle of the Bellman-Zadeh fuzzy measures intersection and nine-point linguistic rating scale of Saaty. The novelty of the method presented here consists of the fact that it does not require labor-intensive procedures, requiring arraying and array processing of paired comparisons matrix. Instead, special correlations are used, which are based on the comparison with the worst alternative and the least important criterion. As an example for the utilization of our method, we use the problem for choosing cars.
