In this paper we describe how the problem of job management has been addressed in the gLite middleware by means of the CREAM and CEMonitor services. CREAM (Computing Resource Execution and Management) provides a job execution and management capability for Grids, while CEMonitor is a general purpose asynchronous event notification framework. Both components expose a Web Service interface allowing conforming clients to submit, manage and monitor computational jobs to a Local Resource Management System. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
