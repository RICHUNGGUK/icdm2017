EDI is changing rapidly from traditional EDI to Internet-based EDI due to rapid development of Internet-based information technologies. Security and integrity of the system, however, is becoming a concern among EDI adopters. This paper examines the effects of formal and informal controls, each of which arc categorized its internal and external controls, oil EDI performance. Hypotheses indicate that controls directly or indirectly affect performance through their effects oil the success of implementation. A structural equation modeling approach (LISREL) is used to analyze data from Korean companies. Internal formal and external informal controls have an indirect effect oil performance through implementation success. External formal controls turn out to have a direct effect oil performance. The results empirically support that causal relations exist between EDI controls. implementation success, and performance. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
