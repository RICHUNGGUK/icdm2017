Over the past years, many methods have been proposed for the protein model quality assessment (QA) and selection problem. Despite significant advances, the discerning power of current methods is still unsatisfactory. In this paper, we propose two new algorithms, CC-Select and MDS-QA, based on multidimensional scaling and k-means clustering. For the model selection problem, CC-Select combines consensus with clustering techniques to select the best models from a given pool. Given a set of predicted models, CC-Select first calculates a consensus score for each structure based on its average pairwise structural similarity to other models. Then, similar structures are grouped into clusters using multidimensional scaling and clustering algorithms. In each cluster, the one with the highest consensus score is selected as a candidate model. For the QA problem, MDS-QA combines single-model scoring functions with consensus to determine more accurate assessment score for every model in a given pool. Using extensive benchmark sets of a large collection of predicted models, we compare the two algorithms with existing state-of-the-art quality assessment methods and show significant improvement.", "paper_title": "NEW MDS AND CLUSTERING BASED ALGORITHMS FOR PROTEIN MODEL QUALITY ASSESSMENT AND SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000326345900007"}
