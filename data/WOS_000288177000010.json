However, based on extensive experiments, we find that some statistical artifacts will be inevitably introduced even with a low embedding capacity in most existing PVD-based algorithms. In this paper, we first analyze the common limitations of the original PVD and its modified versions, and then propose a more secure steganography based on a content adaptive scheme. In our method, a cover image is first partitioned into small squares. Each square is then rotated by a random degree of 0, 90, 180 or 270. The resulting image is then divided into non-overlapping embedding units with three consecutive pixels, and the middle one is used for data embedding. The number of embedded bits is dependent on the differences among the three pixels. To preserve the local statistical features, the sort order of the three pixel values will remain the same after data hiding. Furthermore, the new method can first use sharper edge regions for data hiding adaptively, while preserving other smoother regions by adjusting a parameter. The experimental results evaluated on a large image database show that our method achieves much better security compared with the previous PVD-based methods.", "paper_title": "A more secure steganography based on adaptive pixel-value differencing scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000288177000010"}
