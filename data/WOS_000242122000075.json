A psycho-visual experiment we recently performed at our departments was used to collect data on human visual perception. The Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) framework was applied in order to test which of our fuzzy image similarity measures correlates best to this human visual perception. Based on Spearman's Rank Order Correlation coefficient we will show that the M-6(p) and M-i3(h) measures outperform their peers as well as the commonly used MSE and PSNR measures, in the case where image distortions are less trivial to distinguish with the bare eye.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of the perceptual performance of fuzzy image quality measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000075"}
