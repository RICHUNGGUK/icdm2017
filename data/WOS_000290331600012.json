Direct experimental measurement of TFs' activities is, however, challenging, resulting in a need to develop statistical tools to infer TF activities from mRNA expression levels of target genes. Current models, however, neglect important features of transcriptional regulation; in particular, the combinatorial nature of regulation, which is fundamental for signal integration, is not accounted for. Results: We present a novel method to infer combinatorial regulation of gene expression by multiple transcription factors in large-scale transcriptional regulatory networks. The method implements a factorial hidden Markov model with a non-linear likelihood to represent the interactions between the hidden transcription factors. We explore our model's performance on artificial datasets and demonstrate the applicability of our method on genome-wide scale for three expression datasets. The results obtained using our model are biologically coherent and provide a tool to explore the concealed nature of combinatorial transcriptional regulation.", "paper_title": "Large-scale learning of combinatorial transcriptional dynamics from gene expression", "paper_id": "WOS:000290331600012"}
