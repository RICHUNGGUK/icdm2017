This extends the methods applied in the well-studied problem of reconstruction of scene points in a\"similar to(3) given their projections in a set of images. In this case, the bifocal, trifocal and quadrifocal tensors are used to carry out this computation. It is shown that similar methods will apply in a much more general context, and hence may be applied to projections from a\"similar to (n) to a\"similar to (m) , which have been used in the analysis of dynamic scenes, and in radial distortion correction. For sufficiently many generic projections, reconstruction of the scene is shown to be unique up to projectivity, except in the case of projections onto one-dimensional image spaces (lines), in which case there are two solutions. Projections from a\"similar to (n) to a\"similar to(2) have been considered by Wolf and Shashua (in International Journal of Computer Vision 48(1): 53-67, 2002), where they were applied to several different problems in dynamic scene analysis. They analyzed these projections using tensors, but no general way of defining such tensors, and computing the projections was given. This paper settles the general problem, showing that tensor definition and retrieval of the projections is always possible.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction from Projections Using Grassmann Tensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000264547900004"}
