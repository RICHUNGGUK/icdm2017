The recognizers were trained with data which were recorded using a close-talking microphone. These recognizers are to be evaluated with distant-talking microphone data. The adaptation set was recorded with the same type of microphone. In order to keep the speaker-independency this set includes 33 speakers. The adaptation itself is done using maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood linear regression adaptation (MLLR) in combination with the Baum-Welch algorithm. Furthermore the close-talking training data were artificially reverberated to reduce the mismatch between training and test data. In this manner the performance could be increased from 9.9% WA to 40.0% WA in speaker-open conditions. If further speaker-dependent adaptation is applied this rate is increased up to 54.9% WA.", "paper_title": "Environmental adaptation with a small data set of the target domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500054"}
