The primary purpose of this study is to discuss a semantically based information exchange protocol that will facilitate seamless interoperability among current and next generation computer-aided design systems (CAD) and between CAD and other systems that use product data. An ontological approach is described to integrating computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided process planning (CAPP). Two commercial software applications are used to demonstrate the approach. This involves the development of a shared ontology and domain specific ontologies in the Knowledge Interchange Format (KIF) language. Domain specific ontologies - which are feature-based - are developed after a detailed analysis of the CAD and the CAPP software. Mapping between the domain ontologies and the shared ontology is achieved by several mapping rules. The approach is validated by using a variety of parts.", "paper_title": "CAD/CAPP integration using feature ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000247402200011"}
