We consider two versions of the MINIMUM RANGE ASSIGNMENT problem, where the communication graph has to fulfill either the h-strong connectivity condition (MIN-RANGE(h-SC)) or the h-broadcast condition (MIN-RANGE(h-B)). Both homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases are studied. By approximating arbitrary edge-weighted graphs by paths, we present probabilistic O(log n)-approximation algorithms for MIN-RANGE(h-SC) and MIN-RANGE(h-B), which improves the previous best ratios O(log n log log n) and O(n(2) log n log log n), respectively [D. Ye H. Zhang, The range assignment problem in static ad-hoc networks on metric spaces, Proceedings of the 11th Colloquium on Structural Information and Communication Complexity. Sirocco 2004, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 3104, pp. 291-302]. The result for MIN-RANGE(h-B) matches the lower bound [G. Rossi, The range assignment problem in static ad-hoc wireless networks. Ph.D. Thesis, 2003] for the case that triangle inequality for transmission distance holds (which is a special case of our model). Furthermore, we show that if the network fulfils certain property and the distance power gradient a is sufficiently small, the approximation ratio is improved to O((log log n)(alpha)). Finally we discuss the applications of our algorithms in mobile ad-hoc networks. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
