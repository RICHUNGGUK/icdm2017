This problem has received little attention and introduces new challenges to clustering. The paper proposes a new scheme that is capable of incrementally clustering moving objects. This proposal employs a notion of object dissimilarity that considers object movement across a period of time, and it employs clustering features that can be maintained efficiently in incremental fashion. In the proposed scheme, a quality measure for incremental clusters is used for identifying clusters that are not compact enough after certain insertions and deletions. An extensive experimental study shows that the new scheme performs significantly faster than traditional ones that frequently rebuild clusters. The study also shows that the new scheme is effective in preserving the quality of moving-object clusters.", "paper_title": "Continuous clustering of moving objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000248117600001"}
