The approach utilizes odd polynomials to approximate the inverse of non-linear mixing functions and encodes the separating matrix and the coefficients of the polynomials simultaneously. A novel objective function based on mutual information is used with the constraints to the separating matrix and the coefficients of the polynomials respectively. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, robustness and parallel superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Non-linear blind source separation using constrained genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400010"}
