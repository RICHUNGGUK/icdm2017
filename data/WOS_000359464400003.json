All-digital structure is intrinsically compatible with the scaling of CMOS technology, and can satisfy the great demand of miniaturized and low-voltage sensor interface. The proposed TAD uses an inverter-based Ring-Delay-Line (RDL) to transform the input signal from voltage domain to time domain. The voltage-modulated time information is then digitized by a composite architecture namely \"4-Clock-Edge-Shift Construction\" (4CKES). TAD features superior voltage sensitivity and 1st-order noise shaping, which can significantly simplify the power-hungry pre-conditioning circuits. Reconfigurable resolution can be easily achieved by applying different sampling rates. A TAD prototype is fabricated in 65 nm CMOS, and consumes a small area of 0.016 mm(2). It achieves a voltage resolution of 82.7 mu V/LSB at 10MS/s and 1.96 mu V/LSB at 200 kS/s in a narrow input range of 0.1Vpp, merely under 0.6V supply. The highest SNR of TAD prototype is 61.36 dB in 20 kHz bandwidth at 10MS/s. This paper also analyzes the nonideal effects of TAD and discusses the potential solutions. As the principal drawback, nonlinearity of TAD can be compensated by the differential-setup and digital calibration.", "paper_title": "An All-Digital Reconfigurable Time-Domain ADC for Low-Voltage Sensor Interface in 65 nm CMOS Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000359464400003"}
