First, a new approach is introduced to search for poles of a T-S fuzzy system in any mixed weighting case. Next, through the technique of the pole placement, a controller can be designed to achieve the desired response. Then, using the following methods, such as the Kharitonov polynomials, Edge Theorem, Routh stability criterion, and root locus the stability analysis can be made. The proposed method is much more relaxed than that based on the common quadratic Lyapunov functions. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "STABILITY ANALYSIS OF FUZZY CONTROL SYSTEMS USING POLYNOMIAL METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900011"}
