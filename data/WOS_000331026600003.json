Methods: In HMG framework, the motion template of each class is automatically derived from the training motions for capturing the general spatio-temporal characteristics of an entire motion class. Typical motion field for each class is then constructed. The smooth transitions among motion classes are then generated by interpolating the related motion templates with spacetime constraints. Finally, a hybrid motion graph is built by integrating the separate motion fields for each motion class into the global structural control of motion graph through smooth transition. Results: In motion synthesis stage, a character may freely 'switch' among different motion classes in the hybrid motion graph via smooth transitions between motion templates and 'flow' within each class through the continuous space of motion field with agile and the continuous control process. Conclusion: Experimental results show that our framework realizes the fast connectivity among different motion classes and high responsiveness and interactivity for creating realistic character animation of rich behaviors with limited motion data and computational resources.
