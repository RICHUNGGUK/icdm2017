Detail description and analysis of Zernike polynomials surfaces are provided. Wave front aberration is analyzed and used to design the Zernike polynomials reflective lens. Two types designs of reflective projection lens with Zernike polynomials mirrors are presented, lenses are telecentric in object space. Lens's optical performance are analyzed, under the condition of F-number = 2.5 and field of view 2a = 130 degrees, both of design's modulation transfer function are over 55% at 60 lp/mm, moreover, the design of three Zernike polynomials mirrors has simpler structure and higher performance. The MTF is over 60% at 100 lp/mm and distortion is less than 2%, which can satisfy the requirement of the high definition projection display system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
