A new algorithm is firstly introduced to reduce the computation of mode-dependent redundancy relation parameter matrices. Different from the case of linear time invariant systems, the parity space-based residual generator for a Markovian jump system cannot be designed off-line because it depends on the history of system modes in the last finite steps. In order to overcome this difficulty, a finite set of parity matrices is pre-designed applying a unified approach to linear time invariant systems. Then the on-line residual generation can be easily implemented. Moreover, the problem of residual evaluation is also considered which includes the determination of a residual evaluation function and a threshold. Finally, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Parity space-based fault detection for Markovian jump systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264375500010"}
