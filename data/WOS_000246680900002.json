Inspired by the observation that the most common artifacts that occur when synthesizing textures are high-frequency discontinuities, our technique tries to avoid these artifacts by forcing at least one of the direct neighboring pixels in each causal neighborhood to match within a predetermined threshold. This does not only avoid deterioration of the visual quality, but also results in faster synthesis timings. We demonstrate our technique on a variety of stochastic and structured textures.", "paper_title": "Texture synthesis using exact neighborhood matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000246680900002"}
