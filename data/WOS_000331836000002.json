MapReduce adopts a flexible computation model with a simple interface consisting of map and reduce functions whose implementations can be customized by application developers. Since its introduction, a substantial amount of research effort has been directed toward making it more usable and efficient for supporting database-centric operations. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of a wide range of proposals and systems that focusing fundamentally on the support of distributed data management and processing using the MapReduce framework.", "paper_title": "Distributed Data Management Using MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000331836000002"}
