Unlike previous papers, our procedures are based on a compact formulation relying on the hypotheses of identical machines. This feature makes our approach suitable for large-scale applications (with hundreds of machines) arising in the textile and fiberglass industries. Moreover, our procedures are shown to provide a feasible solution for any feasible instance. Comparisons with lower bounds provided by a truncated branch-and-bound show that the gap between the best heuristic solution and the lower bound never exceeds 3%.
