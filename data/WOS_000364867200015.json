The recent rapid development in vehicle-to-vehicle communication techniques makes vehicular delay-tolerant network (VDTN) an attractive candidate for traffic offloading from cellular networks. In this paper, we study a bulk traffic offloading problem with the goal of minimizing the cellular communication cost under the constraint that all the subscribers receive their desired whole content before it expires. It needs to determine the initial offloading points and the dissemination scheme for offloaded traffic in a VDTN. By novelly describing the content delivery process via a contact-based flow model, we formulate the problem in a linear programming (LP) form, based on which an online offloading scheme is proposed to deal with the network dynamics (e. g., vehicle arrival/departure). Furthermore, an offline LP-based analysis is derived to obtain the optimal solution. The high efficiency of our online algorithm is extensively validated by simulation results.", "paper_title": "Opportunistic Offloading of Deadline-Constrained Bulk Cellular Traffic in Vehicular DTNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000364867200015"}
