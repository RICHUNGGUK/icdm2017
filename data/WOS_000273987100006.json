Our optimization goal is to minimize the expected cost of correcting (i.e., diagnosing and repairing) all faulty overlay nodes that cannot properly deliver data. Instead of first checking the most likely faulty nodes as in conventional fault localization problems, we prove that an optimal strategy should start with checking one of the candidate nodes, which are identified based on a potential function that we develop. We propose several efficient heuristics for inferring the best node to be checked in large-scale networks. By extensive simulation, we show that we can infer the best node in at least 95 percent of time, and that first checking the candidate nodes rather than the most likely faulty nodes can decrease the checking cost of correcting all faulty nodes.", "paper_title": "Toward Optimal Network Fault Correction in Externally Managed Overlay Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273987100006"}
