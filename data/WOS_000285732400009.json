The EPC network system constructed by Reader, Transponder and Middleware systems forms a new figuration of future production line automation, materials management and logistics. The cross layer design applies an intelligent mobile purchasing system by combining an RFID smart phone at the Physical Layer, transferring the RFID code into the EPC Network at the Media Access Control Layer, gathering the EPC Domain Information at the Application Layer and establishing a secure EPC network framework with a Product of Authority Server (PAS) network environment at the Application Layer. The cross-layer approach allows the user to make purchases through a smart phone with an RFID Reader. Content Web Servers and ODS Servers are responsible for recording commodity information by EPC Code. The commodity is then directly sent to the user's home through the Object Tracing Function of the Secure EPC Network. Simulation results shows that the proposed method increases overall network performance by 45%-50%.", "paper_title": "Mobile Business via Cross Layer Approach toward Intelligent RFID Purchasing System", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400009"}
