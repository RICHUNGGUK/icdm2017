In view of the uncertainty of missing attributes, we put forward an interval representation of missing attributes based on nearest-neighbor information, named nearest-neighbor interval, and a hybrid approach utilizing genetic algorithm and fuzzy c-means is presented for incomplete data clustering. The overall algorithm is within the genetic algorithm framework, which searches for appropriate imputations of missing attributes in corresponding nearest-neighbor intervals to recover the incomplete data set, and hybridizes fuzzy c-means to perform clustering analysis and provide fitness metric for genetic optimization simultaneously. Several experimental results on a set of real-life data sets are presented to demonstrate the better clustering performance of our hybrid approach over the compared methods.", "paper_title": "A hybrid genetic algorithm-fuzzy c-means approach for incomplete data clustering based on nearest-neighbor intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000324110600004"}
