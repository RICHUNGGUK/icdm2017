The traffic flow path is modeled by a number of tandem linked parallel-queues with single-server and finite capacity, where channels of control data and message data are distinguished. Traffic of the tandem-cluster path is analyzed by dividing it into individual clusters. Through development of a stochastic model for this model, the explicit results of several important quality-of-service (QoS) metrics, such as the data blocking probability (DBP), successful data delivery rate (DDR), network throughput, source-to-destination delay (SDD) for both control and message traffic flows, and the network lifetime, of the proposed WSN are derived. A dynamic traffic allocation algorithm aiming to maintain the QoS of the whole WSN and two energy/consumption distribution schemes aiming to optimize the WSN's energy utilization are further proposed, respectively. The accuracy of the analytic model and QoS evaluation, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and schemes are also validated through numerical analysis and simulation.", "paper_title": "An Analytic Model for Cluster-Based Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209181300006"}
