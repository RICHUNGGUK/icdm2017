We propose a compound search strategy called conditional linear matrix inequality (CLMI) approach which was composed of the proposed improved random optimal algorithm (IROA) concatenated with the simplex method to solve the linear matrix inequality (LMI) problem. If solutions of a specific system exist, the scheme finds more than one solutions at a time, and these fixed potential solutions and variable PID gains are ready for tracking performance optimization. The effectiveness of the proposed control scheme is demonstrated by the numerical example of a cart-pole system.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy tracker with self-tuning PID and identifier design using conditional-LMI and improved random optimal algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800032"}
