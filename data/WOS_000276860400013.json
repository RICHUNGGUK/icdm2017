We consider N = pq, where p, q are of the same bit size, i.e., q < p < 2q. We show that if n many decryption exponents (d(1), ... , d(n)) are used with the same N. then RSA is insecure when d(i) < N3n-1/4n+4, for all i, 1 <= i <= n and n >= 2. Our result improves the bound of Howgrave-Graham and Seifert (CQRE 1999) for n <= 42 and also generalizes our recent work for n = 2 (IPL 2010). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
