When an agent does not understand a similar, but different ontology instance, an ontology alignment system (OAS) aligns it for the agent to understand. An OAS is presented in this paper with: 1) adjustable (being able to add or to delete) matching strategy, making the aligned ontology instance truly suits the need of users, and 2) distributed processing that follows XML-RPC and that uses XML message format and HTTP POST transmission protocol, making OAS communication across platforms and languages so that different ontologies can be shared.", "paper_title": "Adaptable, Distributed Ontology Alignment System", "paper_id": "WOS:000260564500003"}
