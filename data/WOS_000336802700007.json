The integration of passive optical networks (PONs) with next-generation wireless access networks is not only a promising integration option but also a cost-effective way of backhauling the next generation wireless access networks. The QoS performance of the PON-wireless converged network can be improved by taking the advantages of the features in both network segments for bandwidth resources management. In this paper, we propose a novel resource allocation mechanism for long term evolution-Gigabit Ethernet PON (LTE-GEPON) converged networks that improves the QoS performance of the converged network. The proposed resource allocation mechanism takes the advantage of the ability to forecast near future packet arrivals in the converged networks. Moreover, it also strategically leverages the inherited features and the frame structures of both the LTE network and GEPON, to manage the available bandwidth resources more efficiently. Using extensive simulations, we show that our proposed resource allocation mechanism improves the delay and jitter performance in the converged network while guarantying the QoS for various next generation broadband services provisioned for both wireless and wired end users. Moreover, we also analyze the dependency between different parameters and the performance of our proposed resource allocations scheme.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Resource Allocation Mechanism for LTE-GEPON Converged Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336802700007"}
