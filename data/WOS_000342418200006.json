The measures consist of angles of the triangles (triangle angles) and dihedral angles along the edges (edge angles) which are scale and rigidity independent. The vertex coordinates for a mesh give its scale-invariant measures, unique up to scale, rotation, and translation. Based on the representation of mesh using scale-invariant measures, a two-step iterative deformation algorithm is proposed, which can arbitrarily edit the mesh through simple handles interaction. The algorithm can explicitly preserve the local geometric details as much as possible in different scales even under severe editing operations including rotation, scaling, and shearing. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated by examples.", "paper_title": "Scale-aware shape manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000342418200006"}
