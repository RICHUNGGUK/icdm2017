The geometrically linear formulation of an eight node equivalent single layer solid shell finite element which utilizes fully three dimensional linear elastic orthotropic material properties is presented. Sensitivity analysis with respect to localized failure criteria functions is performed through use of semi-analytically calculated design sensitivities derived by the direct differentiation approach. Models are hierarchically refined in a two stage procedure, where a coarse mesh model is refined through the laminate thickness to obtain fully three dimensional descriptions of the detailed stress-strain state in localized zones of interest, hereby making it possible to take into account in-plane and transverse delamination failure effects. Examples illustrate the methodology.", "paper_title": "Optimization of laminated composite structures using delamination criteria and hierarchical models", "paper_id": "WOS:000265046700003"}
