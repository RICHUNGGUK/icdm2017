These stimulus generators need to be fast and well-distributed to maintain simulation performance. In this paper, we propose a dynamic method to guide stimulus generation by SAT solvers. An adjusting strategy named Tabu Search with Memory (TSwM) is integrated in the stimulus generator for the search and prune processes along with the constraint solver. Experimental results show that the method proposed in this paper could generate well-distributed stimuli with good performance.", "paper_title": "Constrained Stimulus Generation with Self-Adjusting Using Tabu Search with Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700017"}
