In this regard, a number of works have provided enhancements to the performance of XACML policy enforcement point (PEP) component, but very few have focused on enhancing the accuracy of that component. This paper improves the accuracy of an XACML PEP by filling some gaps in the existing works. In particular, dynamically incorporating user access context into the privacy policy decision, and its enforcement. We provide an XACML-based implementation of a dynamic privacy policy management framework and an evaluation of the applicability of our system in comparison to some of the existing approaches.", "paper_title": "XACML Policy Evaluation with Dynamic Context Handling", "paper_id": "WOS:000359226000021"}
