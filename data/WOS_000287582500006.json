The huge computation load, however, makes it difficult for the practical use. We use affinity propagation clustering (APC), a new clustering algorithm especially for large data sets to detect brain functional activation from fMRI. It considers all data points as possible exemplars through the minimisation of an energy function and message-passing architecture, and obtains the optimal set of exemplars and their corresponding clusters. Four simulation studies and three in vivo fMRI studies reveal that brain functional activation can be effectively detected and that different response patterns can be distinguished using this method. Our results demonstrate that APC is superior to the k-centres clustering, as revealed by their performance measures in the weighted Jaccard coefficient and average squared error. These results suggest that the proposed APC will be useful in detecting brain functional activation from fMRI data.", "paper_title": "Analysis of activity in fMRI data using affinity propagation clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000287582500006"}
