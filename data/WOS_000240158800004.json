In the approach, delta volumes between a negative swept volume and a positive swept volume, which are directly generated from original design features, are decomposed into a set of smaller negative swept volumes first. Then, the negative swept volumes are combined to form maximal swept features, each of which represents a set of machining features with the same cutting-paths. Since sweeping is a common characteristic of different type features, the maximal swept features can serve as an intermediate representation for the different types of feature-based models; in particular, they can be conveniently converted into milling features or turning features, common features or user-specific features, and their alternatives.
