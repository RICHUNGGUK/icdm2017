First, the image is divided into small square regions and a nonparametric test is applied to decide whether each region is homogeneous or not. Based on Kendall's tau coefficient (a rank-based measure of correlation), this detector has a nondetection rate independent of the unknown distribution of the noise, provided that it is at least spatially uncorrelated. Moreover, we prove, on a toy example, that its overall detection error vanishes with respect to the region size as soon as the signal to noise ratio level is nonzero. Once homogeneous regions are detected, the noise level function is estimated as a second order polynomial minimizing the l(1) error on the statistics of these regions. Numerical experiments show the efficiency of the proposed approach in estimating the noise level function, with a relative error under 10% obtained on a large data set. We illustrate the interest of the approach for an image denoising application.", "paper_title": "Estimation of the Noise Level Function Based on a Nonparametric Detection of Homogeneous Image Regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000367019300015"}
