There is a pressing need for frameworks and models to support the analysis and design of complex social relationships with regard to identity in order to ensure the effective use of existing protection technologies and control mechanisms. This paper explores how the GRL/i* approach could be used in the design of a more integrated and comprehensive identity management solutions for organizations. Using this modeling approach, we may explicitly relate the different strategic rationales of stakeholders to the alternative design choices in the context of identity management. We argue that different actor configurations and vendor-based identity management components may be evaluated and selectively combined to achieve the best requirements satisfaction level based on strategic analysis results.", "paper_title": "Modeling identity management architecture within a social setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000095"}
