Waking up a robot is done by having an awake robot move to its position. Once a robot is awakened, it can assist in awaking others. In the FTP, the objective is to wake up all the robots in the shortest time possible. This problem is NP-Hard in general; the complexity of the geometric variant in the Euclidean plane is open. Arkin et al. [1] have given a constant-factor approximation algorithm, running in time O(n log n), for the geometric FTP, and utilized it as the basis of a PTAS. In this paper, we propose a simple O(n)-time constant-factor approximation algorithm, for the 2-dimensional geometric FTP. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
