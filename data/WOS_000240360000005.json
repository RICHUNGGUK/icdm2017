In addition to defining denotational trace semantics for the main aspects of interactions, STAIRS focuses on how interactions may be developed through successive refinement steps. In this tutorial paper, we concentrate on explaining the practical relevance of STAIRS. Guidelines are given on how to create interactions using the different STAIRS operators, and how these may be refined. The pragmatics is illustrated by a running example.", "paper_title": "The pragmatics of STAIRS", "paper_id": "WOS:000240360000005"}
