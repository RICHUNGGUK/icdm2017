A further step in the study of these functions is to consider statistical behavior of outputs. This research approach has been initiated by the authors in a recent paper, mainly focused on the compensatory functions (such as averages). Now, parametric t-norms are especially studied in order to provide simply easy rules to be used by practitioners when choosing one parameter value. A pairwise parametric comparison of several t-norm families is provided by means of charts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
