This paper presents the architecture of an intrusion tolerant system using group communication, A distributed group membership algorithm is described which introduces a strategy detecting failure in local servers and announcing them to remote servers to avoid the side effects of remote failure detection. The paper also points out that stability of failure detector is a necessary condition but not sufficient condition of algorithm cease. On analyzing the essential of block, block detection and avoidance mechanism is designed. Finally, we have developed a group membership prototype system on WAN condition. Experiment results show the algorithm has well performance in complicated Internet condition.", "paper_title": "Distributed group membership algorithm in intrusion-tolerant system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100066"}
