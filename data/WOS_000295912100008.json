The face robot is composed of an artificial facial skin that can express a number of facial expressions via motions driven by internal servo motors. Two cameras, each of them installed inside each eyeball of the face, provide vision capability for reading simplified musical notations. Computer vision techniques are subsequently used to interpret simplified musical notations and lyrics of their corresponding songs. Voice synthesis techniques are implemented to enable the face robot to sing songs by enunciating synthesized sounds. Mouth patterns of the face robot will be automatically changed to match the emotions corresponding to the lyrics of the songs. The experiments show that the face robot can successfully read and then accurately sing a song which is assigned discriminately. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
