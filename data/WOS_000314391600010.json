The smallest design utilizes only six cores for offline key expansion and eight cores for online key expansion, while the largest requires 107 and 137 cores, respectively. In comparison with published AES cipher implementations on general purpose processors, our design has 3.5-15.6 times higher throughput per unit of chip area and 8.2-18.1 times higher energy efficiency. Moreover, the design shows 2.0 times higher throughput than the TI DSP C6201, and 3.3 times higher throughput per unit of chip area and 2.9 times higher energy efficiency than the GeForce 8800 GTX.", "paper_title": "Parallel AES Encryption Engines for Many-Core Processor Arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000314391600010"}
