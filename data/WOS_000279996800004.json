Unified convergence criteria ensuring the convergence of Gauss-Newton's method for one kind of singular systems of equations with constant rank derivatives are established and unified estimates of radii of convergence balls are also obtained. Applications to some special cases such as the Kantorovich type conditions, gamma-conditions and the Smale point estimate theory are provided and some important known results are extended and/or improved.
