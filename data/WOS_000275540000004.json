By employing a RapidIO hardware testbed and validated simulation, we determine key trade-offs in design of reconfigurable systems for GMTI and SAR in terms of processing, memory, and network throughput. In addition, we study considerations for timely delivery of latency-sensitive control traffic present in many satellite applications. Based on our results, we propose architectural modifications to further improve performance of SBR systems.", "paper_title": "Optimizing RapidIO Architectures for Onboard Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000275540000004"}
