The concept of diversity-multiplexing tradeoff (DMT) in multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems has been extended to this field. However, DMT constrains a better understanding of the asymptotic interplay between transmission rate, outage probability (OP) and signal-to-noise ratio. Another formulation called the throughput-reliability tradeoff (TRT) was then proposed to avoid such a limitation. By this new rule, Azarian and Gamal well elucidated the asymptotic trends exhibited by the OP curves in block-fading MIMO channels. Meanwhile they doubted whether the new rule can be used in more general channels and protocols. In this paper, we will prove that it does hold true in decode-and-forward cooperative protocols. We deduce the theoretic OP curves predicted by TRT and demonstrate by simulations that the OP curves will asymptotically overlap with the theoretic curves predicted by TRT.", "paper_title": "Throughput-Reliability Tradeoff in Decode-and-Forward Cooperative Relay Channels: A Network Information Theory Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000271492600002"}
