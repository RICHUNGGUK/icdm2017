In this article, the authors propose that ubiquitous computing technology can be effectively used for the design and manufacturing of a product by proposing a new paradigm, called UbiDM (Design and Manufacture via Ubiquitous Computing Technology). The key aspect of UbiDM is the utilisation of the entire product lifecycle information obtained via ubiquitous computing technology for the design and manufacture of the product. The new paradigm can solve many of the problems that have not been properly handled by previous manufacturing paradigms. Specifically, it will address the concept of UbiDM by the following aspects: (1) why there is a need for UbiDM; (2) the essence of UbiDM; (3) enabling technologies; (4) application area; (5) worldwide RD status; and (6) the societal impacts of UbiDM.", "paper_title": "UbiDM: a new paradigm for product design and manufacturing via ubiquitous computing technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000257015900004"}
