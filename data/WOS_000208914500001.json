This issue is important because currently enterprise systems involve end-users with different cultural backgrounds in the East and West. Thus, this paper applies enterprise systems adoption issues to cross-cultural end user perspectives in Japan (East) and the U. S. (West), based on the innovation diffusion theory, the self-determinant theory, and Hofstede's cultural dimensions. Academic and practical implications are discussed in the paper based on empirical findings found deeper in this paper.", "paper_title": "End User Adoption of Enterprise Systems in Eastern and Western Cultures", "paper_id": "WOS:000208914500001"}
