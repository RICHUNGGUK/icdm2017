When combined together, these two techniques have the potential of achieving significant improvements in performance of many applications. In this study, we provide an approach involving a tool that simultaneously performs replication and partitioning of the vertices of an undirected hypergraph whose vertices represent data and nets represent task dependencies among these data. In this approach, we propose an iterative-improvement-based replicated bipartitioning heuristic, which is capable of move, replication, and unreplication of vertices. In order to utilize our replicated bipartitioning heuristic in a recursive bipartitioning framework, we also propose appropriate cut-net removal, cut-net splitting, and pin selection algorithms to correctly encapsulate the two most commonly used cutsize metrics. We embed our replicated bipartitioning scheme into the state-of-the-art multilevel HP tool PaToH to provide an effective and efficient replicated HP tool, rpPaToH. The performance of the techniques proposed and the tools developed is tested over the undirected hypergraphs that model the communication costs of parallel query processing in information retrieval systems. Our experimental analysis indicates that the proposed technique provides significant improvements in the quality of the partitions, especially under low replication ratios. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
