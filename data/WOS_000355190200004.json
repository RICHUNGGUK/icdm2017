In these framings, spatial relationships cannot easily be encoded into traditional data lattices. This hinders spatial analysis that emphasizes how interactions among spatial entities reflect mutual inter-relationships. This paper explores how graph theoretic principles can support spatiotemporal analysis by enabling assessment of spatial and temporal relationships in landscape monitoring.", "paper_title": "Graph-assisted landscape monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000355190200004"}
