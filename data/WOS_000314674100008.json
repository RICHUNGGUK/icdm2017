Recent innovation in depth cameras has re-stated the pose estimation problem. We focus on the information provided by these sensors, for which we borrow the name 2.5D data from the Graphics community. In this paper we propose a human pose estimation algorithm based on topological propagation. Geometric Deformable Models are used to carry out such propagation, implemented according to the Narrow Band Level Set approach. A variant of the latter method is proposed, including a density restriction which helps preserving the topological properties of the object under analysis. Principal end-effectors are extracted from a directed graph weighted with geodesic distances, also providing a skeletal-like structure describing human pose. An evaluation against reference methods is performed with promising results. The proposed solution allows a frame-wise end-effector detection, with no temporal tracking involved, which may be generalized to the tracking of other objects beyond human body.
