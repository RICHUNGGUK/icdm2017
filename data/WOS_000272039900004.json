We give an effective characterization of the regular languages over such trees that are definable in first-order logic in the language of labeled graphs. These languages are the analog on trees of the \"locally threshold testable\" languages on strings. We show that this characterization yields a decision procedure for determining whether a regular tree language is first-order definable: The procedure is polynomial time in the minimal automaton presenting the regular language. We also provide an algorithm for deciding whether a regular language is definable in first-order logic supplemented with modular quantifiers.", "paper_title": "Regular Tree Languages Definable in FO and in FOmod", "paper_id": "WOS:000272039900004"}
