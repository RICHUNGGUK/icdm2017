The cable connection and the size of the teaching pendant generally do not pose a problem when the robot controller is separate from the robot. However, a large teaching pendant connected by a cable is not suitable for a self-propelled mobile robot with an internal controller This paper describes the Communication network of a personal data assistant (PDA) as a wireless teaching pendant for a mobile shipbuilding welding robot with embedded controller system that welds and moves autonomously inside the double hull structure of a ship A double hull is a closed structure that has only a few access holes. it is very difficult and dangerous to weld components inside a double hull structure because of fumes. poisonous gas. and high temperatures. Using a wireless teaching pendant has the following advantages: (1) there are no limits to the welding activities that can take place, (2) the safety level increases because no workers are in close proximity to the robot, (3) workers are far away from the dangerous environmental conditions, (4) it is possible to reduce the weight of the cable connected to the robot, and (5) it is possible to reduce the weight of the robot because of the reduced load of the teaching pendant and the cable. We demonstrate the functionality and performance capabilities of our wireless teaching pendant through field-testing experiments (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
