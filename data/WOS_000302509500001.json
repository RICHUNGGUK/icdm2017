The internal mechanical solution of a Ratio System, producing dimensionless numbers, is preferred. The ratio system creates the opportunity to use a second approach: a Reference Point Theory, which uses the ratios of the ratio system. This overall theory is called MOORA (Multi-Objective Optimization by Ratio Analysis). The results are still more convincing if a Full Multiplicative Form is added forming MULTIMOORA. The control by three different approaches forms a guaranty for a solution being as non-subjective as possible. MULTIMOORA, tested after robustness, showed positive results.", "paper_title": "Robustness of MULTIMOORA: A Method for Multi-Objective Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000302509500001"}
