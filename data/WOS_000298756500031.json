The results show that the optimized ground-state isomers adopt planar structures up to n = 5, and the Na-capped geometries are dominant growth patterns for n = 6-9. Dramatic odd-even alternative behaviors are obtained in the second-order difference of energies, fragmentation energies, highest occupied-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy gaps, and chemical hardness for both Au (n) Na and Au (n+1) clusters. It is found that Au5Na and Au-6 have the most enhanced stability. Here, the size evolutions of the theoretical ionization potentials are in agreement with available experimental data, suggesting a good prediction of the lowest energy structures in the present study. In addition, the charge transfer has been analyzed on the basis of natural population analysis.", "paper_title": "A DFT study on equilibrium geometries, stabilities, and electronic properties of small bimetallic Na-doped Au (n) (n=1-9) clusters: comparison with pure gold clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000298756500031"}
