The package deals with the case of customers arriving in groups, with a probability distribution for the group size being specified. The methodology and software allow for both discrete and continuous pricing. The class of possible models for price sensitivity functions is very wide, and includes piecewise linear models. A mechanism for constructing piecewise linear price sensitivity functions is provided.", "paper_title": "Optimal Asset Pricing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341642600001"}
