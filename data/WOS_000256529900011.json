It takes a differential level-triggered latch to recover digital signal with ultra low-swing voltage less than 50 mV, and the driver part of the interface circuit is optimized for low power using the driver-array method. With a capacity to work up to 500 MHz, the proposed circuit, which is simulated and fabricated using SMIC 0.18-mu m 1.8-V digital CMOS technology, consumes less power than previously reported designs.", "paper_title": "Implementation of low-swing differential interface circuits for high-speed on-chip asynchronous interconnection", "paper_id": "WOS:000256529900011"}
