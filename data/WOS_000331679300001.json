However, the state-of-the-art video codec, high efficiency video coding (HEVC), adopts both integer DCT and discrete sine transform (DST) such that the previous DCT-based algorithms cannot fully utilize available capacity for data hiding in HEVC. This paper presents the first DCT/DST-based data hiding algorithm for HEVC intra-coded frames where the block DCT and DST coefficient characteristics are investigated to locate the transformed coefficients that can be perturbed without propagating errors to neighboring blocks. Experimental results confirm the merits of the proposed algorithm in providing the intra-frame error propagation-free advantage, the quality improvement for marked images, the compression power inherited from HEVC, and the superiority of embedding capacity for low bitrate coding when compared with the previous two algorithms for H.264/AVC.
