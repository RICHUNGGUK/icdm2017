The idea of using ICA in solving such inverse problems, especially in EEG/MEG context, has been a known topic for at least more than a decade, but the known results have been justified heuristically, and their relationships are not understood properly. Here we show how to obtain a Bayesian posterior for a spatial source distribution, by using an ICA demixing matrix as an input. The posterior enables us to rederive and reinterpret the previously known methods, and also provides completely new methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
