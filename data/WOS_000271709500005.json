The properties of VP-DRSA are shown in comparison to previous dominance-based rough set approaches. An advantage of VP-DRSA over variable-consistency dominance-based rough set approach in decision rule induction is emphasized. Some relations among the VP-DRSA-based attribute reduction approaches are investigated. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
