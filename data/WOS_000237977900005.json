This paper presents a supervised, semantically intensive, domain independent approach for the automatic detection of part-whole relations in text. First an algorithm is described that identifies lexico-syntactic patterns that encode part-whole relations. A difficulty is that these patterns also encode other semantic relations, and a learning method is necessary to discriminate whether or not a pattern contains a part-whole relation. A large set of training examples have been annotated and fed into a specialized learning system that learns classification rules. The rules are learned through an iterative semantic specialization (ISS) method applied to noun phrase constituents. Classification rules have been generated this way for different patterns such as genitives, noun compounds, and noun phrases containing prepositional phrases to extract part-whole relations from them. The applicability of these rules has been tested on a test corpus obtaining an overall average precision of 80.95% and recall of 75.91%. The results demonstrate the importance of word sense disambiguation for this task. They also demonstrate that different lexico-syntactic patterns encode different semantic information and should be treated separately in the sense that different clarification rules apply to different patterns.", "paper_title": "Automatic discovery of part-whole relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000237977900005"}
