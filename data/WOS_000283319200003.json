To assess the theoretical model, we surveyed two online communities - Baidu (China) and Yahoo knowledge+ (Taiwan), including 213 and 216 useable responses, respectively. Both PIV and performance expectancy are positively associated with continuance intention of knowledge creation. In Baidu community, satisfaction is affected either directly by performance expectancy or indirectly by PIV (through performance expectancy). Our findings have implications for both practice and theory.", "paper_title": "Understanding continuance intention of knowledge creation using extended expectation-confirmation theory: an empirical study of Taiwan and China online communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000283319200003"}
