The capability of MAT-MI to provide high-resolution images has been demonstrated experimentally. MAT-MI involves two steps. The first step is a well-posed inverse source problem for acoustic wave equations, which has been well studied in the literature. This paper concerns mathematical analysis of the second step, a quantitative reconstruction of the conductivity from knowledge of the internal data recovered in the first step, using techniques such as time reversal. The problem is modeled by a system derived from Maxwell's equations. We show that a single internal data determines the conductivity. A global Lipschitz-type stability estimate is obtained. A numerical approach for recovering the conductivity is proposed, and results from computational experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the Magnetoacoustic Tomography with Magnetic Induction", "paper_id": "WOS:000362417500024"}
