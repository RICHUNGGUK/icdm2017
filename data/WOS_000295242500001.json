Such a process requires coordinated dynamic expression of hundreds of genes and proteins. As both deterministic and stochastic elements control the reprogramming process, it is not easy to have a way to reflect the status of gene regulatory network in those reprogramming cells. In this study, we applied self-organizing maps (SOMs) on those complex gene expression data from different pluripotent cells, including partially reprogrammed and fully reprogrammed induced pluripotent cells (iPSCs), embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and adult stem cells came from different tissues. We showed that our SOMs have good correlation with the previously reported PluriNet of stem cells and they are pictorial diagrams which can reflect the intrinsic status of cells.
