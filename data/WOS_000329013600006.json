In this article, we propose a logic for information systems which incorporates all these three aspects of updates. The logic can capture the flow of information as well as its effects on the approximations of concepts. A sound and complete deductive system for the logic is presented. The decidability issue is also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "An update logic for information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329013600006"}
