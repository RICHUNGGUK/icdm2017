However, many issues in LR FR are still unsolved, such as super-resolution (SR) for face recognition, resolution-robust features, unified feature spaces, and face detection at a distance, although many methods have been developed for that. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on these methods and discusses many related issues. First, it gives an overview on LR FR, including concept description, system architecture, and method categorization. Second, many representative methods are broadly reviewed and discussed. They are classified into two different categories, super-resolution for LR FR and resolution-robust feature representation for LR FR. Their strategies and advantages/disadvantages are elaborated. Some relevant issues such as databases and evaluations for LR FR are also presented. By generalizing their performances and limitations, promising trends and crucial issues for future research are finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Low-resolution face recognition: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000333167500002"}
