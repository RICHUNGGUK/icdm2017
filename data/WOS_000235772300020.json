In this paper, a rule-based multi-bit watermarking technique is presented. Regular pixel patterns are used as base patterns in the watermark bit modulation, and each bit is embedded in one spreading pattern of 8x8 block, which is the combination with base patterns. Space division multiple access is applied to obtain high data-hiding capacity. The main advantage of the scheme is its simplicity, blindness and high capacity. Selected experimental results are reported.", "paper_title": "Blind watermarking via pixel modification with regular rule", "paper_id": "WOS:000235772300020"}
