In an FRP scheme, a channel with a smaller reuse factor is assigned to Mobile Stations (MSs) located near the serving Base Station (BS), whereas a channel with a larger reuse factor is assigned to MSs located near the edge of a cell. In this manner, FRP can reduce the effect of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and improve system throughput. In order to establish an analytical model for FRP based cellular systems, we introduce a model for traffic analysis using a two dimensional Markov chain and approximate CCI levels with the power sum of multiple log-normal random components in a multi-cell environment. The performance of the FRP based system is presented in terms of channel utilization, call blocking probability, outage probability and effective throughput. The analytical results are compared with computer simulations. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
