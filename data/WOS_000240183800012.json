The direct and inverse piezoelectric effects are considered. The highly coupled partial differential equations (p.d.e.) are reduced to ordinary differential equations (o.d.e.) with variable coefficients by means of trigonometric function expansion in circumferential direction. The resulting ordinary differential equations are solved by the finite element method. Numerical examples are presented for [0/90/P] lamination, where P indicates the piezoelectric layer. Finally the results are compared with the published results. (c) 2006 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.
