Such a grammar is equivalent to an equation X=I center dot(X) over sets of natural numbers, using union, intersection and addition. It is shown that every grammar with multiple nonterminals can be encoded into a grammar with a single nonterminal, with a slight modification of the language. Based on this construction, the compressed membership problem for one-nonterminal conjunctive grammars over {a} is proved to be EXPTIME-complete; the same problem for the context-free grammars is decidable in NLOGSPACE, but becomes NP-complete if the grammar is compressed as well. The equivalence problem for these grammars is shown to be co-r.e.-complete, both finiteness and co-finiteness are r.e.-complete, while equivalence to a fixed unary language with a regular positional notation is decidable.", "paper_title": "One-Nonterminal Conjunctive Grammars over a Unary Alphabet", "paper_id": "WOS:000291159100007"}
