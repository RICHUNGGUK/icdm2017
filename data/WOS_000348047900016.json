Many schemes have been proposed to support energy auction in smart grid. However, few of them can achieve range query, ranked search and personalized search. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-keyword range query (EMRQ) scheme, which can support range query, ranked search and personalized search simultaneously. Based on the homomorphic Paillier cryptosystem, we use two super-increasing sequences to aggregate multidimensional keywords. The first one is used to aggregate one buyer's or seller's multidimensional keywords to an aggregated number. The second one is used to create a summary number by aggregating the aggregated numbers of all sellers. As a result, the comparison between the keywords of all sellers and those of one buyer can be achieved with only one calculation. Security analysis demonstrates that EMRQ can achieve confidentiality of keywords, authentication, data integrity and query privacy. Extensive experiments show that EMRQ is more efficient compared with the scheme in [3] in terms of computation and communication overhead.", "paper_title": "EMRQ: An Efficient Multi-keyword Range Query Scheme in Smart Grid Auction Market", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900016"}
