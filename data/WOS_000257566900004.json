Hence, effective document clustering must consider individual preferences and needs to support personalization in document categorization. Most existing document-clustering techniques, generally anchoring in pure content-based analysis, generate a single set of clusters for all individuals without tailoring to individuals' preferences and thus are unable to support personalization. The partial-clustering-based personalized document-clustering approach, incorporating a target individual's partial clustering into the document-clustering process, has been proposed to facilitate personalized document clustering. However, given a collection of documents to be clustered, the individual might have categorized only a small subset of the collection into his or her personal folders. In this case, the small partial clustering would degrade the effectiveness of the existing personalized document-clustering approach for this particular individual. In response, we extend this approach and propose the collaborative-filtering-based personalized document-clustering (CFC) technique that expands the size of an individual's partial clustering by considering those of other users with similar categorization preferences. Our empirical evaluation results suggest that when given a small-sized partial clustering established by an individual, the proposed CFC technique generally achieves better clustering effectiveness for the individual than does the partial-clustering-based personalized document-clustering technique.
