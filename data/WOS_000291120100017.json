This paper describes a methodology in which parameters such as the soil strength, slope geometry and pore pressures, are generated using random field theory. Within the limitations of the infinite slope assumptions, the paper clearly demonstrates the important \"seeking out\" effect of failure mechanisms in spatially random materials, and how \"first order\" methods that may not properly account for spatial variability can lead to unconservative estimates of the probability of slope failure.
