Recent experimental evidence has shown that the electric field oriented transverse to the axon is also sufficient to activate the axon, by inducing a transmembrane potential within the axon. The transverse field can be generated by a time-varying magnetic field via electromagnetic induction. The aim of this study was to investigate the factors that influence the transmembrane potential induced by a transverse field during magnetic stimulation. Using an unmyelinated axon model, we have provided an analytic expression for the transmembrane potential under spatially uniform, time-varying magnetic stimulation. Polarization of the axon was dependent on the properties of the magnetic field (i.e., orientation to the axon, magnitude, and frequency). Polarization of the axon was also dependent on its own geometrical (i.e., radius of the axon and thickness of the membrane) and electrical properties (i.e., conductivities and dielectric permittivities). Therefore, this article provides evidence that aside from optimal coil design, tissue properties may also play an important role in determining the efficacy of axonal activation under magnetic stimulation. The mathematical basis of this conclusion was discussed. The analytic solution can potentially be used to modify the activation function in current cable equations describing magnetic stimulation.", "paper_title": "Transmembrane potential generated by a magnetically induced transverse electric field in a cylindrical axonal model", "paper_id": "WOS:000286437400012"}
