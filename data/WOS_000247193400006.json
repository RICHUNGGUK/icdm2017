In this study, we propose an approach for dashboard development that is model-driven and can be integrated with the business performance models. We adopt the business performance modeling framework, and we extend it in order to capture the reporting aspect of the business operation. We describe models that can effectively represent all the elements necessary for the business performance reporting process, and the interactions among them. We demonstrate how all these models can be combined and automatically generate the final solution. We further extend the proposed framework with mechanisms that can detect changes in the models and incrementally update the deployed solutions. Finally, we discuss our experience from the application of our technique in a real-world scenario. This case study shows that our technique can be efficiently applied to and handle changes in the underlying business models, delivering significant benefits in terms of both development time and flexibility.", "paper_title": "Integrated model-driven dashboard development", "paper_id": "WOS:000247193400006"}
