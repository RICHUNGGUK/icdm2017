A mobile sensor network can be formed by sensors carried by people or buses. In this paper, we will present a mobile sensor network programming system (MSNPS) that can program or reprogram such mobile sensor networks. The programming process is usually initiated by a user from the Internet. MSNPS uses a gateway protocol to bridge the Internet and sensor network, so that control and data messages can be exchanged between these two networks. MSNPS sends the program data to the targeted sensor platforms using a tree structure formed by control messages. We developed a prototype implementation, and analyzed MSNPS system performance. We also simulated the system in a mobile sensor network.", "paper_title": "Mobile sensor network programming system", "paper_id": "WOS:000277454200020"}
