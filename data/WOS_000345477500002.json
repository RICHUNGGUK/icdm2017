For purpose of illustration, flow over flip buckets is considered in the present paper. A novel feature of this paper is employing new technique for refining the solid boundary particles to reduce pressure fluctuations in computation. The presented technique is very efficient computationally since only the bed solid particles are refined. To simulate the curve path and geometry of the bucket accurately a gradually changing particle size technique is used for the bucket invert. A new method is also used to impose the constant flow discharge on the inlet without considering any additional particles to enter the flow domain. Free surface elevation along the bucket, lower and upper takeoff angles and trajectory of the jet, dynamic pressure distribution and location of maximum pressure along the flip bucket were then calculated in different approach Froude numbers and ratio of flow depth to bucket radius of curvature. Comparison of the numerical model with experimental data and results of empirical equations showed a good agreement. These results show the ability of the present developed model to simulate non-hydrostatic free surface flows particularly where complex geometries are involved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
