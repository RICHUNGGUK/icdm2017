Starting with a single linear control law, the controller structure is gradually refined during the evolution. Structural augmentation is intertwined with evolutionary adaptation of the additional parameters with the objective not only to improve the control performance but also to maximize the stability region of the nonlinear system. From the viewpoint of optimization the proposed method follows a divide-and-conquer approach. Additional rules and their parameters are introduced into the controller structure in a neutral fashion, such that the adaptations of the less complex controller in the previous stage are initially preserved. The proposed scheme is evaluated at the task of TSK fuzzy controller design for the upswing and stabilization of a rotational inverted pendulum. In the first case, the objective is a time optimal controller that upswings the pendulum in to the upper equilibrium point in shortest time. The stabilizing controller is designed as a state optimal controller. In a second application the optimization method is applied to the design of a fuzzy controller for vision-based mobile robot navigation. The results demonstrate that the incremental scheme generates solutions that are similar in control performance to pure parameter optimization of only the gains of a TSK system. Even more important, whereas direct optimization of control systems with more than 35 rules fails to identify a stabilizing control law, the incremental scheme optimizes fuzzy state-space partitions and gains for hundreds of rules.", "paper_title": "Incremental evolutionary design of TSK fuzzy controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000248703700004"}
