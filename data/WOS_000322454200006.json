This paper proposes two novel problems in social network analysis: how to identify the uniqueness of a given query vertex, and how to identify a group of vertices that can mutually identify each other. We further propose intuitive yet effective methods to identify the uniqueness identification sets and the mutual identification groups of different properties. We further conduct an extensive experiment on both real and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.", "paper_title": "What distinguish one from its peers in social networks?", "paper_id": "WOS:000322454200006"}
