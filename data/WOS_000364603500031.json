Several scale and affine invariant detectors from computer vision literature along with high performance descriptors were applied. Field dataset contained a total of 474 plant images of sugar beet and creeping thistle, divided into six groups based on illumination, age, and camera to plant distance. To establish a performance baseline, leaf image retrieval potential of the selected features was first assessed on a publicly available leaf database containing flatbed scanned images of 15 tree species. Then a comparison with the field data retrieval highlighted the trade-off due to the field challenges. Adopting a comprehensive approach, edge shape detectors and homogeneous surface detecting affine invariant regions were fused. In order to integrate vegetation indices as local features, a new local vegetation color descriptor was introduced which used various combinations of color indices and offered a very high precision. Retrieval in the field data was evaluated group-wise. Although, the impact of the sunlight was found to be very low on shape features, but relatively higher precisions were obtained for younger plants under a shade (overall more than 80%). The weed detection accuracy was assessed using the Bag-of-Visual-Word scheme with KNN and SVM classifiers. The assessment showed that with an SVM classifier, a fusion of surface color and edge shapes boosted the overall classification accuracy to as high as 99.07% with a very low false negative rate (2%).
