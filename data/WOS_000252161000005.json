Previous studies considered only conventional customer lead-time, which is defined as customer lead-times to receive goods or services. The integrated approach of this study is capable of evaluating customer lead-times in six different dimensions. Furthermore, the integrated simulation approach considers conventional customer lead-time (from when the customer places an order) in addition to five other customer indices. This is the first study to consider the integrated modeling of the information, business, and production process. Previous studies mostly considered individual simulation modeling of production system, information system, or business system in various settings. It is claimed that by integrating information and business systems and production systems through simulation, major and minor organization and production issues become visible. This study also shows perceived improvements through integration of the information system and production process modeling. In summary, the unique features of this study are 3-fold. First, the integrated approach of this study identifies major bottlenecks of the production process and information system and business process concurrently. Second, the integrated approach models and produces several dimensions of customer satisfaction. Finally, the integrated approach allows the effects of business process reengineering and information technology to be evaluated before actual implementation. In addition, by integrated modeling of this study the hidden and concurrent effect of the business and production processes are identified and improved.", "paper_title": "Design of the integrated information system, business, and production process by simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252161000005"}
