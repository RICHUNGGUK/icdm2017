This paper proposes to extend Boltzmann generators to a new field of applications by uniformly sampling a Hadamard product. Under an abstract real-arithmetic computation model, our algorithm achieves approximate-size sampling in expected time O(n root n) or O(n sigma) depending on the objects considered, with sigma the standard deviation of smallest order for the component object sizes. This makes it possible to generate random objects of large size on a standard computer. The analysis heavily relies on a variant of the so-called birthday paradox, which can be modelled as an occupancy urn problem.", "paper_title": "Boys-and-girls Birthdays and Hadamard Products", "paper_id": "WOS:000305269500007"}
