This method reduces the probability of collision and thus the station can save more power. Next, we consider how to poll the wakeup stations to send the PS-Poll frame to get back their buffered data so that the contention can be avoided. Three different access scheduling mechanisms are proposed for the contention avoidance. In the first mechanism, only one of wakeup stations is scheduled to access the buffered data. The second and third mechanisms based on the smallest association ID (AID) first and the smallest queue length first, respectively, arrange a subset of wakeup stations to get back their buffered data within a beacon interval. Simulation results show that the proposed methods are effective in the power-saving. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
