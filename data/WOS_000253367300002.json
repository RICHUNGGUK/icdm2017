In order to satisfy this requirement, we propose the integration of two modern service technologies: Web Services and Mobile Agents. This integration allows wireless users to access and invoke semantically enriched Web Services without the need for simultaneous, online presence of the service requestor Moreover, in order to improve the capabilities offered by the Semantic Web framework. Specifically, we use Service registries, we exploit the advantages of enhanced registries enriched with semantic information that provide semantic matching to service queries and published service descriptions. Finally, we discuss the implementation of the proposed framework and present our performance assessment findings.", "paper_title": "Semantic Web Services and Mobile Agents integration for efficient mobile services", "paper_id": "WOS:000253367300002"}
