Lateral radiographs and skin-mounted electromagnetic motion tracking sensors were employed to study lumbar spine kinematics using a Bayesian Belief Network model. The predicted angular displacement of the vertebrae had a high correlation (r = 0.91, p < 0.001) with the actual movements. The overall mean error was -0.51A degrees A A +/- A 3.11A degrees. Intervertebral angular displacement and velocity consistently increased from L1/L2 to L5/S1. Differences were observed in the movement pattern between normal subjects and those with decreased bone density. In normal subjects, vertebral angular acceleration consistently decreased from the upper to the lower vertebrae but the same consistent predictable pattern was not observed in the subjects with decreased bone mineral density. It is possible that these changes in kinematic behaviours are related to morphological changes as well as altered neuromuscular functions.", "paper_title": "Kinematics of the lumbar spine in elderly subjects with decreased bone mineral density", "paper_id": "WOS:000266497500010"}
