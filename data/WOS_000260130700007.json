These problems can severely degrade network performance. To the best of our knowledge, so far, there is no comprehensive study to fully address all these problems. In this paper, a new busy-tone-based medium access control (MAC) scheme supporting voice/data traffic is proposed to address these problems. Via two separated narrow-band busy-tone channels with different carrier sense ranges, the proposed scheme completely resolves the hidden terminal and exposed terminal problems. Furthermore, with the use of transmitter busy tones in the node backoff procedure, the proposed scheme ensures guaranteed priority access for delay-sensitive voice traffic over data traffic. The priority is also independent of the user locations, thus solving the priority reversal problem. The fairness performance for data traffic in a nonfully connected environment is also greatly improved (as compared with the popular IEEE 802.11e MAC scheme) without the need of extra information exchanges among the nodes.", "paper_title": "A New MAC Scheme Supporting Voice/Data Traffic in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260130700007"}
