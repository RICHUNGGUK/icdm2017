Moreover, the one-level Oseen iterative finite element method based on a fine mesh with small mesh size h is designed to solve numerically the steady 2D/3D Navier-Stokes equations for small viscosity m such that a weak uniqueness condition holds. Meanwhile, the numerical investigations are provided to show that the proposed methods are efficient for solving the 2D/3D steady Navier-Stokes equations for different viscosities.
