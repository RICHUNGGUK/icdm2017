We derive an optimal control method for determining such a transformation; the approach is based on the grid deformation method and seeks to minimize an objective functional that measures the difference between the transformed image and the reference image. The existence of an optimal transformation is proved as is the applicability of the Lagrange multiplier method. Then, an optimality system from which optimal transformations can be obtained is derived.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Control Formulation of an Image Registration Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000273175400006"}
