To provide an efficient real-time Java platform, a Real-Time Java Processor (HRTEJ) based on the RTSJ was designed. This Java Processor efficiently implements the scheduling mechanism proposed in the RTSJ, and offers a simpler programming model through meliorating the scoped memory. Special hardwares are provided in the processor to guarantee the Worst Case Execution Time (WCET) of scheduling. In this paper, the scheduling implementation of this Java Processor is discussed, and its WCET is analyzed as well.", "paper_title": "Implementing predictable scheduling in RTSJ-based Java processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200164"}
