In order to simulate such a environmental system, in which chemical rate constants may vary in a wide range of values, we need a multi-scale approach using grid refinement methods. In this paper we consider three different grid refinement techniques based on the conservation of lattice velocities, relaxation parameters and time steps respectively. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each way of refining the grid, in terms of computer speed and computational accuracy. Moreover, an application to a natural mixture of ligands of environmental interest is shown.", "paper_title": "Study of three grid refinement methods in the Lattice Boltzmann framework for reactive-diffusive processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316000035"}
