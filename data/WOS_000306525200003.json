This is made possible thanks to a novel learning rule based on spike-timing-dependent plasticity and embedded in an artificial spiking neural network serving as a brain-like controller. The subsequent bio-inspired cognitive system carries out different classical conditioning tasks in a controlled virtual 3D-world while the timing and frequency of unconditioned and conditioned parameters are varied. The results of this simulated robotic environment are analysed at different stages from stimuli capture to neural spike generation and show extended behavioural capabilities by the robot in the temporal domain.", "paper_title": "Classical conditioning in different temporal constraints: an STDP learning rule for robots controlled by spiking neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000306525200003"}
