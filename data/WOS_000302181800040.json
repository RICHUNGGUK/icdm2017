This paper evaluates classic scanning strategies of modern bitplane image codecs using several theoretical-practical mechanisms conceived from rate-distortion theory. The use of these mechanisms allows distinguishing those features of the bitplane coder that are essential from those that are not. This discernment can aid the design of new bitplane coding engines with some special purposes and/or requirements. To emphasize this point, a low-complexity scanning strategy is proposed. Experimental evidence illustrates, assesses, and validates the proposed mechanisms and scanning orders.", "paper_title": "Scanning Order Strategies for Bitplane Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000302181800040"}
