In principle, the optimal protection depends not only on the importance of each stream element, but also on the expected channel behavior. By formulating a collection of hypotheses concerning its own behavior in future transmissions, limited-retransmission PET (LR-PET) effectively constructs channel codes spanning multiple transmission slots and thus offers better protection efficiency than the original PET. As the number of transmission opportunities increases, the optimization for LR-PET becomes very challenging because the number of hypothetical retransmission paths increases exponentially. As a key contribution, this paper develops a method to derive the effective recovery-probability versus redundancy-rate characteristic for the LR-PET procedure with any number of transmission opportunities. This significantly accelerates the protection assignment procedure in the original LR-PET with only two transmissions, and also makes a quick and optimal protection assignment feasible for scenarios where more transmissions are possible. This paper also gives a concrete proof to the redundancy embedding property of the channel codes formed by LR-PET, which allows for a decoupled optimization for sequentially dependent source elements with convex utility-length characteristic. This essentially justifies the source-independent construction of the protection convex hull for LR-PET.", "paper_title": "PET Protection Optimization for Streaming Scalable Videos With Multiple Transmissions", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800017"}
