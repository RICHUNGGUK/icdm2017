To solve each subproblem, our methods apply a modified Newton method and use an tau(2)-exact penalty function to attain feasibility. Our methods have strong global convergence properties under standard assumptions. Specifically, if the penalty parameter remains bounded, any limit point of the iterate sequence is either a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the barrier subproblem, or a Fritz-John (FJ) point of the original problem that fails to satisfy the Mangasarian-Fromovitz constraint qualification (MFCQ); if the penalty parameter tends to infinity, there is a limit point that is either an infeasible FJ point of the inequality constrained feasibility problem (an infeasible stationary point of the infeasibility measure if slack variables are added) or a FJ point of the original problem at which the MFCQ fails to hold. Numerical results are given that illustrate these outcomes.", "paper_title": "Interior-point l(2)-penalty methods for nonlinear programming with strong global convergence properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000237563700001"}
