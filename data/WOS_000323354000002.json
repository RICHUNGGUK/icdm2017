Designed in the ultra-wide band frequency range of 3.1-10.6 GHz, it uses a current-reused technique with modified input matching. This approach allowed obtaining a at broadband gain of 12.75 +/- 0.83 dB with an input reflection coefficient less than -5.5 dB, an output reflection coefficient less than -7 dB, and a noise figure less than 3.7 dB. Furthermore, the proposed low-power LNA consumes only 12.14 mW (excluding buffer) from a 1.2 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A 1.2 V CMOS COMMON-GATE LOW NOISE AMPLIFIER FOR UWB WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323354000002"}
