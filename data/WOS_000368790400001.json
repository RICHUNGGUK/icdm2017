In their paper, Theorems 5 and 8 claim that k FHS sets whose maximum periodic Hamming correlation is 0 at the origin result in an LHZ FHS set based on the Cartesian product, and Proposition 4 presented an upper bound of the maximum periodic Hamming correlation of FHSs. However, their statements are imperfect or incorrect. In this paper, we give counterexamples and make corrections to them. Furthermore, based on the Cartesian product, we construct two classes of LHZ FHS sets with optimal maximum periodic partial Hamming correlation property. It is shown that new FHS sets are optimal by the maximum periodic partial Hamming correlation bound of LHZ FHS set.", "paper_title": "New sets of low-hit-zone frequency-hopping sequence with optimal maximum periodic partial Hamming correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000368790400001"}
