Here, we describe our development of a coastal 200 m deep underwater glider, which can serve as an ocean observatory platform operating in the East China Sea. Our glider is developed based on dynamic model analysis: steady flight equilibrium analysis gives the varied range of moving mass location for pitch control and the varied vehicle volume for buoyancy control; a stability analysis is made to discuss the relationship between the stability of glider motion and the location of glider wings and rudder by root locus investigation of glider longitudinal- and lateral-directional dynamics, respectively. There is a tradeoff between glider motion stability and control authority according to the specific glider mission requirements. The theoretical analysis provides guidelines for vehicle design, based on which we present the development progress of the Zhejiang University (ZJU) glider. The mechanical, electrical, and software design of the glider is discussed in detail. The performances of glider key functional modules are validated by pressure tests individually; preliminary pool trials of the ZJU glider are also introduced, indicating that our glider functions well in water and can serve as a sensor platform for ocean sampling.", "paper_title": "Underwater glider design based on dynamic model analysis and prototype development", "paper_id": "WOS:000323204200001"}
