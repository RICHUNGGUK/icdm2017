It needs to allocate resources dynamically according to the varied demands of users. It should not only provide QoS such as short response time and high throughput but also achieve efficient power consumption. This paper first puts forward a reconfiguration framework based on a request prediction, which anticipates the application request volume in advance. To determine the objective of relatively optimal configuration, it can work out the allocation scheme which can improve the resource utilization ratio as well as lower energy consumption. In addition, a concept of Utility Ratio Matrix (URM) is put forward to represent allocations of hosts and Virtual Machines (VMs), and a reconfiguration algorithm based on request prediction is also presented. The algorithm will predict the application requests so as to work out the allocation scheme in advance. The algorithm can separate the reconfiguration computing from the real allocation so that it can avoid a time delay between the reconfiguration result and the varied demands, and can also reduce the energy consumption in data center. The corresponding analysis and experimental results indicate the feasibility of the reconfiguration algorithm in this paper. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
