A novel video shot boundary detection algorithm is presented based on the feature tracking. First, the proposed algorithm extracts a set of corner-points as features from the first frame of a shot. Then, based on the Kalman filtering, these features are tracked with windows matching method from the subsequent frames. According to the characteristic pattern of pixels intensity changing between corresponding windows, the measure of shot boundary detection can be obtained to confirm the types of transitions and the time interval of gradual transitions. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm is effective and robust with low computational complexity.", "paper_title": "A video shot boundary detection algorithm based on feature tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500095"}
