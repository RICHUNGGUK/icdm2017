These methods use circulant matrices in circulant or bordered circulant structures to construct the suitable generator matrices. The necessary and sufficient conditions, for the generated codes to be self-dual, are provided. Special cases of the proposed methods include the well known \"Pure Double Circulant\" construction and the \"Bordered Double circulant\" construction of self-dual codes. As an example, the methods were applied to search for self-dual codes in GF(5). Many new inequivalent self-dual codes with best known distance are found.", "paper_title": "Self-dual codes from circulant matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000303512700010"}
