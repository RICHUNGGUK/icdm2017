In this paper, we present an association rule-based protein interaction prediction method. We adopted neural network to cluster protein interaction data, and used information theory based feature selection method to reduce protein feature dimension. After model training, feature association rules are generated to interaction prediction by decoding a set of learned weights of trained neural network and by mining association rules. For model training, an initial network model was constructed with public Yeast protein interaction data considering their functional categories, set of features, and interaction partners. The prediction performance was compared with traditional simple association rule mining method. The experimental results show that proposed method has about 96.1% interaction prediction accuracy compared to simple association mining approach which achieved about 91.4% accuracy.", "paper_title": "Prediction of protein interaction with neural network-based feature association rule mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000004"}
