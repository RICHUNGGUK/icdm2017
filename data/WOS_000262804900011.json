In contrast to the previous lattice Boltzmann model, our method has a wide flexibility to select equilibrium distribution function. The higher-order moment method bases on so-called a series of lattice Boltzmann equation obtained by using multi-scale technique and Chapman-Enskog expansion. We can also control the stability of the scheme by modulating some special moments to design the dispersion term and the dissipation term. The numerical example shows the higher-order moment method can be used to raise the accuracy of truncation error of the lattice Boltzmann scheme.
