In a randomized control trial design, two groups of second grade children experiencing comprehension difficulties were selected and trained using two CAI programs. One of these was designed to assist comprehension processes (experimental group) whereas the other encouraged word decoding (control group). Four tasks were administered using a classical pre-test/training/post-test design: listening comprehension, reading comprehension, vocabulary and comprehension monitoring. In addition, two post-test sessions were conducted: one just after the training and one 11 months later. The experimental group exhibited a greater level of progress in both listening and reading comprehension, with notable lasting effects. In contrast, the results relating to the vocabulary and comprehension monitoring tasks were more mixed. The results are discussed in the light of the possible use of CAI when training higher-level skills such as text comprehension. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
