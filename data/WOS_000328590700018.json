To reduce this burden, various fast mode decision algorithms have been proposed. The current fast mode decision algorithms usually exploit the relationship among the coding modes and use the context-based approach to reduce the number of modes to be checked for both intra coding and inter coding. The parallel capacity of hardware architectures are also taken into consideration. However, almost all the parallel fast mode decision designs are focusing on intra coding. In this paper, a hardware friendly parallel fast inter mode decision method is proposed. With the proposed method, the inter mode decision can be conducted efficiently in one pass and significant encoding speedup can be achieved with negligible coding efficiency loss. Moreover, the proposed method can be easily mapped to hardware architecture which can be used for the real-time video encoding. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
