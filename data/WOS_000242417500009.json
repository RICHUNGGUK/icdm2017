We demonstrate how to create the constraint equations by means of a relevant distance coordinate system. A short program is made (in Maple) which implements the algorithm producing automatically a complete set of constraint equations for a given point-plane configuration. The point-line-plane configurations are converted into point-plane ones beforehand.", "paper_title": "Solving spatial constraints with global distance coordinate system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242417500009"}
