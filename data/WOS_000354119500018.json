Secondly, we propose a temporal second order numerical method for a fractional reaction-dispersion equation, where we discretize the Riesz fractional derivative by using two numerical schemes. We prove that the numerical methods for a spatial Riesz fractional reaction dispersion equation are both unconditionally stable and convergent, and the orders of convergence are O(tau(2) + h(6)) and O(tau(2) + h(8)), in which tau and h are spatial and temporal step sizes, respectively. Finally, we test our numerical schemes and observe that the numerical results are in good agreement with the theoretical analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
