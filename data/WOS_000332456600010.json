Nevertheless, an important issue is that the compromised storage node may not only cause the privacy problem, but also return fake/incomplete query results. We propose a simple yet effective dummy reading-based anonymization framework, under which the query result integrity can be guaranteed by our proposed verifiable top-k query (VQ) schemes. Compared with existing works, the VQ schemes have a fundamentally different design philosophy and achieve the lower communication complexity at the cost of slight detection capability degradation. Analytical studies, numerical simulations, and prototype implementations are conducted to demonstrate the practicality of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Top-k Query Result Completeness Verification in Tiered Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000332456600010"}
