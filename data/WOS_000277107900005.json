For the simple network under consideration, we derive an optimal resource allocation policy which minimizes the steady-state expected number of files in the network. Using this result, we show that, in a heavy traffic regime, the mean file-transfer delay under the proportionally fair policy is at most 1.5 times the delay under the optimal policy. Simulation results indicate that the gap is even smaller. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
