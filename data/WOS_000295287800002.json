In this paper, we first introduce some operations on intuitionistic fuzzy sets, such as Einstein sum, Einstein product, Einstein exponentiation, etc., and further develop some new geometric aggregation operators, such as the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein ordered weighted geometric operator, which extend the weighted geometric (WG) operator and the ordered weighted geometric (OWG) operator to accommodate the environment in which the given arguments are intuitionistic fuzzy values. We also establish some desirable properties of these operators, such as commutativity, idempotency and monotonicity, and give some numerical examples to illustrate the developed aggregation operators. In addition, we compare the proposed operators with the existing intuitionistic fuzzy geometric operators and get the corresponding relations. Finally, we apply the intuitionistic fuzzy Einstein weighted geometric operator to deal with multiple attribute decision making under intuitionistic fuzzy environments.
