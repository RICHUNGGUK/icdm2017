It fully takes advantages of three dimensional (3D) video, provides more interesting and vivid learning content and greatly improves the learning efficiency. It provides communication opportunity to students with their teacher, which is also beneficial to quicken the learning process. Such a system can be very suited to the students majoring in physic, architectonics and so on.", "paper_title": "Research and application of stereoscopic video based e-Learning system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300017"}
