We show that our models are significantly more accurate than previous models-essentially matching sign-off analyses. We integrate our models in the COSI-OCC communication synthesis infrastructure and show how they impact the feasibility and optimality of the network-on-chip architectures that are synthesized by this tool.", "paper_title": "Accurate Predictive Interconnect Modeling for System-Level Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000276036800018"}
