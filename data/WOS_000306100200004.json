Assuming measurement noise, we perform a detailed stability and resolution analysis of the proposed algorithms in two different asymptotic regimes. We consider both the Born approximation in the nonmagnetic case and a high-frequency regime in the general case. Based on a high-frequency asymptotic analysis of the measurements, an algorithm for finding a good initial guess for the illuminated part of the inclusion is provided and its optimality is shown. The initial guess, obtained through standard statistical arguments, turns out to be Kirchhoff migration. We illustrate the efficiency and the limitations of the proposed algorithms with a variety of numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Multistatic Imaging of Extended Targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000306100200004"}
