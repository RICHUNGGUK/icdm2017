In practice, fault features may be uncertain and imprecise due to sensor errors, fluctuating working conditions, and limitations of feature extraction methods. Features may not be apparent when a fault is in the early stages of development. In addition, diagnostic knowledge is not always accurate because most of it is obtained from experts' experience. In Part 1 of this study, a new decision method is proposed that can deal with these issues, combine multi-evidence information from different methods, and provide more accurate diagnostic results. It is an improvement on conventional D-S evidence theory. Part 2 of this study reports an application of the improved D-S evidence theory in gearbox fault diagnosis. Compared with conventional diagnostic methods, the proposed method call enhance diagnostic accuracy and autonomy. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
