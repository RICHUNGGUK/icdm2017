Traditional approaches to mobile sensor deployment are specifically designed for homogeneous networks. Nevertheless, network and device homogeneity is an unrealistic assumption in most practical scenarios, and previous approaches fail when adopted in heterogeneous operative settings. For this reason, we introduce VorLag, a generalization of the Voronoi-based approach which exploits the Laguerre geometry. We theoretically prove the appropriateness of our proposal to the management of heterogeneous networks. In addition, we demonstrate that VorLag can be extended to deal with dynamically generated events or uneven energy depletion due to communications. Finally, by means of simulations, we show that VorLag provides a very stable sensor behavior, with fast and guaranteed termination and moderate energy consumption. We also show that VorLag performs better than its traditional counterpart and other methods based on virtual forces.", "paper_title": "Autonomous Deployment of Heterogeneous Mobile Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000289625700001"}
