In this paper, traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods are combined with grey theory and a novel grey reinforcement learning (GRL) framework is proposed to solve complex problems with incomplete information. Typical example of mobile robot navigation is given out to evaluate the performance and practicability of GRL. Related issues are also briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "Grey reinforcement learning for incomplete information processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800038"}
