The ECG beat recognition can be divided into a sequence of stages, starting with feature extraction from QRS complexes, and then according to characteristic features to identify the cardiac arrhythmias including the supraventricular ectopic beat, bundle branch ectopic beat, and ventricular ectopic beat. The method of ECG beats is a two-subnetwork architecture, Morlet wavelets are used to enhance the features from each heartbeat, and probabilistic neural network (PNN) performs the recognition tasks. The AWN method is used for application in a dynamic environment, with add-in and delete-off features using automatic target adjustment and parameter tuning. The experimental results used from the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed non-invasive method. Compared with conventional multi-layer neural networks, the test results also show accurate discrimination, fast learning, good adaptability, and faster processing time for detection.
