By choosing an augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and utilizing the delay-partitioning method, novel delay-dependent mean square asymptotic stability conditions are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
