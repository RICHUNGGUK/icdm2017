The approach involving the grey level co-occurrence matrices and fractal dimension is used for bark image analysis, which improves the accuracy of bark image classification by combining fractal dimension feature and structural texture features on bark image. Furthermore, we have investigated the relation between Artificial Neural Network (ANN) topologies and bark classification accuracy. Furthermore, the experimental results show the facts that this new approach can automaticly identify the plants categories and the classification accuracy of the new method is better than that of the method using the nearest neighbor classifier.", "paper_title": "Bark classification based on textural features using artificial neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000052"}
