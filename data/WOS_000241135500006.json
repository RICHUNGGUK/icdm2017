In this work we present a context-aware application through Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) offering services to the users in an implicit way. The only required interaction with the system is to wear a little device called tag (smart label). Some of these services such as location, presence, access or inventory are implicit in this technology. Another, more important for us, is the visualization service, we call \"Mosaic of Visualization\". Our main goal is to link the easy interaction by means of the identification process, through RFID technology, with the presentation of information.", "paper_title": "Mosaics of visualization: An approach to embedded interaction through identification process", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500006"}
