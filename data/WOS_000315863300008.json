Both the formal embedded binary logistic regression (EBLR) and the visual profile's assessment grid (PAG) methods are presented as bridging tools for the real use of clustering results. EBLR is a sequence of logistic regressions that helps to predict the class of a new object; while PAG is a graphical tool that visualises the results of an EBLR. PAG interactively determines the most suitable class for a new object and enables subsequent follow-ups. PAG makes the underlying mathematical model (EBLR) more understandable, improves usability and contributes to bridging the gap between modelling and decision-support. When applied to medical problems, these tools can perform as diagnostic-support tools, provided that the predefined set of profiles refer to different stages of a certain disease or different types of patients with a same medical problem, etc. Being a graphical tool, PAG enables doctors to quickly and friendly determine the profile of a patient in the everyday activity, without necessarily understanding the statistical models involved in the process, which used to be a serious limitation for wider application of these methods in clinical praxis. In this work, an application is presented with 4 functional disability profiles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
