Firstly, the multi-objectives of the overturning assembly are constructed by the use of dynamic structure optimization design theory. The motion simulation and finite element analysis of overturning assembly are utilized for sampling scheme given by uniform design to collect the train dataset. The dataset could describe the non-linear behaviors of dynamic and static characteristics of variety of mechanical structures, which is identified by RVMs. Sequentially, RVM- based meta-model as fitness function is combined with MOGA to obtain the Pareto optimal set. Finally, a fuzzy inference system is established as decision-making support to obtain the optimum preference solution. Therefore, the modified physical prototype with the round solution proofed feasibility and efficiency of this approach. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
