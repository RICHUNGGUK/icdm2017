We conduct an in-depth investigation on how the frequent pattern space evolves under both incremental and decremental updates. Based on the evolution analysis, a new data structure, Generator-Enumeration Tree (GE-tree), is developed to facilitate the maintenance of the frequent pattern space. With the concept of GE-tree, we propose two novel algorithms, Pattern Space Maintainer+ (PSM+) and Pattern Space Maintainer- (PSM-), for the incremental and decremental maintenance of frequent patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms, on average, outperform the representative state-of-the-art methods by an order of magnitude.", "paper_title": "PATTERN SPACE MAINTENANCE FOR DATA UPDATES AND INTERACTIVE MINING", "paper_id": "WOS:000280359100005"}
