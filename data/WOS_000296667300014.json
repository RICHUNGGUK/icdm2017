The model allows nonparametric functions of multivariate continuous covariates as well as categorical covariates and time effects, greatly enhancing the techniques available to an analyst. To implement this approach in practice, we found it necessary to develop a robust modification of the Horvitz-Thompson estimator. The method is illustrated on several data sets and a small simulation study is conducted. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
