By using multiply-by-beta switched-capacitor (SC) multiplying digital-to-analog converter (MDAC) circuit, our proposed ADC is composed by radix-beta (1 < beta < 2) 1 bit pipeline stages instead of using the conventional radix-2 1.5 bit/1 bit pipeline stages to realize non-binary analog-to-digital conversion. Also with proposed beta-value estimation algorithm, there is not any digital calibration technique is required in proposed pipeline ADC. The redundancy of non-binary ADC tolerates not only the non-ideality of comparator, but also the mismatch of capacitances and the gain error of operational amplifier (op-amp) in MDAC. As a result, the power hungry high gain and wide bandwidth op-amps are not necessary for high resolution ADC, so that the reliability-enhanced pipeline ADC with simple amplifiers can operate faster and with lower power. We analyse the beta-expansion of AD conversion and modify the beta-encoding technique for pipeline ADC. In our knowledge, this is the first proposal architecture for non-binary pipeline ADC. The reliability of the proposed ADC architecture and beta-encoding technique are verified by MATLAB simulations.", "paper_title": "Non-binary Pipeline Analog-to-Digital Converter Based on beta-Expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000315244800003"}
