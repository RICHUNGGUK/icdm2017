As we know, 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks differ significantly with respect to bandwidth capacity, coverage range, and service cost. It is crucial to enable efficient load balancing between 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks to improve resource utilization, and still maximize revenue generation. From an economic point of view, pricing plays an important role in achieving load balancing in the EPS. This paper proposes an access-aware pricing strategy for the EPS to achieve load balancing between 3GPP and non-3GPP access networks and to maximize revenue generation for network operators. In addition, this paper develops an analytical model for the system using the proposed access-aware pricing strategy. With the analytical model, this paper also proposes an iterative method for determining the optimal pricing that maximizes revenue generation in the EPS. The analytical model is verified by simulation.", "paper_title": "An access-aware pricing strategy for the evolved packet system", "paper_id": "WOS:000348448900003"}
