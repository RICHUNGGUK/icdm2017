We assumed that contour interpolation is equivalent to the interpolation of a polygon that approximates the object shape. The location of each polygon vertex is characterized by a set of parameters. Polygon interpolation can be performed on these parameters. These interpolated parameters are then used to reconstruct the vertices of the new polygon. Finally, the contour is approximated from this polygon using a cubic spline interpolation. This new technique takes into account the shape, the translation, the size, and the orientation of the object's contours. A comparison with regular shape-based interpolation is made on several object contours. The preliminary results show that this new method yields a better contour and is computationally more efficient than shape-based interpolation. This technique can be applied to gray-level images too. The interpolation result of an MR image does not show artifact of intermediate substance commonly seen in a typical linear gray-level interpolation. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
