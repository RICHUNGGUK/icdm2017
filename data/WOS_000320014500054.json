A combination of the partial-update scheme and the set-membership framework is incorporated into the context of L-infinity-norm adaptive filtering, thus yielding computational efficiency. For the stabilized convergence, we formulate a robust update recursion by imposing an upper bound of a step size. Furthermore, we analyzed a mean-square stability of the proposed algorithm for white input signals. Experimental results show that the proposed low-complexity NSLMS algorithm has similar convergence performance with greatly reduced computational complexity compared to the partial-update NSLMS, and is comparable to the set-membership partial-update NLMS.", "paper_title": "Partial-Update Normalized Sign LMS Algorithm Employing Sparse Updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000320014500054"}
