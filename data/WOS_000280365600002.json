However, prior BDD based techniques incur the significant overhead of constructing and manipulating graphs during search. We present a set-constraint solver which combines BDD-based set-bounds propagators with the learning abilities of a modern SAT solver. Together with a number of improvements beyond the basic algorithm, this solver is highly competitive with existing propagation based set constraint solvers.", "paper_title": "Fast Set Bounds Propagation Using a BDD-SAT Hybrid", "paper_id": "WOS:000280365600002"}
