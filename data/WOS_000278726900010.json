The conservation equations are solved along with the microscopic equation or the so-called Fokker-Planck equation. In this paper, a micro macro approach based on the separated representation introduced in [2,3] with the Stream-Tube method [10-12,21,22] is implemented to study the main features of fiber and polymer networks solutions in complex flows. The Fokker-Planck equation, that defines the fluid microstructure, is solved using a separated representation strategy and is coupled to the macroscopic equations through the macroscopic extra-stress tensor evaluated at the microscopic level. Then, the flow kinematics is solved by applying the Stream-Tube method. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
