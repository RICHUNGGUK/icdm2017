The soil or rock is modeled as a system of discrete balls that interact through normal and shear springs. The balls can be bonded at the contact points to withstand the applied deviatoric stresses. The important feature of this model is that the confining walls that can be imagined for example as the surrounding membrane or the mold in a physical test are modeled by deformable finite elements. This allows simulation of laboratory test features more realistically compared to the situations where the surrounding walls are rigid. The relationships between micro and macro properties are investigated in this paper as well. These relationships and the corresponding curves are helpful tools in calibration of the numerical model for the macroscopic elastic properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
