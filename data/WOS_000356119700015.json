Our approach builds on techniques from the field of information retrieval to identify key terms indicative of the existence of sentiment. We model these terms and the contexts in which they appear and use them to generate features for supervised learning. The two major strengths of the proposed model are its robustness against noise and the easy addition of features from multiple sources to the feature set. Empirical evaluation over multiple real-world domains demonstrates the merit of our approach, compared to state-of the art methods both in noiseless and noisy text. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
