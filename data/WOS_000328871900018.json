These applications usually work on very large databases that are often indexed to speed-up on-line searches. To achieve efficient throughput, it is essential to exploit the intrinsic parallelism in the respective search query processing algorithms. Many strategies have been proposed in the literature to parallelize these algorithms either on shared or distributed memory multiprocessor systems. Lately, GPUs have been used to implement brute-force parallel search strategies instead of using index data structures. Indexing poses difficulties when it comes to achieve efficient exploitation of GPU resources. In this paper we propose single and multi CPU metric space techniques that efficiently exploit CPU tailored index data structures for parallel similarity search in large databases. The experimental results show that our proposal outperforms previous index-based sequential and OpenMP search strategies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
