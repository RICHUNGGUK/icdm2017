The NCT controller is designed by replacing the linear PD in the conventional CT controller with the nonlinear PD (NPD) algorithm. The stability of the parallel manipulator system with the NCT controller is proven using the Lyapunov theorem, and the proposed controller is further proven to guarantee asymptotic convergence to zero of both tracking error and error rate. The superiority of the proposed NCT controller is verified through the trajectory tracking experiments of an actual high-speed planar parallel manipulator, and the experiment results are compared with the CT controller.
