We define the notion of a relative involutive FL-algebra and we generalize to relative negations some results proved for involutive pseudo-BCK algebras. The relative locally finite IFL-algebra is defined and it is proved that an interval algebra of a relative locally finite divisible IFL-algebra is relative involutive. Starting from the observation that in the definition of states, the standard MV-algebra structure of [0, 1] intervenes, there were introduced the states on bounded pseudo-BCK algebras, pseudo-hoops and residuated lattices with values in the same kind of structures and they were studied under the name of generalized states. For the case of commutative residuated lattices the generalized states were studied in the sense of relative negation. We define and study the relative generalized states on non-commutative residuated lattices. One of the main results consists of proving that every order-preserving generalized Bosbach state is a relative generalized Riean state. Some conditions are given for a relative generalized Riean state to be a generalized Bosbach state. Finally, we develop a concept of states on IFL-algebras.", "paper_title": "Relative negations in non-commutative fuzzy structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000329247000003"}
