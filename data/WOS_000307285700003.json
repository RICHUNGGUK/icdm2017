This design is motivated by the trends towards die size and power consumption reduction together with performance robustness. In this direction, the flash converter embedded in a multi-bit Sigma Delta M is here replaced by a VCO and digital counter, resulting in a compact fully-digital quantizer implementation. This solution would greatly exploit the technology scaling. Moreover in the proposed feed-forward architecture all feed-forward paths are summed within the last integrator of the Sigma Delta loop filter, thereby eliminating the need for an analog summation amplifier at the quantizer input The presented 3rd-order Sigma Delta M features 110 dB-SNR, 104 dB-SNDR (i.e. 16 bit-ENOB).", "paper_title": "A 16 bit 20 kHz bandwidth discrete-time Sigma Delta modulator with VCO-based quantizer", "paper_id": "WOS:000307285700003"}
