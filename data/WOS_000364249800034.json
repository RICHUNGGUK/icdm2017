Indeed, technology adoption usually occurs sequentially, so observational learning can help the decision makers to reach reasonable decisions. In reality, the decision makers may prefer to adopt a waiting strategy when the situation is equivocal. In this study, we construct a technology adoption model called the G-WB model, where we consider a generalized waiting situation based on the Walden-Browne (WB) model. In our model, herd behavior is a difficult issue, but an information cascade occurs after herding appears. We explore the effect of different parameters on the convergence speed and extend our G-WB model. We also demonstrate that observational learning is a useful strategy during sequential decision making and our model is an optimal version of the WB model, which facilitates a better understanding of herding.
