This method takes advantage of both traditional direct simulation methods and iterative simulation methods. The new method explores the geometry characteristics of regular P/G grids and translates topology similarity to submatrix regularity, which is called \"pattern\" in this paper. Such pattern structures can reduce the memory usage dramatically. Further, a new type of preconditioner is constructed to optimize the simulation process. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is about 5 x faster than the previous iterative methods with much lower memory, and is superior to the macro model-based hierarchical method on the tested large cases with pattern structures.", "paper_title": "Pattern-based iterative method for extreme large power/ground analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000245190500007"}
