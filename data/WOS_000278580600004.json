We focus on the case of color image processing, and in particular color image decomposition. The problem of image decomposition consists in splitting an original image f into two components u and v. u should contain the geometric information of the original image, while v should be made of the oscillating patterns of f, such as textures. We propose here a scheme based on a projected gradient algorithm to compute the solution of various decomposition models for color images or vector-valued images. We provide a direct convergence proof of the scheme, and we give some analysis on color texture modeling.", "paper_title": "Mathematical Modeling of Textures: Application to Color Image Decomposition with a Projected Gradient Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000278580600004"}
