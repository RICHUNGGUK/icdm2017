This paper describes a program that uses voice input to manipulate the cursor gain parameter within the context of a game. For some use groups the ability to dynamically manipulate this parameter can be important in making games more accessible. The program makes use of readily-available speech technology, and can be used in conjunction with existing games.", "paper_title": "Use of voice input to enhance cursor control in mainstream gaming applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000207889300004"}
