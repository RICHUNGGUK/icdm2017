Slice based navigation systems are commercially available and frequently used. These visualize three dimensional data on a two dimensional display as orthogonal slices controlled by the position of a surgical instrument. Insitu visualization was introduced as an alternative approach for intraoperative visualization. This technique visualizes three dimensional imaging data directly on the surgical object via three dimensional display technology. We compare monitor based navigation against video see-through augmented reality visualization. Furthermore, we compare both systems against a hybrid system that we have recently introduced. We created an experimental setup to simulate an exemplary application in trauma and orthopedic surgery, where a drill has to be navigated to a defined target region. We measured the speed and accuracy of three trauma surgeons with different level of experience performing the drilling task. The results show that the combination of both systems into one single user interface comprises the advantages of each system alone. Using the hybrid interface the surgeons performed the task with the accuracy of a standard navigation at the speed of the in-situ visualization.", "paper_title": "Towards a hybrid navigation interface: Comparison of a slice based navigation system with in-situ visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500023"}
