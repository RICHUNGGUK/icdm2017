In this paper, a cooperative, lightweight and fully distributed approach is introduced to adaptively tune the transmission power of sensors in order to match local connectivity constraints. To accurately evaluate the topology control solution, a small-scale testbed based on MicaZ sensor nodes is deployed in indoor and outdoor scenarios. Practical measures on local connectivity, multi-hop connectivity, convergence time and emitted power are used to compare the proposed approach against previously proposed ones. Moreover, a simulation analysis complements the experimental one in large-scale WSN scenarios, where a testbed implementation becomes unfeasible.", "paper_title": "A cooperative approach for topology control in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000208396400011"}
