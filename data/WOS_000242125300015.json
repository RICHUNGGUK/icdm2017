In order to cope with a variety of environments, the proposed locomotion control system has dual adaptation loops. The first adaptation loop is a phase entrainment attribute of coupled nonlinear oscillators that directly encode the locomotion cycle, and it corresponds to a kind of feedback adaptation against perturbative changes. In contrast, the second one is elicitation of sensorimotor constraints, that is kinematic parameters constrain limbs trajectories (e.g. length of stride) according to the environmental state. Thus it can be considered as a kind of feedforward adaptation. In this paper, the validity of the proposed adaptation mechanisms can be evaluated through a physical simulations of a biped walking robot.", "paper_title": "An environmental adaptation mechanism for a biped walking robot control based on elicitation of sensorimotor constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300015"}
