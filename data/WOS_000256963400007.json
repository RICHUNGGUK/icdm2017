An algorithm is provided for determining the coefficients of all possible time-reversible splitting schemes for a prescribed stability polynomial. It is shown that p(x) carries essentially all the information needed to construct processed splitting methods for numerically approximating the evolution of linear systems. By conveniently selecting the stability polynomial, new integrators with processing for linear equations are built which are orders of magnitude more efficient than other algorithms previously available.", "paper_title": "On the linear stability of splitting methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000256963400007"}
