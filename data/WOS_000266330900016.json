We develop and evaluate an analytical framework for optimal rate allocation based on observed available bit rate (ABR) and round-trip time (RTT) over each access network and video distortion-rate (DR) characteristics. The rate allocation is formulated as a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total expected distortion of all video streams. We present a distributed approximation of its solution and compare its performance against H(infinity)-optimal control and two heuristic schemes based on TCP-style additive-increase-multiplicative-decrease (AIMD) principles. The various rate allocation schemes are evaluated in simulations of multiple high-definition (HD) video streams sharing multiple access networks. Our results demonstrate that, in comparison with heuristic AIMD-based schemes, both media-aware allocation and H(infinity)-optimal control benefit from proactive congestion avoidance and reduce the average packet loss rate from 45% to below 2%. Improvement in average received video quality ranges between 1.5 to 10.7 dB in PSNR for various background traffic loads and video playout deadlines. Media-aware allocation further exploits its knowledge of the video DR characteristics to achieve a more balanced video quality among all streams.", "paper_title": "Distributed Rate Allocation Policies for Multihomed Video Streaming Over Heterogeneous Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266330900016"}
