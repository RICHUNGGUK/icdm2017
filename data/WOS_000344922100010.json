The model will take single-stranded DNA as input data, that represents the presence or absence of a specific molecular signal (evidence). The program logic encodes the prior probability of a disease and the conditional probability of a signal given the disease affecting a set of different DNA complexes and their ratios. When the input and program molecules interact, they release a different pair of single-stranded DNA species whose ratio represents the application of Bayes' law: the conditional probability of the disease given the signal. The models presented in this paper can have the potential to enable the application of probabilistic reasoning in genetic diagnosis in vitro.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic reasoning with a Bayesian DNA device based on strand displacement", "paper_id": "WOS:000344922100010"}
