It is integrated into a system-on-chip and fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS process with 1.8 V supply voltage and 100 MHz max frequency. Several kinds of specific countermeasures are proposed to hide leakage information by utilizing idle reconfigurable processing elements to do dummy operations. Its advantages lie in its little impact on area and frequency as well as high flexibility after silicon that countermeasures can also be reconfigured. Furthermore, different protections including several kinds of global countermeasures and encryption flow related countermeasures can be stacked, thus the security level can be tuned by trading for some performance or power consumption. Experimental SCA attack results show that it resists simple power analysis and differential power analysis without revealing the subkey. For correlation-based electromagnetic analysis (EMA) of DES configuration, it increases 36x measure to disclosure when applied with partial countermeasures compared to unprotected DES. As to AES configuration with full countermeasures, it resists EMA with no sign to reveal the right subkey for up to 1.2 million electromagnetic traces.", "paper_title": "A Secure Reconfigurable Crypto IC With Countermeasures Against SPA, DPA, and EMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000356496100015"}
