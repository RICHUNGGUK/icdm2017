Thus, the method can be applied to some important codes such as -linear codes, which are binary and, in general, nonlinear codes in the usual sense. For this, it is proved that these codes allow a systematic encoding scheme. As particular examples, this permutation decoding method is applied to some Hadamard -linear codes.", "paper_title": "Permutation decoding of Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000356360000008"}
