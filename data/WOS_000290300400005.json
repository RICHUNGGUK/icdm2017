Synaptic weights generating these multiplicative response properties can be learned using an unsupervised, Hebbian learning rule. The behavior of the model is compared to empirical data on gaze-dependent gain modulation of cortical cells and found to be in good agreement with a range of physiological observations. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the model can learn to represent a set of basis functions. This letter thus connects an often-observed neurophysiological phenomenon and important neurocomputational principle (gain modulation) with an influential theory of brain operation (predictive coding).", "paper_title": "Multiplicative Gain Modulation Arises Through Unsupervised Learning in a Predictive Coding Model of Cortical Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000290300400005"}
