In the CIWP scheme, when a new client joins an ongoing multicast channel, the server has to create an extra unicast channel to retransmit the partial stream that has already been transmitted. However, the unicast channel consumes some of the I/O bandwidth of the server, as well as some of the network resources between the server and the client's Internet Service Provider (ISP). To solve this problem, we propose the use of the P2P transfer algorithm to deliver the partial stream from a client that has already joined the ongoing multicast session to the newcomer. This P2P transfer between clients is limited to clients belonging to the same ISP. To further improve the performance, a threshold is used to control the P2P transfer. We performed analytical studies to show that the proposed multicast scheme can reduce the consumption of the network resources of the server, by utilizing the client's disk space. We also performed various simulation studies to demonstrate the performance improvement in terms of the use of the server's bandwidth and the waiting time for the clients' requests.
