However, this approach has been shown not to be very attractive for students, especially in degrees that are not specifically focused on electronics, with students coming from different profiles and not specifically interested in electronics. For these cases, a new course approach has been developed based on a top-down learning strategy and the implementation of a problem-based learningbased experience. This course has been held since 2011 with very good results, both in terms of academic achievements and the interest shown by the students. Results obtained are presented, highlighting the success obtained with this new methodology.", "paper_title": "Learning Achievements Using a PBL-Based Methodology in an Introductory Electronics Course", "paper_id": "WOS:000372658300014"}
