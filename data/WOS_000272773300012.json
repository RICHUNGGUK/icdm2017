Various methods have been proposed to handle this problem. Most of them depend on the statistical distributions of the pixel values. Recent studies show that incorporation image derivatives are more effective than the direct use of pixel values. Based on this idea, a novel edge-based color constancy algorithm using support vector regression (SVR) is proposed. Contrary to existing SVR color constancy algorithm, which is computed from the zero-order structure of images, our method is based on the higher-order structure of images. The experimental results show that our algorithm is more effective than the zero-order SVR color constancy methods.", "paper_title": "Edge-Based Color Constancy via Support Vector Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773300012"}
