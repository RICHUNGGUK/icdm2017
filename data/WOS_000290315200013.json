However, more intelligent smartphone applications such as context-based search and advertising, early warning systems and city-wide sensing applications may require additional information about smartphone users such as their mobility profiles. To meet more personalized demand of these applications we propose TRACK ME: A new web-based framework for smartphone applications with personalized lightweight mobility service as well as location tracking and mobility profile construction. We showed that our personalized mobility service supports different smartphone applications and it is lightweight enough to provide fast access to the mobility profiles of smartphone users. We illustrate the benefits of our mobility service on two smartphone applications: location prediction and air pollution exposure risk estimation.", "paper_title": "A Web-Based Personalized Mobility Service for Smartphone Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000290315200013"}
