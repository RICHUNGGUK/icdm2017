Two orthogonal notions of \"normality\" have been studied in the past through failure detectors that give processes information about process crashes, and through conditions that restrict the inputs to an agreement problem. This paper investigates how the two approaches can bene. t from each other to solve the k-set agreement problem, where processes must agree on at most k of their input values (when k = 1 we have the famous consensus problem). It proposes novel failure detectors for solving k-set agreement and a protocol that combines them with conditions, establishing a new bridge among asynchronous, synchronous, and partially synchronous systems with respect to agreement problems. The paper also proves a lower bound when solving the k-set agreement problem with a condition.", "paper_title": "THE COMBINED POWER OF CONDITIONS AND INFORMATION ON FAILURES TO SOLVE ASYNCHRONOUS SET AGREEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000261891600016"}
