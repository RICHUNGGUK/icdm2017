This paper presents ManyInsights, a multidimensional visual analytics prototype that integrates several novel insight management approaches proposed by the authors in their previous work. These approaches include insight annotation, browsing, retrieval, organization, and association. This paper also reports a long-term case study that evaluated ManyInsights with a domain expert, realistic analytic tasks, and real datasets.", "paper_title": "ManyInsights: A Visual Analytics Approach to Supporting Effective Insight Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000209529100007"}
