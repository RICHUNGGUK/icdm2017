This requires a product development process that utilizes the possibility to simulate the product performance using modeling of different degrees of sophistication at any predefined level-of-detail (LOD). For example, the mechanical properties of a cast component depend strongly on the casting process, the simulation of which requires complex modeling at a high LOD. In this article, we propose an optimization strategy that is based on the LOD concept to develop cost-effective components. A sizing optimization of a cast model component is carried out with respect to both the mechanical and thermal response to exemplify the process. In particular, a (novel) global measure of the temperature in energy norm is introduced as an indicator of the \"production fitness\" to ensure high quality of the material properties. This measure is the thermal counterpart of the well-accepted mechanical strain energy.", "paper_title": "Optimization strategy in the development process with application to cast components", "paper_id": "WOS:000251153800006"}
