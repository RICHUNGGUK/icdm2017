A step semantics for A(2)CCS is also presented directly as a labeled transition system. A safe Petri net semantics for this language is presented, following the approach of Degano, De Nicola, Montanari and Olderog. We prove that a process p and its associated net Net(p) are interleaving bisimilar (Theorem 5.1). Moreover, to support the claim that the intended concurrency is well-represented in the net, we also prove that a process p and its associated net Net(p) are step bisimilar (Theorem 5.2).", "paper_title": "An Operational Petri Net Semantics for A(2)CCS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711200002"}
