These information-centric. heterarchically structured networks are instantiated in response to major disasters with global impact. The instantiation of GCN is conceived as a problem of collective action. Its success depends on multi-level preparedness, and network orchestration and participation. With this framework we analyze the SARS outbreak in 2002 and its successful containment in 2003. We analyze two individual country cases. Canada and China and discuss the role of the network orchestrator, the World Health Organizations. The paper concludes with implications for research and practice. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
