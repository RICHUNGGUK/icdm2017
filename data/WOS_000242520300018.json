In general, enhancing interactivity for large-scale DVEs with thousands of geographically distributed users faces various challenges such as large Internet latencies, high resource demands and high potential of security threats. In this paper, we propose a network-centric approach to enhance the interactivity, of DVEs by directly minimizing the network latencies in client-server communications. We consider two key problems: the server placement problem and the client assignment problem. We have formulated these two problems and proved that they are both NP-hard. We then adapt and develop several degree-based server placement approaches and greedy client assignment algorithms. Extensive simulation studies using realistic models have shown that our approach is very effective in enhancing the interactivity of large-scale DVEs. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
