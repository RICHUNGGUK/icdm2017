In this work, we discuss the minimal solution of a system of linear fuzzy differential equations such as A(x) over dot(t) - B(x) over dot(t) + Cx(t), x(0) - x(0) where A, B, and C are three real m x n matrices and the initial condition x0 is described by a vector made up of n fuzzy numbers. In this paper, we investigated a necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence fuzzy derivative (x) over dot(t) of a fuzzy process x(t) and a necessary and sufficient conditions for the minimal solution vector to be a fuzzy vector, given arbitrary input fuzzy vector x(0).", "paper_title": "Minimal solution of fuzzy linear system of differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000308476800036"}
