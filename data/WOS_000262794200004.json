With adequate consideration of the problem features and the constraints governing the method used, an FCM is developed to model effect-based operations (EBOs). In this study, certain features that do not exist in the classical FCM method were added to our FCM concept value calculation algorithm; these include influence possibility, influence duration, dynamic influence value-changing, and influence permanence. The model developed was applied to an illustrative scenario involving military planning, and we comment on the usefulness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
