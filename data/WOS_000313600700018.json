Towards this, we propose VERSAG, a novel agent framework and architecture which combines agent mobility with the ability to dynamically change the internal structure and capabilities of agents and leads to highly versatile and lightweight software agents. We describe the framework in depth and provide design and implementation details of our prototype implementation. A case study scenario is used to illustrate the functional benefits achievable through the use of this framework in ubiquitous computing environments. Further experimental evaluation confirms the efficiency and feasibility of the VERSAG framework which outperforms traditional mobile agents, and also demonstrates applicability of the proposed framework to agent based systems where varying capabilities are required by agents over their lifecycle.
