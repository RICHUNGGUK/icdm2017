The problem happens when a query propagating along a subscribe trajectory moves through a publish trajectory without obtaining desired information, even though two trajectories intersect geometrically. There follows resubmission of the query or initiation of another subscribe trajectory. Hence, query slipping results in considerable time delay and in the worst, looping in the trajectory or query flooding the network. We address the problem formally and suggest a solution. First, the area where nodes are distributed is logically partitioned into smaller grids and a grid-based next-hop selection algorithm is proposed. Our algorithm not only attempts to make the trajectory straight but also considers the nodal density of recipient nodes and the seamless grid-by-grid multicast. We prove that the publishing and subscribing using the algorithm eventually eliminate the possibility of the slipping. It also turns out that our algorithm dissipates significantly less power of neighbor nodes of the nodes on the trajectory, compared to the non grid-based methods, as greedy forwarding or most forward within radius, and the fixed-sized grid approach, as geographical adaptive fidelity.
