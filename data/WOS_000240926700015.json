The routing architecture is designed to handle versatile connection configurations. However, providing such a great flexibility comes at a high cost in terms of area, delay, and power. The authors propose a new FPGA routing architecture that utilizes a mixture of hardwired and traditional flexible switches. The result is an about a 30% reduction in leakage power consumption, a 5% smaller area, and 20% shorter delays, which translates to a 25% increase in the clock frequency. Despite the increase in clock speeds, the overall power consumption is reduced.", "paper_title": "Statistical analysis and design of HARP FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000240926700015"}
