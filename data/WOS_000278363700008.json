The Isolation Lemma as described in Mulmuley et al. (Combinatorica 7(1): 105-131, 1987) achieves the same for general graphs using randomness, whereas we can do it deterministically when restricted to bipartite planar graphs. As a consequence, we reduce both decision and construction versions of the perfect matching problem in bipartite planar graphs to testing whether a matrix is singular, under the promise that its determinant is 0 or 1, thus obtaining a highly parallel SPL algorithm for both decision and construction versions of the bipartite perfect matching problem. This improves the earlier known bounds of non-uniform SPL by Allender et al. (J. Comput. Syst. Sci. 59(2): 164-181, 1999) and NC2 by Miller and Naor (SIAM J. Comput. 24: 1002-1017, 1995), and by Mahajan and Varadarajan (Proceedings of the Thirty-Second Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), pp. 351-357, 2000). It also rekindles the hope of obtaining a deterministic parallel algorithm for constructing a perfect matching in non-bipartite planar graphs, which has been open for a long time. Further we try to find the lower bound on the number of bits needed for deterministically isolating a perfect matching. We show that our particular method for isolation will require Omega ( log n) bits. Our techniques are elementary.", "paper_title": "Deterministically Isolating a Perfect Matching in Bipartite Planar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000278363700008"}
