Assuming the TWMR-AF over Nakagami-m fading, the approximate expression of the overall outage probability is derived, and the diversity and code gains are then obtained. The analytical results indicate that the proposed policy achieves better outage performance than the traditional max-min relay selection scheme, as validated by the simulation results.", "paper_title": "Traffic-information-utilized low-complexity relay selection for two-way AF relaying networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600027"}
