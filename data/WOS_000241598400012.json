To extract the vascular network, morphology operators were used, primarily maximum of openings and sum of valleys, and secondly a reconstruction by dilation from two images obtained using threshold by hysteresis. To extract the skeleton of the resulting vascular network, morphological thinning and pruning algorithms were used. Results obtained represent a starting point for future work related to the detection of anomalies in the vascular network and techniques for personal authentication.", "paper_title": "Extraction of blood vessels in ophthalmic color images of human retinas", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400012"}
