Our system allows the user to specify the desired operations for creating the output image, such as super resolution, noise and blur reduction, and selection of best focus. It also provides a visual summary of activity in the video by incorporating saliency-based objectives in the snapshot formation process. We show examples on a number of different video clips to illustrate the utility and flexibility of our system.", "paper_title": "Video Snapshots: Creating High-Quality Images from Video Clips", "paper_id": "WOS:000308414100007"}
