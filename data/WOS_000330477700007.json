We use either non-return-to-zero on-off keying with data rates up to 20 Gbit/s or electrical orthogonal frequency division multiplexing with data rates up to 9 Gbit/s. The wireless bridge connects the gateways of two spatially separated fiber sections, each with a length of up to 20 km.", "paper_title": "20 Gbit/s Wireless Bridge at 220 GHz Connecting Two Fiber-Optic Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000330477700007"}
