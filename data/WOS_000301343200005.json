A personal development e-Portfolio assists an individual in planning his/her development path and reflecting upon his/her own learning. In this article, we propose an approach to constructing a personal development portfolio. An abstract information model is presented to support such a portfolio. The information model is proposed based upon and according to IMS standards. The use of this approach is illustrated by way of a prototype e-Portfolio system. The usage scenario and limitations of such a portfolio are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Building an e-Portfolio with a learning plan centric approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000301343200005"}
