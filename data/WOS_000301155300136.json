The system has a two-level hierarchical configuration: intelligent-control level and basic-automation level. At the intelligent-control level, first, a BTP prediction model is derived using an intelligent, integrated modeling method based on grey theory and back-propagation neural networks. Next, a hybrid fuzzy-predictive controller for the BTP is established using fuzzy control, predictive control, and a flexible switching control strategy. Finally, an intelligent coordinating control algorithm based on the satisfactory solution principle is employed to coordinate BTP control and bunker-level control. Then, a satisfactory sinter strand velocity is obtained and used as the target value. The basic-automation level regulates the speed of the motor driving the strand so as to make the strand velocity track the target value. The results of actual runs show that the system adequately suppresses the variation in BTP, increases the quantity and quality of sintering agglomerate, and ensures process safety.
