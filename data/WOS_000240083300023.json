The proposed fuzzy metric can suit the HVS (human visual system) fairly well. Also, we integrate the proposed algorithm into H.264/AVC decoder. Experimental results from decoding several types of video sequences have shown that our scheme can considerably improve the visual quality of reconstructed images and achieve the PSNR gain at different frame.", "paper_title": "Temporal error concealment algorithm using fuzzy metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300023"}
