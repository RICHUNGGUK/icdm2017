We prove that H-0 and H-1 must each have at least two large mutually-orthogonal eigenspaces if the algorithm's running time is to be subexponential in the number of qubits. We also reproduce the optimality proof of Farhi and Gutmann's search algorithm in the context of this adiabatic scheme; because we only consider initial Hamiltonians that are diagonal in the Hadamard basis, our result is slightly stronger than the original.", "paper_title": "Limitations of some simple adiabatic quantum algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000257540500001"}
