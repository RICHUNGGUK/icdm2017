Unlike most Sugeno models, the proposed method contains nonlinear functions in the consequent part of the fuzzy IF-THEN rules. This will allow modeling a wider class of systems with smaller modeling errors. The consequent part of each rule contains a linear part plus a nonlinear term, which has an incremental quadratic constraint. This constraint relaxes the conservativeness introduced by other regular constraints for nonlinearities such as the Lipschitz conditions. To further reduce the conservativeness, a nonlinear injection term is added to the observer dynamics. Simulation examples show the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the existing techniques reported in well-established journals.", "paper_title": "ROBUST OBSERVER DESIGN FOR SUGENO SYSTEMS WITH INCREMENTAL QUADRATIC NONLINEARITY IN THE CONSEQUENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000329613100002"}
