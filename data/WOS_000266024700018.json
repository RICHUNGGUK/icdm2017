The objective of the research is to design the production logistics system by integrating Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP-II)/PUSH and Just in Time (JIT)/PULL control strategy in a Chinese automobile accessory manufacturing system. Firstly, the business process of the production logistics is reengineered and the Bill of Material (BOM) is designed based on the analysis of automobile accessory production characteristics. Then a hybrid PUSH/PULL control strategy based on BOM is put forward to design the production logistics system, where its overall architecture are given out. Thirdly, three layers framework of a production logistics system is designed and implemented with the computer technology. The implementation of this system at a Chinese automobile accessory manufacture shows that, it can simplify the production plan; balance the shop floor production and Work-in-Process (WIP), so as to raise the production logistics management level.", "paper_title": "PRODUCTION LOGISTICS SYSTEM BASED ON A HYBRID PUSH/PULL CONTROL STRATEGY IN MAKE-TO-ORDER ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700018"}
