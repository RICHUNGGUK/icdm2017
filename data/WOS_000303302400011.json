In this paper, we propose an operational semantics for this calculus that considers the types of the species to derive the stochastic evolution of the system. The presence of positive and negative catalysers can modify these speeds. We claim that types provide an abstraction suitable to represent the interaction between elements without specifying exactly the element positions. Our claim is supported through an example modelling the lactose operon. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
