Unlike existing containment models for worm propagation, we study how to prevent worm propagation through the immunization of key nodes (e.g., the top k influential nodes). Thus, we propose a novel containment model based on an influence maximization algorithm. In this model, we introduce a social relation graph to evaluate the influence of nodes and an election mechanism to find the most influential nodes. Finally, this model provides a targeted immunization strategy to disable worm propagation by immunizing the top k influential nodes. The experimental results show that the model not only finds the most influential top k nodes quickly, but also effectively restrains and controls worm propagation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
