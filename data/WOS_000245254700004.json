This paper proposes a push system that continuously adapts to the demand pattern of the client population in order to reflect the overall popularity of each data item. The adaptation is accomplished using a simple feedback from the clients. We propose that the simple feedback is sent only from clients whose distance from the server does not incur a significant timing overhead for the acknowledgment of an item. Simulation results are presented which reveal satisfactory performance in high-speed environments with a priori unknown and dynamic client demands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
