Unlike common links, which retrieve the whole web resource, we propose an approach where partial retrieval is possible. In our case, the unit for reuse is a node in a DOM tree. A suitable proposal far extracting just one single node is presented. This solution permits the partial reuse of external and heterogeneous web contents with no need for client (browser) modifications and with only minor changes for web servers.
