Following the task model consist of actuation time, operation length, deadline, and a consumption profile, the scheduler linearly copies the profile entry or maps a combinatory vector to the allocation table one by one according to the task type, which can be either preemptive or nonpreemptive. The proposed scheme expands the search space recursively to traverse all the feasible allocations for a task set. A pilot implementation of this scheduling method reduces the peak load by up to 23.1% for the given task set. The execution time, basically approximated by O(M-NNP(3(M/2))(NP)), where M, N-NP, and N-P are the number of time slots, nonpreemptive tasks, and preemptive tasks, respectively, is reduced almost to 2% taking advantage of an efficient constraint processing mechanism which prunes a search branch when the partial peak value already exceeds the current best. In addition, local peak reduction brings global peak reduction by up to 16% for the home-scale scheduling units without any global coordination, avoiding uncontrollable peak resonance.", "paper_title": "Energy Consumption Scheduler for Demand Response Systems in the Smart Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000308780300010"}
