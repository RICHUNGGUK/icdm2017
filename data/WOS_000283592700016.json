The pattern is extracted from textual information by the detection of thematically assigned keywords, and depicted as visual imageries. The applicability of the method is demonstrated in several of Shakespeare's plays. The complex scenario patterns in Shakespeare's tragedies are successfully captured with applying the method for two different themes in each play. As the result, the organization of story accompanying multiple themes in a single play has been obtained as a pair of visual imageries, i.e. stereoscopic story visualization. This approach, in combination with a quadrant analysis of the plots, allows us in interpretation further complexity of human psychology in the characters and scene-by-scene transitions in each play.", "paper_title": "Stereoscopic story visualization in literary works demonstrated by Shakespeare's plays", "paper_id": "WOS:000283592700016"}
