Specifically, we consider prior knowledge in the form of multiple polyhedral sets and incorporate the same into the formulation of linear Twin SVM (TWSVM)/Least Squares Twin SVM (LSTWSVM) and term them as knowledge based TWSVM (KBTWSVM)/knowledge based LSTWSVM (KBLSTWSVM) Both of these formulations are capable of generating non-parallel hyperplanes based on real-world data and prior knowledge. We derive the solution of KBLSTWSVM and use it in our computational experiments for comparison against other linear knowledge based SVM formulations. Our experiments show that KBLSTWSVM is a versatile classifier whose solution is extremely simple when compared with other linear knowledge based SVM algorithms (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Knowledge based Least Squares Twin support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000283389800011"}
