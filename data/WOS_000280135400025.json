We aim not only to generate realistic simulation results but also to make our framework flexible and extendible, and easy to use for model developers. A divide-and-conquer methodology is first adopted to divide the complex navigational behaviors into three levels, which allows us to focus on the intermediate level. We then propose a pattern-based framework for modeling pedestrian navigational behavior at this level. In our framework, spatial-temporal patterns are used to represent the situational perception, and a pattern-matching mechanism is proposed to model the navigational choices of individual pedestrians. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, a computational model is constructed to simulate pedestrian behaviors in a corridor with medium to relatively high density of pedestrians. Simulation results with this model are summarized in this paper.
