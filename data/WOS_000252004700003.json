The huge number of collision-based reactions presented in its evolution space are useful to implement some specific (conventional and unconventional) computable process, hence Rule 110 may be used to implement any desired simulation. Therefore there is necessity of defining some interesting objects as: solitons, eaters, black holes, flip-flops, fuses and more. For example, this work explains the construction of meta-gliders; for these constructions, we specify a regular language in Rule 110 to code in detail initial conditions with a required behavior. The paper depicts as well several experimental collision-based constructions.", "paper_title": "Rule 110 objects and other collision-based constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000252004700003"}
