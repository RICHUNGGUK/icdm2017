Scientists are 95-100% certain that it is primarily caused by increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases produced by human activities. Policies dealing with global warming depend on accurate and precise monitoring of the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, most greenhouse gas emissions management comes from bottom-up reporting, in which a company reports its energy use and other resource consumption metrics and maps out its carbon footprint. This is not a sufficient good way. A big data network of sensors has been constructed by us in Neimenggu province of China, which will gather huge amount of more accurate information on the dynamics of greenhouse gases in local areas and measure changes over time. Application specific instruction set processor is integrated in those sensor devices, to perform preliminary process of collected data. In this work, we have presented our efforts at constructing the big data sensor network for monitoring the greenhouse gases emission and mainly focused on building the ASIP's retargetable compiler framework designed and dedicated for our sensor network.", "paper_title": "Effort at Constructing Big Data Sensor Networks for Monitoring Greenhouse Gas Emission", "paper_id": "WOS:000339211000001"}
