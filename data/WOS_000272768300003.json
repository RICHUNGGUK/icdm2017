Once feature correspondence has been established, the transformation parameters are then estimated using non-linear least squares (NLLS) and the standard RANSAC (random sample consensus) algorithm. The technique is evaluated under similarity transforms - translation, rotation and scale (zoom) and also under illumination changes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
