The equations are derived from a spatial stiffness model of registration. The fiducial TRE equation is equivalent to one presented by [1]. We believe that the surface TRE equation is novel, and we provide evidence from computer simulations to support the accuracy of the approximation.", "paper_title": "Analytic expressions for fiducial and surface target registration error", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700078"}
