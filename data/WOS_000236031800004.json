The suitability of using CRM to model multi-agent systems is justified by CRM's capacity in specifying dynamic features of multi-agent systems. A case study in an agent-based e-learning system (course material updating) demonstrates how the CRM based language, Gamma, can be used to specify the architectures of multi-agent systems. The effectiveness of specifying multi-agent systems in CRM from the view point of software engineering is further justified by introducing a transformational method for implementing the specified multi-agent systems. A computation model with a tree-structured architecture is proposed to base the design of the specified multi-agent system during the implementation phase. A module language based on the computation model is introduced as an intermediate language to facilitate the translation of the specification of multi-agent systems. The multicast networking technology pragmatizes the implementation of communications and synchronization among distributed agents. The paper also discusses the feasibility of implementing an automatic translation from the Gamma specification to a program in the module language.", "paper_title": "Specifying distributed multi-agent systems in chemical reaction metaphor", "paper_id": "WOS:000236031800004"}
