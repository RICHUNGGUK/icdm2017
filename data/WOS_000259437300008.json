This paper develops an XML query rewriting and ontology integration mechanism, which acts as a global-as-view (GAV) approach to represent and query semantic information in mediator based information integration environment. It proposes the patterns and properties of ontology mappings, discusses the procedure and algorithm of ontology integration firstly, and then proposes the ontology based XML query mechanism, especially the XML query rewriting mechanism. Finally, a mediator-based implementation of the mechanism in OBSA system is introduced. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
