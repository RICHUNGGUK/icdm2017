Agent-based approaches are ideal for such problems and they provide flexible, robust, and emergent solutions during dynamically changing process conditions. Three different multi-layered multi-agent, frameworks are proposed for the supervision of grade transitions in autocatalytic reactor networks. The first framework is the centralized framework and it is useful for small-scale grade transitions where only a small region of the network needs to be reconfigured. Alternatively, the other two frameworks use a decentralized approach. The first decentralized framework implements genetic algorithms and the second one uses self-organizing heuristics and auctions for large-scale grade transitions. The case studies demonstrate that as the complexity of the reconfiguration problem increases, decentralized solutions perform more efficiently. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
