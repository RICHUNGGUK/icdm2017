Handling images by a basis of associated sets proves more effective than considering images as the collection of acquired intensity values, even in several frequency bands, due to the various noise sources. Then, level lines and sets are more stable features to support recognition than edges likely resulting from high pass filtering. Color being assumed more informative than intensity is preferred to exhibit the set basis. In the paper, color lines are defined after level lines and they are extracted and characterized consecutively. Greater information is conveyed by color lines resulting into more efficient grouping towards objects. A novel Hausdorff-inspired disparity finder is introduced fed in by color lines with respect to epipolar constraints. The efficient disparity map obtained by pixel wise line-matching between left and right images justifies our technical choices.", "paper_title": "Mixed color/level lines and their stereo-matching with a modified Hausdorff distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000288894000001"}
