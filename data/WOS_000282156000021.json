New impeller was manufactured and tested in the test rig. Comparison of the local optimization method results with the global optimization method results showed that the gradient based method has detected the global optimum point. Experimental results confirmed the numerical efficiency improvement in all measured points. This study illustrated that the developed gradient based optimization method is efficient for 3D radial turbomachinery blade optimization. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
