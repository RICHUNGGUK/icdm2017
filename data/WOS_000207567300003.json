Iterations with a conjugate gradient-type method are carried out on each level, and terminated by a stopping rule based on the discrepancy principle. Prolongation is carried out by nonlinear edge-preserving operators, which are defined via PDEs associated with Perona-Malik or total variation-type models. Computed examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the methods proposed.", "paper_title": "Cascadic Multiresolution Methods for Image Deblurring", "paper_id": "WOS:000207567300003"}
