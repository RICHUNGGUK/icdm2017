Antagonism is considered to be the key for realizing more than one locomotion mode. In this paper, we demonstrate how antagonistic pneumatic actuators can be utilized to achieve three dynamic locomotion modes (walking, jumping, and running) in a biped robot. Firstly, we discuss the contribution of joint compliance to dynamic locomotion, which highlights the importance of tunable compliance. Secondly, we introduce the design of a biped robot powered by antagonistic pneumatic actuators. Lastly, we apply simple feedforward controllers for realizing walking, jumping, and running and confirm the contribution of joint compliance to such multimodal dynamic locomotion. Based on the results, we can conclude that the antagonistic pneumatic actuators are superior candidates for constructing a human-like dynamic locomotor. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
