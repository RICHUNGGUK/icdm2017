However, multibiometric systems require storage of multiple biometric templates (e. g., fingerprint, iris, and face) for each user, which results in increased risk to user privacy and system security. One method to protect individual templates is to store only the secure sketch generated from the corresponding template using a biometric cryptosystem. This requires storage of multiple sketches. In this paper, we propose a feature-level fusion framework to simultaneously protect multiple templates of a user as a single secure sketch. Our main contributions include: 1) practical implementation of the proposed feature-level fusion framework using two well-known biometric cryptosystems, namely, fuzzy vault and fuzzy commitment, and 2) detailed analysis of the trade-off between matching accuracy and security in the proposed multibiometric cryptosystems based on two different databases (one real and one virtual multimodal database), each containing the three most popular biometric modalities, namely, fingerprint, iris, and face. Experimental results show that both the multibiometric cryptosystems proposed here have higher security and matching performance compared to their unibiometric counterparts.", "paper_title": "Multibiometric Cryptosystems Based on Feature-Level Fusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000299440300012"}
