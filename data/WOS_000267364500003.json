A pressing problem is that of incorporating ever more elaborate gaming scenarios into virtual worlds while ensuring player numbers can be measured in the millions. This problem reaches across a number of research areas in computing science and has already received attention from the research community in its own right. In this chapter, the major problems associated to the provisioning of expected player interaction in large-scale virtual worlds is described together with how research efforts may tackle such problems. Conclusions are drawn from observations of related work and a number of future challenges highlighted.", "paper_title": "Highly Interactive Scalable Online Worlds", "paper_id": "WOS:000267364500003"}
