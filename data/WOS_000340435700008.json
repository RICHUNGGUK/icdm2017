The outlined in this paper is an efficient and robust collocation method based on the ANNs and Bernstein polynomials intended for the fuzzy Abel integral equation problem. To do this, first truncated Bernstein-series polynomial of the solution function is substituted in parametric form of the given fuzzy problem. Then an architecture of ANNs namely the feed-back neural nets is designed to determine values for the unknown coefficients. Eventually, the proposed method is implemented on some numerical examples, and also is compared with an usual and classical technique.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network approach to the fuzzy Abel integral equation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000340435700008"}
