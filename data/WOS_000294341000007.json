It creates a semi-immersive desktop virtual training environment with a sense of high reality at a low cost. With the CNC Partner, a trainee can learn the knowledge of NC programming and acquire the practical operation skills on a CNC machine tool prior to operate a real one. The framework of CNC Partner is established and described in detail. And its functions on training are summarized. The functions of CNC Partner-assisted teaching are also introduced. Up to now, over 200 sets of CNC Partner systems have been installed in several vocational education schools in China. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
