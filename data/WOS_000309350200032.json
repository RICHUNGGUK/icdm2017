CaCUDA is built upon the Cactus computational toolkit, an open source problem solving environment designed for scientists and engineers. Due to the flexibility and extensibility of the Cactus toolkit, the addition of a GPGPU programming framework required no changes to the Cactus infrastructure, guaranteeing that existing features and modules will continue to work without modification. CaCUDA was tested and benchmarked using a 3D CFD code based on a finite difference discretization of Navier-Stokes equations.", "paper_title": "Using GPU's to Accelerate Stencil-based Computation Kernels for the Development of Large Scale Scientific Applications on Heterogeneous Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000309350200032"}
