A formal relation is shown between edge restricted multi-coloring scheme and maximum throughput utility function of the system. A distributed edge restricted multi-coloring scheme is proposed to maximize the overall throughput of the system while guaranteeing a certain grade of service to individual users with fairness.", "paper_title": "A Channel Allocation Based Self-Coexistence Scheme for Homogeneous Ad-Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377546900023"}
