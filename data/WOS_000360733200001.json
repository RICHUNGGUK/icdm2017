Furthermore, compressive sensing allows that a sparse signal can be reconstructed from few measurements, and choosing a suitable sensing matrix is also important. For this purpose, random sensing matrices have been studied, while a few researches on deterministic sensing matrices have been considered. In this paper, we use compressive sensing for multiple target localization in WSNs. We formulate multiple target locations as a sparse matrix in the discrete time domain. Then, we exploit received signal strength information to recover noisy measurements, while utilizing deterministic sensing matrices and greedy algorithm to locate each target. The proposal approach reduces the number of measurements in localization process, takes low-cost, and maintains the accuracy as compared to the conventional approach which is noncompressive sensing. Further simulation shows that the proposed approach is practical in use, while being favorably comparable to the existing random sensing matrices in reconstruction performance. This cooperation between the compressive sensing using deterministic sensing matrices and multiple target localization provides a new point of view in WSN localization.", "paper_title": "Multiple Target Localization in WSNs Based on Compressive Sensing Using Deterministic Sensing Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000360733200001"}
