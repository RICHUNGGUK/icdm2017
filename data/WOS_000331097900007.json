However, the use of network coding, especially random linear network coding, incurs serious time delay in the decoding process and thus it is imperative to use a network coding implementation that has low decoding latency characteristics, e.g. a parallelized implementation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of parallelizing Pipeline network coding, a variant of random linear coding recently developed in order to alleviate the problems of random linear coding. We propose a novel massively parallelized decoding algorithm leveraging General Purpose Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) and show its performance enhancement by up to 100% compared with previous GPGPU-based parallel algorithms via experiments on real systems.", "paper_title": "A Highly Parallelized Decoder for Random Network Coding leveraging GPGPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000331097900007"}
