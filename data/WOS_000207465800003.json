A unique hardware abstraction approach is used to provide device extensibility and manageability. Rule-based device configuration and control which allows the real-time changing of system behavior is presented. Various data encoding schemes used to accommodate data captured by a device and used as the input of rule based data filtration and aggregation are discussed. We discuss a mechanism of building self-governed automation processing in the data capture process. Performance is measured by using virtual reader that generates high volume of data at high speed. The measurement shows the RC is capable of handling such data.", "paper_title": "On the Identification Device Management and Data Capture via WinRFID1 Edge-Server", "paper_id": "WOS:000207465800003"}
