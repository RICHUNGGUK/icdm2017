The definitions of dynamic slicing are formulated in terms of the projection theory of slicing. This shows that existing forms of dynamic slicing contain three orthogonal dimensions in their slicing criteria and allows for a lattice-theoretic study of the subsumption relationship between these dimensions and their relationship to static slicing formulations.
