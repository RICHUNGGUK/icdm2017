Some estimation methods have been proposed on this line. However, most of them require some additional assumptions: a parametric model for their dependencies or a temporal structure of the sources, for example. In previous work, we have proposed a generalized least squares approach using fourth-order moments to the blind source separation problem in the general case where those additional assumptions do not hold. In this article, we develop a simple optimization algorithm for the least squares approach, or a quasi-stochastic gradient algorithm. The new algorithm is able to estimate variance-dependent components even when the number of variables is large and the number of moments is computationally prohibitive.", "paper_title": "A quasi-stochastic gradient algorithm for variance-dependent component analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241475200022"}
