Computationally, for minimizing the proposed energy functional, we investigate an efficient numerical algorithm-the split Bregman method, and briefly prove its convergence. In addition, comparisons are also made with the classical OSV (Osher-Sole-Vese) model (Osher et al., 2003) and the TV-Gabor model (Aujol et al., 2006), in terms of the edge-preserving capability and the recovered results. Numerical experiments markedly demonstrate that our novel scheme yields significantly better outcomes in image decomposition and denoising than the existing models.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT ALGORITHM FOR ADAPTIVE TOTAL VARIATION BASED IMAGE DECOMPOSITION AND RESTORATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000338781100015"}
