In order to suppress the pseudo-Gibbs and curvelet-like artifacts, the conventional shrinkage results are further processed by a projected total variation diffusion, in which only the insignificant curvelet coefficients or high-frequency part of the signal are changed by use of a constrained projection. Numerical experiments from piecewise-smooth to textured images show good performances of the proposed method to recover the shape of edges and important detailed components, in comparison to some existing methods.", "paper_title": "Combined curvelet shrinkage and nonlinear anisotropic diffusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000248831100003"}
