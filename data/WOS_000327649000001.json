In this paper, the DCCM is considered to construct cognitive wireless netwroks, in which the structure and implementation of service-oriented radio architecture (SORA) are expounded. Using SORA, a DCCM-based wireless resource management is considered in design and implementation of cognitive wireless networks. It shows that our proposed DCCM-based SORA is able to provide loosely coupled, reusable, and scalable implementations in machine-to-machine (M2M) heteogeneous wireless networking environment,", "paper_title": "A Dual-Cycle Architecture in Cognitive M2M Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327649000001"}
