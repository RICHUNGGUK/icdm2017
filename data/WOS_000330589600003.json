This work develops learning-based premise selection in two ways. First, a fine-grained dependency analysis of existing high-level formal mathematical proofs is used to build a large knowledge base of proof dependencies, providing precise data for ATP-based re-verification and for training premise selection algorithms. Second, a new machine learning algorithm for premise selection based on kernel methods is proposed and implemented. To evaluate the impact of both techniques, a benchmark consisting of 2078 large-theory mathematical problems is constructed, extending the older MPTP Challenge benchmark. The combined effect of the techniques results in a 50 % improvement on the benchmark over the state-of-the-art Vampire/SInE system for automated reasoning in large theories.", "paper_title": "Premise Selection for Mathematics by Corpus Analysis and Kernel Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000330589600003"}
