The proposed floating inductance needs not component matching condition. Base on the proposed floating inductance as building block, a new voltage-mode universal biquadratic filter with one input and five outputs can be obtained. The proposed universal biquad uses two differential voltage current conveyors, three resistors and two grounded capacitors. All standard filter functions; highpass, bandpass, lowpass, notch and allpass can be obtained, simultaneously, without changing the passive elements. The proposed universal biquad has the features of using only grounded capacitors and orthogonal controllable of resonance angular frequency and quality factor.", "paper_title": "Lossless inductance simulation and voltage-mode universal biquadratic filter with one input and five outputs using DVCCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000274330600014"}
