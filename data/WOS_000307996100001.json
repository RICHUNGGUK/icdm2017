This problem is formally known as the sparsity of the ratings' matrix,because this is the structure that holds user preferences. This paper outlines a Collaborative Filtering Recommender System that tries to amend this situation. After applying Singular Value Decomposition to reduce the dimensionality of the data, our system makes use of a dynamic Artificial Neural Network architecture with boosted learning to predict user ratings. Furthermore we use the concept of k-separability to deal with the resulting noisy data, a methodology not yet tested in Recommender Systems. The combination of these techniques applied to the MovieLens datasets seems to yield promising results.", "paper_title": "APPLYING k-SEPARABILITY TO COLLABORATIVE RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307996100001"}
