This paper presents a novel methodology for retrieving infographics from a digital library that takes into account a graphic's structural and message content. The retrieval methodology can be summarized thus: 1) hypothesize requisite structural and message content from a natural language query, 2) measure the relevance of each candidate infographic to the requisite structural and message content hypothesized from the user query, and 3) integrate these relevance measurements via a linear combination model in order to produce a ranked list of infographics in response to the user query. The methodology has been implemented and evaluated, and it significantly outperforms a baseline method that treats queries and graphics as bags of words.
