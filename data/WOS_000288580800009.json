Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) are more sensitive to these issues where each mobile device acts like a router. Thus, routing delay adds significantly to overall end-to-end delay. This paper analyzes the performance of the Warning Energy Aware Clusterhead/Virtual Base Station-On demand (WEAC/VBS-0) protocol in terms of average delay, multi-hop communication and power minimization aspects that are subject to video traffic. H.263 and H.264 standards are utilized to model the simulated network. HCB model is also utilized to minimize the power consumption. The simulation results are demonstrated on a single hop and multi-hop settings. This includes the power consumption and the effect of sudden demise of cluster heads in the Warning Energy Aware Cluster head (WEAC) protocol. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
