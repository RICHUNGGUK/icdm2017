Domain resource ontology is identified as the key enabler to a meaningful agent communication for collaborative work among multidisciplinary organizations. A semantic-driven workflow representation adopted in the proposed service-oriented modeling framework can speed up the design process of a complex engineering system by composing the process with existing multidisciplinary design resources intelligently. The proposed approach has been evaluated with a multidisciplinary collaborative design example of metal stamping progressive die.", "paper_title": "A service-oriented modeling approach for distributed management of multidisciplinary, design knowledge in the semantic grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000075"}
