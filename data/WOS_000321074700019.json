In this study, 71 pyrrole derivatives active against M. tuberculosis, were used to derive through a recent new 3-D QSAR protocol; 3-D QSAutogrid/R, several predictive 3-D QSAR models on compounds aligned by a previously reported pharmacophoric application. A final multiprobe (MP) 3-D QSAR model was then obtained configuring itself as a tool to derive pharmacophoric quantitative models. To stress the applicability of the described models, an external test set of unrelated and newly synthesized series of R-4-amino-3-isoxazolidinone derivatives found to be active at micromolar level against M. tuberculosis was used, and the predicted bioactivities were in good agreement with the experimental values. The 3-D QSAutogrid/R procedure proved to be able to correlate by a single multi-informative scenario the,different activity molecular profiles thus confirming its usefulness in the rational drug design approach.", "paper_title": "Pharmacophore Assessment Through 3-D QSAR: Evaluation of the Predictive Ability on New Derivatives by the Application on a Series of Antitubercular Agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000321074700019"}
