The basic governing equations of fluid domain, solid domain and fluid solid interface are given for flow-blade interaction system. Furthermore a numerical method named bidirectional sequential method is illuminated, and the corresponding physical process of vibration from unsteady state to steady state is described. The dynamical response can be obtained by this time domain method conveniently by the use of commercial softwares. Then PHBA is put forward based on vibration stress according to the probabilistic accumulative damage model. Finally art engineering sample is discussed to illuminate PHBA flow clearly. PHBA is performed on two types of second-stage stators to evaluate the operation security, thus the probabilistic accumulative damages altering with operation time are calculated, and the operational reliabilities are also obtained. The results can describe the possibility of HCF intuitively and quantitatively, which shows PHBA is very helpful in the HCF prediction and failure analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
