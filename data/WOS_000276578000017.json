A modified fuzzy logic system (FLS) with an adequate scaling factor (SF) is proposed to infer adequate partial factors (PFs) for the PIC scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed FLS can adapt to the large variations of users' fading effects; the FLPIC thus outperforms the conventional PIC (CPIC) and constant-weight MC (CWPIC) over two-path and three-path time-varying frequency-selective fading channels, especially at heavy system load in DS-CDMA systems.", "paper_title": "APPLICATIONS OF FUZZY LOGIC FOR ADAPTIVE INTERFERENCE CANCELLER IN CDMA WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000017"}
