We propose a new method to approximately solve this problem. Numerical experiments show that this method gets close to the globally optimal solution, and is 15-100 times faster for typical images than a state-of-the-art interior point method. Our method's denoising performance is comparable to that of a state-of-the-art noise removal method of [4]. Our work extends our previously published algorithm for solving the constrained total variation minimization problem for 1D signals [13] which was shown to produce the globally optimal solution exactly in O(N log N) time where N is the number of data points.", "paper_title": "Approximate methods for constrained total variation minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200041"}
