Energy management is of concern to both hardware and software designers. In this article, we present an energy-aware code-motion framework for a compiler to generate concentrated accesses to input and output (I/O) buffers inside a GPU. Our solution attempts to gather the I/O buffer accesses into clusters, thereby extending the time period during which the I/O buffers are clock or power gated. We performed experiments in which the energy consumption was simulated by incorporating our compiler-analysis and code-motion framework into an in-house compiler tool. The experimental results demonstrated that our mechanisms were effective in reducing the energy consumption of the shader processor by an average of 13.1% and decreasing the energy-delay product by 2.2%.", "paper_title": "Energy-Aware Code Motion for GPU Shader Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000329136000009"}
