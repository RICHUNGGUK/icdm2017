This yields existence of a completely random T-tessellation, as defined by Kieu et al. (Spat Stat 6 (2013) 118-138), and of its Gibbsian modifications. The combinatorial bound is sharp, but likely pessimistic in typical cases. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "How many T-tessellations on k lines?
