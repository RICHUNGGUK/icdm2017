In this paper, we fulfill the first power analysis attack on the ultra-low-power environment of wireless body area networks. Specifically, two practical differential power analyses on NTRU algorithm are proposed, which can attack the existing countermeasures of NTRU. Accordingly, we suggest three countermeasures against our attacks. Meanwhile, practical experiments show that although the attacks in this paper are efficient, our countermeasures can resist them effectively.", "paper_title": "Power Analysis Attacks and Countermeasures on NTRU-Based Wireless Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320007300009"}
