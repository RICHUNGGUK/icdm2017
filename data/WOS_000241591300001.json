We introduce a turbulence term in a detailed chemical reaction model and analyze the impact on the reliability of pollutant emission predictions and on the efficiency and scalability of our combustion software. The parallel combustion software we developed adaptively combines numerical schemes based either on Backward Differentiation Formulas or semi-implicit Runge-Kutta methods for the solution of ODE systems arising from the chemical reaction model. It is based on CHEMKIN-II package for managing detailed chemistry and on two general-purpose solvers for adaptive solution of the resulting ODE systems. Furthermore, it is interfaced with KIVA3V-II code in order to simulate the entire engine cycle.", "paper_title": "Introducing combustion-turbulence interaction in parallel simulation of diesel engines", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300001"}
