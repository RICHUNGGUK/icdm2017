In this survey, we report the state of the art in video-based graphics and video visualization. We provide a review of techniques for making photo-realistic or artistic computer-generated imagery from videos, as well as methods for creating summary and/or abstract visual representations to reveal important features and events in videos. We provide a new taxonomy to categorize the concepts and techniques in this newly emerged body of knowledge. To support this review, we also give a concise overview of the major advances in automated video analysis, as some techniques in this field (e.g. feature extraction, detection, tracking and so on) have been featured in video-based modelling and rendering pipelines for graphics and visualization.", "paper_title": "State of the Art Report on Video-Based Graphics and Video Visualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310475600011"}
