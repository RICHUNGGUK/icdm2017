The phenomenon is significant under shear strength (tau(f)) random fields but is insignificant under unit weight (gamma) random fields. It is found that the phenomenon of the critical SOF is connected to the nature of the spatial averaging, which is \"line averaging\" under tf random fields and is \"area averaging\" under 7 random fields. The former averaging effect (line) is significantly weaker than the latter (area), so the tendency for the critical slip plane to seek for a favorable location is stronger for the tau(f) random field than for the gamma random field. Hence, the phenomenon of the critical SOF is more pronounced under tf random fields than under gamma random fields. The underlying mechanisms for the phenomenon of the critical SOF will be explored in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
