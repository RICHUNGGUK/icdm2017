The resultant depth maps are often found to be noisy, misaligned with the color images, and even contain many large holes. These limitations make it difficult to be adopted by many graphics applications. In this paper, we propose a computational approach to address the problem. By fusing raw depth values with image color, edges and smooth priors in a Markov random field optimization framework, both misalignment and large holes can be eliminated effectively, our method thus can produce high-quality depth maps that are consistent with the color image. To achieve this, a confidence map is estimated for adaptive weighting of different cues, an image inpainting technique is introduced to handle large holes, and contrasts in the color image are also considered for an accurate alignment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Depth map enhancement based on color and depth consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000342193800009"}
