The work presented here is undertaken in the context of a research project that focuses on delivering iTV services to disabled children. This objective is accomplished through the utilization of the arising MPEG-21 standard. Based on that standard, iTV accessibility is investigated in terms of metadata and content adaptation. The novelty of the contribution lies on a systematic methodology that deals with a wide range of accessibility problems, as opposed to previous studies that focus mostly on users with only one specific disability.", "paper_title": "Accessible interactive television using the MPEG-21 standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000291035000005"}
