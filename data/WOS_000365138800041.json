The proposed stochastic method is constructed based on krill herd (KH) algorithm to search the problem space optimally. Since the output power of WT is neither stable nor continues, point estimate method (PEM) with 2m scheme is used to model the uncertainty effects. In addition to the traditional constraints, the practical ED includes valve-loading effect, multi-fuel option, prohibited operating zone (POZ), ramp rate limit and spinning reserve. According to the high complexity and nonlinearity of the problem, a new version of KH called Modified Levy Krill Herd (MLKH) is suggested to solve the problem optimally. The satisfying performance of the problem is examined on two standard test systems and is compared with some of the recent well-know methods in the area successfully.", "paper_title": "Practical economic dispatch considering wind turbine uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800041"}
