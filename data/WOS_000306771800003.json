The efficiency of using instruments in a remote way, i.e. Remote Instrumentation, might be largely improved by integration with the existing distributed computing and storage infrastructures, like Grids. The paper discusses major activities towards the e-Infrastructure for Remote Instrumentation - a Grid-based Information and Communication Technology environment capable of covering all the issues arising around enabling Remote Instrumentation for e-Science applications.
