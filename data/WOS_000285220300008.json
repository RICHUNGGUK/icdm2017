The evaluation method is equally applicable to pore water pressure data displaying monotonic or non-monotonic time variation, with the only difference that the initial condition is identified differently during the inverse problem solution. The necessary testing time is very short provided that the pore water pressure is measured well above the tip. This is attributed to the ability of the one-dimensional, linear consolidation model to account for the geometry and the unloading effects that occur when steady penetration of the static cone penetrometer ceases.
