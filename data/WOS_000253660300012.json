The charge schemes possess important benefits. First, they produce both topologically symmetrical and environment dependent charges. Second, they can be parameterised to reasonably reproduce ab initio molecular electrostatic potential (MEP), which guarantees their successful use in molecular modelling. To validate the approaches, the parameters of the proposed charge schemes were fitted to best reproduce MEP simultaneously on grids around a set of 227 diverse organic compounds. The residual errors in MEP reproduction due to calculated atomic charges were compared to those due to charges from known charge schemes.", "paper_title": "Fast tools for calculation of atomic charges well suited for drug design", "paper_id": "WOS:000253660300012"}
