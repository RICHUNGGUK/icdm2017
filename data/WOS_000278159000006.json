This means that the example cannot negate the convergence theorem of maximum entropy clustering algorithm. Furthermore, we construct an example to negate Theorem 1 in Yu's paper, and we propose Proposition 3 to prove that the limit of the iterative sequence is a local minimum of the objective function while v varies and u remains stable. Finally, we give a theoretical proof of the convergence theorem of maximum entropy clustering algorithm.", "paper_title": "A proof of the convergence theorem of maximum-entropy clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000278159000006"}
