We consider a star topology and begin by characterizing the optimal performance frontier achievable under no restrictions on waveband sizing, and provide algorithms employing non-uniform waveband sizing that approach or achieve this optimum. We then consider the special case of uniform waveband sizing, and show that the performance compares very favorably. We also extend our results to general topologies.
