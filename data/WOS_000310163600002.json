For the NBW to NCW translation, the currently known upper bound is 2(O(nlog n)) and the lower bound is 1.5n. We improve the upper bound to n2(n) and describe a matching lower bound of 2(Omega(n)). For the NBW to DCW translation, the currently known upper bound is 2(O(nlog n)). We improve it to 2(O(n)), which is asymptotically tight. Both of our upper-bound constructions are based on a simple subset construction, do not involve intermediate automata with richer acceptance conditions, and can be implemented symbolically. We continue and solve the open problems of translating nondeterministic Streett, Rabin, Muller, and parity word automata to NCW and to DCW. Going via an intermediate NBW is not optimal and we describe direct, simple, and asymptotically tight constructions, involving a 2(circle minus(n)) blow-up. The constructions are variants of the subset construction, providing a unified approach for translating all common classes of automata to NCW and DCW. Beyond the theoretical importance of the results, we point to numerous applications of the new constructions. In particular, they imply a simple subset-construction based translation, when possible, of LTL to deterministic Buchi word automata.", "paper_title": "Translating to Co-Buchi Made Tight, Unified, and Useful", "paper_id": "WOS:000310163600002"}
