It is complementary to the classic seismological software packages used to process tectonic earthquake seismograms. The program's six user-friendly interfaces provide a large set of tools for reading data in many different formats, for carrying out spectral analysis, autoregressive modelling and deconvolution, for calculating time-frequency representations and Real-time Seismic Amplitude Measurement (RSAM)-type time series, and for detecting volcanic tremors and discrete events in long-duration records. A separate version of the program facilitates signal classification when preparing training databases for automatic recognition systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
