The predator's sensitivity to prey's odor is defined, so that can be simulated by Monte Carlo in L x L. It suggests the relationship between system stability and each value of Predator's sensitivity. We get three system states for different value of alpha (predator's sensitivity): the grass only, prey and the grass, three species in coexistence, with predators, prey and grass. But the probability of each system state is different. Their corresponding distribution will be given in this article.", "paper_title": "Model odor-oriented predators and prey", "paper_id": "WOS:000238265800009"}
