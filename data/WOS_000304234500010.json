To exploit those valuable resources in aiding diagnoses and research, content-based mammogram retrieval systems are required to effectively access the mammogram databases. This paper presents a content-based mammogram retrieval system, which allows medical professionals to seek mass lesions that are pathologically similar to a given example. In this retrieval system, shape and margin features of mass lesions are extracted to represent the characteristics of mammographic lesions. To compare the similarity between the query example and any lesion within the databases, this study proposes a similarity measure scheme which involves the hierarchical arrangement of mammographic features and a weighting distance measure. This makes similarity measure of the retrieval system consistent with the way radiologists observe mass lesions. This study used the DDSM dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the extracted shape feature and margin feature, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that, when Zernike moments are used, round-shape masses are the most discriminative among four types of shape; the circumscribed-margin masses can be effectively discriminated among the four types of margins. Moreover, the result also shows that, when retrieving round-shape and circumscribed margin masses, this retrieval system can achieve the highest precision among all mass lesion types.
