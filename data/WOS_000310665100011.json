The developer must deal with daunting tasks using low-level code to implement strategies trading off costs versus quality of service. Programming directives can substantially reduce this overhead by delegating control of elasticity to middleware systems while allowing developers to focus on defining suitable strategies.", "paper_title": "Programming Directives for Elastic Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000310665100011"}
