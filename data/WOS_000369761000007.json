Fewer algorithms exploit signal processing techniques that require a numerical representation of amino acid chains. However, these algorithms are very powerful for extracting regularities that cannot be detected when working with a symbolic chain, which may be important for understanding the biological meaning of a sequence or in classification tasks. In this study, a new mathematical representation of amino acid chains is proposed, which is derived using a similarity measure based on the PAM250 amino acid substitution matrix and that generates 20 signals for each protein sequence. Using this representation 20 consensus spectra for a protein family are determined and the relevance of the frequency peaks is established, obtaining a group of significant frequency peaks that manifest common periodicities of the amino acid sequences that belong to a protein family. We also show that the proposed representation in 20 signals can be integrated into Chou's pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC) and constitute a useful alternative to amino acid physicochemical properties in Chou's PseAAC.", "paper_title": "A new signal characterization and signal-based Chou's PseAAC representation of protein sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000369761000007"}
