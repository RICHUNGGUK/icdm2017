In fact, it may require considerable domain knowledge and involve complex knowledge engineering tasks, whereas CBR is often adopted when available domain knowledge is not enough to build a problem solution given its description, and thus past experiences are considered and exploited. This paper introduces a general framework for substitutional adaptation, which only requires analogical domain knowledge, which is very similar to the one required to define a similarity function. The approach is formally introduced, and its applicability is discussed with reference to case structure and its variability. A case study focused on the adaptation of cases related to truck tire production processes is also presented.", "paper_title": "Substitutional adaptation in case-based reasoning: A general framework applied to P-truck curing", "paper_id": "WOS:000246536600010"}
