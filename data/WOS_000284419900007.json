When each receiver has side information correlated with its own desired source, it is shown that source-channel separation is optimal. When each receiver has side information correlated with the interfering source, sufficient conditions for reliable transmission are provided based on a joint source-channel coding scheme using the superposition encoding and partial decoding idea of Han and Kobayashi. When the receiver side information is a deterministic function of the interfering source, source-channel separation is again shown to be optimal. In addition to these source-channel coding problems, a new channel model that generalizes the classical interference channel is introduced: the interference channel with message side information. Achievable rate regions are given and a single letter characterization of the capacity region for a special class of Z-interference channels is provided. Using this capacity result and the optimality of source-channel separation, we demonstrate that our sufficient conditions for reliable transmission when each receiver has side information correlated with the interfering source are also necessary for some special cases. As a by-product, the capacity region of a class of Z-channels with degraded message sets is also provided.", "paper_title": "Interference Channels With Correlated Receiver Side Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000284419900007"}
