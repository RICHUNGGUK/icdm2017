The proposed biologically-motivated algorithm achieves robust and satisfactory performance even though there are more than one control inputs to the plant, which may be used to get the desired performance. The response time is also very fast despite the fact that the control strategy is based on satisfying decision making. The proposed strategy is very flexible and alternative performance specifications can easily be enforced via defining proper emotional cues. Simulation results reveal the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Applying brain emotional learning algorithm for multivariable control of HVAC systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238595800004"}
