However, these techniques typically either fail to explicitly account for the strong geometric constraints associated with multiple images of the same 3D object, or require a large set of training images with much overlap to construct relatively sparse object models. This paper proposes a simple new method for automatically constructing 3D object models consisting of dense assemblies of small surface patches and affine-invariant descriptions of the corresponding texture patterns from a few (7 to 12) stereo pairs. Similar constraints are used to effectively identify instances of these models in highly cluttered photographs taken from arbitrary and unknown viewpoints. Experiments with a dataset consisting of 80 test images of 9 objects, including comparisons with a number of baseline algorithms, demonstrate the promise of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Modeling 3D objects from stereo views and recognizing them in photographs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237555200043"}
