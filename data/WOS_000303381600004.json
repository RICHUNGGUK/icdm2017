As a case study, we synthesize a controller for a guide robot that manages the visitor traffic flow in an exhibition space in order to maximize the enjoyment of the visitors. We used genetic programming in a low-fidelity simulation to evolve a controller for this task, which was then transferred to a service robot. An experimental evaluation of the evolved controller in both simulation and on the actual service robot shows that it performs well compared to hand-coded heuristics, and performs comparably to a human operator.", "paper_title": "Evolving controllers for high-level applications on a service robot: a case study with exhibition visitor flow control", "paper_id": "WOS:000303381600004"}
