However, large process variations of both magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and CMOS process severely limit the yield of STT-RAM chips and prevent the massive production from happening. In this paper, we analyze and compare the impacts of process variations on various sensing schemes of STT-RAM design. On top of it, we propose a novel voltage-driven nondestructive self-reference sensing scheme to enhance the STT-RAM chip yield by significantly improving sense margin. Monte Carlo simulations of a 16-Kb STT-RAM array shows that our proposed scheme can achieve the same yield as the previous nondestructive self-reference sensing scheme while improving the sense margin by five times with the similar access performance and power.", "paper_title": "Voltage Driven Nondestructive Self-Reference Sensing Scheme of Spin-Transfer Torque Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500009"}
