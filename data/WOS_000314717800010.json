The unavoidable information loss incurred by feature quantization in the coding process and the undesired dependence of pooling on the image spatial layout, however, may severely limit the classification. In this paper, we propose a linear distance coding (LDC) method to capture the discriminative information lost in traditional coding methods while simultaneously alleviating the dependence of pooling on the image spatial layout. The core of the LDC lies in transforming local features of an image into more discriminative distance vectors, where the robust image-to- class distance is employed. These distance vectors are further encoded into sparse codes to capture the salient features of the image. The LDC is theoretically and experimentally shown to be complementary to the traditional coding methods, and thus their combination can achieve higher classification accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LDC on six data sets, two of each of three types (specific object, scene, and general object), i.e., Flower 102 and PFID 61, Scene 15 and Indoor 67, Caltech 101 and Caltech 256. The results show that our method generally outperforms the traditional coding methods, and achieves or is comparable to the state-of-the-art performance on these data sets.", "paper_title": "Linear Distance Coding for Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000314717800010"}
