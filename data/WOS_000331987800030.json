The MIPv6 protocol allows Mobile Nodes (MNs) to remain connected to Correspondent Nodes (CNs), even when moving to foreign networks. Basically, MNs may change their position throughout the IPv6 network while retaining their existing connections by managing address variations in the Internet layer. Numerous advantages are thus attained, but security remains a fundamental concern. According to our research, a number of protocols can form a secure connection environment between MNs and CNs, though each has advantages and disadvantages. This paper presents a state-of-the art survey of security protocols in MIPv6. Moreover, we propose taxonomy, and comparative study that does not exist in the surveys in the literature. Along with the location management feature within these protocols, potential attacks and security threats, together with the security services and requirements are necessary for minimizing such problems, are subsequently presented.
