The large number of deployed embedded systems, their limited resources and their increasing complexity render systems vulnerable to an increasing number of threats. Additionally, the involvement of sensitive, often private, information and the expectation for safe and dependable embedded platforms lead to strong security requirements, even legal ones, which require new technologies for their provision. In this article, we provide an overview of embedded security issues, used methods and technologies, identifying important challenges in this emerging field.", "paper_title": "Security Challenges in Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209492400015"}
