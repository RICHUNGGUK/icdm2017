The issue we addressed here is to allocate right data at the right location for whole users in the environment. The user behaviors include user moving patterns and user request patterns. By utilizing the information, we developed four algorithms focusing on different views, respectively, such as hit ratios, communication costs, and response time. According to the data allocation schemes produced from these algorithms, we conducted several experiments to evaluate them and compared their pro and con. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
