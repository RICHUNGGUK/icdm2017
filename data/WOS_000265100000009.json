First, the classification of items within a single task is placed within the context of distinct concurrent or previous classification tasks (multiple distinct data collections). This is referred to as multitask learning (MTL) and is implemented here in a statistical manner, using a simplified form of the Dirichlet process. In addition, when performing many classification tasks one has simultaneous access to all unlabeled data that must be classified and, therefore, there is an opportunity to place the classification of any one feature vector within the context of all unlabeled feature vectors; this is referred to as semisupervised learning. In this paper, we integrate MTL and semisupervised learning into a single framework, thereby exploiting two forms of contextual information. Results are presented on a \"toy\" example to demonstrate the concept, and the algorithm is also applied to three real data sets.", "paper_title": "Semisupervised Multitask Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000265100000009"}
