In this paper, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set is used to capture fuzziness in multi-criteria decision making problems. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new method for solving multi-criteria decision making problem in interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy environments. First, we introduce and discuss the concept of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy point operators. Using the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy point operators, we can reduce the degree of uncertainty of the elements in a universe corresponding to an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set. Then, we define an evaluation function for the decision-making problem to measure the degrees to which alternatives satisfy and do not satisfy the decision-maker's requirement. Furthermore, a series of new score functions are defined for multi-criteria decision making problem based on the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy point operators and the evaluation function and their effectiveness and advantage are illustrated by examples.", "paper_title": "Multi-Criteria Decision Making Methods Based on Interval-Valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000337890400007"}
