We applied the time domains reflectometry method for signal acquisition, which was further analyzed by OPF and several other well-known pattern recognition techniques. The results indicated that OPF and support vector machines outperformed artificial neural networks and a Bayesian classifier, but OPF was much more efficient than all classifiers for training, and the second fastest for classification.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT FAULT LOCATION IN UNDERGROUND DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS THROUGH OPTIMUM-PATH FOREST", "paper_id": "WOS:000303887700004"}
