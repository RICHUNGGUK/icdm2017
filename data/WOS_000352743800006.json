The new Bees Algorithm includes an adaptive neighbourhood size change and site abandonment (ANSSA) strategy which is an enhancement to the basic Bees Algorithm. The supply chain case study utilised in this work is taken from literature and several experiments have been conducted in order to show the performances, the strength, the weaknesses of the proposed method and the results have been compared to those achieved by the basic Bees Algorithm and Ant Colony optimisation. The results show that the proposed ANSSA-based Bees Algorithm is able to achieve better Pareto solutions for the supply chain problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
