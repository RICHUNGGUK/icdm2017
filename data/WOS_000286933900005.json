Combination of this newly found element with crossbar interconnect technology, opened a new field in designing configurable or programmable electronic systems which can have applications in signal processing and artificial intelligence. In this paper, based on the simple memristor crossbar structure, we will propose a new mixed analog-digital circuit as a hardware implementation of the sign-sign least mean square (LMS) adaptive filter algorithm. In this proposed hardware, any multiplication and addition is performed with infinite precision and there is no necessity for the quantization of the input signal. Since the coefficients of the filter are stored in the switches of the crossbar, they can remain unchanged theoretically for an infinite period of time.", "paper_title": "Mixed analog-digital crossbar-based hardware implementation of sign-sign LMS adaptive filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000286933900005"}
