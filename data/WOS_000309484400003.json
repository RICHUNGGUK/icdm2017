It is known that only the matrix transposition is nontrivial among Hermiticity-preserving (HP) linear EnCE maps when we use the changes in the eigenvalues of a density matrix due to a partial map for the purpose. In this paper, we prove that this is true even among not-necessarily HP (nnHP) linear EnCE maps. The proof utilizes a conventional theorem on linear preservers. This result imposes a strong limitation on the linear maps and promotes the importance of nonlinear maps.", "paper_title": "LIMITATION FOR LINEAR MAPS IN A CLASS FOR DETECTION AND QUANTIFICATION OF BIPARTITE NONCLASSICAL CORRELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000309484400003"}
