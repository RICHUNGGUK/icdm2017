In a Bayesian context, we derive exact, explicit and tractable formulae for the posterior distribution of variables such as the number of change-points or their positions. We also demonstrate that several classical Bayesian model selection criteria can be computed exactly. All these results are based on an efficient strategy to explore the whole segmentation space, which is very large. We illustrate our methodology on both simulated data and a comparative genomic hybridization profile.", "paper_title": "Exact posterior distributions and model selection criteria for multiple change-point detection problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302815400006"}
