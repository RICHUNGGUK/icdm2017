A set of spanning trees of G is independent if they are pairwise independent. The construction of multiple independent spanning trees has many applications in network communication. For instance, it is useful for fault-tolerant broadcasting and secure message distribution, A recursive circulant graph G(N, d) has N = cd(m) vertices labeled from 0 to N - 1, where d >= 2, m >= 1, and 1 <= c < d, and two vertices x, y is an element of G(N, d) are adjacent if and only if there is an integer k with 0 >= k <= inverted right perpendicular log(d) Ninverted left perpendicular - 1 such that x +/- d(k) equivalent to y (mod N). In this paper, we propose an algorithm to construct multiple independent spanning trees on a recursive circulant graph G(cd(m), d) with d > 2, where the number of independent spanning trees matches the connectivity of G(cd(m), d).
