In this paper, a novel robust controller named fractional order sliding mode controller (FOSMC) is proposed for ABS to regulate the slip to a desired value. The proposed FOSMC combines sliding mode controller (SMC) with fractional order dynamics, in which fractional order proportional-derivative (FOPD) sliding surface is adopted. FOSMC can not only deal with the uncertainties in ABS system but also track the desired slip faster than conventional integer order SMC with proportional or proportional-derivative sliding surface. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.
