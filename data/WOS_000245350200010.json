We would like to compare conditional random fields (CRFs)-based method with conventional classification-based methods that omit the relation between two labels of neighboring residues to show the advantages of CRFs-based method in predicting protein- protein interaction sites. Results: The prediction of protein-protein interaction sites is solved as a sequential labeling problem by applying CRFs with features including protein sequence profile and residue accessible surface area. The CRFs-based method can achieve a comparable performance with state-of-the-art methods, when 1276 nonredundant hetero-complex protein chains are used as training and test set. Experimental result shows that CRFs-based method is a powerful and robust protein- protein interaction site prediction method and can be used to guide biologists to make specific experiments on proteins.
