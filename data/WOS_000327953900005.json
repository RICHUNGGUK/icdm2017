The Maeng, Malek (MM) model for comparison-based diagnosis defines a strategy based on sending the same input (or task) from a processor to some pair of distinct neighboring processors, and then comparing their responses. Sengupta and Dahbura proposed a further modification of the MM model, called the MM* model, in which any processor upsilon has to test another two processors if upsilon is adjacent to them. Sengupta and Dahbura presented a O(N-5)-time diagnosis algorithm for general diagnosable systems under the MM* model, where N is the number of processors in the system. By exploiting the cycle decomposition property, we improve the above result by presenting a O(N(log(2)N)(2))-time diagnosis algorithm for a class of hypercube-like networks under the MM* model.", "paper_title": "A Scalable Comparison-Based Diagnosis Algorithm for Hypercube-Like Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327953900005"}
