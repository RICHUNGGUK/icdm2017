In many domains, the agent is required to complete a set of independent tasks. We propose to decompose a factored POMDP into a set of restricted POMDPs over subsets of task relevant state variables. We solve each such model independently, acquiring a value function. The combination of the value functions of the restricted POMDPs is then used to form a policy for the complete POMDP. We explain the process of identifying variables that correspond to tasks, and how to create a model restricted to a single task, or to a subset of tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a number of benchmarks from the factored POMDP literature, showing that our methods are applicable to models with more than 100 state variables.", "paper_title": "Task-Based Decomposition of Factored POMDPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000330122700005"}
