This transformation has different drivers involving all the actors in the learning value chain, from final users to learning institutions through technology providers. All those actors share a common goal: making the learning processes more effective through the information and communication technologies. This is happening through the promotion of a paradigm shift from content-centered to process-centered solutions. In this paper, we present the results from the European Learning Grid Infrastructure project concerning models, processes, and services supported by a service-oriented software architecture for creating dynamic and adaptive virtual organizations for learning using Grid technologies.", "paper_title": "Grid-Enabled Virtual Organizations for Next-Generation Learning Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000291819000016"}
