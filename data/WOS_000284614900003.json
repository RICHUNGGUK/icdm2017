This study focuses on approaches with a clear and sound semantics, based on the notion of possible worlds. Three types of queries are considered: (i) those about attribute values (in an algebraic or SQL-like framework), (ii) those about the properties satisfied by a given set of worlds (i.e., a set of instances of an imprecise database), and (iii) those about the representation of uncertain data. For the first two types, it is emphasized that a trade-off has to be found between expressivity (of the model) and tractability (of the queries in the context of a given model)", "paper_title": "MODELING AND QUERYING UNCERTAIN RELATIONAL DATABASES: A SURVEY OF APPROACHES BASED ON THE POSSIBLE WORLDS SEMANTICS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284614900003"}
