Approximate cycle matching aims to store only a small part of intermediate results and find cycle matchings as many as possible. The existing solution prunes the intermediate results by a threshold of probability of a subscription to be matched, where the discrete degree of probabilities is neglected. In this paper, we propose an approximate dynamic cycle matching algorithm based on intermediate results classification using extreme learning machine. We first introduce a method of incorporating probability information into feature vector, and then propose the approximate cycle algorithm. Further, we propose a dynamic classification strategy considering that the data distribution of subscriptions may change as time goes on. The proposed approximate cycle matching algorithm and the dynamic classification strategy are evaluated in a simulated environment. The results show that compared with the approximate cycle matching based on probability threshold, the approximate cycle matching based on ELM classification is faster, and the dynamic classification strategy is more efficient and convenient. ELM is more suitable for approximate dynamic cycle matching than SVM with regards to response time.", "paper_title": "ELM based approximate dynamic cycle matching for homogeneous symmetric Pub/Sub system", "paper_id": "WOS:000349608400006"}
