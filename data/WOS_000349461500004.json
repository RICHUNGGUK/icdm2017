We show that their power lies between GCSL and CSL. We show that their subclasses form an infinite hierarchy of classes of languages with respect to the reversibility level k and we also show that limiting types of allowed rewrites lowers the power of the model. Finally, we study their relation to strictly locally testable restarting automata.", "paper_title": "Power of S-kR-RRWW-automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000349461500004"}
