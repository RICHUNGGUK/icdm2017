The formulation is based on the primitive variables velocity, density, temperature and pressure. The goal of this work is to present a 'stable' numerical formulation, and, thus, the interpolation functions for the field variables are chosen so as to satisfy the inf-sup conditions. An exact tangent stiffness matrix is derived for the formulation, which ensures a quadratic rate of convergence. The good performance of the proposed strategy is shown in a number of steady-state and transient problems where compressibility effects are important such as high Mach number flows, natural convection, Riemann problems, etc., and also on problems where the fluid can be treated as almost incompressible.
