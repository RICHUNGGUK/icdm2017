After introducing a standard domain reduction and its iterated version, we will introduce a new reduction strategy. Under mild assumptions, we will prove the equivalence between the new domain reduction and the iterated version of the standard one, allowing a new interpretation of the latter and a new way of computing it. Finally, we prove that any \"reasonable\" domain reduction strategy is independent of the order by which variables are processed.", "paper_title": "Global optimization problems and domain reduction strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000281761500006"}
