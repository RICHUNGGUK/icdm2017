Given an initially uncovered field and as more and more sensors are continuously added to a WSN, the size of partial covered areas increases. At some point, the situation abruptly changes from small fragmented covered areas to a single large covered area. We call this abrupt change the sensing-coverage phase transition (SCPT). Also, given an originally disconnected WSN and as more and more sensors are added, the number of connected components changes such that the WSN suddenly becomes connected at some point. We call this sudden change the network-connectivity phase transition (NCPT). The nature of such phase transitions is a central topic in the percolation theory of Boolean models. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic approach to compute the covered area fraction at critical percolation for both of the SCPT and NCPT problems. Because sensing coverage and network connectivity are not totally orthogonal, we also propose a model for percolation in WSNs, called the correlated disk model, which provides a basis for solving the SCPT and NCPT problems together.", "paper_title": "Integrated coverage and connectivity in wireless sensor networks: A two-dimensional percolation problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000258592300011"}
