For the flow. techniques such as tree-algorithms and the particle-mesh method are brought together with the aim to achieve the best possible performance in view of analyzing complex problems. The now results are then input to the acoustic wave equation which is solved in integral form. It will involve monopole, dipole and quadrupole terms which can be Successively integrated. The significance of such an approach is first demonstrated in two problems, both related to vortex-solid interactions. The first is a generic one and considers the interaction of a vortex filament interacting with a sphere while the second considers helicopter noise as ail example of a complex engineering set-tip.
