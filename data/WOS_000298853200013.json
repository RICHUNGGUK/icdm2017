To elucidate the conditions required to induce the mutual adaptation phenomenon, we designed an appropriate experimental environment called \"WAITER\" (Waiter Agent Interactive Training Experimental Restaurant) and conducted two experiments in this environment. The experimental results suggest that the proposed conditions can induce the mutual adaptation phenomenon.", "paper_title": "Formation conditions of mutual adaptation in human-agent collaborative interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200013"}
