Trees with maximum Randic index R-1 need not be unique. Clark et al. gave the maximum values for the index of trees of order n <= 20. In this paper, we determine the maximum value for the Randic index R-1 of all trees of order n <= 102, and give one of the trees with maximum value of the index. This not only largely extends the known range of the orders n of trees with maximum index, but also gives a convincible solution for the induction initial of our previous paper. Because there is a huge number of trees of order n <= 102, it is not possible to directly search the trees with maximum index by a computer. Our method is to first figure out the simple structure of one of the trees of order n with maximum R-1 for each n <= 102, i.e., the branching subtree must be a star. Then from this simple structure, we can employ mathematical programming to easily calculate the maximum value of R-1 for each n.", "paper_title": "Maximum tree and maximum value for the randic index R-1 of trees of order n <= 102", "paper_id": "WOS:000235914500010"}
