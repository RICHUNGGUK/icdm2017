We propose two novel fusion schemes that can increase the security of multimodal biometric systems. The first is an extension of the likelihood ratio based fusion scheme and the other uses fuzzy logic. Besides the matching score and sample quality score, our proposed fusion schemes also take into account the intrinsic security of each biometric system being fused. Experimental results have shown that the proposed methods are more robust against spoof attacks when compared with traditional fusion methods. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
