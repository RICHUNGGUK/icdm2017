In this paper we characterized image texture in vivo using the PST in histologically verified lesion areas in T2-weighted MRI of an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Both high and low frequency signals, representing inflammation and demyelination, were significantly increased in pathological regions compared to normal control tissue. This suggests that this new local spatial-frequency measure of image texture may provide a sensitive and precise indication of disease activity.", "paper_title": "A novel MRI texture analysis of demyelination and inflammation in relapsing-remitting experimental allergic encephalomyelitis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300093"}
