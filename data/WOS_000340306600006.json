Gelman and Shalizi [9] criticise a philosophical account of how statisticians ought to choose statistical models which they call 'the received view of Bayesian inference' and propose a different account inspired by falsificationist philosophy of science. I introduce another philosophical account inspired by Carnapian inductive logic and argue that it is even better than Gelman and Shalizi's falsificationist account. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
