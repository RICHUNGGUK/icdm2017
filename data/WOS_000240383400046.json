The main problem in this field is how to design good algorithm or control law for flow rate of network data flow sources and for updated price of communication links. Base on Lyapunov stability theory, this paper makes a deep analysis of stability of such network data flow control systems with the consideration of dynamic link capacity case. Simulations show that the stability analysis of dynamic link capacity of network data flow control system provided in the paper is enlightening and meaningful to further understand and design good control strategy of network data flow control problem.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of network data flow control for dynamic link capacity case", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400046"}
