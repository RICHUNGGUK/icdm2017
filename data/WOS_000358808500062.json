An augmented drive system used to deal with channel noise is constructed by introducing a new auxiliary drive variable. Then, an augmented auxiliary drive signal is constructed in order to breakthrough the observer rank condition. Based on a kind of nonsingular transformation for the state and output of augmented auxiliary drive system, a reduced-order observer is designed to asymptotically estimate the states of the augmented auxiliary drive system, and a high-gain sliding-mode observer is considered to estimate the augmented auxiliary drive signal and its derivative. An information signal recovery method that can not only recover the information signal but also reconstruct both uncertain parameter disturbance and channel noise is developed. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
