Often legislative requirements to obtain consent are waived if the information collected or disclosed is de-identified. Objective: The authors developed and empirically evaluated a new globally optimal de-identification algorithm that satisfies the k-anonymity criterion and that is suitable for health datasets. Design: Authors compared OLA (Optimal Lattice Anonymization) empirically to three existing k-anonymity algorithms, Datafly, Samarati, and Incognito, on six public, hospital, and registry datasets for different values of k and suppression limits. Measurement: Three information loss metrics were used for the comparison: precision, discernability metric, and non-uniform entropy. Each algorithm's performance speed was also evaluated. Results: The Datafly and Samarati algorithms had higher information loss than OLA and Incognito; OLA was consistently faster than Incognito in finding the globally optimal de-identification solution. Conclusions: For the de-identification of health datasets, OLA is an improvement on existing k-anonymity algorithms in terms of information loss and performance.", "paper_title": "A Globally Optimal k-Anonymity Method for the De-Identification of Health Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000269755500009"}
