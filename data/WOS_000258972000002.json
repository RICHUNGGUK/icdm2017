These boundary conditions are imposed on an artificial elliptical or prolate spheroid outer surface. In order to compare the computational solution with an analytical solution, we consider, as an example, scattering about an ellipse. We solve the Helmholtz equation with both finite differences and finite elements. We also introduce a new boundary condition for ail ellipse based on a modal expansion. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
