However, the popular cloud data services also bring forth many new data security and privacy challenges. Cloud service provider untrusted, outsourced data security, hence collusion attacks from cloud service providers and data users become extremely challenging issues. To resolve these issues, we design the basic parts of secure re-encryption scheme for data services in a cloud computing environment, and further propose an efficient and secure re-encryption algorithm based on the EIGamal algorithm, to satisfy basic security requirements. The proposed scheme not only makes full use of the powerful processing ability of cloud computing but also can effectively ensure cloud data security. Extensive analysis shows that our proposed scheme is highly efficient and provably secure under existing security model.
