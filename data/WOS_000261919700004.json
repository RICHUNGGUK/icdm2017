The initial pool of 105 items was administered to 499 undergraduate psychology students at a university in the southeastern United States in order to empirically validate the underlying factor structure associated with this tendency. Six factors were derived. resembling the original conceptual model. Construct validity and reliability evidence are presented. Future empirical work is needed to explore the criterion and predictive validities of the factors constituting this inventory. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
