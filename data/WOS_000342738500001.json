For this system, we examine two approaches for analyzing the ultrasound waves transmitted through the cultured bone, including stem cells to estimate cell quantity: multiple regression and fuzzy inference. We employ two characteristics from the obtained wave for applying each method. These features are the amplitude and the frequency; the amplitude is measured from the obtained wave, and the frequency is calculated by the cross-spectrum method. The results confirmed that the fuzzy inference method yields the accurate estimates of cell quantity in artificial culture bone. Using this ultrasonic estimation system, the orthopaedic surgeons can choose the composites that contain favorable number of cells before the implantation.", "paper_title": "Stem Cell Quantity Determination in Artificial Culture Bone by Ultrasonic Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738500001"}
