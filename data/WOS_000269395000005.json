The method is based on the identification of the parameters of the state space model. The identification algorithm has two parts. First, the continuous state space model is transferred to the discrete state space form. Next, some theoretical relations are derived from the discrete-time equations. The derived equations lead to a solution for the generator parameters. The method requires measurement of the active and reactive output power, the generator rotor angle, the field voltage and current, and also the armature current following a small perturbation of the field voltage. The derived algorithm is applied to a sample power system model. Simulation results admit the accuracy of the estimated parameter.", "paper_title": "ESTIMATION OF SYNCHRONOUS GENERATOR PARAMETERS IN A LARGE SCALE POWER SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000005"}
