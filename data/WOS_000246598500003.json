To survive and prosper, a Web site has to constantly enliven its content while providing various and extensive information services to attract users. The Web Recommendation System, a personalized information filter, prompts users to visit a Web site and browse at a deeper level. In general, most of the recommendation systems use large browsing logs to identify and predict users' surfing habits. The process of pattern discovery is time-consuming, and the result is static. Such systems do not satisfy the end users' goal-oriented and dynamic demands. Accordingly, a pressing need for an adaptive recommendation system comes into play. This article proposes a novel Web recommendation system framework, based on the Moving Average Rule, which can respond to new navigation trends and dynamically adapts recommendations for users with suitable suggestions through hyperlinks. The framework provides Web site administrators with various methods to generate recommendations. It also responds to new Web trends, including Web pages that have been updated but have not yet been integrated into regular browsing patterns. Ultimately, this research enables Web sites with dynamic intelligence to effectively tailor users' needs.
