First, the performances of application, physical, MAC, and network layers are modeled by some classical models under reasonable assumptions. Then, we present a framework in which source coding, power control, ARQ control, and delay partitioning functionalities at different layers can be jointly optimized. Our objective is. to maximize the video quality under strict end-to-end delay constraints through adjusting source coding rate, end-to-end delay distribution, and each node's transmit power. This optimization problem is proved to be a nonlinear but log-convex one. Finally, we propose a centralized solution based on the classical convex programming method, as well as a partially distributed solution based on the Lagrangian dual decomposition technique. The both solutions are proved to converge to the global optimum of the above problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
