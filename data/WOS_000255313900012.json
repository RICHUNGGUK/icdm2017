Such errors frequently result in unfavorable atomic interactions. Here we present a new web service, called Interaction Viewer, for the visualization and correction of such errors. We show how the Interaction Viewer is used in combination with the NQ-Flipper service to spot strained asparagine and glutamine rotamers and we emphasize the convenience of this service in correcting such errors.
