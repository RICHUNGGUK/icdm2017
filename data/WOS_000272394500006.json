Since that time, several signatures have been proposed to achieve better efficiency or useful property along with the provable security in the standard model. In this paper, we construct a trapdoor hash function, and design an efficient online/online signature by using the trapdoor hash function. Our signature scheme requires only one non-modular multiplication of two small integers for online signing, and it provides the fastest online signing among all online/offline signatures that achieve provable security in the standard model.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Signature Scheme with Fast Online Signing", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500006"}
