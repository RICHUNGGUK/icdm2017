An important research challenge is deployment, where features like node auto-configuration, unattended operation, and Internet connectivity are becoming mandatory. Moreover, on off-the-shelf solutions the user typically must be network technology-savvy to take advantage of sensing and actuation services. This paper presents a novel multi-channel architecture for sensor data gathering and actuation, featuring Plug-and-Play like functionality for node attachment and operation, IPv6 at the node level, and dedicated communication semantic protocols the ZenSens system architecture. The architecture features the sensor/actuator nodes, a personal computer application (SenseLab), a mobile application (SenseLab mobile), and World Wide Web access (WebSensor), presenting the user with a complete sensing and actuation solution. As a result the user can operate the network without technological background, and near-zero configuration. All developed software and firmware are presented, and validated through a series of experiments on real hardware, namely using a test-bed with TelosB motes running ContikiOS. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
