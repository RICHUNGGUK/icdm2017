We review the existing division method and develop a new exact approach called the subtraction method. For practical applications, a two-phase selection procedure is established based on the subtraction method. The decision powers of two methods are compared. We show that the subtraction method we proposed is indeed more powerful than the existing division method. Several figures are presented to display the required sample sizes with various powers and various values of (C-pk1(T), C-pk2(T)). For the convenience of practitioners, the required sample sizes for the two methods with various powers and various values of (C-pk1(T), C-pk2(T))) are also tabulated.", "paper_title": "A powerful test for two-sided multiple independent characteristics supplier selection problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000345689600013"}
