Design/methodology/approach - The research data include 8,567 papers and 70,947 cited articles in the IS field indexed by Chinese Social Sciences Citation Index from 2000 to 2009. Author co-citation analysis, author bibliographic-coupling analysis, social network analysis, and factor analysis were combined to explore co-citation and bibliographic-coupling relationships and to identify research groups and subjects. Findings - Scholars with greatest impact are different from the most active scholars of Chinese IS; there is no uniform impact pattern forming since authors' impact subjects are scattered and not steady; while authors' research activities present higher independence and concentration, there is still no steady research pattern due to no deep research existing. Furthermore, Chinese IS studies can be delineated by: foundation or extension. The research subjects of these two parts, as well as their corresponding/contributing authors, are different under different views. The general research status of core authors is concentrated, while their impact is broad. Originality/value - The combined use of some related methods could enrich the development and methodology research of the discipline, and the results establish a reference point on the development of IS research.", "paper_title": "Analysis on research activity and impact of authors in Chinese information science based on citation relationship", "paper_id": "WOS:000341924600009"}
