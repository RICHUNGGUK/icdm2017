A successful designer requires knowledge and training in specific design techniques combined with practical experience. Designing a dimensional model embodies this challenge. This paper presents Dimensional Design Patterns (DDPs) and their application to the design of dimensional models. We describe a metamodel of the DDPs and show their integration into Kimball's dimensional modeling design process so they can be applied to design problems using a known practice. By providing a metamodel and a method for DDP use, we combine theory and a practical design technique with the goal of increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the software designer. The experimental results show that the classroom use of DDPs increase the effectiveness by 25% and efficiency by 9% for students in designing dimensional models. This research shows that DDPs could be an effective tool not only for teaching a dimensional model in academia, but also for designing dimensional models in an industry setting.
