In literature, many algorithms exist for the removal of white uncorrelated noise, but they usually fail when applied to images with correlated noise. In this paper, we design a new de-noising method for the removal of correlated noise, by modeling the significance of the noise-free wavelet coefficients in a local window using a new significance measure that defines the \"signal of interest\" and that is applicable to correlated noise. We combine the intrascale model with a hidden Markov tree model to capture the interscale dependencies between the wavelet coefficients. We propose a denoising method based on the combined model and a less redundant wavelet transform. We present results that show that the new method performs as well as the state-of-the-art wavelet-based methods, while having a lower computational complexity.", "paper_title": "Removal of Correlated Noise by Modeling the Signal of Interest in the Wavelet Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000266163300001"}
