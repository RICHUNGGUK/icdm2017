In this paper, key issues for the establishment of Grid authentication and authorization infrastructures are discussed, and an overview of major Grid authentication and authorization technologies is presented. Related to this, recent developments in Grid authentication and authorization infrastructures suggest adoption of the Shibboleth technology which offers advantages in terms of usability, confidentiality, scalability and manageability. When combined with advanced authorization technologies, Shibboleth-based authentication and authorization infrastructures provide role-based, fine-grained authorization. We share our experience in constructing a Shibboleth-based authentication and authorization infrastructure and believe that such infrastructure provides a promising solution for the security of many application domains.", "paper_title": "Authentication and authorization infrastructure for Grids-issues, technologies, trends and experiences", "paper_id": "WOS:000276183700004"}
