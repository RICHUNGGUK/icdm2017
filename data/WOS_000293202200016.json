Almost all real world optimization problems have constraints which should be satisfied along with the best optimal solution for the problem. In evolutionary algorithms (EAs) the presence of constraints reduces the feasible region and complicates the search process. Therefore, a suitable method to handle the constraints must also be executed. In the SaDE algorithm, four mutation strategies and the control parameter CR are self-adapted. Self-adaptive Penalty (SP) method is introduced into the SaDE algorithm for constraint handling. The performance of SaDE algorithm is demonstrated on the design of robust optimal fixed structure controller of three systems, namely the linearized magnetic levitation system, F-8 aircraft linearized model and a SISO plant. For the comparison purpose, reported results of constrained PSO algorithm and five DE algorithms with different strategies and parameter values are taken into account. Statistical performance in 20 independent runs is considered to compare the performance of algorithms. From the obtained results, it is observed that SaDE algorithm is able to self-adapt the mutation strategy and the crossover rate and hence performs better than the other variants of DE and the constrained PSO algorithm. Better performance of SaDE is achieved by sustained maintenance of diversity throughout the evolutionary process thus producing better individuals consistently. This also aids the algorithm to escape from local optima thereby avoiding premature convergence. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
