The proposed class of designs is a modification of the Central Composite Designs, in which the axial points of the traditional central composite design are replaced by some edge points of the hypercube that circumscribes the sphere of zero center and radius a. An algorithm for the construction of these designs is developed and applied. The constructed designs are suitable for sequential experimentation and have higher D-values than those of known composite designs. The properties of the constructed designs are further discussed and evaluated in terms of rotatability, blocking, and D-optimality under the full second-order model. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
