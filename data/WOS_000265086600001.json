The Parikh matrix gives more information than the well-known Parikh vector of a word which counts only occurrences of symbols in a word. In this note a property of two words u, v, called \"ratio property\", is introduced. This property is a sufficient condition for the words uv and vu to have the same Parikh matrix. Thus the ratio property gives information on the M-ambiguity of certain words and certain sets of words. In fact certain regular, context-free and context-sensitive languages that have the same set of Parikh matrices are exhibited. In the study of fair words, Cerny (2006) introduced another kind of matrix, called the p-matrix of a word. Here a \"weak-ratio property\" of two words u, v is introduced. This property is a sufficient condition for the words uv and vu to have the same p-matrix. Also the words uv and vu are fair whenever u, v are fair and have the weak ratio property.", "paper_title": "ON PARIKH MATRICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000265086600001"}
