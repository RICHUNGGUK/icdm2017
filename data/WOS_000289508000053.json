The objective functions of the proposed model include offer cost, voltage stability margin (VSM) and corrected transient energy margin (CTEM). A new solution method incorporating the lexicographic optimization and augmented epsilon-constraint method is proposed to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The New England test system is used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The proposed strategy is also compared with the conventional epsilon-constraint technique.
