In this paper, the Time Dilation design technique is proposed that provides concurrent error detection and correction in the field of application and also supports off-line manufacturing scan testing. By utilizing a new scan Flip-Flop, the Time Dilation technique is capable to detect and correct multiple errors at the minimum penalty of one clock cycle delay. The silicon area overhead and the power consumption are substantially reduced, as compared to the Razor design approach, since no additional memory elements are required. At the same time, the proposed technique introduces only negligible performance degradation since no extra circuitry is inserted in the critical paths of a design.", "paper_title": "The Time Dilation Technique for Timing Error Tolerance", "paper_id": "WOS:000336672600018"}
