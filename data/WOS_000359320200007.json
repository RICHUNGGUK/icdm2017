The aim of the L(j, k)- edge labeling problem consists of :finding a coloring fund iou eu Ii I ha the value of kf is minimum. This minimum value is called lambda(n,k)' (p). This problem has already been studied on hexagonal, squared and triangular grids, but most not coinciding upper and lower bounds on lambda(j,k)' have been proposed. In this paper we close some of these gaps or 'find better bounds on lambda(j,k)' in the special cases j = 1,2 and k = 1. Moreover, we propose tight L(j, k)-edge-labelings for eight-regular grids.", "paper_title": "Optimal L(j, k)-Edge-Labeling of Regular Grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000359320200007"}
