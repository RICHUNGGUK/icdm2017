The emission current density can reach 72 A/cm(2) at 900 degrees C and over 100 A/cm(2) can be achieved at a temperature higher than 950 degrees C. The emission improves and then keeps stable with time throughout the life testing period of 330 h at a continuous loading of 88 A/cm(2) pulsed current density with a pulse width of 10 mu s and duty cycle of 0.2%. The cathode surface is covered by a semiconductor multilayer composed of Ba, Sc and O. The emission behavior of the cathode can be explained by a semiconductor model.", "paper_title": "High current density Sc2O3-W matrix dispenser cathode", "paper_id": "WOS:000298651900012"}
