The proposed scheme consists of two levels: (i) sink node level and (ii) sensor node level. The proposed scheme exploits independent gradients for each sink node so that the exploratory messages forwarded by the intermediate sensor nodes can be significantly reduced. Experiments are conducted using two evaluation criterions, which are average dissipated energy and hop counts, to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A Two-Level Routing Scheme for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000307705200001"}
