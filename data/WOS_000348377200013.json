This paper presents a novel obstacle-avoiding CTS approach with slew constraints satisfied and signal polarity corrected. We build a look-up table through NGSPICE simulation to achieve accurate buffer delay and slew, which guarantees that the final skew after NGSPICE simulation is as satisfactory as expected. Aiming at skew optimization under constraints of slew and obstacles, our CTS approach features the clock tree construction stage with the obstacle-aware topology generation algorithm called OBB, balanced insertion of candidate buffer positions and a fast heuristic buffer insertion algorithm. With an overall view on obstacles to explore the global optimization space, our CTS approach effectively overcomes the negative influence on skew brought by the obstacles. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our CTS approach with significantly improved skew and latency by 69.0% and 72.0% on average. In addition, the accuracy of the look-up table is demonstrated through the huge skew reduction by 87.3% on average. Moreover, our OBB heuristic algorithm obtains 53.2% improvement in skew than the classic balanced bipartition algorithm.", "paper_title": "Obstacle-Avoiding and Slew-Constrained Clock Tree Synthesis With Efficient Buffer Insertion", "paper_id": "WOS:000348377200013"}
