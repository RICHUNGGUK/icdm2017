First, an initial design of a truss-like structure is constructed by a mesh generator of the finite element method because a truss-like structure can be described by a finite element mesh. Then, the shape and topology of the initial structure is optimized. In order to ensure a truss-like structure can be easily manufactured via intended techniques, we assume the beams have the same size of cross-section, and a method based on the concept of the SIMP method is used for the topology optimization. In addition, in order to prevent intersection of beams and zero-length beams, a geometric constraint based on the signed area of triangle is introduced to the shape optimization. The optimization method is verified by several 2D examples. Influence on compliance of the representative length of beams is investigated.", "paper_title": "A method for shape and topology optimization of truss-like structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000317683800005"}
