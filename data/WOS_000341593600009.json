(2) Does there exist unified framework for feedforward neural networks and feature space methods? ELMs that have built some tangible links between machine learning techniques and biological learning mechanisms have recently attracted increasing attention of researchers in widespread research areas. This paper provides an insight into ELMs in three aspects, viz: random neurons, random features and kernels. This paper also shows that in theory ELMs (with the same kernels) tend to outperform support vector machine and its variants in both regression and classification applications with much easier implementation.", "paper_title": "An Insight into Extreme Learning Machines: Random Neurons, Random Features and Kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000341593600009"}
