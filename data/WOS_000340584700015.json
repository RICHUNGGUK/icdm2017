The superior performance of this algorithm has been proven among the other most well-known algorithms such as genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). However, the original version of this algorithm is suitable for continuous problems, so it cannot be applied to binary problems directly. In this paper, a binary version of this algorithm is proposed. A comparative study with binary PSO and GA over twenty-two benchmark functions is conducted to draw a conclusion. Furthermore, Wilcoxon's rank-sum nonparametric statistical test was carried out at 5 % significance level to judge whether the results of the proposed algorithm differ from those of the other algorithms in a statistically significant way. The results prove that the proposed binary bat algorithm (BBA) is able to significantly outperform others on majority of the benchmark functions. In addition, there is a real application of the proposed method in optical engineering called optical buffer design at the end of the paper. The results of the real application also evidence the superior performance of BBA in practice.", "paper_title": "Binary bat algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700015"}
