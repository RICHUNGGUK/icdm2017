The design utilizes bulk-controlled varactor and pulse-based digitally controlled oscillator (PB-DCO) providing a high timing resolution and a good jitter performance. The worst-case total locking time of the proposed ADPLL is 32 reference clock cycles. The divider used here divides by factors from 2 to 63. A test chip is implemented and verified. The RMS and peak-to-peak jitters are 6.7 and 44 ps, respectively, at 450-MHz. The peak-to-peak jitter is 2.0% at 450-MHz. When the multiplication of divider is varying at 150-MHz, the peak-to-peak jitters are less than 3.2%. The power consumption is 16.2-mW at 450-MHz. The core area of ADPLL is only 260 x 360 mm(2). This clock generator can be applied as re-usable silicon IP for system-on-chip (SoC) applications.", "paper_title": "All-digital PLL using bulk-controlled varactor and pulse-based digitally controlled oscillator", "paper_id": "WOS:000293183100001"}
