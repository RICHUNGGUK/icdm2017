Our formulation is based on a combination of spatial and frequency decomposition of the sound field. We use numerical wave-based techniques to precompute the pressure field in the near-object regions and geometric propagation techniques in the far-field regions to model sound propagation. We present a novel two-way pressure coupling technique at the interface of near-object and far-field regions. At runtime, the impulse response at the listener position is computed at interactive rates based on the stored pressure field and interpolation techniques. Our system is able to simulate high-fidelity acoustic effects such as diffraction, scattering, low-pass filtering behind obstruction, reverberation, and high-order reflections in large, complex indoor and outdoor environments and Half-Life 2 game engine. The pressure computation requires orders of magnitude lower memory than standard wave-based numerical techniques.", "paper_title": "Wave-Ray Coupling for Interactive Sound Propagation in Large Complex Scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200009"}
