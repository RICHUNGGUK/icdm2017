The cyber terrorists could inflict catastrophic loss or damage on civilians, corporations or the governments physically thousands of miles away and accomplish severe death polls than the traditional one. The government in the public sector or the private critical infrastructure administrators should not underestimate these potential cyber attacks. In this paper, we presented the cyber terrorism, the next generation of terrorism, to be a forthcoming and unavoidable threat to the global community as well as providing a potential rational cyber terrorist scenario, which could be the global cyber terrorism phenomena. This paper explicitly demonstrates the feasibility of launching cyber attacks toward critical infrastructures that might cause severe casualties.", "paper_title": "Next Generation of Terrorism: Ubiquitous Cyber Terrorism with the Accumulation of all Intangible Fears", "paper_id": "WOS:000273177200006"}
