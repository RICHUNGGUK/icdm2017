The generic goal is to design the shape of a 2-dimensional flow domain to minimize some prescribed objective while satisfying given geometric constraints. As part of the design problem, the steady-state, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, governing a laminar flow in the domain, must be solved. Based on isogeometric analysis, we use B-splines as the basis for both the design optimization and the flow analysis, thereby unifying the models for geometry and analysis, and, at the same time, facilitating a compact representation of complex geometries and smooth approximations of the flow fields. To drive the shape optimization, we use a gradient-based approach, and to avoid inappropriate parametrizations during optimization, we regularize the optimization problem by adding to the objective function a measure of the quality of the boundary parametrization. A detailed description of the methodology is given, and three different numerical examples are considered, through which we investigate the effects of the regularization, of the number of geometric design variables, and of variations in the analysis resolution, initial design and Reynolds number, and thereby demonstrate the robustness of the methodology.", "paper_title": "Isogeometric shape optimization in fluid mechanics", "paper_id": "WOS:000326718800004"}
