Object attention is facilitated by using a video sequence and a depth map obtained through a compound-eye image sensor TOMBO. Robustness of the multi-agent system over environmental changes is enhanced by utilizing the biological model of adaptive response by attractor selection. To implement the proposed system, an efficient VLSI architecture is employed with reducing enormous computational costs and memory accesses required for depth map processing and multi-agent attractor selection process. According to the FPGA implementation result of the proposed object attention system, which is accomplished by using 7,063 slices, 640x512 pixel input images can be processed in real-time with three agents at a rate of 9 fps in 48 MHz operation.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Multi-Agent Object Attention System Based on Biologically Inspired Attractor Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400600030"}
