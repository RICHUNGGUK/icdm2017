The adaptation process is performed on the filter statistical information matrices R or Q, which are tuned using an Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) based on the filter innovation sequence through a covariance-matching technique. The test results show a better performance of the KF-NFA when it is compared with a traditional Kalman Filter (T-KF). This work is being developed in the context of a Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) algorithm for localization based services (LBS), currently in progress.", "paper_title": "Attitude estimation using a Neuro-Fuzzy tuning based adaptive Kalman filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100003"}
