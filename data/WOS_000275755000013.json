Thus, it is crucial to identify and remove these errors if automation is to replace the still common practice of visually assessing spot quality, an extremely expensive and time-consuming procedure. A major problem in microarray spot quality classification methods proposed in the literature is the correlation among the features extracted from the spots. In this paper, we propose using a random subspace ensemble of neural networks and a feature selection algorithm to improve the performance of our microarray spot quality classification method. Our best method obtains an error under the receiver operating characteristic curve (EAUR) of 0.3 outperforming the stand-alone support vector machine EAUR of 1.7. The consistency of our proposed approach makes it a viable alternative to the labour-intensive manual method of spot quality assessment.", "paper_title": "Advanced machine learning techniques for microarray spot quality classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000275755000013"}
