In the first part of this paper we examine h(T), identifying its main drawbacks and weaknesses: an arbitrary scoring system and an illusory increase in discrimination power compared to h. Subsequently, we propose a new bibliometric tool, the citation triad (CT), that better exploits the information contained in a Ferrers diagram, giving a synthetic overview of a scientist's publication output. The advantages of this new approach are discussed in detail. Argument is supported by several examples based on empirical data. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
