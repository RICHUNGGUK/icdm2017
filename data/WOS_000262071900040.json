Generally, in this technique, image is divided into number of layers for easy and fast transmission keeping the concept of multi-description representation. This configuration helps to make overall system adaptive with respect to different system's bandwidth. Proposed data compression layered scheme's architecture not only works with JPEG but also with MPEG image formats. It includes all necessary steps and precautions to handle possible disturbances in image compression by analyzing different parameters affecting image quality and transmission time. In this paper, behavioral model of complete image compression scheme is discussed starting from image extraction from source, layering of image matrix, generating separate pixel layers for concurrent compression followed by efficient coder operation. This paper also addresses different parameters, which improve image quality with different constraints and limitations encountered during design verification. This proposed scheme is comprised of pre-coder, efficient transformation scheme followed by adaptive Huffman encoding/decoding in conjunction with quantization of image matrix which makes overall compression system lossy in nature. Due to flexibility of operation, this scheme can be applicable in different applications like Robot vision and real time video compression, etc. The results obtained after mathematical analysis and simulation are found useful to prove efficiency of layered compression scheme.
