Due to the power scarcity of sensors, a mechanism that can efficiently utilise energy has a great impact on extending network lifetime. Most existing works concentrate on scheduling sensors between sleep and active modes to maximise network lifetime while maintaining target/area coverage and network connectivity. This paper generalises the sleep/active mode by adjusting sensing range to maximise the total number of rounds. Two distributed solutions have been proposed and simulation results confirm the efficiency of our solutions.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient connected coverage of discrete targets in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000266357400003"}
