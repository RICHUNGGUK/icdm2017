Because of limitations of computing resources, we have restricted to relatively small N (similar to 10,000) systems compared to realistic star clusters. We found that these two different approaches generally give very similar results. Some minor differences are found to exist, but they can be understood because Fokker-Planck approach has to make some simplifying assumptions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
