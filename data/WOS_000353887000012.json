To achieve high level of security, each pair of nodes must share a secret key in order to communicate with each other. Because of the random deployment of sensors, a set of keys must be pre-distributed, so that each sensor node is assigned a set of keys from a key pool before the deployment. The keys stored in each node must be carefully selected to increase the probability of key share between two neighboring nodes. In this paper, we consider a hybrid key pre-distribution scheme based on the balanced incomplete block design. We present a new approach for choosing key pool in the hybrid symmetric design that improves the connectivity and scalability of the network. We also introduce an extension to the proposed approach to detract memory usage and improve resilience. Experimental results verify the performance and applicability of our approach.
