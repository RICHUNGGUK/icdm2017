The proposed method enables fast and reliable handoff. This feature is extremely important for high speed vehicular networks. Since vehicles are characterized by likely-predictable path, as well as very high speed, handoff events can and should be predicted in order to achieve fast and reliable handoff. As it is shown in this study, the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the packet loss ratio caused by frequent handoff events experienced by high speed vehicles. This scheme is topology-independent in the sense that it does not assume any network topology. The key idea is to use a topology-learning algorithm that enables to perform localized mobility management, by efficiently re-selecting a Mobility Anchor Point (MAP) node. The goal of the proposed scheme is to maintain a continues connection subject to user-dependent delay constraints, while minimizing the signaling cost and packet loss ratio associated with handoff events. This scheme is consistent with the existing mobility management schemes currently used in Mobile IP (MIP) and cellular networks, and it fits into the Hierarchical Mobile IPv6 (HMIPv6) scheme defined in Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6) for integrating mobile terminals with the Internet wired backbone.
