The ALOHA-Q protocol applies Q-Learning to frame based ALOHA as an intelligent slot selection strategy capable of migrating from random access to perfect scheduling. Results show that ALOHA-Qsignificantly outperforms Slotted ALOHA in terms of energy-efficiency, delay and throughput. It achieves comparable performance to S-MAC and Z-MAC with much lower complexity and overheads. A Markov model is developed to estimate the convergence time of its simple learning process and to validate the simulation results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
