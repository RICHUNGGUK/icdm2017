Though the Grid computing is popular in today's IT infrastructure, the concrete service-oriented Grid environment (system) is difficult to develop. Quality of Grid Services (QoGS) shields the heterogeneity of available resources. Such a QoGS requires interoperability between Grid resources and a consistent developer's interface, which must be specified by feasible and applicable virtual organizations (VO). In addition, an economic model of Grid community may also be considered. With the consideration of the behaviors and characteristics of such desirable Grid systems, an architecture and model of service-based BSP or ServiceBSP (service-based Bulk-Synchronous Parallelism) is proposed, at the aim at establishing a high interoperation and high quality cooperation between each Grid service, while developing an efficient mechanism to evaluate the performances of Grid applications.", "paper_title": "ServiceBSP model with QoS considerations in grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100113"}
