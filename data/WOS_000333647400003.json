In order to mitigate this problem, a promising solution is to use tier-based anycast protocols. The main shortcoming of these protocols is that they can consume a much greater amount of energy as compared with other competing protocols using deterministic routing. In this paper, we analyze, in depth, a tier-based anycast protocol and develop a new technique of improving network lifetime. Our solution is guided by our analytic framework that consists of subtiering and a new forwarding protocol called scheduling controlled anycast protocol'. We formulate the problem for finding an optimal duty cycle for each tier with a delay constraint as a minimax optimization problem and find its solution, which we show is unique. From the analytical results, we find that the network lifetime can be significantly extended by allocating a different duty cycle adaptively for each tier under a delay constraint. Through simulations, we verify that our duty cycle control algorithm enhances the network lifetime by approximately 70% in comparison with an optimal homogeneous duty cycle allocation.
