Adversaries exploit this weakness for executing attacks such as man-in-the-middle and evil twin. The reported work proposes a novel wireless intrusion response scheme called Rashnu to deal with these attacks. Rashnu is a third party wireless intrusion response scheme and is capable of rescuing the victim(s), that is, access point's clients. The proposed response approach is simulated in Omnet++ environment to appraise its effectiveness. Simulation results show that Rashnu can respond to these attacks with more than 65% success rate. Changing the access point selection strategy in the agent layer of the victim's wireless network interface card, 35% attacker's success rate is reduced to 8%. Eventually, improving Rashnu by tuning the response rate factor can modify this value by only 2.7%.
