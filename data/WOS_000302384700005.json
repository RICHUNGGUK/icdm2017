The paper focuses on the voltage generation analysis of two special SRGs. Design/methodology/approach - To evaluate the proposed configurations, their structures are introduced firstly, and the output voltages of both two generators are analyzed numerically via three dimensional finite element method. After that the obtained results are validated on laboratory set up. Moreover, the main parameters of each one causing the output voltages are studied. The proposed generators have been manufactured within a common physical framework. This framework consists of two magnetically independent stator and rotor sets (layers), where each stator set includes four salient poles, while the rotor comprises of two salient poles with almost equal arc lengths and no windings. The first generator called Field assisted SRG which has a stationary reel, and so the field coil wrapped around it, and it is placed between the two-stator sets, whereas in the second type named Self excited SRG, there is no field coil. Findings - Via experimental and numerical analysis, it is substantiated that this interesting combination can help users to produce electrical energy from low speeds to high speeds of performance through employing each of these generators in special case of study and application separately. Originality/value - This beneficial characteristic of two proposed SRGs can be noticed as a suitable trait in different industries such as aerospace, automobile and production of electrical energy via windmills.", "paper_title": "Experimental and numerical comparison between the output voltages of two novel switched reluctance generators", "paper_id": "WOS:000302384700005"}
