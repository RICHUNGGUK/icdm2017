For many years, immune inspired algorithms, whilst having some degree of success, have been limited by the lack of theorectical advances, the adoption of a limited immune inspired approach and the limited application of AIS to hard problems.", "paper_title": "Challenges for artificial immune systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237451800042"}
