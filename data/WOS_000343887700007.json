For applications where the assumption is not valid, e. g., secure cryptographic devices, secret sharing, etc, the security of systems protected by traditional error detecting codes can be easily compromised by an attacker. In this paper, we present constructions for strongly secure codes based on the nonlinear encoding functions. For (k, m, r) strongly secure codes, a message contains three parts: k-bit information data, m-bit random data x, and r-bit redundancy f(y,x). For any error and information, the fraction of x that masks the error is less than 1. In this paper, we describe lower and upper bounds on the proposed codes and show that the presented constructions can generate optimal or close to optimal codes. An efficient encoding and decoding method for the codes minimizing the number of multipliers using the multivariate Horner scheme is presented.", "paper_title": "Design of Strongly Secure Communication and Computation Channels by Nonlinear Error Detecting Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000343887700007"}
