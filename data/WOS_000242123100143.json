It is also useful for the linguistic quantification of sets in which the classification of concepts and events is affected by semantic imprecision. We describe a fuzzy method designed to assist with interpretations of group measurements obtained from validation data for intelligent systems operating in complex domains. The method described was implemented applying an object-oriented paradigm. The suitability of using fuzzy methods and an object-oriented approach are both discussed in the article.", "paper_title": "Interpretation of group measurements of validation data using fuzzy techniques in an object-oriented approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100143"}
