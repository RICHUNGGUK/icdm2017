By representing the contrast distributions of a local region, it serves as a distinctive local descriptor of the region. Our experiments demonstrate that contrast-based local descriptors can represent local regions with more compact histogram bins. Because of its high matching accuracy and efficient computation, the CCH has the potential to be used in a number of real-time applications. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
