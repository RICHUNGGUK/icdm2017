But how can we extract and analyze this implicit social structure? The authors' proposed formalism suggests various ways to map interactions to social structure. Applying this formalism to real-world data collected from three game genres reveals the implications of the mappings on in-game and gaming-related services, ranging from network and socially aware player matchmaking to an investigation of social network robustness against player departure.", "paper_title": "Analyzing Implicit Social Networks in Multiplayer Online Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000337170100006"}
