Due to this requirement, a wide variety of prediction methods has been introduced in order to identify the best strategy for software cost estimation. The selection of the best technique is usually based on measures of error whereas in more recent studies researchers use formal statistical procedures. The former approach can lead to unstable and erroneous results due to the existence of outlying points whereas the latter cannot be easily presented to non-experts and has to be carried out by an expert with statistical background. In this paper, we introduce the regression error characteristic (REC) analysis, a powerful visualization tool with interesting geometrical properties, in order to validate and compare different prediction models easily, by a simple inspection of a graph. Moreover, we propose a formal framework covering different aspects of the estimation process such as the calibration of the prediction methodology, the identification of factors that affect the error, the investigation of errors on certain ranges of the actual cost and the examination of the distribution of the cost for certain errors. Application of REC analysis to the ISBSG10 dataset for comparing estimation by analogy and linear regression illustrates the benefits and the significant information obtained. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
