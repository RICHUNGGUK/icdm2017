WSNs can be seen as a new type of distributed database systems. The data query processing is very important for WSNs. In this paper, we proposed a Continuous Top-k Contour Regions Querying algorithm (CTCRQ) which can continuously obtain the top-k contour regions and does not lose the rate of precision (accuracy). We take full advantage of the kth value of top-k result in current round as the threshold to suppress the nodes whose readings do not belong to the top-k result in next round. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed CTCRQ approach by using a synthetic data set. The results provide a number of insightful observations and show that CTCRQ substantially outperforms Centralized algorithm, Centralized Optimized algorithm, and CCM algorithm in terms of data transmitted.", "paper_title": "Continuous Top-k Contour Regions Querying in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319165200001"}
