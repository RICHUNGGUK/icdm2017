Space complexity for such systems measures the number of distinct monomials to be kept in memory while verifying a proof. We introduce a new combinatorial framework for proving space lower bounds in algebraic proof systems. As an immediate application, we obtain the space lower bounds previously provided for PC/PCR [Alekhnovich et al. 2002; Filmus et al. 2012]. More importantly, using our approach in its full potential, we prove Omega(n) space lower bounds in PC/PCR for random k-CNFs (k >= 4) in n variables, thus solving an open problem posed in Alekhnovich et al. [2002] and Filmus et al. [2012]. Our method also applies to the Graph Pigeonhole Principle, which is a variant of the Pigeonhole Principle defined over a constant (left) degree expander graph.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Space Complexity in Algebraic Proof Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357529300006"}
