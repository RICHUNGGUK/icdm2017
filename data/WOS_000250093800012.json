The model is based on a voltage-domain behavioral simulation. Simulation efficiency is improved by merging the voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) and the frequency divider. Due to the benefits of Verilog-AMS, the Delta Sigma modulator which is incorporated in the synthesizer is modeled in a fully digital way. This makes it accurate enough to evaluate how the performance of the frequency synthesizer is affected by cyclic behavior in the Delta Sigma modulator. The spur-minimizing effect of an odd initial condition on the first accumulator of the Delta Sigma modulator is verified. Sequence length control and its effect on the fractional-N frequency synthesizer are also discussed. The simulated results are in agreement with prior published data on fractional-N synthesizers and with new measurement results.", "paper_title": "Modeling and simulation of Delta Sigma fractional-N PLL frequency synthesizer in Verilog-AMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093800012"}
