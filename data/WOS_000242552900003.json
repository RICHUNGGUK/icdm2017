In this paper a method that turns around the existing symbiosis between stereovision and motion is introduced; motion minimizes correspondence ambiguities, and stereovision enhances motion information. The central idea behind our approach is to transpose the spatially defined problem of disparity estimation into the spatial-temporal domain. Motion is analyzed in the original sequences by means of the so-called permanency effect and the disparities are calculated from the resulting two-dimensional motion charge maps. This is an important contribution to the traditional stereovision depth analysis, where disparity is got from the image luminescence. In our approach, disparity is studied from a motion-based persistency charge measure. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
