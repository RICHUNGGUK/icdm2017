A product is designed to satisfy some certain tasks. In this study, the design of an automobile seat is handled. Automobile seat design procedure is based on experience and trial-and-error method, rather than structured and scientific methods. Axiomatic design is a design theory providing a systematic approach to engineering design. We propose a new product development algorithm based on axiomatic design principles. The independence axiom of axiomatic design is extended to fuzzy environment. Then, an automobile seat design process is taken into consideration by the proposed algorithm. The design characteristics of an automobile seat and their priorities are determined. Moreover, the design dimensions of an automobile seat are defined for Turkish drivers.", "paper_title": "Determining Design Characteristics of Automobile Seats Based On Fuzzy Axiomatic Design Principles", "paper_id": "WOS:000277350100005"}
