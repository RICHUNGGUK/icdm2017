We formulate and prove several theorems which enable using synchronous conformance testing techniques such as input-output conformance testing (ioco ) in order to test implementations only accessible through asynchronous communication channels. These theorems define when the synchronous test cases are sufficient for checking all aspects of conformance that are observable by asynchronous interaction with the implementation under test.", "paper_title": "Synchrony and asynchrony in conformance testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000349026100010"}
