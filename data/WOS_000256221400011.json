In general, industrial practice has tended toward a decentralized MPC architecture. Most existing MPC systems work independently of other MPC systems installed within the plant and pursue a unit/local optimal operation. Thus, a margin for plant-wide performance improvement may be available beyond what decentralized MPC can offer. Coordinating decentralized, autonomous MPC has been identified as a practical approach to improving plant-wide performance. In this work, we propose a framework for designing a coordination system for decentralized MPC which requires only minor modification to the current MPC layer. This work studies the feasibility of applying Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition to provide an on-line solution for coordinating decentralized MPC. The proposed coordinated, decentralized MPC system retains the reliability and maintainability of current distributed MPC schemes. An empirical study of the computational complexity is used to illustrate the efficiency of coordination and provide some guidelines for the application of the proposed coordination strategy. Finally, two case studies are performed to show the ease of implementation of the coordinated, decentralized MPC scheme and the resultant improvement in the plant-wide performance of the decentralized control system.
