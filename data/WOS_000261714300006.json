It is a great challenge to simultaneously guarantee the QoS for video delivery and maximize the system throughput over time-varying MIMO channel. We demonstrate that, by making full use of estimated channel state information (CSI) through feedback, a cascade of adaptive operations can be designed to satisfy maximum throughput for scalable video over MIMO systems. These operations include power allocation based on water-filling (WF), adaptive channel selection (ACS), and novel throughput maximizing power reallocation (PR). The proposed ACS transmission scheme enables overall increase in data throughput among enhancement layers by adaptively launching base layer bit-stream to proper sub-channel. Then, after initial power allocation with WF and proper adaptive mode selection, we obtain the surplus power across enhancement layer sub-channels which can be reallocated to some sub-channels by the proposed PR scheme. With such power reallocation, certain enhancement layers will be able to reach new level of QAM modulation through PR so as to maximize the system data throughput. We present in this paper some detailed analysis on these adaptive operations. We also present some simulation results to demonstrate that maximum throughput video transmission over MIMO wireless systems indeed can be achieved based on scalable video coding (SVC) and a sequence of appropriately designed adaptive operations.
