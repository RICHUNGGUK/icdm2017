Statistically significant four parameter Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR) models were constructed and validated in both cases (R-2=0.849; R-cv(2)=0.811; F=52.20; s(2)=0.25; N=42). A Fragment based QSAR (FQSAR) approach was applied for developing a fragment-QSAR equation, which enabled the construction of virtual structures for novel ATPase inhibitors with desired or pre-defined activity.", "paper_title": "Theoretical Modeling of HPV: QSAR and Novodesign with Fragment Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000355760800003"}
