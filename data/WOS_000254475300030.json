Block and bit erasure probabilities of turbo codes are studied by using the stopping set analysis. It is found that block and bit erasure probabilities of turbo codes with iterative decoding are higher than those with maximum-likelihood decoding, where the differences are negligible in the error floor region. It is shown that in the error floor region, block and bit erasure probabilities of turbo codes with iterative decoding are dominated by small stopping sets and are asymptotically dominated by low weight codewords.", "paper_title": "Turbo codes in binary erasure channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300030"}
