The body terminal of PMOS transistors in bulk CMOS technology can be used as the forth terminal, to enhance the performance of low-voltage analog circuits. To show the effectiveness of this technique, we have designed a continuous time common mode feedback (CMFB) circuit for a sub I-V opamp and a new sub 1-V, 1-bit quantizer. A 0.8-V opamp with embedded CMFB and a 0.8-V, I-bit quantizer for low-voltage Delta Sigma modulators are implemented in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology. The simulation results as well as the measurement data of these blocks are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "DTMOS technique for low-voltage analog circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000241747500010"}
