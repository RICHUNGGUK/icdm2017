It was designed as a building block of a generic DC-coupled Burst Mode Laser Diode Driver (BM-LDD) for GPON (Gigabit Passive Optical Network) applications and acts as an on-chip RCG with a settling time of 18 ns for fast and accurate optical level monitoring with guaranteed monotony. The proposed architecture of the on-chip RCG is based on an 8-bit segmented current-steering Digital-to-Analog Converter (IDAC) and a bandgap voltage reference. The (3 + 5) segmented architecture of the 8-bit IDAC is an optimum combination of a 3-bit MSBs (Most Significant Bits) unit-element sub-DAC and a 5-bit LSBs binary-weighted sub-DAC offering good DNL (Differential Nonlinearity) performance. The bandgap voltage reference deviates only 0.6% of the nominal value over temperature and power supply variations. A cascade current mirror with a super beta helper circuit is used to guarantee monotony and high accuracy. The linearity errors caused by systematic influences and random variations are reduced by the proposed 2-D double centroid symmetrical architecture. Experiments confirm a DNL of +/- 0.5 LSB for the proposed RCG. The tested performance of optical level monitoring and APC (Automatic Power Control) algorithm is compliant to ITU-T GPON standards. The design was realized in a 0.35 mu m SiGe BiCMOS technology with 3.3 V power supply. The technology choice was made by heavy requirements of the innovative DC-coupled 1.25 Gbit/s BM-LDD chip. Although the proposed structure was designed as a building block for a BM-LDD chip, the design concept can be applied for developing other high linearity on-chip RCG for a wide junction temperature range (-40 to 110 degrees C).", "paper_title": "A digitally controlled on-chip monotonic reference current generator with low LSB current for fast and accurate optical level monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000255112000004"}
