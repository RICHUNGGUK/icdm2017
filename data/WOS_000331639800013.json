We have integrated our condensation algorithm in a low-level-vision system that obtains several vision-features in real-time working on an FPGA. Within this framework, our condensation algorithm allows for the transfer of information from the FPGA device (or processing chip) to any co-processor (from embedded ones to external PCs or DSPs) under technological constraints (such as bandwidth, memory and performance ones). Our condensation core processes 1024 x 1024 resolution images at up to 90 fps. Hence, our condensation module performs this process introducing an insignificant delay in the vision system. A hardware implementation usually implies a simplified version of the vision-feature extractor. Therefore, our condensation process inherently regularizes low-level-vision features, effectively reducing discontinuities and errors. The semidense representation obtained is compatible with mid-/high-level-vision modules, usually implemented as software components. In addition, our versatile semidense map is ready to receive feedback from attention processes, integrating task-driven attention (i.e. top-down information) in real time. Thus, the main advantages of this core are: real-time throughput, versatility, inherent regularization, scalability and feedback from other stages.", "paper_title": "On-chip semidense representation map for dense visual features driven by attention processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000331639800013"}
