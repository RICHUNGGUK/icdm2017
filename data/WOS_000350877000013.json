This kind of flow is described as a polydispersed multiphase flow. In this work, we evaluated the behavior of water-in-oil emulsion flowing through a duct with an element used to mimic the effect of a globe valve. An Eulerian multi-fluid approach was employed by solving the population balance equation coupled with computational fluid dynamics. Coalescence and breakage models recently developed were extended to this inhomogeneous model. A bivariate population balance problem was also solved to demonstrate the mixing caused by the valve-like element. The simulated results showed good agreement with the available experimental data for the Sauter and DeBroukere mean diameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
