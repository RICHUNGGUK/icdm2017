We have been studying OpenStack which was an Open cloud project under the KOREN (Korea Advanced Research Network) environments. In this paper, we propose a secure smart-work service model-based OpenStack. There are mainly two kinds of security breaches that can occur under the proposed environment. Nova is vulnerable to DoS attack in OpenStack. SQL Injection can be attacked in the process during which the user requests authorization, which results in data being saved in Swift. Looking more deeply into these two types of attack, we can divide DoS attack into Jolt2, Tear-drop, and SYN-Flooding attack. We simulated attacks in an experimental environment and summarized the results. With the objective of being able to provide Smart-Work service in the KOREN environment, we proposed solutions to various kinds of attacks against the security system and carried out modeling work with the data from the experiment conducted in the Cloud service environment we examined above.", "paper_title": "A secure smart-work service model based OpenStack for Cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000341081900007"}
