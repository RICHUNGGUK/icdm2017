P2P multimedia sharing mechanisms for P2P network such as PPLive, PPStream, Joost, have been used popularly. However, if Content Server and Client in home network have to transmit via P2P sharing, P2P network must be adopted, thus it is unable to increase the network transmission speed through this intranet connection. Although there are DLNA, HAVi, and Jini protocols in home network to share multimedia files, it cannot access P2P network due to the limitation of home network framework. Therefore, this paper proposes a DLNA-based Multimedia Sharing System for OSGI framework with Extension to P2P Network, which extends DLNA multimedia sharing mechanism to P2P network through OSGI platform, so that users can access multimedia resource on P2P Network via DLNA, and P2P network users can apply P2P network mechanism in OSGI bundle to access shared DLNA multimedia resource in home network.", "paper_title": "DLNA-Based Multimedia Sharing System for OSGI Framework With Extension to P2P Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000278539300014"}
