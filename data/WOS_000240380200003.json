We develop a mean value analysis (MVA) to compute these delay figures. The merits of MVA are in its intrinsic simplicity and its intuitively appealing derivation. As a consequence, MVA may be applied, both in an exact and approximate manner, to a large variety of models.", "paper_title": "Mean value analysis for polling systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240380200003"}
