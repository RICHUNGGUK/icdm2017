Usually, the problem of surgical instruments reconstruction is considered as a basic task in computer vision to estimate the 3-D position of each marker on a surgery instrument from three pairs of image points. However, the existing methods considered the 3-D reconstruction of the points separately thus ignore the structure information. Meanwhile, the errors from light variation, imaging noise and quantization still affect the reconstruction accuracy. This paper proposes a method which takes the structure information of surgical instruments as constraints, and reconstructs the whole markers on one surgical instrument together. Firstly, we calibrate the instruments before navigation to get the structure parameters. The structure parameters consist of markers' number, distances between each markers and a linearity sign of each instrument. Then, the structure constraints are added to stereo reconstruction. Finally, weighted filter is used to reduce the jitter. Experiments conducted on surgery navigation system showed that our method not only improve accuracy effectively but also reduce the jitter of surgical instrument greatly.", "paper_title": "Constrained High Accuracy Stereo Reconstruction Method for Surgical Instruments Positioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000310983900014"}
