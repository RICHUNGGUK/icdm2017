While the most optimal savings can be achieved by careful coordination among all of the elements, there are opportunities for improvement on each individual component of the system. In particular, at the very core of computation, the processing elements are silicon devices embedded in integrated circuits. In this paper, an overview of the state of the art in building efficient silicon for computational applications is presented, including the techniques actively used by the industry, the upcoming new technologies, and the research initiatives geared toward the future.
