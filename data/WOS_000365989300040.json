A reduced-order filter is designed. With the augmentation technique, a filtering error system with delayed states is obtained. In order to deal with time delays in system states, the filtering error system is first transformed into two interconnected subsystems. By using a two-term approximation for the time-varying delay, sufficient delay-dependent conditions of finite-time boundedness and H-infinity performance of the filtering error system are derived with the Lyapunov function. Based on these conditions, the filter design methods are proposed and the filter gain matrices can be obtained by calculating a set of linear matrix inequalities. A numerical example is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Finite-Time H-infinity Filtering for T-S Fuzzy Discrete-Time Systems With Time-Varying Delay and Norm-Bounded Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000365989300040"}
