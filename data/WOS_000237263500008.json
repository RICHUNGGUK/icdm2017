Established evaluation criteria for conceptual modeling languages are used to compare Topic Map ontology modeling with ORM and UML, to try to find if ORM is a good alternative to UML. The paper discusses a few extensions to simplify viewing ORM diagrams of a Topic Map ontology. ORM is also used to model a case ontology to show practical use within an application domain.", "paper_title": "Conceptual modeling of topic maps with ORM versus UML", "paper_id": "WOS:000237263500008"}
