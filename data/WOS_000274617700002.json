Variant values and distribution of strain can only be generated by sewing different two-dimensional (2D) patterns and warping them onto the body. We present a physical/geometric approach for computing 2D meshes that, when folded onto the three-dimensional (3D) body, can generate a user-defined strain distribution through proper distortion. This is opposite to the widely studied mesh parameterization problem, whose objective is to minimize the distortion between the 2D and 3D meshes in angle, area or length. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
