Using A - phi methods, fully discrete coupled and decoupled numerical schemes are developed. The existence and uniqueness of solutions for these schemes together with the energy-norm error estimates are provided. To verify the validity of both schemes, some computer simulations are performed for the model from TEAM Workshop Problem 7.", "paper_title": "Fully discrete potential-based finite element methods for a transient eddy current problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000268511600003"}
