The notorious ligand promiscuity of this channel earmarked hERG as one of the most important antitargets to be considered in early stages of drug development process. Herein we report on the development of an innovative and freely accessible web server for early identification of putative hERG blockers and non-blockers in chemical libraries. We have collected the largest publicly available curated hERG dataset of 5,984 compounds. We succeed in developing robust and externally predictive binary (CCR approximate to 0.8) and multiclass models (accuracy approximate to 0.7). These models are available as a web-service freely available for public at http://labmol. farma cia. ufg. br/predherg/. Three following outcomes are available for the users: prediction by binary model, prediction by multi-class model, and the probability maps of atomic contribution. The Pred-hERG will be continuously updated and upgraded as new information became available.", "paper_title": "Pred-hERG: A Novel web-Accessible Computational Tool for Predicting Cardiac Toxicity", "paper_id": "WOS:000365319900005"}
