We propose a novel technique to minimize DDJ introduced while the output driver is operating with pre-emphasis mode, which is called DDJ reduction technique. The output driver circuit is designed in 0.13 mu m 1P6 M CMOS process and fully compliant to the DisplayPort standard. With the proposed technique, observed DDJ at the output of the driver is reduced from 10 ps to under 1 ps while the output driver producing 400 mV output swing with 6 dB pre-emphasis. The output driver consumes minimum 66 mW and adopts 1.2 V supply voltage for core and 3.3 V supply voltage for I/O including pre-drivers.", "paper_title": "A 6 Gb/s transmitter with data-dependent jitter reduction technique for displayport physical layer", "paper_id": "WOS:000344168000018"}
