Most existing soft shadow mapping methods lose important visibility information by relying on pinhole renderings from an area light source, providing plausible results only for small light sources. Since we sample the entire 4D shadow light field stochastically, we are able to closely approximate shadows of large area lights as well. In order to efficiently reconstruct smooth shadows from this sparse data, we exploit the analogy of soft shadow computation to rendering defocus blur, and introduce a multiplane pre-filtering algorithm. We demonstrate how existing pre-filterable approximations of the visibility function, such as variance shadow mapping, can be extended to four dimensions within our framework.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Soft Shadow Mapping", "paper_id": "WOS:000358533700001"}
