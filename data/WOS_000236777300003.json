The theoretical parametric studies, which are based on a previously reported orthotropic sheet model, have also led to the development of equally simple procedures for estimating the values of critical (axial load range/mean axial load) and range of twist at which maximum axial and torsional specific loss occur. It is shown that, over a wide range of strand mean axial strains, the axial specific loss may be significantly increased by quite modest increases in the lay angle (within the current manufacturing limits). For a given strand construction, increasing the lay angle is, however, shown to lead to a reduction in the magnitude of maximum torsional specific loss. Guided by the previously reported experimental observations, the possible practical limitations of the proposed formulations are critically discussed. The present work should prove of value to those involved with the design against aero- or hydrodynamic instability of cable supported bridges and offshore platforms, as well as overhead transmission lines.
