The other is the convergence failure observed at smaller quark masses for enlarged number of the right-hand sides. The block BiCGGR algorithm which was recently proposed by the authors succeeds in solving the former problem. In this article we show that a preconditioning technique allows us to improve the convergence behavior for increasing number of the right-hand sides. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
