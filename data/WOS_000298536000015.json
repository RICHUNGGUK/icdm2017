A real-time kinematic global positioning system and an inertial measurement unit installed in a tractor normally used by farmers during grass harvesting were used to acquire tractor vibration acceleration data. Analysis of the position and vibration acceleration data of tractors by a Fourier transformation yielded a power spectrum of vibration acceleration at each frequency (1-10 Hz) and position. The root mean square of vibration acceleration at each frequency (1-10 Hz) was calculated with the center frequency of the 1/3 octave bands (1.0,1.25,1.6,2.0,2.5,3.15,4,5,6.3,8,and 10 Hz) based on ISO standards. To evaluate the working efficiency in the grassland, geographical information system maps were generated using the power spectrum of vibration acceleration and the limit on working time for each frequency that negatively affected the tractor driver. The vibration acceleration in the longitudinal (a(x)) and lateral (a(y)) directions at the center frequency of the 1/3 octave band below 2.0 Hz exceeded the fatigue-decreased proficiency and reduced the comfort boundaries stipulated in ISO 2631 (1974). In the area where working characteristics are severe, the vibration acceleration in the vertical direction (a(z)) is high. The vibration acceleration in the a(z) direction at the center frequency of the 1/3 octave band (5-10 Hz) clearly indicates discomfort during grass harvesting and a decrease in the work efficiency beyond 1 h. The total vibration acceleration (a(v)) at the center frequency of 5.0 Hz of the 1/3 octave band served to evaluate comfort in the whole field during grass harvesting the a value is higher than that at other frequencies. The area with severe working characteristics showed a higher a(v) value at the center frequency of 8.0 Hz than that at other frequencies. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
