First, using semi-tensor product of matrices and the matrix expression of logic, the Boolean control networks with state delays can be converted into discrete time delay dynamics. Then, the observability of the Boolean control networks via two kinds of inputs is investigated by giving necessary and sufficient conditions. Finally, examples are given to illustrate the efficiency of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Observability of Boolean Control Networks with State Time Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000291355700010"}
