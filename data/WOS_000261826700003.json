We characterize a full T-conditional possibility in terms of a suitable set of unconditional possibilities. Starting from this characterization we are able to manage coherent conditional possibility assessments and their enlargements. To compare T-conditional possibility related to different t-norm T, we study binary relations locally representable by a T-conditional possibility. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
