To realize the concept, simply use the PDA to search for information is not enough, where an intelligent paradigm is required to deal with the request for information as well as the command execution in a distributed information system. This paper proposes a mobile-enterprise multi-agent paradigm (MMAP) which is an agent-based intelligent solution provider developed for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to increase their flexibility and competitiveness in the market. The system is driven by intelligent software agents. Their design and prototype implementation are demonstrated in this paper. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
