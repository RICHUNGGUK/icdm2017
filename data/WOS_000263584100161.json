The optimal interval of case dissimilarity distance threshold T is inferred from the experimental results by X fold cross-validation method. The experiments and application show that useful information can be generated for CFW prevention and treatment and the dynamic adjustment for decision-making of cucumber planting can be assisted by the proposed CBR system.
