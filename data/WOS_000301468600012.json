The automatic translation from these models to fully executable code which can be simulated and round-trip engineered is still an open challenge in the Business Process Management field. Model-driven Engineering has proposed a set of methodologies with which to solve the existing gap between business analysts and software developers, but the expected results have not as yet been achieved. In this paper, a new approach to solve this challenge is proposed. This approach is based on the integration of SOD-M, a model-driven method for the development of service-oriented systems, and DENEB, a platform for the development and execution of flexible business processes. SOD-M provides business analysts with a methodology that can be used to transform their business goals into composition service models, a type of model that represents business processes. The use of the Eclipse Modelling Framework and the ATLAS Transformation Language allows this model to be automatically transformed into a DENEB workflow model, resulting in a business process that is coded by a class of high-level Petri-nets and is directly executable in DENEB. The application of the proposal presented herein is illustrated by means of a real system related to the management of medical images. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
