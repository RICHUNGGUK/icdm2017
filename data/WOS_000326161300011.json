They can be used to improve the transient stabilities, voltage profiles, lines transmission capabilities, etc. Therefore, the optimized allocation of FACTS devices is an important issue in recent research. The optimal placements of FACTS devices can have a determinant effect on the performance of a system, too. In this paper, the proper allocation of SSSCs is proposed. Sensitivity analysis is used in order to model SSSCs' effects on the power system. The advantage of this modeling based on sensitivity analysis is to accelerate the optimization process. By using SA for modeling the SSSC, optimization needs only one load flow in the initial state. According to this method, there is no need for exact modeling of SSSCs. Due to its high speed, another advantage of this method is its ability to cover all possible input values and all candidate places for SSSCs. Additionally, the number of SSSCs is not limited and it can vary during optimization. This approach is based on the objective function including transient stability and active power transmission capacity indices. The proposed method is applied on a typical 6-bus network and the 57-bus IEEE test system. The results show the performance of this method.", "paper_title": "A new method based on sensitivity analysis to optimize the placement of SSSCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000326161300011"}
