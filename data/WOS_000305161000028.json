The assumptions made are similar to a double blind review process; that is, the identities of both parties (evaluators and subjects) are only known to the facilitator, and the evaluators are allowed to provide ratings in linguistic terms (e.g., 'poor', 'good', 'very good'). This paper provides a novel integration and an unbiased method in reaching a transparent decision making outcome for the funding allocation of projects. The differences in implementation between the AHP-fuzzy TOPSIS and other similar applications are discussed. Finally, the evaluation process is illustrated with values derived from a university resource allocation exercise.", "paper_title": "MODELING FUNDING ALLOCATION PROBLEMS VIA AHP-FUZZY TOPSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161000028"}
