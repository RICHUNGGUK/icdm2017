This paper presents an application to fuzzy control of Polya's theorems on positive forms on the standard simplex. The result provides a set of progressively less conservative sufficient conditions for proving positivity of fuzzy summations; such conditions are less and less conservative as a complexity parameter, n, increases. Particular cases of such conditions are those in [C.-H. Fang, Y-S. Liu, S.-W. Kau, L. Hong, C.-H.

Zhang, New approaches to H(infinity) controller designs based on fuzzy observers for T-S fuzzy systems via LMI, Automatica 39 (9) (2003) 1571-1582], with n = 2 and 3, respectively. The proposed conditions are asymptotically exact, i.e., necessary and sufficient when n tends to infinity or, equivalently, when a tolerance parameter tends to zero. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
