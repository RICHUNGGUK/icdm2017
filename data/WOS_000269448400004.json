First and most important is generality. The formula is truly universal and could be applied regardless of feedback topology. The impedances of canonical cases could be presented as special cases of Blackman's impedance relation. This paper revisits the concepts of Blackman's impedance relation. Several alternative derivation approaches are suggested to stand in accord with the gain evaluation procedure. The derivation of the Blackman's impedance relation formula by Superposition, Thevenin, Trans-Admittance and Trans-Impedance methods are offered. The paper extends the ideas and completes the methodology of unified approach to analysis of feedback amplifiers presented earlier. The paper also discusses some additional features of the feedback amplifier model. The paper advocates that the described method of obtaining the loop-gain makes a real difference in application of the formula. Overcoming the loop-gain computational difficulties helps reestablish the Blackman's impedance relation as a viable tool in analysis of feedback circuits.", "paper_title": "SEVERAL ALTERNATIVE DERIVATIONS OF BLACKMAN'S IMPEDANCE RELATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269448400004"}
