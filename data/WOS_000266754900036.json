The proposed here algorithm complexity is that the superior algorithm based on the tabu search technique selects parameters controlling the work of a certain constructional algorithm. This approach limits the checked solutions only to a group of solutions being able to be generated by the structural algorithm in question. it bears serious consequences both positive, for example it limits the research scope for a small fraction of relatively extremely well quality of acceptable solutions, and negative that is the lack of possibility of finding the optimal solution. In this paper numerical researches of the proposed algorithm are conducted as well as a comparative analysis with reference to the literature algorithms of the algorithm in question is made.
