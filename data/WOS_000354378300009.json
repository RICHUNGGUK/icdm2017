Five antecedent factors involved in making online microsourcing decisions, mainly representing economic and strategic considerations, were identified based on prior research. Our research model was tested with data collected from one of the primary online microsourcing platforms. Our findings suggested that online microsourcing decisions are made more for the convenience of management and for strategic reasons than for purposes of cost reduction. Thus, this study indicates the relevance of a resource-based theory for online microsourcing. Because online microsourcing is generally characterized by small outsourcing deals, with small firms as clients, this paper introduces a new outsourcing practice to the current outsourcing landscape. Finally implications for theory and practice are presented.", "paper_title": "Examining the antecedent factors of online microsourcing", "paper_id": "WOS:000354378300009"}
