A dynamically and partially reconfigurable system can share hardware contexts among various hardware tasks. However, such FPGA systems require much memory to save the hardware context. To solve this problem, this work proposes a methodology for switching hardware context in dynamically partially reconfigurable FPGA systems. This method can reduce the reconfiguration time and memory size of hardware context-switching by analyzing the characteristic of bit indexes and frame addresses. The experimental results show that the proposed method reduces 10.674% in hardware reconfiguration time, 47.47% in memory size, and 41.25% in resource overhead.", "paper_title": "Hardware Context-Switch Methodology for Dynamically Partially Reconfigurable Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000280434700009"}
