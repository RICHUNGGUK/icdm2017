Most of these risks lie in the legacy software migration process. These risks can create many problems, and in the worst case they can lead to the failure of the migration project. This paper explores different types of risk analysis methods such as CRAMM, CORAS, OCTAVE and VECTOR. After comparing these methods, the two suitable methods were chosen, namely, OCTAVE and VECTOR. Based on the use of these two methods, the project suggests an enhanced EOV method for risk analysis in the migration of legacy software.", "paper_title": "Enhancement of VECTOR Method by Adapting OCTAVE for Risk Analysis in Legacy System Migration", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200018"}
