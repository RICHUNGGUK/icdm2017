A three-dimensional finite element (FE) model comprising of the T12-Pelvis spine unit was used to mimic the human spine system. It is not clear how the A-P shifting of the upper part of human upper body affect on vibrational modality of the human lumbar spine under whole body vibration. Five trunk mass point locations were assumed by 2.0 cm anterior, 1.0 cm anterior, 1.0 cm posterior and 2.0 cm posterior to the upright sedentary posture including no shifting posture. FE modal analysis was used to extract the resonant frequencies and vibration modes of the human spine. The analytical results indicate that trunk mass centroid shifting onwards or rearwards may result in a reduction of vertical resonant frequency of the human spine. The human spine has the highest vertical resonant frequency at the normal upright sedentary posture with the trunk mass locating around 1.0 cm anterior to the L3-L4 vertebral centroid. Larger A-P deformations and rotational deformations were also found at the spine motion segments L3-L4 and L4-L5, which imply higher compressive stress and shear stress at the disc annulus of those spinal motion segments. The findings in this study may explain why long-term whole body vibration might induce the degeneration of human spine at the relevant spinal motion segments. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
