As recently emerged a clean slate approach of the future Internet, CCN needs to be further supplemented yet. Since power consumption by Internet and user demand for Quality of Service have been increasing year by year, one of the major challenges in CCN is how to support an energy-efficient intelligent forwarding engine. To address this challenge, this paper proposed a Greening Domain and Ant Colony based Forwarding (GDACF) scheme which is a joint caching and forwarding strategy. In our proposals, we firstly use popularity inspired caching and adaptive rate methods to reduce power consumption of CCN; Then we design an ant colony based packets forwarding scheme to support Quality of Service for CCN. The evaluation results show that our proposals decrease data retrieve time from 3.29% to 16.16% and save energy from 9.66% to 15.08% compared with original CCN forwarding strategy.
