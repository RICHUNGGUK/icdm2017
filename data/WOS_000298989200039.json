They construct arithmetic analogs of the Walsh-Hadamard transform and correlation functions of Boolean functions. These play central roles in the cryptographic analysis of block ciphers and stream ciphers. After making basic definitions and constructing various algebraic tools they: 1) show how to realize arithmetic correlations as cardinalities of intersections of hypersurfaces; 2) show that the arithmetic Walsh spectrum characterizes a Boolean function; 3) study the average behavior of arithmetic Walsh transforms; and 4) find the arithmetic Walsh transforms of linear and affine functions.", "paper_title": "Arithmetic Correlations and Walsh Transforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000298989200039"}
