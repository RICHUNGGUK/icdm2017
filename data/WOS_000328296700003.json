This calibration has been performed for EURO STOXX 50 index and EUR/USD exchange rate with an asymptotic formula for volatility or Monte Carlo simulation. Moreover, in the dynamic model we propose an original more general expression for the functional parameters, specially well suited for the EUR/USD exchange rate case. Numerical results illustrate the expected behavior of both SA BR models and the accuracy of the calibration. In terms of computational time, when the asymptotic formula for volatility is used the speedup with respect to CPU computation is around 200 with one GPU. Furthermore, GPU technology allows the use of Monte Carlo simulation for calibration purposes, the computational time with CPU being prohibitive. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
