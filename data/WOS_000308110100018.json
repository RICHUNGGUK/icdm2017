However, making efficient use of the computational resources available places a significant burden on the application developer due to the lack of support for reconfigurable computing and task heterogeneity in standard message-passing libraries. This paper describes Accessible Reconfigurable Computing (ARC), a metacomputing environment designed to address these issues. The architecture, implementation, and operation of the system are described in detail.", "paper_title": "ARC: a metacomputing environment for clusters augmented with reconfigurable hardware", "paper_id": "WOS:000308110100018"}
