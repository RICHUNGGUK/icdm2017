But in the real-world applications, facilities may fail due to disasters such as congestion, earthquakes, floods and adverse weather conditions. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop models which work not only in normal conditions but also after a disruption; applying this concept to traditional facility location problem ends up to reliable facility location problem. In this paper, possibility of failure for facilities is considered and a model is developed in which a hierarchy of facilities are located in order to maximize the total covered demand. This model has application in different areas such as health care and solid waste management systems. Then a hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) algorithm is presented to solve the model efficiently. The algorithm is hybridized with 2-opt as a local search. Moreover, the algorithm uses the current solutions based on their fitness to generate new ones, which helps the algorithm work more efficiently. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is tested via comparing the results with the exact solutions obtained from small-size problems. Finally, after validation, the algorithm is tested over a real-life case example. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
