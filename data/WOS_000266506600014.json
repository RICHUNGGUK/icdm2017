Applying the classical representation theorem of finitely additive measures with totally bounded variation, we first present a short proof of the representation theorem of statistical measures. As its application, we show that every kind of statistical convergence is just a type of measure convergence with respect to a specific class of statistical measures. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
