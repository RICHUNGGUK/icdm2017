The projected algorithm can implant more information into less perceptive areas within the original image determined by saliency map. The scheme helps to detect the regions that have better data hiding capacity within an image. The locations with less perceptibility specifies the most insignificant location from the view of visibility within an image, so any alteration within these locations will be less apparent to any spectator. Moreover, the watermark is encrypted with Symmetric Key Cryptography to make it secure from the attackers. Here the algorithm is tested by means of imperceptibility and robustness.", "paper_title": "On the Implementation of a Secured Digital Watermarking Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000374505800004"}
