Afterwards, this theory is applied to enhance the facilities for accessing a multimedia system, namely when searching for correspondence between multi-valued attributes, which are coupled with a thesaurus. Furthermore, to allow flexibility in this search, thesauri with similarities defined between the thesaurus terms are considered. As a possible application, the DEKKMMA project is introduced, a project about an audio archive of African music.", "paper_title": "Similarity between multi-valued thesaurus attributes: Theory and application in multimedia systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575000028"}
