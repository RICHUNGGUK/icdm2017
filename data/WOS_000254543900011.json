Initially, a token is placed at position 0 on a round table with n positions. In each round of the game Magnus chooses the number of positions for the token to move, and Derek decides in which direction, + (clockwise) or - (counterclockwise), the token will be moved. Magnus aims to maximize the total number of positions visited during the course of the game, while Derek aims to minimize this quantity. We define f* (n) to be the eventual size of the set of visited positions when both players play optimally. We prove a closed form expression for f* (n) in terms of the prime factorization of n, and provide algorithmic strategies for Magnus and Derek to meet this bound. We note the relevance of the game for a mobile agent exploring a ring network with faulty sense of direction, and we pose variants of the game for future study. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
