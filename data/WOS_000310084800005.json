The probability limit theory, the algebra graph theory, and some other techniques are employed to derive the necessary and sufficient condition guaranteeing the mean square bounded consensus tracking. It turns out that the maximum allowable sampling period depends on not only the network topology but also the constant feedback gains. Furthermore, the effects of the sampling period on tracking performance, including the tracking speed and the static tracking error, are also analyzed. The results show that reducing the sampling period can accelerate the tracking speed and decrease the static tracking error. Simulations are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Bounded Consensus Tracking of Second-Order Multi-Agent Systems with Measurement Noises and Sampled-Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000310084800005"}
