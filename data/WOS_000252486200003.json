We decompose the process into two stages, called the gathering and scattering corresponding to the computations for incident and exident irradiance respectively. We derive a simplified illumination model for the gathering of the incident irradiance, which is amenable for deformable models using two auxiliary textures. In the scattering stage, we adopt two modes for efficient accomplishment of the view-dependent scattering. Our approach is implemented by fully exploiting the capabilities of graphics processing units (GPUs). It achieves visually plausible results and real-time frame rates for deformable models on commodity desktop PCs.", "paper_title": "GPU-based rendering for deformable translucent objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000252486200003"}
