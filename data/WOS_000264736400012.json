GOLPP extends the recently proposed linear Orthogonal Locality Preserving Projections (OLPP) to nonlinear case using the kernel-trick. Specifically, GOLPP explicitly considers the low-dimensional structure in data and finds a nonlinear mapping from the input space to the reduced space that optimally preserves the structure and that simultaneously possesses the orthogonal property in a kernel feature space. By tailoring the definition of proximity between training samples, GOLPP can work in unsupervised or supervised setting: Unsupervised GOLPP preserves the geometry structure for compact data representation; Supervised GOLPP uses a new proximity definition to preserve the local discriminant structure as well as the geometry in each class for data discrimination. A fault detection method based on unsupervised GOLPP and a fault diagnosis method based on supervised GOLPP are developed. Simulation results on a simple nonlinear system and the benchmark Tennessee Eastman process show the superiority of the GOLPP-based fault detection and diagnosis methods over popular nonlinear methods.
