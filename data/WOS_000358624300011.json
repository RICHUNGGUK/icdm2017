This (weighted) k-center problem was solved in O (n log n) time previously by using Cole's parametric search and other complicated approaches. In this paper, we present an easier O (n log n) time algorithm that avoids the parametric search, and in certain special cases our algorithm solves the problem in O (n) time. In addition, our techniques involve developing interesting data structures for processing queries that find a lowest point in the common intersection of a certain subset of half-planes. This subproblem is interesting in its own right and our solution for it may find other applications as well. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
