The effects of linear coupling J, nonlinear coupling K and magnetic field B on the average fidelity are investigated in detail. It is found that increasing |K| is not only very helpful for enhancing the average fidelity, but also beneficial to improving the critical temperature T(f) and magnetic field B(f), beyond which quantum teleportation is inferior to classical communication protocol.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM TELEPORTATION VIA 1D OPTICAL LATTICE CHAINS WITH NONLINEAR COUPLING", "paper_id": "WOS:000262138000008"}
