The document was prepared at the Eastern front during WWII and reached the German military authorities, possibly with the help of Kurt Pannke, a manufacturer of calculating equipment. Zuse's scheme was recently found in his Nachlass. It is documented here for the first time. Zuse's offer was rejected by the military, so the software-based cipher machine described in the letter never materialized.", "paper_title": "Konrad Zuse's Proposal for a Cipher Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000341643700004"}
