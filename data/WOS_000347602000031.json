We give also a best up to now upper approximation bound for this problem in the case of the parameters beta > 2. We develop also a new functional method for proving lower approximation bounds and display a sharp approximation phase transition area between approximability and inapproximability of the underlying problems. Our results depend on a method which could be also of independent interest. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
