In this scheme, the two successive zero coefficients of the medium-frequency components in each block are used to hide the secret data. Furthermore, the scheme modifies the quantization table to maintain the quality of the stego-image. Experimental results also confirm that the proposed scheme can provide expected acceptable image quality of stego-images and successfully achieve reversibility. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
