Under such a contract, a retailer pays a supplier a wholesale price for each unit purchased, plus a percentage of the revenue generated by the retailer that is determined by retailer's purchase quantity and price. We address the contract under two kinds of fuzzy demands which depend on the retailer's selling price based on game theory. The effectiveness of the revenue-sharing contract under fuzzy demands is proved.", "paper_title": "Supply chain coordination by revenue-sharing contract with fuzzy demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000261327100004"}
