By using the Mawhin-like coincidence theorem, together with the differential inclusion theory, M-matrix properties and differential inequality techniques, some novel criteria are established for ensuring the periodicity and dissipativity for the addressed neural networks. Finally, two numerical examples with simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
