Modern image recovery algorithms either yield poor quality and require much time or need substantial interaction with the user. In this paper, a new algorithm for recovering texture of building facades, which is based on information on regularity of their structures, is presented. The structure is described by a set of nonintersecting lattices of similar rectangular fragments. An algorithm for searching such structures is proposed. The algorithms are compared with the existing ones on available image databases.", "paper_title": "Reconstruction of Structure and Texture of City Building Facades", "paper_id": "WOS:000300086300005"}
