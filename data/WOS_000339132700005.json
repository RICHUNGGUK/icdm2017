Similar to the existing artificial moment method, an attractive point is obtained first at each step for guiding the robot to move along a shorter path. Then, the robot moves one step to the next position under the guidance of the attractive point and the control of an artificial moment motion controller. Different from the existing one, attractive function segments are used for attractive points and the artificial moment motion controller is improved. As each attractive function segment can be used for several steps, the computational burden for attractive points is reduced considerably. Furthermore, positive and negative key obstacle function segment sets are proposed to determine whether the target is reachable when a new attractive function segment is required. If the target is reachable, then, a motion direction for the robot is determined by using the key obstacle function segment sets. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is effective and can yield better solutions in complex environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
