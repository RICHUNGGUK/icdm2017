Such a modelling could be applied when analyzing the transient operating conditions or the impact of nonlinear and unbalanced loads on the transformer operation and the big power systems modelling. Design/methodology/approach - Secondly, an inverse form of the Jiles-Atherton hysteresis model was applied for the hysteresis losses of a transformer defining. In that sense this paper compares and evaluates both hysteresis models, where the possible errors caused by simplified model application are exposed. Findings - The Jiles-Atherton model can be applied when more accurate hysteresis models are required, however, at the cost of increased model complexity and required computational effort. Apart from that the main drawback is impossible application of such a modelling, when some of the input parameters are unknown. On the other hand the simplified hysteresis model does not increase the required computational effort substantially. Originality/value - Both methods have been modified in such a way that they can be used when the magnetizing curve of the iron-core material is not available, whilst the magnetically-nonlinear characteristic of the entire device can be determined experimentally. The aforementioned characteristic can be given in the form of an approximation polynomial or in the form of a look-up table.", "paper_title": "Comparison between the simplified and the Jiles-Atherton model when accounting for the hysteresis losses of a transformer", "paper_id": "WOS:000322608900021"}
