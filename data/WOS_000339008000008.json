In this article, we report the design and implementation of Quality-aware Voice Streaming (QVS) for wireless sensor networks. QVS is built upon SenEar, a new sensor hardware platform we developed for high-bandwidth wireless audio communication. QVS comprises several novel components, which include an empirical model for online voice-quality evaluation and control, dynamic voice compression/duplication adaptation for lossy wireless links, and distributed stream admission control that exploits network capacity for rate allocation. We have extensively tested QVS on a 20-node network deployment. Our experimental results show that QVS delivers satisfactory voice quality under a range of realistic settings while achieving high network capacity utilization.", "paper_title": "A Quality-Aware Voice Streaming System for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339008000008"}
