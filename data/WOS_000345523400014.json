It presents an efficient algorithm, called ORPHEUS, that finds a multiplierless TMCM design by sharing logic operators, namely adders, subtractors, adders/subtractors, and multiplexors (MUXes). Moreover, this article introduces folded design architectures for the digital signal processing (DSP) blocks, such as finite impulse response (FIR) filters and linear DSP transforms, and describes how these folded DSP blocks can be efficiently realized using TMCM operations optimized by ORPHEUS. Experimental results indicate that ORPHEUS can find better solutions than existing TMCM algorithms, yielding TMCM designs requiring less area. They also show that the folded architectures lead to alternative designs with significantly less area, but incurring an increase in latency and energy consumption, compared to the parallel architecture.", "paper_title": "Multiplierless Design of Folded DSP Blocks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345523400014"}
