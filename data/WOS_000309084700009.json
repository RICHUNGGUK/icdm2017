In particular, we propose nonparametric methods for edge detection, and numerically compare them to an alternative method that has been recently proposed in the literature. Our results show that some of the proposed methods display superior results and are computationally simpler than the existing method. An application to real (not simulated) data is presented and discussed. (C) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
