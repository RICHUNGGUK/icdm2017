The model provides a reduced calculation time by a factor 30 compared to SPICE. A 2%, or less, deviation in comparison with SPICE is achieved. The validation of the model through the measurements of both a fully-integrated boost and buck converter is demonstrated, resulting in an accuracy for the efficiency of 3 and 4% respectively.", "paper_title": "A mathematical steady-state design model for fully-integrated boost and buck DC-DC converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000300357600010"}
