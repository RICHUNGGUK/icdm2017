The first algorithm builds, for any instance phi of 3-SAT, a quantum Fredkin circuit that computes a superposition of all classical evaluations of phi in a given output line. Similarly, the second and third algorithms compute the same superposition on a given register of a quantum register machine, and as the energy of a given membrane in a quantum P system, respectively. Assuming that a specific non-unitary operator, built using a truncated version of the well known creation and annihilation operators, can be realized as a quantum gate, as an instruction of the quantum register machine, and as a rule of the quantum P system, respectively, we show how to decide whether phi is a positive instance of 3-SAT. The construction relies also upon the assumption that an external observer is able to discriminate, as the result of a measurement, a null vector from a non-null vector. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
