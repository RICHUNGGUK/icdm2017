The goal is to serve items into a prescribed rate, while minimizing the energy consumption of the mobile users. Abstractly, we are presented with a set of jobs, each with a known execution time and a requested period, and the task is to design a schedule for these jobs over a single shared resource without preemption. Given any solution schedule, its period approximation is the maximal factor by which the average period of a job in the schedule is blown up w.r.t. its requested period, and the jitter is roughly the maximal variability of times between two consecutive occurrences of the same job. Schedules with low jitter allow the mobile devices to save power by having their receivers switched off longer. In this paper we consider a scenario where clients may be willing to settle for non-optimal period approximation so that the jitter is improved. We present a parametric jitter-approximation tradeoff algorithm that allows us to choose various combinations between jitter optimality and period optimality for any given set of jobs.", "paper_title": "Jitter-approximation tradeoff for periodic scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137900006"}
