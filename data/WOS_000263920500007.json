In this paper, we present a filtered-backprojection (FBP) algorithm for triple-source helical cone-beam CT. The algorithm is both exact and efficient. It utilizes data from three inter-helix PI-arcs associated with the inter-helix PI-lines and the minimum detection windows defined for the triple-source configuration. The proof of the formula is based on the geometric relations specific to triple-source helical cone-beam scanning. Simulation results demonstrate the validity of the reconstruction algorithm. This algorithm is also extended to a multisource version for (2N + 1)-source helical cone-beam CT. With parallel computing, the proposed FBP algorithms can be significantly faster than our previously published multisource backprojection-filtration algorithms. Thus, the FBP algorithms are promising in applications of triple-source helical cone-beam CT.", "paper_title": "A Filtered Backprojection Algorithm for Triple-Source Helical Cone-Beam CT", "paper_id": "WOS:000263920500007"}
