As an extension of real-valued recurrent neural networks, complex-valued recurrent neural networks use complex-valued states, connection weights, or activation functions with much more complicated properties than real-valued ones. This paper presents several sufficient conditions derived to ascertain the existence of unique equilibrium, global asymptotic stability, and global exponential stability of delayed complex-valued recurrent neural networks with two classes of complex-valued activation functions. Simulation results of three numerical examples are also delineated to substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Global Stability of Complex-Valued Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000306522200001"}
