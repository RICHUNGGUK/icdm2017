Any container not picked up in the period following its delivery incurs a penalty cost resulting primarily from operating costs and customer dissatisfaction. The result is a dynamic logistics planning problem where in each delivery period the vehicle dispatcher needs to design a multi-stop vehicle route while determining the container quantities to be picked up at each stop. This research is unique in that route design and pickup strategies are developed simultaneously, where stop volumes are known only probabilistically over a planning horizon. A heuristic procedure is developed for treating the route design-pickup strategy planning problem. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
