Such extensions were achieved by proposing novel improvements. Specifically, a new \"side function\", to determine the relative position of the particle and the cell, was introduced to build a more formal test process. In addition, a binary search method was developed to accelerate the particle in cell test and trajectory/face intersection test for grids consisting of arbitrary polygon/polyhedral cells. Further, the particle location problem without the known vicinity position was established and solved by special boundary treatment through considering the internal/extemal boundary and larger particle displacement in one single Lagrangian step. The improved algorithm was applied to the particle location problem with both two dimensional and three dimensional Eulerian grids. Additionally, the proposed algorithm was compared with the previous ones to exhibit its higher efficiency and broader application. Sample cases focusing the water impingement computation for aircraft icing were solved by adopting this algorithm assisted by the Lagrangian particle dynamics model, and the computational results were verified by the experiments.
