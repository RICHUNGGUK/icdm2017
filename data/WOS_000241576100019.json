It is not only suggests a route based on route guidance principles and optimized due to routing criteria but also passes through all unspecified site(s) such as gas stations, banks determined by drivers. By proposing a novel approach on the bases of route guidance navigation system principles, virus theory (viral infection and local/site infection) and by GIS and GA utilization, this paper is come up to rate of search improvement in urban multi-criteria optimized route guidance by considering unspecified site satisfaction on real network with multiple dependent criteria. Tests of route selection for a part of north-west of Tehran traffic network are conducted and the results show the efficiency of the algorithm and support our analyses.", "paper_title": "A GIS-based approach for urban multi-criteria quasi optimized route guidance by considering unspecified site satisfaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241576100019"}
