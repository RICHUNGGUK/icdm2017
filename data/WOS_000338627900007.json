To this end, designers often integrate existing systems with ad-hoc adaptive strategies able to tune specific parameters that impact performance or energy-for example, frequency scaling. However, these strategies interfere with one another and unpredictable performance degradationmay occur due to the interaction between different entities. In this article, we propose a software approach to reconfiguration when different strategies, called loops, are encapsulated in the system and are available to be activated. Our solution to loop coordination is based on machine learning and it selects a policy for the activation of loops inside of a system without prior knowledge. We implemented our solution on top of GNU/Linux and evaluated it with a significant subset of the PARSEC benchmark suite.", "paper_title": "Coordination of Independent Loops in Self-Adaptive Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000338627900007"}
