In order to find a best-matched codeword (winner) in the codebook for a certain input vector, it is a general way to roughly estimate other than exactly compute Euclidean distance immediately for the purpose of rejecting a candidate codeword. The lower dimensional features of a vector such as sum or the mean (L-1-type norm) and L-2 norm are widely used for this purpose. Obviously, how to construct a suitable feature is a core problem for estimating Euclidean distance. In this paper, an efficient method of constructing L-1-type norm feature is proposed by introducing a reference vector. In addition, the criterion on how to select an optimal reference vector is also given. Experimental results confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An efficient method of constructing L-1-type norm feature to estimate Euclidean distance for fast vector quantization", "paper_id": "WOS:000243807200005"}
