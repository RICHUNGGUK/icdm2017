However, costs and benefits of information systems with low-granular item-level information can be very different depending on various factors. We consider item-level information applications, especially RFID solutions, within the oil industry. We discuss why the incorporation of RFID tags in this system cannot be isolated and studied and how several related dimensions need to be considered. Among them, we detail characteristics like item-level identification, the rewritable and contact-less information functions, the existence of distributed sensors, and the overall network architecture. We consider the solutions used or potentially useful in the oil industry and evaluate three types of performance drivers (technical, operational, and strategic) related to these systems. Based on these, we propose five typologies-related to tubes, containers, other items, processes, and people-to characterize various critical empirical scenarios to identify the conditions under which item-level information is valuable in the oil industry. We then illustrate these typologies through potential applications.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE DRIVERS FOR RFID-GENERATED ITEM-LEVEL INFORMATION IN THE OIL INDUSTRY", "paper_id": "WOS:000299775900003"}
