Therefore, the efficiency and accuracy of estimating the optimal marked-signal distribution will greatly influence the speeds of encoding and decoding. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm to solve the optimal marked-signal distribution. Furthermore, we modify the method to achieve the optimal distribution directly according to a given distortion constraint or an expected embedding rate, which makes it more practical for applications.", "paper_title": "Fast Estimation of Optimal Marked-Signal Distribution for Reversible Data Hiding", "paper_id": "WOS:000319723800007"}
