We propose to group the butterfly computations in several consecutive stages to maximize utilization of the available VRs and take the advantage of the symmetries in twiddle factors. All the butterflies sharing identical twiddle factors are clustered and computed together to further improve performance. The relationship between the number of fused stages and the number of available VRs is then examined. Experimental results on different platforms show that the proposed method is effective.", "paper_title": "Efficient Utilization of Vector Registers to Improve FFT Performance on SIMD Microprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700016"}
