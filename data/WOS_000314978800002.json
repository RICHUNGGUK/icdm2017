I show that he misjudges the role of BPMN, YAWL and similar techniques in the modeling of business processes. In particular he mistakes YAWL's formal basis, i.e. Petri nets. Borger furthermore suggests evaluation criteria for business process modeling tools. I argue that his criteria overemphasize some less important aspects, while ignoring some decisive ones.", "paper_title": "Remarks on Egon Borger: \"Approaches to model business processes: a critical analysis of BPMN, workflow patterns and YAWL, SOSYM 11:305-318\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000314978800002"}
