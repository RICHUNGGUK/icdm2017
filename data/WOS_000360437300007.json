It can be naturally formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), which, however, is not very scalable. To address this problem, we propose the combined use of low-rank approximation and block coordinate descent (BCD). Low-rank approximation avoids the expensive positive semidefinite constraint in the SDP by replacing the kernel matrix variable with V TV, where V is a low-rank matrix. The resultant nonlinear optimization problem is then solved by BCD, which optimizes each column of V sequentially. It can be shown that the proposed algorithm has nice convergence properties and low computational complexities. Experiments on a number of real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art NPKI. solvers.", "paper_title": "Scalable Nonparametric Low-Rank Kernel Learning Using Block Coordinate Descent", "paper_id": "WOS:000360437300007"}
