This way, the coarse-grid problem can be fully overlapped by fine-grid computations (which are embarrassingly parallel) in a wide range of cases. Further, we consider inexact solvers to reduce the computational cost/complexity and memory consumption of coarse and local problems and boost the scalability of the solver. Out of our numerical experimentation, we conclude that the BDDC preconditioner is quite insensitive to inexact solvers. In particular, one cycle of algebraic multigrid (AMG) is enough to attain algorithmic scalability. Further, the clear reduction of computing time and memory requirements of inexact solvers compared to sparse direct ones makes possible to scale far beyond state-of-the-art BDDC implementations. Excellent weak scalability results have been obtained with the proposed inexact/overlapped implementation of the two-level BDDC preconditioner, up to 93,312 cores and 20 billion unknowns on JUQUEEN. Further, we have also applied the proposed setting to unstructured meshes and partitions for the pressure Poisson solver in the backward-facing step benchmark domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
