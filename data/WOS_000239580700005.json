A subset of these constraints are known as organisation of the MAS. This paper describes a software implementation, called S-MOISE+, that tries to fill the gap between the organisational constraints and the agents autonomy. This software ensures that all agents will follow the organisation without requiring that they are developed in a specific language or architecture.", "paper_title": "S-Moise(+): A middleware for developing organised multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239580700005"}
