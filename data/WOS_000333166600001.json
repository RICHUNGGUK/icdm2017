In this demonstration, an ordinary phosphorescent light-emitting diode with relatively low modulation bandwidth is used. Four sub-channels without any channel spacing are adopted to simultaneously support four users. By using this scheme combined with frequency domain equalization, the data rate of each user can be dynamically reconfigured from 10 to 120 Mb/s, and the overall throughput is above 125 Mb/s at a distance of 120 cm. Furthermore, a data rate of 225 Mb/s by adopting two sub-channels at a distance of 66 cm within the FEC limit of has been also achieved. This scheme has good scalability for supporting more terminals, and high spectrum efficiency due to the dynamic traffic reconfiguration, which shows that it has great potential advantages in future access network.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous multiple access using flexible bandwidth allocation scheme in SCM-based 32/64QAM-OFDM VLC system", "paper_id": "WOS:000333166600001"}
