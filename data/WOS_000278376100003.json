Most known sRNAs have been identified in Escherichia coli and have been shown to be conserved in closely related organisms. We have developed an integrative approach that searches highly conserved intergenic regions among related bacterial genomes for combinations of characteristics that have been extracted from known E. coli sRNA genes. Support vector machines (SVM) were then used with these characteristics to predict novel sRNA genes. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
