In this paper, we deal with the design of polar codes in decode-and-forward relaying and prove that the selective transmission of the relay to the destination, based on the decision of a detector of erroneous decoding - a method which we call \"smart\" relaying - can significantly improve the error probability performance. Furthermore, we propose a design for the aforementioned detector, that can be applied on the successive cancellation decoding of polar codes. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Smart Decode-and-Forward Relaying with Polar Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100016"}
