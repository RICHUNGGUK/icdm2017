Though it is well-known that flash storage is physically more reliable than hard disk drives within its limited lifespan, neither of them provide sophisticated built-in mechanisms guarding against non-physical failures, such as virus attacks and unintentional errors. One of the unique characteristics of flash is \"no in-place overwrites\", which would cause a large amount of superseded pages/data to remain in the flash until they are selected to be erased by a garbage collection process. Leveraging this idiosyncrasy, we propose ShiftFlash, which provides flash based storage with time-shifting functionality to make it more robust and resilient. By monitoring and recording the modifications of the FTL mapping table, ShiftFlash enables flash state to be reverted to any point-in-time (PiT) in the past. It is implemented within SSD devices and needs minimal support from the upper layer. The trace-driven simulation results of a range of different workloads show that ShiftFlash only introduces marginal overheads with respect to several principal performance metrics, somewhere between 6% and 11%, compared with the original non-shifting flash. ShiftFlash also outperforms other time-shifting schemes by a large extent in many respects. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
