These papers and the presentations at the workshop highlight an important new direction for integrated decision support: enterprise model management (EMM). In this paper we discuss our underlying assumptions and suggest several EMM research propositions supported by evidence from the papers included in the special issue. We conclude with our thoughts on harnessing EMM for sustainable competitive advantage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
