New sufficient conditions are proposed in terms of linear-matrix inequalities. Based on the optimal solutions of these sufficient conditions at each sampling instant, we design both parallel-distributed compensation and nonparallel-distributed compensation state-feedback controllers, which can guarantee that the resulting closed-loop fuzzy-discrete system is asymptotically stable. In addition, the fuzzy-feedback controllers meet the specifications for the fuzzy-discrete systems with both input and output constraints. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Constrained Infinite-Horizon Model Predictive Control for Fuzzy-Discrete-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276097400016"}
