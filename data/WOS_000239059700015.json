To solve such a problem, rollback-recovery protocol rVsSG, preserving session guarantees is proposed. The protocol employs known rollback-recovery techniques, however, while applying them, the semantics of session guarantees is taken into account. Consequently, rVsSG protocol is optimized with respect to session guarantees requirements. The paper includes the proof of safety property of the presented protocol.", "paper_title": "Bounding recovery time in rollback-recovery protocol for mobile systems preserving session guarantees", "paper_id": "WOS:000239059700015"}
