Especially we consider the use of symmetries of channels and states for the construction of the convex roof. As an application we study the entanglement entropy of the diagonal map for permutation symmetric real N = 3 states w(z) and solve the case z < 0 where z is the non-diagonal entry in the density matrix. We also report a surprising result about the behavior of the output entropy of the diagonal map for arbitrary dimensions N; showing a bifurcation at N = 6.", "paper_title": "ENTANGLEMENT AND OUTPUT ENTROPY OF THE DIAGONAL MAP", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304900002"}
