This construction generalizes the one proposed by Xing (2002). It turns out that when d = 3 this construction gives a lower bound of constant-composition codes improving the one by Luo et al. (2003) for some case. Moreover, for d > 3, we give a lower bound on maximal size of constant-composition codes. In particular, our bound for d = 5 gives the best possible size of constant-composition codes up to magnitude.", "paper_title": "A construction for constant-composition codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400030"}
