In this paper, we present a technique that provides geolocation and mobility prediction of mobile devices, mixing the location information acquired with the GSM/3G infrastructure and the results of a landmark matching achieved thanks to the camera integrated on the mobile devices. Our geolocation approach is based on an advanced Time-Forwarding algorithm and on database correlation technique over Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) data, and integrates information produced by a landmark recognition infrastructure, to enhance algorithm performances in those areas with poor signal and low accurate geolocation. Performances of the algorithm are evaluated on real data from a complex urban environment.", "paper_title": "Landmark-assisted location and tracking in outdoor mobile network", "paper_id": "WOS:000303869800006"}
