To achieve this objective, the latest communications technology has been incorporated into heterogeneous networks and sensor systems. This technology includes mobile systems, which take measurements and transmit images in real time, an intelligent platform for processing and management of variables, and the implementation of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) designed with specific protocols and tools that allow the rapid deployment of the network and allow measurements to be taken in emergency situations. The sensors in this type of installation are extremely important for the management of the system as they allow us to collect information and make decisions with sufficient time to deal effectively with critical situations such as flooding or overloading of the waste water system, or environmental problems such as dumping of possible pollutants, as well as to make the best use of the water cycle. The solution presented here automates large portions of the processes, minimizing the possibility of human error, and increasing the frequency and accuracy of the measurements taken, ensuring a robust communication system covering all the elements involved to provide ubiquity of information, and finally gives an application layer to manage the system and receive alerts.
