The interleaving crescent broadcasting protocol is a trade-off among the subscriber's access latency, maximum buffer requirement, needed subscriber's bandwidth, and maximum disk I/O transfer rate. A longer subscriber's access latency may cause a subscriber to leave. A lower maximum buffer requirement, a lower needed subscriber's bandwidth, and a lower maximum disk I/O transfer rate reduce subscribers' costs. The interleaving crescent broadcasting protocol not only makes access latency shorter, but also lowers the overall system's cost. We prove the correctness of the interleaving crescent protocol; provide mathematical analyses to demonstrate its efficiency.", "paper_title": "An interleaving crescent broadcasting protocol for near video-on-demand services", "paper_id": "WOS:000278287300003"}
