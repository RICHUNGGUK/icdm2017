The large number of resources that have to communicate makes the use of interconnection systems based on shared buses inefficient. One way to solve the problem of on-chip communications is to use a Network-on-Chip (NoC)-based communication infrastructure. Such interconnection systems offer new degrees of freedom, exploration of which may reveal significant optimization possibilities: the possibility of arranging the computing and storage resources in an NoC, for example, has a great impact on various performance indexes. The paper addresses the problem of topological mapping of intellectual properties (IPs) on the tiles of a mesh-based NoC architecture. The aim is to obtain the Pareto mappings that maximize performance and minimize power dissipation. We propose a heuristic technique based on evolutionary computing to obtain an optimal approximation of the Pareto-optimal front in an efficient and accurate way. At the same time, two of the most widely-known approaches to mapping in mesh-based NoC architectures are extended in order to explore the mapping space in a multi-criteria mode. The approaches are then evaluated and compared, in terms of both accuracy and efficiency, on a platform based on an event-driven trace-based simulator which makes it possible to take account of important dynamic effects that have a great impact on mapping. The evaluation performed on both synthesized traffic and real applications (an MPEG-4 codec) confirms the efficiency, accuracy and scalability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A multi-objective genetic approach to mapping problem on Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000239789600002"}
