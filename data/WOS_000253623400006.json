In the case of the surface electromyographic (SEMG) activity, some models have been proposed aiming to study muscle contraction strategies that are used during different tasks and conditions. Most of SEMG simulators are based on energy modulation of a Gaussian noise. This work proposes a novel simulator in which the user-defined parameters are associated with the motor units (MUs) recruitment and their firing rate. Comparison between the mean spectrum of real SEMG signals collected in isometric contraction of the muscle biceps brachii and the mean spectrum obtained from simulated SEMG signals showed a good agreement, pointing the proposed simulator seems to be capable to generate consistent electromyographic signals in time and frequency domains and that can be used in many studies, in particular in the evaluation of automatic methods aimed to detect muscular contraction.
