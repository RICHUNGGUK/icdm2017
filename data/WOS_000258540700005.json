The recursive structure of CRC codes will give us an iterative way to compute the weight distribution of their dual codes starting from some \"representative\" words. Thanks to MacWilliams' Theorem, the computation of the weight distribution of the dual codes can be easily brought back to that of CRC codes.", "paper_title": "Computation of the weight distribution of CRC codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000258540700005"}
