Both the random coding error exponent and expurgated error exponent are studied using the replica method and saddle point approximation. Simulation results demonstrate that the derived expressions are very accurate. Also, compared with the prior expression which involves the hypergeometric function with matrix argument, our expression is much simpler and provides significant computational advantage.", "paper_title": "Reliability Analysis for Large MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700002"}
