This algorithm can obtain the boundary of hypersphere containing one class of samples by the description of the training samples from one class and uses this boundary to classify the test samples. Moreover, new multiplicative updates are derived to solve sum and box constrained quadratic programming. The experiments show the superiority of our new algorithm.", "paper_title": "Hypersphere support vector machines based on multiplicative updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600001"}
