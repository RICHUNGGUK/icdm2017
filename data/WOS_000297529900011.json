There is in fact no reason to assume that a single algorithm would be optimal. An ensemble of algorithms based on different principles can be more accurate than any of its individual members if the individual algorithms are doing better than random guessing. We aim to obtain an improved optic disc and macula detector by combining the prediction of multiple algorithms, benefiting from their strength and compensating their weaknesses. The location with maximum number of detectors' outputs is formally the hotspot and is used to find the optic disc or macula center. An assessment of the performance of integrated system and detectors working separately is also presented. Our proposed combination of detectors achieved overall highest performance in detecting optic disc and fovea closest to the manually center chosen by the retinal specialist. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
