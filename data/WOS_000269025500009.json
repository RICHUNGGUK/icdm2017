Consequently, the simulation of realistic facies distributions is a significant aim. Realistic facies distributions are typically obtained by pixel-based, object-based or process-based methods. This work presents a pixel-based geostatistical algorithm suitable for reproducing lateral gradual facies transitions (LGFT) between two adjacent sedimentary bodies. Lateral contact (i.e. interfingering) between distinct depositional facies is a widespread geometric relationship that occurs at different scales in any depositional system. The algorithm is based on the truncation of the sum of a linear expectation trend and a random Gaussian field, and can be conditioned to well data. The implementation introduced herein also includes subroutines to clean and geometrically characterize the obtained LGFT. The cleaned sedimentary body transition provides a more appropriate and realistic facies distribution for some depositional settings. The geometric measures of the LGFT yield an intuitive measure of the morphology of the sedimentary body boundary, which can be compared to analogue data. An example of a LGFT obtained by the algorithm presented herein is also flow simulated, quantitatively demonstrating the importance of realistically reproducing them in subsurface models, if further flow-related accurate predictions are to be made.
