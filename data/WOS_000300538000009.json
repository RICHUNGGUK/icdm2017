Then we apply these two bounds to provide a simple sufficient and necessary condition for sequential perfect distinguishability between epsilon and tau and provide both a lower bound and an upper bound on the minimum number of queries required to sequentially perfectly discriminating epsilon and tau. Interestingly, in the 2-dimensional case, both bounds coincide. Based on the optimal perfect discrimination protocol presented in [20], we can further generalize the lower bound and upper bound to the minimum number of queries to perfectly discriminating epsilon and I over all possible discrimination schemes. Finally the two lower bounds are shown remain working for perfectly discriminating general two quantum channels epsilon(0) and epsilon(1) in sequential scheme and over all possible discrimination schemes respectively.", "paper_title": "SOME BOUNDS ON THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF QUERIES REQUIRED FOR QUANTUM CHANNEL PERFECT DISCRIMINATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000300538000009"}
