These measures quantify the degree of similarity or relatedness between concepts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The objective of this work is to develop a method that can disambiguate terms in biomedical text by exploiting similarity and relatedness information extracted from biomedical resources and to evaluate the efficacy of these measure on WSD. Method: We evaluate our method on a biomedical dataset (MSH-WSD) that contains 203 ambiguous terms and acronyms. Results: We show that information content-based measures derived from either a corpus or taxonomy obtain a higher disambiguation accuracy than path-based measures or relatedness measures on the MSH-WSD dataset. Availability: The WSD system is open source and freely available from http://search.cpan.org/dist/UMLS-SenseRelate/.
