To handle this effect, the X-architecture has been proposed for high-performance integrated circuits. In this paper, we present a performance-driven X-architecture router based on a novel multilevel framework, called PIXAR. To fully consider performance-driven routing and take advantage of the X-architecture, PIXAR applies a novel multilevel routing framework, which adopts a two-stage technique of top-down uncoarsening followed by bottom-up coarsening, with a trapezoid-shaped track routing embedded between the two stages to assign long, straight diagonal segments for wirelength reduction. We also propose a performance-driven X-Steiner tree algorithm based on the delaunay triangulations to construct routing tree for performance optimization. Compared with the state-of-the-art work, PIXAR achieves 100% routing completion for all circuits while reduced the net delay. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
