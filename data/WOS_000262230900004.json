Traditional performance models have failed to capture this behavior. In this paper, we propose an analytical model, which is a two-stage and layered queuing model of the Web server, which is able to reproduce this behavior. We do this by explicitly modelling the overhead processing, the user abandonment and retry behavior, and the contention for resources, for the FIFO and LIFO queuing disciplines. We show that LIFO provides better goodput in most overload situations. We compare our model predictions with experimental results from a test bed and find that our results match well with measurements. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
