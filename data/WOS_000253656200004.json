First, a novel unity-feedback-factor sample-and-hold which manipulates the features of switched-opamp technique is presented. Second, opamp-sharing is merged into switched-opamp structure with a proposed dual-output opamp configuration. A 0.8-V, 9-bit, 10-Msample/s pipelined ADC is designed to verify the proposed circuit. Simulation results using a 0.18-mu m CMOS 1P6M process demonstrate the figure-of-merit of this pipelined ADC is only 0.71 pJ/step.", "paper_title": "Low-power circuit techniques for low-voltage pipelined ADCs based on switched-opamp architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000253656200004"}
