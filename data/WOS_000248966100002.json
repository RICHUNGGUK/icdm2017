We show that when every probe hybridizes to at most two viruses, i.e., every row contains at most two 1s, this minimization is still MAX SNP-complete, but has a polynomial-time approximation with performance ratio 1 + 2/(d + 1). This approximation is constructed based on an interesting result that the above minimization is polynomial-time solvable when every probe hybridizes to exactly two viruses. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
