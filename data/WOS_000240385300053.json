The first step of the method is to represent a facial image by a pair of shape and texture vectors which are extracted by projecting its shape and texture in the eigenspaces of shape or texture separately. The second is estimating the age of face image by Intelligence Increasing Neural Network. After this, the synthesized shape and texture vectors at target age are generated by using typical vector creating function, estimated age and the feature vector of the original test image. At last the synthesized shape and texture vectors at target age are reconstructed in eigenspaces to get the shape and texture at target age which are combined to synthesize facial image at target age. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively \"change\" the age of face images.", "paper_title": "Simulation of aging effects in face images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300053"}
