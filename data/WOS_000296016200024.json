However, the influences on the quality of the image interpolated from the downsampled one are usually neglected. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an interpolation-dependent image downsampling (IDID), where interpolation is hinged to downsampling. Given an interpolation method, the goal of IDID is to obtain a downsampled image that minimizes the sum of square errors between the input image and the one interpolated from the corresponding downsampled image. Utilizing a least squares algorithm, the solution of IDID is derived as the inverse operator of upsampling. We also devise a content-dependent IDID for the interpolation methods with varying interpolation coefficients. Numerous experimental results demonstrate the viability and efficiency of the proposed IDID.", "paper_title": "Interpolation-Dependent Image Downsampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000296016200024"}
