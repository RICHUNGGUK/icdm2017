For that purpose, we define an elementary ordered tree grammar (EOTG) by extending CFG, and then present a polynomial time algorithm which approximates the smallest EOTG within a factor of O(n(5/6)). We also show that the grammar and algorithm can be modified for unordered trees of bounded degree. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
