It is thus not surprising that air quality (AQ) increasingly becomes a central issue in the environmental information policy worldwide. The most common way to deliver AQ information is in terms of graphics, tables, pictograms, or color scales that display either the concentrations of the pollutant substances or the corresponding AQ indices. However, all of these presentation modi lack the explanatory dimension; nor can they be easily tailored to the needs of the individual users. MARQUIS is an AQ information generation service that produces user-tailored multilingual bulletins on the major measured and forecasted air pollution substances and their relevance to human health in five European regions. It incorporates modules for the assessment of pollutant time series episodes with respect to their relevance to a given addressee, for planning of the discourse structure of the bulletins and the selection of the adequate presentation mode, and for generation proper. The positive evaluation of the bulletins produced by MARQUIS by users shows that the use of automatic text generation techniques in such a complex and sensitive application is feasible.", "paper_title": "MARQUIS: GENERATION OF USER-TAILORED MULTILINGUAL AIR QUALITY BULLETINS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285057300003"}
