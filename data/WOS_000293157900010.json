People suffering from G6PD deficiency would be vulnerable to various oxidative substances, such as fava beans and oxidant drugs. Until now, many institutes, organizations or domain experts have compiled low-risk or high-risk drugs collection for patients with G6PD deficiency, mainly from the case report or clinical trails. Recently, we have explored a classification system to predict drug-induced hemolytic potential. In this paper, we screen the normally used over-the-counter (OTC) drugs for \"high-risk\" and \"low-risk\" ones to G6PD deficient patients by this system. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
