The perception of reverberation is assessed based on a new measure combining the characteristics of reverberation time, room spectral variance, and direct-to-reverberant energy ratio, which are estimated from the associated room impulse response (RIR). The practical aspects behind a robust RIR estimation are underlined, allowing an effective feature extraction for reverberation evaluation. The resulting objective metric achieves a correlation factor of about 90% with the subjective scores of two distinct speech databases, illustrating the system's ability to assess the reverberation effect in a reliable manner.
