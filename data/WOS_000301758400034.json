In this work, an adaptive and parameterless generalization of Otsu's method is presented. The adaptiveness is obtained by combining grid-based modeling and the estimated background map. The parameterless behavior is achieved by automatically estimating the document parameters, such as the average stroke width and the average line height. The proposed method is extended using a multiscale framework, and has been applied on various datasets, including the DIBCO'09 dataset, with promising results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
