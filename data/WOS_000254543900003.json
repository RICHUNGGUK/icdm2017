In each case, the reversal operator R is replaced by an arbitrary involutory antimorphism theta of the free monoid A*, In particular, we define the class of theta-words with seed, whose \"standard\" elements (theta-standard words with seed) are constructed by an iterative theta-palindrome closure process, starting from a finite word u(0) called the seed. When the seed is empty, one obtains theta-words; episturtman words are exactly the R-words. One of the main theorems of the paper characterizes theta-words with seed as infinite words closed under theta and having at most one left special factor of each length n >= N (where N is some nonnegative integer depending on the word). When N = 0 we call such words theta-epistunnian. Further results on the structure of theta-epistunnian words are proved. In particular, some relationships between theta-words (with or without seed) and theta-episturmian words are shown.
