This paper explores a data fusion approach to clustering microarray data. Our method, which combined expression data and Gene Ontology (GO)-derived information, is applied on a real data set to perform genome-wide clustering. A set of novel tools is proposed to validate the clustering results and pick a fair value of infusion coefficient. These tools measure stability, biological relevance, and distance from the expression-only clustering solution. Our results indicate that a data-fusion clustering leads to more stable, biologically relevant clusters that are still representative of the experimental data.", "paper_title": "Data-Fusion in Clustering Microarray Data: Balancing Discovery and Interpretability", "paper_id": "WOS:000274063600005"}
