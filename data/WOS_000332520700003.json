In practice, system performance often varies continually rather than just being functional or failed, especially for a complex system. Profust reliability theory extends the traditional binary state space {0, 1} into a fuzzy state space, which is therefore suitable to characterize a gradual physical degradation. Moreover, in profust reliability theory, fuzzy state transitions can also help to describe the health evolution of a component or a system. Accordingly, this paper proposes a profust reliability based PHM approach, where the profust reliability is employed as a health indicator to evaluate the real-time system performance. On the basis of the health estimation, the system remaining useful life (RUL) is further defined, and the mean RUL estimate is predicted by using a degraded Markov model. Finally, an experimental case study of Li-ion batteries is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Profust Reliability Based Approach to Prognostics and Health Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000332520700003"}
