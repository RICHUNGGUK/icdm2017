In contrast to the Euclidean case, this space is in general not convex. We show that its starshapedness is equivalent to the completeness of the parallel bodies of complete sets, a property studied in Moreno and Schneider (Isr. J. Math. 2012, doi:10.1007/s11856-012-0003-6), which is generically not satisfied. The space in question is, however, always contractible. Our main result states that in the case of a polyhedral norm, the space of translation classes of diametrically complete sets of given diameter is a finite polytopal complex. The proof makes use of a diagram technique, due to P. McMullen, for the representation of translation classes of polytopes with given normal vectors. The paper concludes with a study of the extreme diametrically complete sets.", "paper_title": "Structure of the Space of Diametrically Complete Sets in a Minkowski Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400011"}
