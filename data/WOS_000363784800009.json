Designing memory cells is a very interesting field of research in QCA domain. In this paper, we are going to propose novel nanotechnology-compatible designs based on the majority gate structures. In the first step, this objective is accomplished by QCA implementation of two well-organized JK flip flop designs and in the second step; synchronous counters with different sizes are presented as an application. To evaluate functional correctness of the proposed designs and compare with state-of-the-art, QCADesigner tool is employed.", "paper_title": "Design and Verification of New n-Bit Quantum-Dot Synchronous Counters Using Majority Function-Based JK Flip-Flops", "paper_id": "WOS:000363784800009"}
