The proposed methodology begins with the approximation of the spectral-domain Green's functions over large values of the spectral variable by complex exponentials, and continues with the approximation of the remainder by rational functions. Finally, the closed-form Green's functions in terms of spherical and cylindrical waves are derived, making use of some well-known integral identities. A key-feature of the proposed approach is that although it does not call for an analytical extraction of the quasistatic terms and the surface wave poles, it provides the means for the accurate description of both the near-field and far-field physics. Moreover, the rational function spectrum fitting proposed here overcomes the problem of the spurious singular behavior of the spatial-domain Green's functions because of the use of Hankel functions.
