The mathematical modeling of this problem leads to a min-sum-min formulation which, in addition to its intrinsic bi-level nature, has the significant characteristic of being strongly nondifferentiable. To overcome these difficulties, the proposed resolution method, called hyperbolic smoothing, adopts a smoothing strategy using a special C differentiable class function. The final solution is obtained by solving a sequence of low dimension differentiable unconstrained optimization subproblems which gradually approach the original problem. This paper introduces the method of partition of the set of observations into two nonoverlapping groups: \"data in frontier\" and \"data in gravitational regions\". The resulting combination of the two methodologies for the MSSC problem has interesting properties, which drastically simplify the computational tasks. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
