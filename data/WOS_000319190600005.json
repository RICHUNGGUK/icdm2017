The interval Owen value for this kind of fuzzy games is studied, and its explicit form is given. When the fuzzy games are convex, the proposed interval Owen value is an interval population monotonic allocation function (IPMAF), and belongs to the associated core. Furthermore, we discuss a special kind of fuzzy games with a coalition structure and interval payoffs, and study the interval Owen value and the core of it. Some properties are also examined, which are coincided with the crisp case.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Fuzzy Games with a Coalition Structure and Interval Payoffs", "paper_id": "WOS:000319190600005"}
