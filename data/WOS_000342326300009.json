The flexibility of a process is related to an understanding of the unexpected events that occur when people, systems and resources interact and require adjustments. Thus, business processes must be designed to respond to information about different events and their specificity. This information defines what the literature calls \"context\". To broaden the perception of context in the case of a business process, this work proposes an approach to characterize the context of a business process activity, in a given domain through conceptual models structured in layers. A case study was conducted to evaluate the proposal, which provided evidence of the applicability of the model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
