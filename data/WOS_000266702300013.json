This characteristic makes CNNs adequate for hardware implementation and, consequently, for their employment on a variety of applications as real-time image processing and construction of efficient associative memories. Adjustments of CNN parameters is a complex problem involved in the configuration of CNN for associative memories. This paper reviews methods of associative memory design based on CNNs, and provides comparative performance analysis of these approaches. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
