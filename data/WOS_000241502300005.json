These algorithms use distributed learning automata to find a policy that determines a path from a source node to a destination node with minimal expected cost (length). In these algorithms, at each stage distributed learning automata determines which edges to be sampled. This sampling method may result in decreasing unnecessary samples and hence decreasing the running time of algorithms. It is shown that the shortest path is found with a probability as close as to unity by proper choice of the parameters of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Utilizing distributed learning automata to solve stochastic shortest path problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241502300005"}
