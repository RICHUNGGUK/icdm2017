The proposed controller at each router (server or switch) regulates the rates of the heterogeneous source classes leveraging on the cooperation of neighboring bottlenecks. We consider the model of multibottleneck network in the presence of time delay and formulate global stability conditions suitable for network parameters and controller gains design. The proposed approach guarantees good performance in terms of link utilization, packet loss and fairness. Additionally it is guaranteed queue balancing without requiring rerouting or hop-by-hop operation differently from the existing approaches. A validation is carried out by a discrete packet experiment simulator in a realistic multibottleneck scenario to demonstrate the effectiveness of the key idea of the paper. Finally the proposed scheme is compared to some of well-known network controller-type presented in the literature in both steady-state and dynamic network scenario.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Queue Balancing and Differentiated Service Scheme Based on Cooperative Control Concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600057"}
