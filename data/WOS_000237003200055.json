The proposed extension relies on a specific indoor positioning technique to track current location. The adopted technique uses the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) as a good room-fingerprint. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach by examining preliminary experimental results obtained from our first system prototype.", "paper_title": "Supporting location-aware distributed applications on mobile devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200055"}
