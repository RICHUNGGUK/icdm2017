Clustering based on modularity optimization provides a better visualization and understanding of the network, in combination with the study of covariates. The graph has a globally low but heterogeneous density, with clusters of high intraconnectivity but low interconnectivity. Though descriptive, our results pave the way for incorporating structure when studying stochastic SIR epidemics spreading on social networks.", "paper_title": "A statistical network analysis of the HIV/AIDS epidemics in Cuba", "paper_id": "WOS:000366196300033"}
