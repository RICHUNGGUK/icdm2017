In order to prolong the system lifetime, random sleep scheme can be adopted without coordinating with its neighboring nodes. Based on the random sleep scheme, an accurate mathematical model for expected coverage ratio and point event detection quality is put forward in this paper. Furthermore, the model also takes the border effects into account and thus improves the accuracy of performance and quality analysis. Our model is flexible enough to capture the interaction among the essential system parameters. Therefore, this model could provide beneficial guidelines for optimal sensor network deployment satisfying both the lifetime and reliability requirements. Additional simulation results confirm the correctness and effectiveness of our analysis.", "paper_title": "Mathematical model for energy-efficient coverage and detection in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400017"}
