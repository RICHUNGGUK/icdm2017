With this aim, we introduce an approach for context-aware personalized smart homes based on two main pillars: the Open Service Gateway Initiative (OSGi) platform and the Semantic Web philosophy. By combining both fields, we enrich the OSGi service-oriented architecture by providing a semantical conceptualization of (i) services at home, (ii) contextual information and (iii) inhabitants' preferences. This ontological structure supports reasoning about the captured behavior and inferring new knowledge. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
