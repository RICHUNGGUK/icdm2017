In this work, we study the problem of ensuring the integrity of data storage in cloud computing. To reduce the computational cost at user side during the integrity verification of their data, the notion of public verifiability has been proposed. However, the challenge is that the computational burden is too huge for the users with resource-constrained devices to compute the public authentication tags of file blocks. To tackle the challenge, we propose OPoR, a new cloud storage scheme involving a cloud storage server and a cloud audit server, where the latter is assumed to be semi-honest. In particular, we consider the task of allowing the cloud audit server, on behalf of the cloud users, to pre-process the data before uploading to the cloud storage server and later verifying the data integrity. OPoR outsources and offloads the heavy computation of the tag generation to the cloud audit server and eliminates the involvement of user in the auditing and in the pre-processing phases. Furthermore, we strengthen the proof of retrievability (PoR) model to support dynamic data operations, as well as ensure security against reset attacks launched by the cloud storage server in the upload phase.", "paper_title": "OPoR: Enabling Proof of Retrievability in Cloud Computing with Resource-Constrained Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000366167500010"}
