This system is able to find the different representations for an author name as well as to distinguish between different authors sharing the same name. Using that information, the system shows the user the results of a search over a digital library properly grouped according to their authorship. To accomplish this task, it only uses information that can be directly obtained from the digital library itself without any kind of external data. The system has been tested using different digital libraries on the web. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
