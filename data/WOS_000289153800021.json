We demonstrate this for Hamiltonian dynamics, in general, and for the Jaynes-Cummings model, in particular. Employing superspace (instead of Hilbert space), we describe time evolution of density matrices in terms of path integrals, which are formally identical for quantum and classical mechanics. They only differ by the interaction contributing to the action. This allows us to import tools developed for Feynman path integrals, in order to deal with superoperators instead of quantum mechanical commutators in real time evolution. Perturbation theory is derived. Besides applications in classical statistical physics, the \"classical path integral\" and the parallel study of classical and quantum evolution indicate new aspects of (dynamically assisted) entanglement (generation). Our findings suggest to distinguish intra-from inter-space entanglement.", "paper_title": "A PATH INTEGRAL FOR CLASSICAL DYNAMICS, ENTANGLEMENT, AND JAYNES-CUMMINGS MODEL AT THE QUANTUM-CLASSICAL DIVIDE", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800021"}
