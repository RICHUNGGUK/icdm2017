With the proliferation of mobile devices and the increasing coverage of high speed wireless networks, such services are likely to be extended to support clients connected to the Internet through a wireless last hop. However, existing application level multicast schemes are not designed to handle the characteristics of the noisy wireless links. In this paper we propose an overlay multicast scheme called Quick Patching which arranges additional patch streams to clients under poor link conditions to improve their clients' viewing quality. We demonstrate through extensive simulation experiments that Quick Patching is not only scalable, but can also sustain the required viewing quality under different network conditions including fluctuating error conditions as well as heterogeneous user viewing quality requirements.", "paper_title": "Quick patching: an overlay multicast scheme for supporting video on demand in wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252253600003"}
