For this learning model, we define an appropriate measure of regularity of a graph labeling called the merging degree. In general, the merging degree of a graph is small when its vertices can be partitioned into a few well-separated clusters within which labels are roughly constant. For the special case of binary labeled graphs, the merging degree is a more refined measure than the cutsize. After observing that natural nonadaptive exploration/prediction strategies, like depth-first with majority vote, do not behave satisfactorily on graphs with small merging degree, we introduce an efficiently implementable adaptive strategy whose cumulative loss is controlled by the merging degree. A matching lower bound shows that in the case of binary labels our analysis cannot be improved. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
