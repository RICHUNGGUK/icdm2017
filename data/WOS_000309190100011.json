We explain that the complexity of the node control critically depends on the node architecture and, hence, critically impacts the end-to-end latency of the system. We introduce node architectures with highly distributed control that allow for systems with very low end-to-end latency. We present integrated devices that support such systems and we present laboratory experiments to illustrate the technical feasibility of such switching systems.", "paper_title": "Scaling Photonic Packet Switches to a Large Number of Ports [Invited]", "paper_id": "WOS:000309190100011"}
