In this paper, we consider the problem of optimizing a cost function for wireless sensor networks of this kind under energy consumption constraints. We focus, in particular, on the problem of coverage optimization through scheduling. Following existing approaches, we use a mixed integer linear program formulation. We show how to use partitioning techniques to decompose the problem into separate subproblems, solved individually, overcoming the exponential complexity typical of integer linear programming, while minimizing the loss in optimality. In addition, we evaluate the achieved degree of optimality by computing relatively tight bounds with respect to the optimal solution. Finally, we employ simple but effective heuristics to further improve our solution. The results show that our procedure is very efficient and scalable, and is able to find solutions that are very close to optimal. These characteristics make our approach a perfect fit for large and fixed deployments of wireless sensors, typical in factory automation and industrial applications. To show the generality of the approach, we apply our methodology to three different models of varying complexity.", "paper_title": "Scalable Offline Optimization of Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290414000017"}
