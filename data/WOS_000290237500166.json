In the proposed approach, we firstly use the maximum variance method based on Gram-Schmidt process to transform the original indicators into the corresponding orthogonal variables (Schmidt variables). And at the same time, a measure of investigating the cumulative variation information for selecting Schmidt variables is described. Secondly, a method for setting weights attached to the chosen Schmidt variables is provided: and then a ranking approach through weighted sum of the chosen Schmidt variables is presented. Finally, two Chinese cases are used to illustrate the rationality and advantage of the proposed ranking approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
