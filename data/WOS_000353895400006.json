This result is obtained by a combination of an analytic bound that is an analog of the Lovasz theta number and of a combinatorial argument involving finite subgraphs of the unit distance graph. In turn, we straightforwardly obtain an asymptotic improvement for the measurable chromatic number of Euclidean space. We also tighten previous results for dimensions between 4 and 24.", "paper_title": "The Density of Sets Avoiding Distance 1 in Euclidean Space", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400006"}
