This paper firstly establishes the nonlinear differential-algebra equations model of a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) power system installed with a SVC and a STATCOM and points out the possibility of the negative interactions between SVC and STATCOM controllers in this SMIB power system. Hence, a self-adaptive single neuron (SSN) control approach based on genetic algorithm is designed to eliminate the negative interactions and improve the stability of the closed-loop SMIB power system. The detailed simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSN controllers.", "paper_title": "Design of self-adaptive single neuron facts controllers based on genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000193"}
