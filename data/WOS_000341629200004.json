However, there are some restrictions in the use of ANNs as optimizers. For example: (1) ANNs cannot optimize continuous variable problems; (2) discrete problems should be mapped into the neural networks' architecture; and (3) most of the existing neural networks are applicable only for a class of smooth optimization problems and global convexity conditions on the objective functions and constraints are required. In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for stochastic optimization by a recurrent ANN. The concept of fractional calculus is adopted to propose a novel weight updating rule. The introduced method is called fractional-neuro-optimizer (FNO). This method starts with an initial solution and adjusts the network's weights by a new heuristic and unsupervised rule to reach a good solution. The efficiency of FNO is compared to the genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization techniques. Finally, the proposed FNO is used for determining the parameters of a proportional-integral-derivative controller for an automatic voltage regulator power system and is applied for designing the water distribution networks.", "paper_title": "Fractional-Neuro-Optimizer: A Neural-Network-Based Optimization Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000341629200004"}
