In principle, flash scenes can be detected by analyzing the histogram differences between frames. The proposed algorithm then suggests an adaptive coding order technique for increasing the efficiency of video coding by taking account of characteristics of flash scenes in video contents. The use of adaptive coding technique also benefits to enhance the accuracy of derived motion vectors for determination of weighting parameter sets. Experimental results show that a significant improvement of coding performance in terms of bitrate and PSNR can be achieved in comparison with the conventional weighted prediction algorithms.
