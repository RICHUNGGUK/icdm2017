In case of severely corrupted or non-available odometry information, topological mapping is difficult as the robot is challenged with the loop-closing problem; that is to determine whether it has visited a particular place before. In this article we propose to use neighbourhood information to disambiguate otherwise indistinguishable places. Using neighbourhood information for place disambiguation is an approach that neither depends on a specific choice of sensors nor requires geometric information such as odometry. Local neighbourhood information is extracted from a sequence of observations of visited places. In experiments using either sonar or visual observations from an indoor environment the benefits of using neighbourhood clues for the disambiguation of otherwise identical vertices are demonstrated. Over 90% of the maps we obtain are isomorphic with the ground truth. The choice of the robot's sensors does not impact the results of the experiments much.", "paper_title": "Topological map induction using neighbourhood information of places", "paper_id": "WOS:000302324300004"}
