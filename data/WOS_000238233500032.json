We derived the proposed CAM based on Breneman's corresponding color data. The results of the experiments were carried out to assess the proposed model performance in terms of color fidelity by comparing complex images on a LCD monitor. We confirmed that the proposed model performed better to predict corresponding colors under various viewing conditions. Therefore, the reproduced colors, which are viewed in real surround viewing conditions, are perceived the same as original object colors, when the proposed CAM was applied to color display devices such as CRT, LCD, and PDP.", "paper_title": "Chromatic adaptation model using the relationship between the cone responses under change in illuminants", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500032"}
