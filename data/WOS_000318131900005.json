The objective consists of maximizing the total collected revenue. We restrict our study to the case of a single server with nodes located in the Euclidean plane. We investigate the properties of this problem, and we derive a mathematical model assuming that the number of nodes to be visited is known in advance. We describe a tabu search algorithm with multiple neighborhoods, we test its performance by running it on instances from the literature and compare the outcomes with an upper bound. We conclude that the tabu search algorithm finds good-quality solutions fast, even for large instances. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
