The analysis is based on bibliometric data from the Italian university system for the five-year period 2004-2008. Technical and allocative efficiency is measured with input being considered as a university's research staff, classified according to academic rank, and with output considered as the field-standardized impact of the research product realized by these staff. The analysis is applied to all scientific disciplines of the so-called hard sciences, and conducted at subfield level, thus at a greater level of detail than ever before achieved in national-scale research assessments.
