The basic idea is designing a narrowband beamforming spatial filter at a specific frequency and using the obtained filter weights directly to wideband signals, which reduces the complexities of designing and processing. Under the premise of knowing signals' direction information, this paper uses the method of least square with linear constraints to design the narrowband spatial filter. Since the directional uniform circular array is insensitive to the variation of frequency, coincident beams and notches are obtained at different frequencies of the wideband signal by using the obtained narrowband spatial filter weights. The computation complexity of array signal processing can be greatly reduced by using the method proposed in this paper, which is convenient for real-time signal processing.", "paper_title": "A wideband beamforming method based on directional uniform circular arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500020"}
