In this paper, we prove that if G is k-regular for k >= 2, then for any graph H with vertical bar E(H)vertical bar >= vertical bar V (H)vertical bar - 1 >= 1, the Cartesian product H square G is anti-magic. We also show that if vertical bar E(H)vertical bar >= vertical bar V(H)vertical bar - 1 and each connected component of H has a vertex of odd degree, or H has at least 2 vertical bar V(H)vertical bar - 2 edges, then the prism of H is anti-magic.
