Based on the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, we propose an efficient artificial bee colony (EABC) algorithm for solving the on-line path planning of multiple mobile robots by choosing the proper objective function for target, obstacles, and robots collision avoidance. The proposed EABC algorithm enhances the performance by using elite individuals for preserving good evolution, the solution sharing provides a proper direction for searching, the instant update strategy provides the newest information of solution. By the proposed approach, the next positions of each robot are designed. Thus, the mobiles robots can travel to the designed targets without collision. Finally, simulation results of illustration examples are introduced to show the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
