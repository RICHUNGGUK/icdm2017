In this paper, we propose a new roadside unit (RSU) aided bundle forwarding protocol for vehicular delay tolerant networks. Furthermore, with the assistance from those RSUs deployed at some critical points on the road, for example, intersections, the proposed protocol can increase the network performance in terms of delivery ratio. At the same time, since vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-RSU (V2R) privacy-preserving authentications are guaranteed, the black (gray) hole attacks can be avoided. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.
