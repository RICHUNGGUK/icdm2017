When time-series images preprocessed by particle image velocimetry are computed by the SOM, the generated map provides visible and intelligible information for periodic behavior of patterns for gas dispersion. It is also shown that the sigmoid transformation of data enhances the efficiency of generating a more comprehensible map. Furthermore, the SOM is demonstrated to be effective in extracting the feature of small displacements of the impeller shaft inside the vessel. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
