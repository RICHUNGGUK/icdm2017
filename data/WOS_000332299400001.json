However, due to the limited power supply of the sensors, the researchers introduce mobile sinks in WSNs to prolong its lifetime. When introducing the mobile sinks in WSNs, the authentication issue between the mobile sink and the sensors appears. However, there are few studies on the authentication issue when using mobile sinks in WSNs. In this paper, we present a bilinear pairing based authentication and key agreement scheme for the authentication between mobile sinks and cluster head in WSNs. The proposed scheme can solve the problems of mobile sink authentication and provide data confidentiality and integrity. Security and performance analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme can resist against various attacks and meet the requirements of computational complexity in the environment of WSNs.", "paper_title": "Secure and Efficient Authentication Scheme for Mobile Sink in WSNs Based on Bilinear Pairings", "paper_id": "WOS:000332299400001"}
