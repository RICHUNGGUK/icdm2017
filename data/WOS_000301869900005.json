One of the significant issues affecting the success of any P2P streaming network is cooperation between peers. Practical observations have proved the prevalence of free riders in P2P networks that degrade their performance. To solve this problem, using incentive mechanisms, which encourage peers to contribute more in the network, is necessary. In this paper, we designed and proposed a distributed and scalable incentive mechanism for mesh based P2P video streaming networks. In the proposed approach the contribution of the peers is measured and maintained in a distributed fashion. Furthermore, we proposed an incentive sending side scheduler in which peers are served based on their contribution in the network. Our simulation evaluations show the efficiency of the proposed approach in improving the overall perceived video quality by the non-free rider nodes and consequently in the whole network.", "paper_title": "An incentive scheduling mechanism for peer-to-peer video streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000301869900005"}
