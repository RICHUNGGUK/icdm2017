The release of WCAG 2.0 has caused great expectation, as it is supposed to be precisely testable with automated review tools. Therefore, more effective tools could be developed. However, so far few tools applying WCAG 2.0 have been developed. This paper presents an evaluation framework which has been updated in order to evaluate the new tests. In addition, it describes a validation process carried out in order to verify the effectiveness of the new version of the evaluation tool. The effectiveness is validated by conducting a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results obtained by applying both versions of the tool (the one implementing WCAG 1.0 and the one implementing WCAG 2.0) to a set of selected web pages, as well as by manual evaluation of an expert for detecting the possible false positives and false negatives produced by each tool.", "paper_title": "Validating the effectiveness of EvalAccess when deploying WCAG 2.0 tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000300161700006"}
