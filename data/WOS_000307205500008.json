This disadvantage is addressed in this work using the penalty function method (PFM) to define all constraints of the system and to join elements to build box-type structures. Frequency parameters of non-symmetrical structures and buckling parameters of symmetric box-type structures are presented in this work. The use of positive and negative penalty parameters added to either the elastic stiffness matrix or to the mass matrix (matrices associated with the eigenvalue) is also investigated.
