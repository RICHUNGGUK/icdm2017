Current solutions widely exploit inter-domain shared memory mechanism to improve performance. Also the larger the shared memory buffer is, the higher the throughput and the less the latency. However, these solutions which use static fixed size shared memory, do not take memory utilization and the heterogeneous upper applications into consideration. In this paper, we have designed and implemented an adaptive shared memory mechanism for inter-domain communication, called AdaptIDC, adjusting the shared memory dynamically. With the help of completely independent in/out buffer design, the IOIHMD adjustment algorithm, the control ring and event channel reuse mechanism, AdaptIDC achieves superior shared memory utilization and yet does not sacrifice high performance between co-existing VMs. In the evaluation, we observe that AdaptIDC can greatly improve the shared memory utilization while performance draws near the fixed static shared page solution.
