This new method successfully reduces the growth of particle numbers from the numerical time scale to the physical time scale for Coulomb collisions. We also propose a particle resampling method which reduces the particle number to further improve the efficiency. Various numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
