To overcome this problem, many different possibilities of improving the accuracy of linguistic fuzzy modeling have been considered in the specialized literature. We will call these approaches as basic refinement approaches. In this work, we present a short study of how these basic approaches can be combined to obtain new hybrid approaches presenting a better trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. As an example of application of these kinds of systems, we analyze seven hybrid approaches to develop accurate and still interpretable fuzzy rule-based systems, which will be tested considering two real-world problems.", "paper_title": "Hybrid learning models to get the interpretability-accuracy trade-off in fuzzy modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000237123800002"}
