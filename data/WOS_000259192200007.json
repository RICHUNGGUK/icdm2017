SDPA promotes the deployment of a nomadic service directory, whose current location in the network varies according to the dynamics of service-discovery queries driven by the users' applications and partial knowledge of the network's topology. SDPA is based on a heuristic approach, whose performance is optimized by formulating the directory-placement problem as a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) solved by the means of a reinforcement-learning technique known as Q-Learning. Performance evaluations obtained through computer simulations of networks with up to 45 hosts moving at pedestrian speeds reveal average bandwidth savings close to 50 percent over a default broadcast/multicast approach for service discovery once an efficient directory-placement policy is obtained.", "paper_title": "A mobile-directory approach to service discovery in wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000259192200007"}
