Different approaches can be found in the literature, but we focus on those which respect the optimal throughput while minimizing the work in process. So, we recall methods of performance evaluation developed during the last 20 years. The last part is devoted to a new approach of cyclic scheduling using a Petri net. This method uses algebraic tools (dioids) developed for the study of marked graphs. In this way, the problem of the scheduling is progressively transformed into a problem of the search of solution(s) on a system of equations.", "paper_title": "Formal approach of FMS cyclic scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000243172400011"}
