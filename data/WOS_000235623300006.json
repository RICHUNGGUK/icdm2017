A closed-form Green's function for nonuniformly doped substrates is employed with the correct singular characteristics. A novel global surface impedance matrix scheme is introduced to efficiently model nonuniformly doped wells, channel stop implants, and buried layers. Layout, device, and netlist extractors are developed so as to integrate our boundary element method (BEM) solver with commercial layout and circuit simulation tools.", "paper_title": "An automated and efficient substrate noise analysis tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000235623300006"}
