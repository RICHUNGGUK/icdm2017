Based on the traffic characteristic analyzed from real network, we take both uplink and downlink traffic into account in network modeling. The analysis of network utility shows that it has a controllable upper bound. So this paper develops a scheme to maximize the upper bound of network utility. and then make network utility converge to the enhanced upper bound. Both channel assignment (CA) and power control (PC) are performed in each iteration. To illustrate the advantages of TDOCP, a compared algorithm One-Dimensional Optimization Integrating Channel Assignment and Power Control (ODOCP) is designed, which implements the least congested channel search (LCCS) in CA, and the power control for AP performance (PCAP) in PC. Only one-dimensional optimization is implemented in each iteration of ODOCP. Extensive simulations show that the network model in this paper is effective, and TDOCP outperforms current popular one-dimensional optimization algorithms LCCS, PCAP, and the compared ODOCP in the aspect of increasing throughput and reducing network delay.
