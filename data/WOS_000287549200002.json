Although the recognition of secondary structure elements as alpha helices and beta sheets seem straightforward but there are many different definitions, each regarding different criteria. We introduce a new algorithm for the protein secondary structure assignment based on a number of geometric parameters and by using the entropy. A sequence is partitioned to segments. Then the secondary structure elements are assigned to each of these segments. It is shown that if the entropy of a segment increases then the regularity in the structure decreases. So it is concluded that the concept of entropy could be used as a measure of regularity of the secondary structure.", "paper_title": "An Information Theoretic Approach to Secondary Structure Assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000287549200002"}
