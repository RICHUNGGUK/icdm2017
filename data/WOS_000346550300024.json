For such problems in integer-order systems, Lyapunov functions are usually constructed, whereas no specific Lyapunov functions exist in fractional-order cases. By employing inequalities such as Holder inequality, Gronwall inequalities and inequality scaling skills, some finite-time stability results are derived. For fractional delayed neural models of retarded-type with order 0< alpha <0.5 and 0.5 <= alpha< 1, sufficient conditions for the finite-time stability are presented. Numerical simulations also verify the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
