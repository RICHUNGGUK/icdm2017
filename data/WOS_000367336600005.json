Formalisations have been undertaken in a variety of systems, primarily focusing on well-studied (and challenging) properties such as the theory of process bisimulation. We present a formalisation in Agda that instead explores the theory of concurrent transitions, residuation, and causal equivalence of traces, which has not previously been formalised for the pi-calculus. Our formalisation employs de Bruijn indices and dependently-typed syntax, and aligns the \"proved transitions\" proposed by Boudol and Castellani in the context of CCS with the proof terms naturally present in Agda's representation of the labelled transition relation. Our main contributions are proofs of the \"diamond lemma\" for residuation of concurrent transitions and a formal definition of equivalence of traces up to permutation of transitions.", "paper_title": "Proof-relevant pi-calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000367336600005"}
