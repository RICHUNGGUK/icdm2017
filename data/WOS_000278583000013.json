The TRC technique requires single convolution integral in the formulation as in the recursive convolution (RC) method, while maintaining the accuracy comparable to the piecewise linear recursive convolution (PLRC) method with two convolution integrals. In this article, the numerical results indicate that the TRC-FDTD method not only improves accuracy over the RC-FDTD with the same computational efficiency but also spends less computational time than the PLRC-FDTD based on the same accuracy. The 3D TRC-FDTD formula is provided and the bistatic radar scattering sections of conductive targets covered with anisotropic magnetized plasma are calculated. The results show that magnetized plasma cover layer can greatly reduce echo energy of radar targets, and the anisotropic magnetized plasma cover has better absorption effect than nonmagnetized.
