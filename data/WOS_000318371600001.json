We give a particular succession rule, called jumping and marked succession rule, which describes the growth of such words according to their number of ones. Moreover, the problem of associating a word to a path in the generating tree obtained by the succession rule is solved by introducing an algorithm which constructs all binary words having more 1's than 0's and then kills those containing the forbidden patterns. Finally, we give the generating function of such words according to the number of ones.", "paper_title": "Avoiding cross-bifix-free binary words", "paper_id": "WOS:000318371600001"}
