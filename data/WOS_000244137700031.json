Being different from the classical FTC problems, the measured information is the stochastic distribution of the system output rather than its value. The control objective is to use the output PDFs to design control schemes that can compensate the fault and attenuate the disturbance. A multi-layer perception (MLP) neural network is applied to approximate the output PDFs, with which nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) can be used to reduce the model order. For the established continuous-time weighting system with disturbances and uncertainties which is used to link the input and the weights, an LMI-based feasible FTC method is presented to assure that the fault can be well measured and compensated, where the H., performance index for the uncertain error systems is optimized.
