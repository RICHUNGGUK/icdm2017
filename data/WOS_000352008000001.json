We believe that the papers presented in this special issue ought to serve as a reference for students, researchers, and industry practitioners interested in the evolving, interdisciplinary area of intelligent computing in large-scale systems. We very much hope that readers will find in this compendium new inspiration and ideas to enhance their own research.", "paper_title": "Intelligent computing in large-scale systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352008000001"}
