In the proposed AIT2FNN control system, an IT2FNN, which combines the merits of an interval type-2 fuzzy logic system and a neural network, is developed to approximate an unknown dynamic function. Moreover, adaptive learning algorithms are derived using the Lyapunov stability theorem to train the parameters of the IT2FNN online. Furthermore, a robust compensator is proposed to confront the uncertainties including the approximation error, optimal parameter vectors, and higher order terms in Taylor series. To relax the requirement for the value of lumped uncertainty in the robust compensator, an adaptive lumped uncertainty estimation law is also investigated. In addition, the circle and butterfly contours are planned using a nonuniform rational B-spline curve interpolator. The experimental. results show that the contour tracking performance of the proposed AIT2FNN is significantly improved compared with the adaptive type-1 FNN. Additionally, the robustness to parameter variations, external disturbances, cross-coupled interference, and frictional force can also be obtained using the proposed AIT2FNN.", "paper_title": "Robust Control of an LUSM-Based X-Y-theta Motion Control Stage Using an Adaptive Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000263225100003"}
