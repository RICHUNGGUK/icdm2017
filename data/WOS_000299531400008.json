The paper investigates this problem and proposes an improved floating-to-fixed-point conversion scheme. With a proper scaling factor and a new-established look-up table, the proposed fixed-point scheme can obtain bit-wise consistence to the floating-point realization. Experimental results verify the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Improved Floating-to-Fixed-Point Conversion Scheme for DCT Quantization Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400008"}
