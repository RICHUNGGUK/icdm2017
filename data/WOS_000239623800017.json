The specific objectives were to increase understanding of both paradigms, identifying which, if either, excels at a particular function, and to look for potential synergism amongst them. We study these paradigms through ten different aspects, with some indication of which one excels at this particular facet of performance. We point out how they are complementary and finishes with a recommendation for a new synergistic approach, followed by an example of an application of the new approach to tactical", "paper_title": "Tale of two context-based formalisms for representing human knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800017"}
