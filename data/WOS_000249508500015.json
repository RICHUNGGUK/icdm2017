Numerous approaches to image thresholding already exist in the literature. In this work, a reinforced threshold fusion for image binarization is introduced which aggregates existing thresholding techniques. The reinforcement agent learns the optimal weights for different thresholds and segments the image globally. A fuzzy reward function is employed to measure object similarities between the binarized image and the original gray-level image, and provide feedback to the agent. The experiments show that promising improvement can be obtained. Three well-established thresholding techniques are combined by the reinforcement agent and the results are compared using error measurements based on ground-truth images. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
