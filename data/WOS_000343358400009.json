Given is a bin of capacity B > 0, and a set I of items. Each item j is an element of I has a size s(j) > 0. A packed item must stay in the bin for a fixed common time interval. To accommodate additional items in the bin, each item j can be compressed to a given size p(j) is an element of[0, s(j)) for at most a fraction q(j) is an element of[0, 1) of the packing interval, during one continuous sub-interval. The goal is to pack in the bin, for the given time interval, a subset of items of maximum cardinality. PRI is a generalization of the well-known Knapsack problem, and it is strongly NP-hard already for highly restricted instances. Our main result is an approximation algorithm that packs, for any instance I of PRI, at least 2/3 OPT(I) - 2 items, where OPT(I) is the number of items packed in an optimal solution. Our algorithm yields a better performance ratio for instances in which the maximum compression time of an item is q(max) is an element of(0,1/2). For subclasses of instances arising in realistic scenarios, we give an algorithm that packs at least OPT(I) - 2 items. Finally, we show that a non-trivial subclass of instances admits an asymptotic fully polynomial time approximation scheme (AFPTAS). (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
