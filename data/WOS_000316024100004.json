The quantum gate technique is introduced for solving the pattern mismatch between the inputs stream and one-time-delay state feedback. A quantized back-propagation training algorithm with an adaptive dead zone scheme is developed for providing an optimal or suboptimal tradeoff between the convergence speed and the generalization performance. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the new real time learning algorithm is demonstrated by proving the quantum gate parameter convergence based on Lyapunov method. The numerical experiments are carried out to demonstrate the accuracy of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Quantized Neural Modeling: Hybrid Quantized Architecture in Elman Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316024100004"}
