The uplift capacity is formulated in terms of several inflecting variables. An experimental database obtained from the literature is employed to develop the models. Further, a conventional statistical analysis is performed to benchmark the proposed models. Sensitivity and parametric analyses are conducted to verify the results. TGP, LGP and GEP are found to be effective methods for evaluating the horizontal, vertical and inclined uplift capacity of suction caissons. The TGP, LGP and GEP models reach a prediction performance better than or comparable with the models found in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
