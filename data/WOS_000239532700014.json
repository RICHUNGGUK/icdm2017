NOR-based control schemes provide an alternative solution to problems such as propagation delay: This paper compares modified versions of these two popular pipelined systems. HSPICE simulation results show the two-phase pipelined system is still a reliable solution with a limited number of inputs even when the theoretically lower control overhead is disregarded. A power reduction of over 27% and a propagation improvement of more than 11% were achieved by replacing some decision circuits with modified C-elements.", "paper_title": "A brief comparison of two-phase and NOR-based four-phase pipelined asynchronous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239532700014"}
