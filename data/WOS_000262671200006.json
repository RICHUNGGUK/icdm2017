The minimum size N for which a CA(N; t, k, v) exists is called the covering array number and denoted by CAN(t, k, v). Covering arrays are used in experiments to screen for interactions among t-subsets of k components. One of the main problems on covering arrays is to construct a CA(N; t, k, v) for given parameters (t, k, v) so that N is as small as possible. In this paper, we present some constructions of covering arrays of strengths 3 and 4 via holey difference matrices with prescribed properties. As a consequence, some of known bounds on covering array number are improved. In particular, it is proved that (1) CAN(3, 5, 2v) <= 2v (2)(4v + 1) for any odd positive integer v with gcd(v, 9) not equal 3; (2) CAN(3, 6, 6p) <= 216p (3) + 42p (2) for any prime p > 5; and (3) CAN(4, 6, 2p) <= 16p (4) + 5p (3) for any prime p equivalent to 1 (mod 4) greater than 5.", "paper_title": "Covering arrays of strength 3 and 4 from holey difference matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000262671200006"}
