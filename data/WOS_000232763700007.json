Cosine function, dot product and proportion function are regular similarity measures of vector. But they are symmetric similarity measures, which cannot find out the subset copies. In this paper we present the concepts of asymmetric similarity model and heavy frequency vector (HFV). The former can detect subset copies well, and the latter can save a great resources and CPU time. We have developed two new asymmetric measures: heavy frequency vector (HFM) and Heavy inclusion proportion model HIPM. The HFM and HIPM are derived from cosine function and proportion function by combining asymmetric similarity concept with HFV. The HFV is to truncate the original full frequency vector to a short vector. We can adjust the parameter of HFV to balance the model's performance. The paper illustrates the aspects of asymmetric similarity and HFV models by several experiments.", "paper_title": "A fast document copy detection model", "paper_id": "WOS:000232763700007"}
