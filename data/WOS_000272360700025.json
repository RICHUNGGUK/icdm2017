The high accident rate of UAVs means that civilian use will come at a huge risk unless we design systems and protocols that can prevent UAV accidents, better train operators and augment pilot performance. This paper presents two methods for generating a chase view to the pilot for UAV operations in cluttered environments. The chase view gives the operator a virtual view from behind the UAV during flight. This is done by generating a virtual representation of the vehicle and surrounding environment while integrating it with the real-time onboard camera images. Method I presents a real-time mapping approach toward generating the surrounding environment and Method II uses a prior model of the operating environment. Experimental results are presented from tests where subjects flew in a H0 scale environment using a 6 DOF gantry system. Results showed that the chase view improved UAV operator performance over using the traditional onboard camera view.", "paper_title": "Development and Evaluation of a Chase View for UAV Operations in Cluttered Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000272360700025"}
