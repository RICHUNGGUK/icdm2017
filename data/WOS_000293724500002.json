The proposed framework combines two different energy-saving methods, one at the application layer, namely data aggregation, and one at the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer by appropriately adopting sleeping mechanisms. This is achieved by following a cross-layer approach where local information about the status of each sensor, including its sleep/awake schedules, feeds a subsequent data aggregation phase, which gathers correlated data and aggregates it to a single packet towards its way to the sink by applying a fully localised, distributed, probabilistic method. Simulation results demonstrate the significant energy savings achieved by our proposed framework, especially when compared to conventional MAC layer approaches and/or data aggregation approaches.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient framework for data gathering in wireless sensor networks via the combination of sleeping MAC and data aggregation strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000293724500002"}
