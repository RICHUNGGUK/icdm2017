In smart grid architecture, electricity suppliers can monitor, predicate, and control energy generation/consumption in real time. Users can know the current price of electrical energy and obtain energy management information from smart meters. It helps users reduce home's energy use. However, electricity consumptions of users may divulge the privacy information of users. Therefore, privacy of users and communication security of the smart grid become crucial security issues. This paper presents a secure power-usage data aggregation scheme for smart grid. Electricity suppliers can learn about the current power usage of each neighborhood to arrange energy supply and distribution without knowing the individual electricity consumption of each user. This is the first scheme against internal attackers, and it provides secure batch verification. Additionally, the security of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by formal proofs.", "paper_title": "Privacy-Enhanced Data Aggregation Scheme Against Internal Attackers in Smart Grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600065"}
