In particular, integrating podcasting, electronic learning (e-learning), and traditional face-to-face teaching into a blended learning (b-learning) environment can help create a push-pull educational exchange that increases student learning satisfaction. The authors' empirical study reveals that students generally feel a higher level of social presence and achieve better academic results if they're involved in the development of course podcasts. This research opens the door to the application of emerging Internet technologies to improve student learning.", "paper_title": "Podcasting: An Internet-Based Social Technology for Blended Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000277183900006"}
