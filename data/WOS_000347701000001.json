The parity cube is an important variant of the hypercube. It has many attractive features superior to those of the hypercube. In this paper, we prove that the complete binary tree with vertices can be embedded with dilation 1, congestion 1, load 1 into the -dimensional parity cube and expansion tending to 1. Furthermore, we provide an algorithm to construct the complete binary tree with vertices in , where denotes the number of vertices in and .", "paper_title": "Embedding complete binary trees into parity cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000347701000001"}
