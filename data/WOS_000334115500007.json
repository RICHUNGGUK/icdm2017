To protect the confidentiality of the transferred data, public-key cryptography has been introduced in data transfer schemes (DTSs). Unfortunately, there exist some drawbacks in the current DTSs. First, the sender must know who the real receivers are. This is undesirable in a system where the number of the users is very large, such as cloud computing. In practice, the sender only knows some descriptive attributes of the receivers. Secondly, the receiver cannot be guaranteed to only receive messages from the legal senders. Therefore, it remains an elusive and challenging research problem on how to design a DTS scheme where the sender can send messages to the unknown receivers and the receiver can filter out false messages according to the described attributes. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based data transfer with filtering (ABDTF) scheme to address these problems. In our proposed scheme, the receiver can publish an access structure so that only the users whose attributes satisfy this access structure can send messages to him. Furthermore, the sender can encrypt a message under a set of attributes such that only the users who hold these attributes can obtain the message. In particular, we provide an efficient filtering algorithm for the receiver to resist the denial-of-service attacks. Notably, we propose the formal definition and security models for ABDTF schemes. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that a provable ABDTF scheme is proposed. Hence, this work provides a new research approach to ABDTF schemes.", "paper_title": "Attribute-Based Data Transfer with Filtering Scheme in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000334115500007"}
