The monomials terms in eta(x) are sometimes referred to as \"main effect\" terms such as x (1), x (2), ..., or \"interactions\" such as x (1) x (2), x (1) x (3), ... Two theories are related in this paper. First, when the models are hierarchical, in a well-defined sense, there is an associated monomial ideal generated by monomials not in the model. Second, the so-called \"algebraic method in experimental design\" generates hierarchical models which are identifiable when observations are interpolated with eta(x) based at a finite set of points: the design. We study conditions under which ideals associated with hierarchical polynomial models have maximal Betti numbers in the sense of Bigatti (Commun Algebra 21(7):2317-2334, 1993). This can be achieved for certain models which also have minimal average degree in the design theory, namely \"corner cut models\".", "paper_title": "Betti numbers of polynomial hierarchical models for experimental designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000305229800006"}
