We show that the introduced challenging combinatorial optimization problem can be solved globally and exactly by means of convex relaxation. In this regard, we propose a novel coherent continuous max-flow model (CCMFM), which derives a new and efficient duality-based algorithm, leading to a GPU-based implementation to achieve high computational speeds. Experiments with 25 3-D TRUS images and 30 3-D T2w MR images from our dataset, and 50 3-D T2w MR images from a public dataset, demonstrate that the proposed approach can segment a 3-D prostate TRUS/MR image within 5-6 s including 4-5 s for initialization, yielding a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 93.2% +/- 2.0% for 3-D TRUS images and 88.5% +/- 3.5% for 3-D MR images. The proposed method also yields relatively low intra-and inter-observer variability introduced by user manual initialization, suggesting a high reproducibility, independent of observers.", "paper_title": "Prostate Segmentation: An Efficient Convex Optimization Approach With Axial Symmetry Using 3-D TRUS and MR Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000334667000014"}
