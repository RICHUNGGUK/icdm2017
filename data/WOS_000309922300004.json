Based on the manifold assumption, many graph-based algorithms were developed. Almost all methods follow the k-rule or epsilon-rule to construct a graph, and then focus on the algorithms based on the graph. However, the graph may not represent the local structure well, and it does not fully utilize the label information yet. The local structure can be presented by the local density and the distance between the samples and their neighbors. And the graph constructed by the guidance of label information will be better approximate of the relationship of the input data. In this paper, we propose an adaptive semi-supervised graph constructing method. The similarity is learned when constructing the graph. The advantages of the similarity learned by our method include: (1) The similarity is measured along the manifold by constructing a graph; (2) nearby points and points in the same cluster share high similarity; (3) samples from the same class have higher similarity than samples from different classes. Experimental results show that using the proposed similarity for classification task could get better recognition accuracy.", "paper_title": "SIMILARITY LEARNING BASED ON SEMI-SUPERVISED GRAPH FOR CLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300004"}
