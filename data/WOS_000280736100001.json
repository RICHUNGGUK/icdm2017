The complexity of such analytic formulations of the control law can grow exponentially with the prediction horizon. The suboptimal solutions offer a trade-off in terms of complexity and several approaches can be found in the literature for the construction of approximate MPC laws. In the present paper a piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov function is used for the stability verification of an of approximate explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC). A novel relaxation method is proposed for the LMI criteria on the Lyapunov function design. This relaxation is applicable to the design of PWQ Lyapunov functions for discrete-time piecewise affine systems in general.", "paper_title": "Piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions for stability verification of approximate explicit MPC", "paper_id": "WOS:000280736100001"}
