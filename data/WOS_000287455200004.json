As such negotiation involves rational decision making about options and issues. However, negotiation also involves social interaction and dilemmas as well as personal preferences and opinions. Negotiation is a multifaceted process in which affect plays a critical role, a role confirmed in recent empirical studies. In this position paper we first argue that affect is an important issue to consider when developing a negotiation support system. We do so by giving a strategic overview of some of the most important findings in the affect-cognition and affect-negotiation literature. Second, we show in a structured manner during which phases in the negotiation process what emotion-related concepts play a major role, as well as discuss more concrete affect-related support functions an affective negotiation support system could offer. Third, we analyze the feasibility of these functions by reviewing currently available affective computing technologies, such as affect measurement, emotion modeling, emotion expression, emotional reasoning, and emotional agents.", "paper_title": "Affective negotiation support systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000287455200004"}
