This algorithm is based on a simple partial differential equation and depends on a crucial fact: the dimension of the polynomial solution space G associated with this differential equation is equal to the number r of absolutely irreducible factors of J. However, this holds only when the characteristic of F is either zero or sufficiently large in terms of the degree off. In this paper we characterize a vector subspace of G for which the dimension is r, regardless of the characteristic of F, and the properties of Gao's construction hold. Moreover, we identify a second vector subspace of G that leads to an analogous theory for the rational factorization off. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
