In this study, a least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) model based on online hyperparameters optimization is proposed, where the variance of effective noise of the sample is estimated, while a conjugate gradient algorithm is developed to optimize the width of Gaussian kernels and the regularization factor. To assess the quality of the proposed method, we experiment with a test function affected by additive noise and an industrial gas flow data from Shanghai Baosteel Company Ltd. A series of comparative experiments are reported as well. The results demonstrate that the proposed method shows the shortest computing time while ensuring the prediction accuracy. These two features make the approach applicable to real-time prediction of gas flow in steel industry.", "paper_title": "Effective Noise Estimation-Based Online Prediction for Byproduct Gas System in Steel Industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400023"}
