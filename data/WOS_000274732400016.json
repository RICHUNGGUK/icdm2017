Clustering significantly reduces the energy consumption of individual sensors, but it also increases the communication burden on CHs. To investigate this tradeoff, our analytical model incorporates both intra- and intercluster traffic. Depending on whether location information is available or not, we consider optimization formulations under both deterministic and stochastic setups, using a Rayleigh fading model for intercluster communications. For the deterministic setup, sensor nodes and CHs are arbitrarily placed, but their locations are known. Each CH routes its traffic directly to the sink or relays it through other CHs. We present a coverage-time-optimal joint clustering/routing algorithm, in which the optimal clustering and routing parameters are computed using a linear program. For the stochastic setup, we consider a cone-like sensing region with uniformly distributed sensors and provide optimal power allocation strategies that guarantee (in a probabilistic sense) an upper bound on the end-to-end (inter-CH) path reliability. Two mechanisms are proposed for achieving balanced power consumption in the stochastic case: a routing-aware optimal cluster planning and a clustering-aware optimal random relay. For the first mechanism, the problem is formulated as a signomial optimization, which is efficiently solved using generalized geometric programming. For the second mechanism, we show that the problem is solvable in linear time. Numerical examples and simulations are used to validate our analysis and study the performance of the proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "Coverage-Time Optimization for Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks: A Power-Balancing Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000274732400016"}
