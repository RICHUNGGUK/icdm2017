As a consequence, we obtain that the topological closure of the collection of principal initial segments of a poset P is the Stone space of the Boolean algebra Tailalg(P) generated by the collection of principal final segments of P, the so-called tail-algebra of P. Similar results concerning Priestley spaces and distributive lattices are given. A generalization to incidence structures valued by abstract algebras is considered.", "paper_title": "Incidence structures and Stone-Priestley duality", "paper_id": "WOS:000248606400004"}
