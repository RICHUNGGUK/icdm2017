Informatics must respond to the challenges of providing the software needed for future embedded systems. In this case, software engineering will be integrated into systems engineering and, we expect, combined ultimately into a completely new discipline focused on the engineering of software-intensive systems.", "paper_title": "The 'Grand Challenge' in informatics: Engineering software-intensive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241162400017"}
