This paper mainly studies the scheduling problem in the two-stage hybrid flow shop, namely the proportionate scheduling. In such problem, it is assumed that each job has the same processing time in different stages. The objective of minimizing the makespan is considered. If there are two machines in the first stage and m machines in the second, then an approximation algorithm with worst case ratio no more than 3/2 is provided. If each stage consists of only two machines, we show that the tight bound of our algorithm can be reduced to 4/3. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
