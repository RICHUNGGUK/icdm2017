Given an example texture, the synthesis process starts with analyzing the texel (TEXture ELement) scale variations to obtain the perspective map (scale map). Feature mask and simple user-assisted scale extraction operations including slant and tilt angles assignment and scale value editing are applied. The scale map represents the global variations of the texel scales in the sample texture. Then, we extend 2D texture optimization techniques to synthesize these kinds of perspectively featured textures. The non-parametric texture optimization approach is integrated with histogram matching, which forces the global statics of the texel scale variations of the synthesized texture to match those of the example. We also demonstrate that our method is well-suited for image completion of a perspectively featured texture region in a digital photo.", "paper_title": "Perspective-aware texture analysis and synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257384800007"}
