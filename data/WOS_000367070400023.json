Security protocols mainly focus on saving energy through early filtering of attacks; however, this does not necessarily prolong the network lifetime. In order to save more energy and extend the network lifetime, the underlying routing is equally important. Security protocols such as commutative cipher en-route filtering (CCEF), which considers shortest path routing, do not take advantage of the opportunity to save more energy by considering an energy efficient underlying routing at the design level. In this paper, we propose pre-deterministic key-distribution based CCEF (PKCCEF), which extends the network life significantly through pre-deterministic and random distribution of the witness keys with a modified underlying routing that considers the residual energy. For high FTR, our method selects a path with more filtering nodes to be able to detect more attacks. This needs further verification for legitimate reports and needs more energy as compared to original method, but it can save energy by filtering fabricated or false report earlier. For low FTR, our method selects an energy efficient path with fewer verifications of legitimate reports. Independent of the number of attacks, our method extends the network lifetime as compared to the original method i.e. CCEF. Our method achieves energy efficiency without compromising the security of the original scheme. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the energy efficiency (up to 16.05 %) and extending the network lifetime (up to 84.01 %).", "paper_title": "Extending the network lifetime by pre-deterministic key distribution in CCEF in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000367070400023"}
