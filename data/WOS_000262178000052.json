This study therefore aims to apply a neural network system to predict fraud litigation for assisting accountants oil audit strategy making. The empirical results show that neural network provides not only a promising predicting accuracy, but also a better detecting power and a less misclassification cost comparing with that of a logit model and auditor judgments. This suggests that ail artificial intelligence technique is quite well in identifying a fraud-lawsuit presence. and hence could be a supportive tool for practitioners. Further, a remarkable finding related to the greater effects of management's capability oil fraud commitments acquires ail attentive investigation of ethic issues in emerging markets where contribute the most important force in the global economy nowadays.
