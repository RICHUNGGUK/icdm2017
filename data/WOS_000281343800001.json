Because of its inter-organizational nature, the study extended the theory of diffusion of innovation and developed an analytical model correlating relative advantage, complexity, organizational readiness, and supply chain integration with adoption intention. Retail chains in Taiwan were chosen for an empirical survey; 134 valid data sets were obtained and structural equation modeling was used to analyze our model. The results indicated that the four constructs were all significant in affecting RFID adoption, and supply chain integration produced an effect similar to that of conventional innovation. An indirect effect of it on organizational readiness was also found to be significant. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
