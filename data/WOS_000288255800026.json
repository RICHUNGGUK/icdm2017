It is known that two of them are equivalent to Turing machines. We propose here a direct simulation of one device by the other. Each computational step in one model is simulated in a constant number of computational steps in the other one while a translation via Turing machines squares the time complexity. We also discuss the possibility of constructing simulations that preserve not only complexity, but also the shape of the simulated network.", "paper_title": "Complexity-preserving simulations among three variants of accepting networks of evolutionary processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800026"}
