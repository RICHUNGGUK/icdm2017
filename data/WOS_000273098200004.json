This method is based on using minimum electromagnetic absorbing materials on the inner surface of the rooms. The positions of the absorbing materials are found optimally to produce a \"best\" performance for the shielding rooms. The ray-tracing method is used to predict the shielding effectiveness (SE) of the electromagnetic shielding rooms with apertures. The performance of the proposed method is verified by a comprehensive example. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
