The routing protocols in ad hoc networks face the challenge of establishing and maintaining multi-hop routes while complying with mobility, bandwidth limitation and power constraints. The already demanding problem of offering wireless communication in a MANET becomes more complicated in the case of real-time systems where the loss or late arrival of a single item of data can cause serious problems. In this article, we propose a real-time wireless protocol for MANET capable of timely delivery of data. Taking advantage of a cross-layer design, it includes a novel medium access control mechanism and routing algorithm based on the link-quality among the nodes belonging to the network. The protocol manages message priority and is capable of multi-hop communications. It has been conceived mainly to provide real-time wireless communication for small robot teams, making possible the sharing of information such as kinematics or laser data. The validity of the protocol is proven by an in-depth theoretical analysis of its real-time characteristics and performance and through a set of real-world experiments. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
