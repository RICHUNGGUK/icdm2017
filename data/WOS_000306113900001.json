First, the T-S FUBSD is established and based on the parallel distributed compensation method, the overall robust H-infinity fuzzy controller is proposed to globally stabilise the T-S FUBSD. Then, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the robust stabilisability of the overall fuzzy control system via linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical example is utilised to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "State-feedback stabilisation for fuzzy bilinear uncertain system with disturbance via fuzzy control approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000306113900001"}
