In the hydrodynamic limit, the model recovers the Navier-Stokes and the Stefan-Maxwell binary diffusion equations, satisfies the indifferentiability principle, and is thermodynamically consistent. The present model is able to simulate mixtures with different Schmidt numbers and with a large molecular weight ratio of the components. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
