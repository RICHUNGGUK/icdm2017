This paper introduces a general class of continuous multiobjective optimization test instances with arbitrary prescribed PS shapes, which could be used for studying the ability of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for dealing with complicated PS shapes. It also proposes a new version of MOEA/D based on differential evolution (DE), i.e., MOEA/D-DE, and compares the proposed algorithm with NSGA-II with the same reproduction operators on the test instances introduced in this paper. The experimental results indicate that MOEA/D could significantly outperform NSGA-II on these test instances. It suggests that decomposition based multiobjective evolutionary algorithms are very promising in dealing with complicated PS shapes.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective Optimization Problems With Complicated Pareto Sets, MOEA/D and NSGA-II", "paper_id": "WOS:000265091900006"}
