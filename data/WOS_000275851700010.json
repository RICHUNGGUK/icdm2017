Multiple scan trees, also known as a scan forest, greatly reduce test data volume and test application time in system-on-chip testing. However, previous research on scan tree synthesis rarely considered issues such as, routing length and output port limitation, and hence created scan trees with a large number of scan output ports and excessively long routing paths. The proposed algorithm provides a mechanism that effectively reduces test time and test data volume, and routing length under output port constraint. As a result, very few or no output compressors are required, which significantly reduces the hardware overhead.", "paper_title": "Multiple Scan Trees Synthesis for Test Time/Data and Routing Length Reduction Under Output Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000275851700010"}
