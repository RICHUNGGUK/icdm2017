The scheme is optimized for minimal dissipation and dispersion errors. High order accuracy is achieved with fewer stages than standard explicit Runge-Kutta schemes. The scheme is designed to be A-stable for highly stiff problems. Possible applications include wall-bounded flows with solid boundaries in the computational domain, and sound generation by reacting flows. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
