However it is not straightforward to simultaneously select important genes while modeling gene interactions. Some heuristic approaches have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we study a unified modeling approach based on the l(1) penalized likelihood estimation that can simultaneously select important genes and model gene interactions. We will illustrate its competitive performance through simulation studies and applications to public microarray data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
