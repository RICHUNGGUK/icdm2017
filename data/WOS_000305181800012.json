Our newly proposed transmitter circuit uses a charge-recycling technique for power-aware 3-D system integration. The cross-type daisy chain enables charge recycling and achieves power reduction without sacrificing communication performance such as a high timing margin, low bit error rate and high bandwidth. There are two design issues in the cross-type daisy chain: pulse amplitude reduction and another is inter-channel skew. To compensate for these issues, an inductor design and a replica circuit are proposed and investigated. Test chips were designed and fabricated in 90-nm CMOS to verify the validity of the proposed transmitter. Measurements revealed that the proposed cross-type daisy chain transmitter achieved an energy efficiency of 65 fJ/bit without degrading the timing margin, data rate, or bit error rate. In order to investigate the compatibility of the transmitter with technology scaling, a simulation of each technology node was performed. The simulation results indicate that the energy dissipation can be potentially reduced to less than 10 fJ/bit in 22 nm CMOS with proposed cross-type daisy chain.", "paper_title": "A 65fJ/b Inter-Chip Inductive-Coupling Data Transceivers Using Charge-Recycling Technique for Low-Power Inter-Chip Communication in 3-D System Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800012"}
