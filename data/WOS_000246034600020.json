The algorithm is based on a combination of several simple predictors. If the sequence is a realization of an unbounded stationary and ergodic random process then the average of squared errors converges, almost surely, to that of the optimum, given by the Bayes predictor. An analog result is offered for the classification of binary processes.", "paper_title": "Sequential prediction of unbounded stationary time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600020"}
