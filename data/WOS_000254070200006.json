The task of the learning controllers is to generate a sequence of upgraded control inputs iteratively to take responsibility for sequential step function-type control decisions, each of which is determined by the steady-state optimisation layer and then imposed on the real system for feedback information. In the learning control scheme, the learning gains are designated to be time-varying which are adjusted by virtue of expertise experiences-based IF-THEN rules, and the magnitudes of the learning control inputs are amplified by the sequential step function-type control decisions. The aim of learning schemes is to further effectively improve the transient performance. The convergence of the updating laws is deduced in the sense of Lebesgue 1-norm by taking advantage of the Hausdorff-Young inequality of convolution integral and the Hoelder inequality of Lebesgue norm. Numerical simulations manifest that both the open-loop and the closed-loop time-varying learning gain-based schemes can effectively decrease the overshoot, accelerate the rising speed and shorten the settling time, etc.", "paper_title": "Iterative learning controllers with time-varying gains for large-scale industrial processes to track trajectories with different magnitudes", "paper_id": "WOS:000254070200006"}
