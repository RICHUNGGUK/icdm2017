In some situations, however, an actual signer may possibly want to expose himself, for instance, if doing so, he will acquire an enormous benefit. In this paper, we present a Schnorr ring signature scheme with designated revocability, providing a confirmation procedure, in which the real signer is able to convince a designated party that he is the one who generates the signature. The confirming proof is non-transferable, which only can be triggered by the signer. Meanwhile, the scheme satisfies unconditional anonymity, and has been proven to be existentially unforgeable under adaptive-chosen message attack in the random oracle.", "paper_title": "SCHNORR RING SIGNATURE SCHEME WITH DESIGNATED REVOCABILITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578000015"}
