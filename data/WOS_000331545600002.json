Since the chaotic motion is pseudorandomness and chaotic sequences are sensitive to the initial conditions, the search ability of COA is usually effected by the starting values. Considering this weakness, parallel chaos optimization algorithm( PCOA) is studied in this paper. To obtain optimum solution accurately, harmony search algorithm (HSA) is integrated with PCOA to form a novel hybrid algorithm. Different chaotic maps are compared and the impacts of parallel parameter on the hybrid algorithm are discussed. Several simulation results are used to show the effective performance of the proposed hybrid algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.
