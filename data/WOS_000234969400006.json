This approach is based upon a latent variable model structure, HLV (standing for heteroscedastic latent variable model), that explicitly integrates information regarding data uncertainty. Moderate amounts of missing data can also be handled in a coherent and fully integrated way through HLV. Several examples show the added value achieved under noisy conditions by adopting such an approach and a case study illustrates its application to a real industrial context of pulp and paper product quality data analysis.
