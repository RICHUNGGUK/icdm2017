Communication resources often become a bottleneck in service provisioning for many cloud applications. Therefore, data replication which brings data (e.g., databases) closer to data consumers (e.g., cloud applications) is seen as a promising solution. It allows minimizing network delays and bandwidth usage. In this paper we study data replication in cloud computing data centers. Unlike other approaches available in the literature, we consider both energy efficiency and bandwidth consumption of the system. This is in addition to the improved quality of service QoS obtained as a result of the reduced communication delays. The evaluation results, obtained from both mathematical model and extensive simulations, help to unveil performance and energy efficiency tradeoffs as well as guide the design of future data replication solutions.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient data replication in cloud computing datacenters", "paper_id": "WOS:000350395500033"}
