External signals are used to perform quantum logical gates and recombination mechanisms are suitably modelled in order to demonstrate quantum information processing. The physical mechanism which performs the logical equivalent of the Controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is presented along with a mechanism obtaining an output with a similar statistical behaviour with the Hadamard Gate. The computational basis was checked for errors when used for solving a quantum algorithm. Hence, using suitable simulation on a silicon structure, the computational errors that degrade the quantum information processing are considered and computed. These error results are found to be fairly small.
