A Pareto optimization model, combining a NSGA-II-based optimization process with an effective production process simulator, is developed to handle this problem. In the NSGA-II-based optimization process, a novel chromosome representation and modified genetic operators are presented while a heuristic pruning and final selection decision-making process is developed to select the final order scheduling solution from a set of Pareto optimal solutions. The production process simulator is developed to simulate the production process in the complicated production environment. Experiments based on industrial data are conducted to validate the proposed optimization model. Results show that the proposed model can effectively solve the order scheduling problem by generating Pareto optimal solutions which are superior to industrial solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
