Methods: We improved our time-frequency approach of classification of motor imagery (MI) tasks for BCI applications. The approach consists of Laplacian filtering, band-pass filtering and classification by correlation of time-frequency-spatial patterns. Results and Conclusions: Through off-line analysis of data collected during a \"cursor control\" experiment, we evaluated the capability of our new method to reveal major features of the EEG control for enhancement of MI classification accuracy. The pilot results in a human subject are promising, with an accuracy rate of 96.1%.", "paper_title": "Enhancement of classification accuracy of a time-frequency approach for an EEG-based brain-computer interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000244967200014"}
