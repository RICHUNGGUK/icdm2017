[2005]. Despite the local nature of the Eulerian property, it turns out to be significantly harder to test than other properties studied in the orientation model. We show a nonconstant lower bound on the query complexity of 2-sided tests and a linear lower bound on the query complexity of 1-sided tests for this property. On the positive side, we give several 1-sided and 2-sided tests, including a sublinear query complexity 2-sided test, for general graphs. For special classes of graphs, including bounded-degree graphs and expander graphs, we provide improved results. In particular, we give a 2-sided test with constant query complexity for dense graphs, as well as for expander graphs with a constant expansion parameter.", "paper_title": "On the Query Complexity of Testing Orientations for Being Eulerian", "paper_id": "WOS:000304065800007"}
