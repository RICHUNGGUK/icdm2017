Design/methodology/approach - The induction motor (IM) is simulated according to the adopted control strategy. This allows use of only magnetostatic simulation for both no-load and under-load simulations. Findings - The procedure allows the analysis of the performance of the IM drive taking into account iron saturation in all operation points. Originality/value - The entire system design is considered in the paper, both the electrical machine and the control strategy.", "paper_title": "Finite element modeling of induction motor for variable speed drives", "paper_id": "WOS:000283623400010"}
