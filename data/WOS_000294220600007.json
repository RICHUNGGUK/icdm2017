For the sake of accuracy, the spatial derivative terms in the equations of motion for an incompressible fluid flow are approximated by the coupled compact scheme. For accurately predicting the modified level set function, the dispersion-relation-preserving advection scheme is developed to preserve the theoretical dispersion relation for the first-order derivative terms shown in the pure advection equation cast in conservative form. For the purpose of retaining its long-time accurate Casimir functionals and Hamiltonian in the transport equation for the level set function, the time derivative term is discretized by the sixth-order accurate symplectic Runge-Kutta scheme. To resolve contact discontinuity oscillations near interface, nonlinear compression flux term and artificial damping term are properly added to the second-step equation of the modified level set method. For the verification of the proposed dispersion-relation-preserving scheme applied in non-staggered grids for solving the incompressible flow equations, three benchmark problems have been chosen in this study. The conservative level set method with area-preserving property proposed for capturing the interface in incompressible fluid flows is also verified by solving the dambreak, Rayleigh-Taylor instability, bubble rising in water, and droplet falling in water problems. Good agreements with the referenced solutions are demonstrated in all the investigated problems.
