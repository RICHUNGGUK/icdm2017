However, they do not provide much coding gain. For a given spacetime block code, we combine several component codes in conjunction with set partitioning of the expanded signal constellation according to the coding gain distance (CGD) criterion. By providing proper interlevel coding between adjacent blocks, we can design an orthogonal spacetime block code with high rate, large coding gain, and low decoding complexity. The error performance of an example code is compared with some codes in computer simulation. These codes are compared based on the situation of the same transmission rate, space diversity order, and state complexity of decoding trellis.
