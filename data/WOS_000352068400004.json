Most existing algorithms are pixel based, which construct a statistical model from image features. However, in these algorithms, the frequency component is not sufficiently addressed. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm that utilizes compressed sensing (CS) in frequency domain to reconstruct corrupted images. In order to reconstruct image, we first decompose the image into two functions with different basic characteristics - structure component and textual component. We seek a sparse representation for the functions and use the DCT coefficients of this representation to generate an over-complete dictionary. Experimental results on real world datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our method in image inpainting. We compare our method with three state-of-the-art inpainting algorithms and demonstrate its advantages in terms of both quantitative and qualitative aspects.", "paper_title": "Image decomposing for inpainting using compressed sensing in DCT domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000352068400004"}
