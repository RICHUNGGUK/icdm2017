Key concepts of the Balance Theory are reviewed. The work system model and associated design principles are described. Originally, the Balance Theory emphasized the impact of work on job stress; other worker outcomes were later described such as job satisfaction, and worker health, safety, and well-being. In conclusion, the article describes four emerging areas of application of the Balance Theory: (a) impact of the work system on worker performance, (b) multilevel analysis of the work system, (c) understanding the nonwork sphere, and (d) application to health care and patient safety, also known as the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety model of work system and patient safety.", "paper_title": "The Balance Theory and the Work System Model ...
