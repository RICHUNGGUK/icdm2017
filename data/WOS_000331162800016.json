The data are often combined from various sources and interchanged between different systems. There is, however, no harmonized and widely used data interchange format. In addition, food consumption data are often combined with other data such as food composition data. In the field of food composition, successful harmonization has recently been achieved by the European Food Information Resource Network, which is now the basis of a standard draft by the European Committee for Standardization. We present an XML-based data interchange format for food consumption based on work and experiences related to food composition. The aim is that the data interchange format will provide a basis for wider harmonization in the future. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
