Additionally, changing product specifications and environmental regulations will continue to affect the processing parameters that influence surface appearance and quality. Therefore, it is vital to develop robust methods to monitor surface quality on-line and continuously examine the processes that significantly affect surface appearance in real-time. As a critical step, this paper presents a cost-effective machine vision system design that utilizes surface reflectance models as a rational basis. Experimental and numerical investigations of diffuse angle images of specular coated surfaces confirm that these images yield a three-dimensional characterization of surface defects, efficiently, from a single image.
