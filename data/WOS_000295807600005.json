However, exceptional or non-routine tasks require the intervention of domain experts or generation of the situation specific resolution process. This paper assumes that sufficient amount of business process exception handling cases are stored in the process repository. Since the retrieval of the best exception handling process requires good understanding about the exceptional situation, context awareness is an important issue. To facilitate the representation of the exceptional situation and to enable the selection of the best exception handling process, we adopted the 'situation variable' and 'decision variable' construct. A case example for exception handling in the e-commerce delivery process is provided to illustrate how the proposed construct works. We applied the C5.0 algorithm to build the optimum search tree.", "paper_title": "SEARCH TREE GENERATION FOR THE EXCEPTION HANDLING OF E-COMMERCE DELIVERY PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000295807600005"}
