Various properties of the proposed distribution are discussed. The estimation of the parameters attained by the EM algorithm and their asymptotic variances and covariances are obtained. In order to assess the accuracy of the approximation of variances and covariances of the maximum likelihood estimators, simulation studies are performed and experimental results are illustrated based on real data sets.
