It implements an abstraction based model-checking approach proposed in the earlier work of the authors. The tool constructs a weighted graph abstracting the polyhedral hybrid system, and analyzes the graph to infer stability. In the case that the hybrid system is unstable, it also returns an abstract counterexample in the weighted graph indicating a potential reason for failure.", "paper_title": "AVERIST: An Algorithmic Verifier for Stability", "paper_id": "WOS:000365196900013"}
