The fundamental approach of SDWS consists of the integration of a set of ontological models for the representation of different Web service description languages and models. The main contributions of this proposal are (i) a general ontological model for the representation of Web services, (ii) a set of language-specific ontological models for the representation of different Web service descriptions implementations, and (iii) a set of software modules that automatically parse Web service descriptions and produce their respective ontological representation. The design of the generic service model incorporates the common elements that all service descriptions share: a service name, a set of operations, and input and output parameters; together with other important elements that semantic models define: preconditions and effects. Experimental results show that the automatic generation of semantic descriptions from public Web services is feasible and represents an important step towards the integration of a general semantic service registry.", "paper_title": "SDWS: Semantic Description of Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000343387200001"}
