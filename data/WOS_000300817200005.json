The algorithm utilizes the recently introduced MeanNN estimator for differential entropy. We show that the estimator is an appropriate tool for the dimensionality reduction task. Next we provide a nonlinear regression algorithm based on the proposed dimensionality reduction approach. The regression algorithm achieves comparable to state-of-the-art performance on the standard data sets but is three orders of magnitude faster. In addition we describe applications of the proposed dimensionality reduction algorithm to reduced-complexity supervised and semisupervised classification tasks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
