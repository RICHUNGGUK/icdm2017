Running multiple threads in multicore systems poses challenges on meeting limited shared resources, such as memory bandwidth. We propose an optimization approach that includes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) optimization model and a scheme to dynamically determine thread-to-core assignment. We present simulation analysis that shows energy savings and performance gains for a variety of workloads compared to state-of-the-art schemes. We implemented and evaluated a prototype of our thread assignment approach at user level, leveraging Linux scheduling and performance-monitoring capabilities.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Thread Assignment Optimization for Heterogeneous Multicore Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000349302200015"}
