The key idea of SCUBA is to group moving objects and queries based on common spatio-temporal properties at run-time into moving clusters to optimize query execution and thus facilitate scalability. SCUBA exploits shared cluster-based execution by abstracting the evaluation of a set of spatio-temporal queries as a spatial join first between moving clusters. This cluster-based filtering prunes true negatives. Then the execution proceeds with a fine-grained within-moving-cluster join process for all pairs of moving clusters identified as potentially joinable by a positive cluster-join match. A moving cluster can serve as an approximation of the location of its members. We show how moving clusters can serve as means for intelligent load shedding of spatio-temporal data to avoid performance degradation with minimal harm to result quality. Our experiments on real datasets demonstrate that SCUBA can achieve a substantial improvement when executing continuous queries on spatio-temporal data streams.", "paper_title": "SCUBA: Scalable cluster-based algorithm for evaluating continuous spatio-temporal queries on moving objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000237081600058"}
