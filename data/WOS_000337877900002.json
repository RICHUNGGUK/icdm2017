In this paper, we propose a method called DiGB (Directed-contention-Graph-based Backlog bound derivation) to analyze worst-case backlog bounds. For primitive scenarios, we propose analytical models for backlog bound derivation. For complex scenarios, we first construct a directed-contention-graph (DCG) to analyze the relationships among traffic flows. Then, we use the Breadth-First-Search strategy to traverse the DCG so that complex scenarios can be divided into primitive scenarios. Finally we compute the worst-case backlog bounds of each router. To illustrate this method, we present the derivation of closed-form formulas to compute the worst-case backlog bounds under all-to-one gather communication. The experimental results show that our method can achieve correct and tight worst-case backlog bounds. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
