By constructing bandwidth-guaranteed topology graph, we present a mathematical formulation to account for the complex relationships among the effect of network interference, link capacity and flow conservation. Further, a nested optimization strategy is proposed to solve the complicated problem, including a genetic approach for channel allocation, a genetic approach for route scheduling and an optimal path selection algorithm to find maximum bandwidth path. In order to ensure the individual validity and fast convergence, both the combination and sequence-based encoding rules are designed with appropriate constraint control mechanisms. Extensive simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
