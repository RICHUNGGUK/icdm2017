This paper describes an ontology-based context model and a related context management system providing a configurable and extensible service-oriented framework to ease the development of applications for monitoring and handling patient chronic conditions. The system has been developed in a prototypal version, and integrated with a service platform for supporting operators of home-based care networks in cooperating and sharing patient-related information and coordinating mutual interventions for handling critical and alarm situations. Finally, we discuss experimentation results and possible further research directions.", "paper_title": "An Ontology-Based System for Context-Aware and Configurable Services to Support Home-Based Continuous Care", "paper_id": "WOS:000288082200018"}
