Based on the time-dependent Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach, which makes full use of the available information about the actual sampling pattern, a sufficient condition is established to guarantee the sampled-data systems to be exponentially stable and strictly (Q, S, R)-gamma-dissipative. Based on the criterion, a design algorithm for the desired sampled-data controller is proposed. The effectiveness and benefits of the results developed in this paper is demonstrated by a controller design for a truck-trailer system.", "paper_title": "Dissipativity-Based Sampled-Data Fuzzy Control Design and its Application to Truck-Trailer System", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800024"}
