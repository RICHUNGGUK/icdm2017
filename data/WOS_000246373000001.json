In accordance with latter conceptual and methodological advances in academic rankings approaches, five selection criteria are defined and four international university rankings are selected. A comparative analysis of the four rankings is presented taking into account both the indicators frequency and its weights. Results show that, although some indicators differ considerably across selected rankings and even many indicators are unique, indicators referred to research and scientific productivity from university academic staff have a prominent role across all approaches. The implications of obtained data for main rankings consumers are discussed.", "paper_title": "Comparative study of international academic rankings of universities", "paper_id": "WOS:000246373000001"}
