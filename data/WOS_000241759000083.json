In this paper, a new MOEA based on objective space divided named SDMOGA is proposed. SDMOGA transforms the Pareto ranking into the sum of interval index ranking among individuals in objective space divided, and uses a method of individual crowding operator similar to adaptive grid to keep population diversity. Experimental results on four nicely balance functions show that SDMOGA has high efficiency, low run-time complexity and good convergence.", "paper_title": "SDMOGA: A new multi-objective genetic algorithm based on objective space divided", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000083"}
