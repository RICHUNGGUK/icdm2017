They have covering radius rho equal to 3 or 4 , and are 1/2(i)th parts, for i epsilon{1, ... ,u} of binary (respectively, extended binary) Hamming codes of length n=2(m) -1 (respectively, 2(m) ), where m=2u . In the usual way, i.e., as coset graphs, infinite families of embedded distance-regular coset graphs of diameter D equal to 3 or 4 are constructed. In some cases, the constructed codes are also completely transitive codes and the corresponding coset graphs are distance-transitive.", "paper_title": "FAMILIES OF NESTED COMPLETELY REGULAR CODES AND DISTANCE-REGULAR GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000354031100007"}
