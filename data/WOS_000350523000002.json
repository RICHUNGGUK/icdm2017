Moreover, solutions can indicate the splitting of connections into two or more sub-streams by multipath routing and fine-tuned by traffic grooming to utilize network resources better. Algorithms are proposed and the results of simulations using a variety of realistic scenarios indicate that the proposed algorithms significantly reduce the blocking of connection requests yet promote a fair distribution of the network resources in relation to the state-of-the-art solutions.
