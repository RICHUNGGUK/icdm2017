The system is subject to both holonomic and nonholonomic constraints. An adaptive recurrent neural network controller is proposed to deal with the unmodelled system dynamics. The proposed control strategy guarantees that the system motion asymptotically converges to the desired manifold while the constraint force remains bounded. In addition, an adaptive method is proposed to identify the contact surface. Simulation studies are carried out to verify the validation of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Adaptive recurrent neural network control of uncertain constrained nonholonomic mobile manipulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000324673600005"}
