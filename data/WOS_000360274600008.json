The framework features the following components: (i) in vitro environment, where model parameters can be obtained and new setups can be tested; (ii) in silica environment, including a simulation module for representing relevant physical or biological processes, and an optimization module, for calculating improved in vitro or in vivo outcomes; (iii) in vivo environment, from which organ and patient-specific parameters are collected and which can also implement personalized suggestions for improved outcomes. Two applications in the area of healthy and diseased blood are thoroughly discussed to exemplify the framework's characteristics. We discuss progress in the different areas and the way in which they are connected and finally propose a hybrid in vitro/in silico/in vivo platform. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
