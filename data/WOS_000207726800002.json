The availability of connectivity such as DSL or leased lines is scarce. In order to keep operational costs low, these rural telecom networks are often kept unmanned and are managed from a centralized network management station (NMS). This often requires a low-cost, efficient and reliable data communication network (DCN) between the rural telecom equipment and the central NMS. The conventional DCN used for telecom management consists either of leased lines or Internet connectivity. These are often costly and not freely available in rural areas. We have developed a new DCN model, based on dial-up, which is easily available. Using mathematical models and measurements we show that this DCN meets the QoS requirements of a telecom network at an affordable cost. We have implemented this DCN in corDECT networks. This is in use in India and Tunisia, and is under implementation in other similar countries.
