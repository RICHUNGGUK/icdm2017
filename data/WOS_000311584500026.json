The new proposal is motivated by the conflict between bidder anonymity and DOS (denial-of-service) attack from insider. It utilizes an efficient LPN-based authentication method to accomplish lightweight authentication. In order to share the determination process data, the market constructs a simple interpolating polynomial to those suppliers who participated in this auction. Sharing the determination process data can totally avoid collusion between a customer and a certain supplier and achieve public verifiability. Also, the proposed scheme relaxes the trust assumptions for three-party. According to comparison and analysis with other protocols, the proposed protocol requires less computation cost.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT SEALED-BID AUCTION PROTOCOL WITH BID PRIVACY AND BIDDER PRIVACY", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500026"}
