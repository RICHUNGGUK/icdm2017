Production and development of this equipment relied on the construction of its software. This software was shaped by practices, ideas, and ideals appropriated from the computer industry and computer science as much as by concerns and constraints within the telecommunications industry.", "paper_title": "When Switches Became Programs: Programming Languages and Telecommunications, 1965-1980", "paper_id": "WOS:000346320000004"}
