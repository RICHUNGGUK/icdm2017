Most existing pairing tools, such as the relative gain array (RGA) method, have shortcomings both in measuring interaction and in integrity issues. To evaluate the overall interaction among loops, we propose a statistics-based criterion via enumerating all possible combinations of loop statuses. Furthermore, we quantify the traditional concept of integrity to represent the extent of integrity of a decentralized control system. Thus, we propose that a pairing decision should be made by taking both factors into consideration. Two examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.", "paper_title": "New loop pairing criterion based on interaction and integrity considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000277763000007"}
