It is shown that, for nondegenerate functionals and stochastic processes, it is impossible to achieve consistent estimation with bounded memory. In the positive direction, we show that O(log(1/epsilon)) states suffice to achieve epsilon-consistent estimation for a natural class of functionals. A canonical optimal construction is conjectured for arbitrary statistical functionals.", "paper_title": "Statistical estimation with bounded memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000305963700013"}
