Several approaches have been undertaken to see under which conditions an exact factorization can be obtained with set functions that are not sigma-additive (for instance finitely additive set functions or submeasures). We provide a Radon-Nikodym type theorem with respect to a measure for almost subadditive set functions with bounded disjoint variation. The necessary and sufficient condition to guarantee a superior Radon-Nikodym derivative remains the standard domination condition for measures. We show how these set functions admit an equivalent factorization under the standard domination condition for set functions.", "paper_title": "A SUPER RADON-NIKODYM DERIVATIVE FOR ALMOST SUBADDITIVE SET FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320617600002"}
