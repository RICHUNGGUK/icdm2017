Given a set of gene trees, the MINIMUM DUPLICATION problem asks for a species tree that induces the minimum number of gene duplications in the input gene trees. Recently, a variant of the MINIMUM DUPLICATION problem, called MINIMUM DUPLICATION BIPARTITE, has been introduced, where the goal is to find all pre-duplications, that is duplications that in the evolution precede the first speciation with respect to a species tree. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of both MINIMUM DUPLICATION and MINIMUM DUPLICATION BIPARTITE. First of all, we prove that the MINIMUM DUPLICATION problem is APX-hard, even when the input consists of five uniquely leaf-labeled gene trees (improving upon known results on the complexity of the problem). Then, we show that the MINIMUM DUPLICATION BIPARTITE problem can be solved efficiently with a randomized algorithm when the input gene trees have bounded depth.
