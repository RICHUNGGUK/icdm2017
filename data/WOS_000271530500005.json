Applying Birkhoff's theorem, we prove that an arbitrary element of S(pq) can be decomposed into a product of three permutations, the first and the third being elements of the Young subgroup S(p)(q), whereas the second one is an element of the dual Young subgroup S(p)(q). This leads to synthesis methods for arbitrary multiple-valued reversible logic circuits of logic width w. These circuits indeed form a group isomorphic to Sr(w), where r is the radix of the multiple-valued logic. A particularly efficient decomposition is found by choosing p = r and thus q = r(w-1). As a result, an arbitrary reversible logic circuit of radix r and width w is decomposed into a cascade of 2w - 1 control gates, i.e. logic building blocks, which manipulate only one of the w dits.", "paper_title": "Multiple-Valued Reversible Logic Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000271530500005"}
