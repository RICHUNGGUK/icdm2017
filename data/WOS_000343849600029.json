This compound, validated through time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer and fluorescence polarization biological assays, provides the basis for lead optimization and structureactivity relationship analysis of a new series of non-LBP AR antagonists. Induced-fit docking and molecular dynamics studies have been performed to establish a consistent hypothesis for the interaction of the new active molecule on the AR surface.", "paper_title": "Molecular Topology Applied to the Discovery of 1-Benzyl-2-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxy-3-(3-phenylpropanoyl)-2H-pyrrole-5-one as a Non-Ligand-Binding-Pocket Antiandrogen", "paper_id": "WOS:000343849600029"}
