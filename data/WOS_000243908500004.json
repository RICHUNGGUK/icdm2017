By representing masks in factored form, we are able to easily satisfy a semidefiniteness constraint. Moreover, this representation allows us to restrict the rank of the mask as a means for attempting to practically incorporate second-order information.", "paper_title": "Solving maximum-entropy sampling problems using factored masks", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500004"}
