The macroscopic plastic deformation is generated by frictional sliding of weakness planes. The evolution of damage is related to growth of such weakness planes. The local frictional sliding in each family of weakness planes is described by a non-associated plastic model taking into account material softening and volumetric dilatancy. The damage evolution is coupled with plastic deformation and modelled by an isotropic damage criterion. The proposed model is applied to modelling mechanical responses of typical sandstone under different loading paths. There is good agreement between numerical predictions and experimental data. Further, the anisotropic distributions of plastic deformation and induced damage are analysed and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
