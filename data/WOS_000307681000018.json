Hence, aimed at farmers advising, the simulation model DEPIVOT has been developed with the objective of design new systems or changes in systems in operation. The software consists of a simulation package developed in Visual Basic and data base in Access. The model comprises five main sub-models for: (a) computation of the gross irrigation requirements; (b) sizing of the lateral pipe spans through the hydraulics computation of the friction losses and respective operative simulation considering to the effects of topography and the possible requirements of an end gun; (c) selecting a sprinklers package with computation of pressure and discharge at each outlet and including the consideration of pressure regulators; (d) verification of the sprinklers package through estimation of runoff potential by comparing application and infiltration rates at selected locations along the lateral; and (e) estimating the expected uniformity performance indicators when in operation. The user verifies if performance is within target values set at start and may develop and compare alternative sprinkler packages until appropriate conditions are obtained. When the model is used for evaluation of systems under operation using data collected in farmers' fields performance indicators are computed and, responding to farmers' needs, the model may be used to design changes in the existing systems and to improve management. This paper describes the model and shows examples of applications to select a sprinkler package and assess the respective runoff potential. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
