The spline wavelets based texture features, mean and standard deviation of the magnitudes of the subband coefficients in the wavelet frame decomposition, are proposed for image retrieval. The experiments are performed on a database of 1792 texture images to check the retrieval performance. We also perform feature selection and further compare the performances of several wavelets based features. The detailed comparison results indicate that the new method is superior to the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Spline wavelets based texture features for image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000242255400013"}
