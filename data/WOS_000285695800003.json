In this paper, we study the fundamental properties of distributed actuator and sensor networks (DASNs) in detecting and localizing obstacles. A novel notion of \"exposure\" is defined, which quantifies the dimension limitations in detectability. Using simple geometric constructs, we propose polynomial-time algorithms to compute the exposure and bounding regions where the center of the obstacles may lie.", "paper_title": "Obstacle Discovery in Distributed Actuator and Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285695800003"}
