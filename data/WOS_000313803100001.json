Concrete is represented by a gradient-enhanced continuum damage model with strain-softening and reinforcement is modeled as elastic bars that are embedded into the concrete domain. Adjoint sensitivity analysis is derived in complete consistency with respect to path-dependency and the nonlocal model. Classical truss topology optimization based on the ground structure approach is applied to determine the optimal topology and cross-sections of the reinforcement bars. This approach facilitates a fully digital work flow that can be highly effective, especially for the design of complex structures. Several test cases involving two- and three-dimensional concrete structures illustrate the capabilities of the proposed procedure.", "paper_title": "Reinforcement layout design for concrete structures based on continuum damage and truss topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000313803100001"}
