This is used for three-phase induction motor (IM) on nominal load. An additional purpose is verification empiric expressions of the heat transfer and equivalent thermal conductivity coefficients for external faces and air zones in analysed motor taken from literature. Design/methodology/approach - The numerical investigations proposed in this paper are based on 3D finite element models for thermal and electromagnetic fields analysis. Electromagnetic analysis includes iron core losses. It gives additional heat sources to thermal analysis. Heat transfer and equivalent thermal conductivity coefficients are assessed applying empiric expressions. Thermal model is experimentally validated. Findings - The results of calculations and experimental test shows that heat transfer coefficient for external zones taken from literature does not guarantee the equal accuracy of the distribution of the temperature in all volume of the machine. Research limitations/implications - Taken from literature, empirical equations do not give correct values of heat transfer coefficient. It states ways to go futther in the evaluation of heat transfer coefficients. Originality/value - This paper presents modelling methodology of 3D transient thermal field coupled with electromagnetic field applied in three-phase IM at rated load conditions.", "paper_title": "Computer modelling of 3D transient thermal field coupled with electromagnetic field in three-phase induction motor on load", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700009"}
