These optimizations are applied to a RBF neural network used in identifying helicopter types, processing their rotor sounds. The first method uses an optimum learning rate in each iteration of training process. This method increases the speed of learning process and also achieves an absolute stability in network response. Another modification is applied to quick propagation (QP) method as a generalization that attains more learning speed. Finally, we introduced the general optimum steepest descent (GOSD) method, which contains both improvements in learning RBF networks. All modified methods are employed in training a system that recognizes helicopters' rotor sounds exploiting a RBF neural network. Comparing results of these learning methods with the previous ones yields interesting outcomes. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
