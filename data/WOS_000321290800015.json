Some natural events, such as some types of landslides, fall into this type of phenomena and lend themselves well to be simulated with this approach. This paper describes the latest version of the SCIDDICA CA family models, specifically developed to simulate debris-flows type landslides. The latest model of the family, named SCIDDICA-SS3, inherits all the features of its predecessor, SCIDDICA-SS2, with the addition of a particular strategy to manage momentum. The introduction of the latter permits a better approximation of inertial effects that characterize some rapid debris flows. First simulations attempts of real landslides with SCIDDICA-SS3 have produced quite satisfactory results, comparable with the previous model.", "paper_title": "SCIDDICA-SS3: a new version of cellular automata model for simulating fast moving landslides", "paper_id": "WOS:000321290800015"}
