The rule-based CA based on Floor-Field model is presented to support the experiment. Several ideas of decision-making allowing the individual to choose an occupied cell are implemented to reflect observed behavior in the congestion cluster in front of the bottleneck. The velocity of pedestrians is represented by the updating frequency of individuals. Model parameters were calibrated to match the observations of the leaving-the-room experiment.", "paper_title": "Cellular Model of Room Evacuation Based on Occupancy and Movement Prediction: Comparison with Experimental Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000329378500006"}
