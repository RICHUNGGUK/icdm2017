In this paper, we propose a centralized and deterministic sensor deployment method, DT-Score (Delaunay Triangulation-Score), aims to maximize the coverage of a given sensing area with obstacles. The DT-Score consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use a contour-based deployment to eliminate the coverage holes near the boundary of sensing area and obstacles. In the second phase, a deployment method based on the Delaunay Triangulation is applied for the uncovered regions. Before deploying a sensor, each candidate position generated from the current sensor configuration is scored by a probabilistic sensor detection model. A new sensor is placed to the position with the most coverage gains. According to the simulation results, DT-Score can reach higher coverage than grid-based and random deployment methods with the increasing of deployable sensors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
