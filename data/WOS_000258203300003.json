CS-TR-3183/UMIACS-TR-93-124, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 1993] proved that the hardness of factoring is a sufficient condition for there to exist one-way functions (i.e., p-time computable, honest, p-time noninvertible functions; this paper is in the worst-case model, not the average-case model) that are total, commutative, and associative but not strongly noninvertible. In this paper we improve the sufficient condition to P not equal NP. More generally, in this paper we completely characterize which types of one-way functions stand or fall together with (plain) one-way functions-equivalently, stand or fall together with P 54 NP. We look at the four attributes used in Rabi and Sherman's seminal work on algebraic properties of one-way functions (see [M. Rabi, A. Sherman, An observation on associative one-way functions in complexity theory, Information Processing Letters 64 (5) (1997) 239-244: M. Rabi, A. Sherman, Associative one-way functions: A new paradigm for secret-key agreement and digital signatures, Tech. Rep. CS-TR-3183/UMIACS-TR-93-124, Department of Computer Science, University of Maryland, College Park, MD, 1993]) and subsequent papers - strongness (of noninvertibility), totality, commutativity, and associativity - and for each attribute, we allow it to be required to hold, required to fail, or \"don't care\". In this categorization there are 3(4) = 81 potential types of one-way functions. We prove that each of these 81 feature-laden types stands or falls together with the existence of (plain) one-way functions. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
