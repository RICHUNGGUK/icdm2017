The new schemes have full pressure continuity imposed across control-volume faces, Previous families of flux-continuous schemes are point-wise continuous in pressure and flux. When applying the earlier point-wise flux-continuous schemes to strongly anisotropic full-tensor fields their failure to satisfy a maximum principle (as with other FEM and finite-volume methods) can result in loss of local stability for high anisotropy ratios which can cause strong spurious oscillations in the numerical pressure solution. An M-matrix analysis reveals the upper limits for guaranteeing a maximum principle for general 9-point schemes and aids in the design of schemes that minimize the occurrence of spurious oscillations in the discrete pressure field. The full pressure continuity schemes are shown to possess a larger range of flux-continuous schemes, than the previous point-wise counter parts. For strongly anisotropic full-tensor cases it is shown that the full quadrature range possessed by the new schemes permits these schemes to exploit quadrature points (previously out of range) that are shown to minimize spurious oscillations in discrete pressure solutions. The new formulation leads to a more robust quasi-positive family of flux-continuous schemes applicable to general discontinuous full-tensor fields. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
