It is concluded that, for urban zone Users, the effective range is lower than the effective range for users in rural zones. It is shown that ill Focal Zones, the HSDPA mode can support the modulation 16QAM with 7/8 code rate when Cells are not fully loaded. For fully loaded rural cells, the 16QAM modulation scheme with code late of 7/8 cannot be supported. Also, it is noticed that, in urban zones, HSDPA mode can support 16QAM with code rate of 1/2 and QPSK modulation schemes when cells are not fully, loaded. For fully loaded urban COS. only QPSK With Code ate of 1/2 can be supported. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
