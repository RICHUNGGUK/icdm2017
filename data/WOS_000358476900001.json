Based on an energy analysis, the multiscale model is developed to describe the failure process and predict the column's compressive strength. Comparisons of the predicted results with experimental data show that the proposed multiscale model can accurately represent both the compressive strength of the concrete columns with circular cross section, and the effect of column size on its strength.", "paper_title": "Multiscale modeling for compressive strength of concrete columns with circular cross-section", "paper_id": "WOS:000358476900001"}
