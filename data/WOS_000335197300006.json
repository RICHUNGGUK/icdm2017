In order to improve the accuracy of search engines' ranking algorithm, we propose an algorithm for determining the theoretical degree of user attention to a webpage (TDUAW). News webpages were selected from the Chinese online forums as the object of our research. We designed a content-oriented algorithm for TDUAWs through such steps as extracting web content, identifying the feature vector of a webpage and calculating the degree of user attention based on Baidu Index. Experiment and regression analyses were conducted on 150 webpages. The results indicate that the optimal number of feature words is three and the correlation coefficient between the theoretical degree of user attention and the actual degree of user attention (net page view) is over 0.8, which proves the validity of our method. So, the theoretical degree of user attention can serve as an alternative to the page view in the case when page view is unavailable.", "paper_title": "Degree of user attention to a webpage based on Baidu Index: an alternative to page view", "paper_id": "WOS:000335197300006"}
