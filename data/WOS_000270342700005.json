Because of the diversity of various image processing tasks, there exists no optimum method that can perform properly for all applications. In this paper, we have proposed a novel skin detection algorithm that combines color and texture information of skin with cellular learning automata to detect skin-like regions in color images. Skin color regions are first detected, by using a committee structure, from among several explicit boundary skin models. Detected skin-color regions are then fed to a texture analyzer which extracts texture features via their color statistical properties and maps them to a skin probability map. This map is then used by cellular learning automata to adaptively make a decision on skin regions. Conducted experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves the true positive rate of about 86.3% and the false positive rate of about 9.2% on Compaq skin database which shows its efficiency.", "paper_title": "A new dynamic cellular learning automata-based skin detector", "paper_id": "WOS:000270342700005"}
