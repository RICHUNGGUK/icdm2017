It is often used to estimate the bandwidth consumption of tree-based reliable multicast where some special receivers or routers are assigned for retransmission handling of each domain. In this work, we will analyze and simulate the tree-based multicast transmissions to obtain the number of transmissions and actual bandwidth consumption. This paper will also investigate the problem of finding the optimal partitioning of multicast trees based on the bandwidth consumption. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
