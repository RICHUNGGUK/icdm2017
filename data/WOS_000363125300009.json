At LCN (Local Computer Networks) 2014 we analyzed information propagation inside a pure opportunistic version of this network, a scenario constructed from more than 2,500 traces of transatlantic flights in which communications relied only on the sporadic contacts between airplanes. As only a small percentage of the nodes were capable of performing efficient air-to-ground communications we concluded the need to devise a more suitable network architecture by combining opportunistic and satellite communication systems. We propose a generic methodology based on graph analysis (both static and dynamic temporal) to evaluate the different ways to create this new architecture. We show the architectural combination that most improves the network delivery performance while minimizing its deployment costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
