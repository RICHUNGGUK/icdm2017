The locomotion of a legged robot presents not only the problem of maximizing the speed, but also the problem of obtaining a precise speed response, and achieving an acceptable odometry information. In this study we use a simulated annealing algorithm for calibrating different parametric sets for different speed ranges, with the goal of avoiding discontinuities. The results are applied to the robot AIBO in the RoboCup domain. Moreover, we outline the relevance of calibration to the control, showing the improvement obtained in odometry and, as a consequence, in robot localization.", "paper_title": "Portable autonomous walk calibration for 4-legged robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000298853200008"}
