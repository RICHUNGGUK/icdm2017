To maintain the predictive ability of a soft sensor model, adaptation mechanisms are applied to soft sensors. However, even these adaptive soft sensors cannot predict the y-values of various process states in chemical plants, and it is difficult to ensure the predictive ability of such models on a long-term basis. Therefore, we propose a method that combines online support vector regression (OSVR) with an ensemble learning system to adapt to nonlinear and time-varying changes in process characteristics and various process states in a plant. Several OSVR models, each of which has an adaptation mechanism and is updated with new data, predict y-values. A final predicted y-value is calculated based on those predicted y-values and Bayes' rule. We analyze a numerical dataset and two real industrial datasets, and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
