The self-organizing map (SOM) is employed to divide the state space into local regions such that it associates the operating region where a local linear model is the winner with a local quasi-sliding mode controller (QSMC). Switching of the controllers is done synchronously with the active local linear model that tracks the different operating conditions. The simulation results show that the proposed controller outperforms tracking the desired trajectory in noisy environments either with a global controller or simpler controllers based on multiple models.
