In this paper, our results toward the development of adaptive service-based software systems are presented. The formulation of Activity-State-QoS (ASQ) models and how to use the data from controlled experiments to establish ASQ models for capturing the cause-effect dynamics among service activities, system resource states, and QoS in service-based systems are presented. Then, QoS monitoring modules based on ASQ models and SOA-compliant simulation models are developed to support the validation of the ASBS design. The main idea for developing QoS adaptation modules based on ASQ models is discussed. An experiment based on a voice communication service is used to illustrate our results.", "paper_title": "Toward Development of Adaptive Service-Based Software Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000208240300007"}
