To optimize the scheduling of parts as well as to minimize material handling between cells, the practice has to develop processing sequences for the parts in cells. A commonly chosen objective is to find part sequences within cells which results in a minimum tardiness. This paper proposes a nonlinear mathematical programming model of the problem by minimizing the total weighted tardiness in a CMS. To solve the mathematical model, a scatter search approach is developed, in which the common components of scatter search are redefined and redesigned so as to better fit the problem. This scatter search approach considers two different methods to generate diverse initial solutions and two improvement methods, and adopts the roulette wheel selection in the combination method to further expand the conceptual framework and implementation of the scatter search. The proposed approach is compared with the commercial solver CPLEX on a set of test problems, some of which are large dimensions. Computational results have demonstrated the effectiveness of this scatter search approach.", "paper_title": "Optimization of parts scheduling in multiple cells considering intercell move using scatter search approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000279714600015"}
