In this work, we present a new exploration interface that allows users to browse collections based on similarities and differences between shapes in userspecified regions of interest (ROIs). To support this interactive system, we introduce a novel analysis method for computing similarity relationships between points on 3D shapes across a collection. We encode the inherent ambiguity in these relationships using fuzzy point correspondences and propose a robust and efficient computational framework that estimates fuzzy correspondences using only a sparse set of pairwise model alignments. We evaluate our analysis method on a range of correspondence benchmarks and report substantial improvements in both speed and accuracy over existing alternatives. In addition, we demonstrate how fuzzy correspondences enable key features in our exploration tool, such as automated view alignment, ROI-based similarity search, and faceted browsing.", "paper_title": "Exploring Collections of 3D Models using Fuzzy Correspondences", "paper_id": "WOS:000308250300030"}
