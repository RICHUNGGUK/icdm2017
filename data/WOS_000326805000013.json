In a real world market, various economic models exist for setting the price of grid resources, based on supply-and-demand and their value to the consumers. In this paper, we discuss the use of multiagent-based negotiation model for interaction between GROs and GRCs. For realizing this approach, we designed the Market- and Behavior-driven Negotiation Agents (MBDNAs). Negotiation strategies that adopt MBDNAs take into account the following factors: Competition, Opportunity, Deadline and Negotiator's Trading Partner's Previous Concession Behavior. In our experiments, we compare MBDNAs with MDAs (Market-Driven Agent), NDF (Negotiation Decision Function) and Kasbah in terms of the following metrics: total tasks complementation and budget spent. The results show that by taking the proposed negotiation model into account, MBDNAs outperform MDAs, NDF and Kasbah.", "paper_title": "Negotiation strategies considering market, time and behavior functions for resource allocation in computational grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000013"}
