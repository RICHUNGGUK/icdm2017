A model of an n-storey building with MATMD system is established and a joint optimization method is used to obtain an optimal state-feedback controller gain and the parameters of the MATMD system. A mixed H-2/H-infinity/GH(2) control is employed to attenuate the seismic and wind-induced vibration of the building with the constraints of the actuating forces and strokes of the masses. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to search for the optimal parameters and obtain the corresponding controller gain. Two illustrative examples are presented in this paper. In the first comparison, the GA-based approach can obtain a better set of parameters and achieve better control performance. When comparing with an Active Tuned Mass Damper (ATMD), an MATMD system can achieve similar control effects with much smaller acting forces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
