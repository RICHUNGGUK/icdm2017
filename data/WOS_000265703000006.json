When determining multiple paths, however, multipath routing protocols should address the well-known route coupling problem that results from a geographic proximity of adjacent routes and that hampers performance gain. Although a lot of multipath routing protocols have been proposed, most of them focused on obtaining node or link-disjoint multipaths. In order to address the route coupling problem, some multipath routing protocols utilizing zone-disjointness property were proposed. However, they suffer from an overhead of control traffic or require additional equipment such as directional antenna. This paper therefore proposes a novel multipath routing protocol, based on geographical information with low overhead, called 3-directional zone-disjoint multipath routing protocol (3DMRP). 3DMRP searches up to three zone-disjoint paths by using two techniques: 1) greedy forwarding, and 2) RREP-overhearing. One primary and two secondary paths are obtained via greedy forwarding in order to reduce control overhead, and these secondary paths are found by avoiding the RREP overhearing zone created during the primary path acquisition. In particular, two versions of 3DMRP are introduced in order to avoid the RREQ-overhearing zone. Through ns-2 simulations, 3DMRP is evaluated to verify that it achieves performance improvements in terms of throughput and control overhead.", "paper_title": "3DMRP: 3-Directional Zone-Disjoint Multipath Routing Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000006"}
