For each color image in the database, 6 histograms (2 for each color component) are calculated from the six corresponding DWBPVQ index sequences. The retrieval simulation results show that, compared with the traditional Spatial-domain Color-Histogram-based (SCH) features and the DCTVQ index histogram-based (DCTVQIH) features, the proposed DWBPVQIH features can greatly improve the recall and precision performance.", "paper_title": "Color Image Retrieval Based on Distance-Weighted Boundary Predictive Vector Quantization Index Histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000272392700024"}
