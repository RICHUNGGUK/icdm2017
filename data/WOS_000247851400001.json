The mobile outpatient service system (MOSS) focuses on illness treatment, illness prevention and patient relation management for outpatient service users. Initiated in a local hospital in Taiwan, the MOSS pilot project was developed to improve outpatient service quality and pursue higher patient safety. Method: This study focuses on the development of the MOSS. The workflow, architecture and target users of the MOSS are delineated. In addition, there were two surveys conducted as part of this study After a focus group of medical staff identified areas in which outpatient services might be improved by the MOSS, the first survey was administered to outpatients to confirm the focus group's intuitions. The second administration of the survey explored outpatient satisfaction after they used the MOSS service. Results: With regard to outpatient attitudes, about 93% of participants agreed that the mobile outpatient service improved outpatient service quality In the area of outpatient satisfaction, about 89% of participants indicated they were satisfied with the mobile outpatient service. Discussion/conclusion: Supported by our study finding, we propose that more diverse mobile outpatient services can be provided in the future.
