Recent publications have proved the effectiveness of the HAM in solving a wide variety of problems in different fields. In this work, through successfully applying the HAM for solving diffusion equations, we present examples which illustrate different procedures for controlling the convergence region of the solution series. Moreover, in all worked examples, we use the same auxiliary linear functional L, the same auxiliary function H and the same initial guess nu(0), which seems to be a good advantage.
