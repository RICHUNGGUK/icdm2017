With this scheme, the sensing area is divided into a number of location cells and a logical group consists of four location cells. A pairwise key is established for each pair of sensor nodes in a logical group based on grid-based bivariate t-degree polynomials. An efficient en-route data authentication method is proposed to limit data authentication within a small neighboring range. In addition, a greedy location-based secure and energy-efficient data aggregation approach is integrated with the design. It further utilizes data aggregation by setting up control groups, applying pattern codes, selecting and switching control head nodes dynamically and periodically. The analysis demonstrate that our design is resilient to node compromise and decrease storage and communication overhead when compared with non location-based designs. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
