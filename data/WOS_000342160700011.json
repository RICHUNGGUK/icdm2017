In this paper, we investigate the load distributions and relations between the load and degree of the node for different traffic demands in scale-free networks. Different kinds of load distributions are obtained under different traffic demands. Furthermore, the impact of link capacity on load distribution in congested scale-free networks is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Impact of traffic demands on load distribution in congested scale-free networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342160700011"}
