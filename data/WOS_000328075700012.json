In this model, the warehouses capacity which should be phased out, remained, or relocated to other warehouses, and the shipment quantity of the product between the network nodes with a consideration for two delivery lead times is to be determined. Unlike most previous works, considering two delivery lead times, the maximum capacity for each warehouse location, reliability and uncertainty are taken into account in this study. The proposed bi-objective model includes: (1) minimizing average costs including the sum of fixed, production, transportation, relocation and capacity extension costs; (2) maximizing the coverage percentage of customer demand delivered within the preferred delivery lead time. In order to obtain Pareto optimal solutions, a novel version of epsilon-constraint method (i.e., the augmented epsilon-constraint) is applied. A real industrial case is applied to validate and verify the developed warehouse redesigning network model under reliability concept. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
