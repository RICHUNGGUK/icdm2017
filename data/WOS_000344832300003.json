First, the relationship between AFs and a Czech phone inventory is defined, and then the estimation based on the MLP neural networks is done. The usage of several speech representations on the input of the MLP classifiers is proposed with the purpose to obtain a robust AF estimation. The realized experiments have proved that an ANN- based AF estimation works very reliably especially in a low noise environment. Moreover, in case the number of neurons in a hidden layer is increased and if the temporal context DCT-TRAP features are used on the input of the MLP network, the AF classification works accurately also for the signals collected in the environments with a high background noise.", "paper_title": "ROBUST NEURAL NETWORK-BASED ESTIMATION OF ARTICULATORY FEATURES FOR CZECH", "paper_id": "WOS:000344832300003"}
