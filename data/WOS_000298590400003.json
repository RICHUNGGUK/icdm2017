HIV infection in humans is considered pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). HIV needs to use a protein as a co-receptor to enter its target cells. Several chemokine receptors can in principle act as viral co-receptors, but the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) is likely the most physiologically important co-receptor during natural infection. For this reason the development of new CCR5 inhibitors like anti-HIV agents, constitutes a challenge for the scientific community. The present review will focus on the current state of the design of novel anti-HIV drugs, and how the existing computer aided-drug design methodologies, have been effective in the search of new anti-HIV agents. In addition, a QSAR model based on substructural descirptors is presented as a rapid, rational and promising alternative for the discovery of anti-HIV agents through the inhibition of the CCR5.", "paper_title": "Current Drug Design of Anti-HIV Agents Through the Inhibition of C-C Chemokine Receptor Type 5", "paper_id": "WOS:000298590400003"}
