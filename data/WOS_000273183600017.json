Rigorous results are illustrated with a number of examples which include solitons on an infinite line with algebraic, exponential and Gaussian decay rates. Suitable mappings of the real line to the interval [-1, 1] are considered for each class of solutions. (C) 2009 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
