These conditions are difficult to satisfy in general. In this paper, those conditions are relaxed by solving the fuzzy regulation problem directly on the overall T-S fuzzy model, instead of constructing the fuzzy regulator on the basis of linear local controllers. By considering the fuzzy model as a special class of linear time-varying systems, existence conditions are rigorously derived. These new conditions, which can be solved by means of any mathematical software, depend on the solution of a set of symbolic simultaneous linear equations depending on the membership values of the plant and/or the exosystem. Two examples are given to illustrate the construction of the proposed regulator and to validate the improvement that is achieved with the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Exact Output Regulation for Nonlinear Systems Described by Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000302536800003"}
