In this paper, we investigate the covariance matrix estimation problem for small-number samples with high dimension setting based on minimum description length (MDL) principle. A new covariance matrix estimator is developed, and a formula for fast estimation of regularization parameters is derived. Experiments on spectrum pattern recognition are conducted to investigate the classification accuracy with the developed covariance matrix estimator. Higher classification accuracy results are obtained and demonstrated in our new approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
