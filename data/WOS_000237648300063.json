Despite their high classification accuracy, they suffer from a high storage requirement, computational cost, and sensitivity to noise. In this paper, we present a data reduction method for instance-based learning, based on entropy-based partitioning and representative instances. Experimental results show that the new algorithm achieves a high data reduction rate as well as classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Data reduction for instance-based learning using entropy-based partitioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300063"}
