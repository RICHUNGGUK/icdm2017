This article gives a detailed description of a tool that offers an integrated framework for the detection and localization of marine spills using remote sensing, GIS, and cloud computing. Advanced segmentation algorithms are presented in order to isolate dark areas in SAR images, including fuzzy clustering and wavelets. In addition, cloud computing is used for scaling up the algorithms and providing communication between users. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
