Two concatenation models to synthesize Arabic words from segmented characters are adopted: Extended-Glyphs connection and Synthetic-Extensions connection. We use our system to synthesize handwriting from a collected dataset and inject it into an expanded dataset. We experiment by training a state-of-the-art Arabic handwriting recognition system on the collected dataset, as well as on the expanded dataset, and test it on the IFN/ENIT Arabic benchmark dataset We show significant improvement in recognition performance due to the data that was synthesized by our system.
