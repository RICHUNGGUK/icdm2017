It can be used to make a very fast calculation method for the Euler equations in two dimensions. However, the original procedure for two spatial dimensions is inadequate for axisymmetric geometries, where radial co-ordinates of cells and interfaces need to be known. Presented in this paper is a short, simple extension of the VCE method to handle axisymmetric cases with an accuracy consistent with the basic VCE surface representation in planar geometries. The method will be tested in basic conical flow simulations to show its usefulness for practical engineering design purposes.
