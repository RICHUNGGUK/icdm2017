It builds on MDP for its modularity, and adds processing of sequential data sets, gradient descent training, several cross-validation schemes and parallel parameter optimization methods. Additionally, several learning algorithms are implemented, such as different reservoir implementations (both sigmoid and spiking), ridge regression, conditional restricted Boltzmann machine (CRBM) and others, including GPU accelerated versions.
