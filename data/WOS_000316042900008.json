It is strongly required for the mobile device to access wireless links efficiently because wireless communication expends a significant amount of energy per second. By using cache schemes, we can reduce communication costs and enhance performance by storing and reusing recently used data. However, the cached data on the mobile device should be updated in sync with the original data on the server as they are being modified. With a delta consistency policy, we can provide the energy-efficient cache consistency level by setting delta in accordance with various environmental parameters. This paper proposes a method to determine the optimal delta that minimizes the overhead energy expenditure for mobile devices in wireless web environments. We derive the optimal delta from a mathematical model and conduct a simulation for validation. We also implement a test application for the proposed optimal delta method on a test-bed and assess its performance. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
