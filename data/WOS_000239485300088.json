Multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm and its extension referred to as recursive MUSIC algorithm are widely used to localize multiple dipolar sources from the MEG data. The drawback of these algorithms is that they run very slowly when scanning a three-dimensional head volume globally. In order to solve this problem, a novel MEG source localization method based on chaos optimization algorithm is proposed. This method uses the property of ergodicity of chaos to estimate the rough source location. Then combining with grids in small area, the accurate dipolar source localization is performed. Experimental results show that this method can improve the speed of source localization greatly and its accuracy is satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Multiple signal classification based on chaos optimization algorithm for MEG sources localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300088"}
