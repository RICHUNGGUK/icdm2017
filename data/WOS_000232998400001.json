The methodology is based on a conceptual representation of the Enterprise, which is exploited both in the integration phase of the Warehouse information sources and during the knowledge discovery activity on the information stored in the Warehouse. The application of the methodology in the TELECOM ITALIA framework has been supported by prototype software tools both for conceptual modeling and for data integration and reconciliation.
