If the same procedure is applied to sets of outgoing links of web pages, we can find semantically related web domains to a large extent. The structure of the semantic clusters shows all proper-ties of small worlds. The algorithm is known to work for large parts of the web like the German internet. As a sample application we present a surf guide for the German web.", "paper_title": "Calculating communities by link analysis of URLs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237210900015"}
