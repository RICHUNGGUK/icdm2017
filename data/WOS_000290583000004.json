Sci. Comput. 2006; 28: 2095-2113]. The preconditioners are used to accelerate the convergence of the Generalized Minimal Residual method (GMRES) applied to various finite element and Marker-and-Cell discretizations of the Oseen problem in two and three space dimensions. Both steady and unsteady problems are considered. Numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed preconditioners for a wide range of problem parameters. Implementation on parallel architectures is also considered. The AL-based approach is further generalized to deal with linear systems from stabilized finite element discretizations.
