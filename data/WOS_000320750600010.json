Multipath traffic engineering is gaining more importance in contemporary networks. It aims to satisfy the requirements of emerging network applications while optimizing the network performance and the utilization of the available resources within the network. A formulation of this problem as a multiobjective constrained mixed-integer program, which is known to be NP-hard, is first extended. Then, we develop a hybrid heuristic algorithm based on combining linear programming with a devised Pareto-based genetic algorithm for approximating the optimal Pareto curve. A numerical example is adopted from the literature to evaluate and compare the performance of six variations of the proposed heuristic. We study the statistical significance of the results using Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric test. We also compare the results of the heuristic approach with the lexicographic weighted Chebyshev method using a variety of performance metrics. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
