In this paper we propose a mobile agent-based routing model in vulnerable networks for these applications. To characterize the behaviors of mobile agents and their effects on the network performance, we analyze the population distribution of mobile agents as a measurement of the computational resource consumption. Our analysis reveals theoretical insights into the statistical behaviors of mobile agents and provides useful tools for effectively managing mobile agents in large networks.
