Yet it is unknown how men and women differ in the way they move computer cursors. This study examines gender differences in movements of computer cursors. In one experiment, the authors measured trajectories of computer cursors every 20 ms in a simple choice-reaching task and tested the extent to which movement features related to controlling and targeting diverge between male and female participants. Results showed significant gender differences in cursor motions. Female participants deviated from the straight path toward the target location to a larger degree than did male participants, and female participants showed more backward motions (deviating backward from the target location) than did male participants. Implications for sources of these gender differences, user interface and input device design, and musculoskeletal disorders in women are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Gender Differences in Mouse and Cursor Movements", "paper_id": "WOS:000366419600006"}
