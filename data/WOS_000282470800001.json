The mechanical design is briefly described as well as the dynamic simulations used to analyze the robot mobility and functionality. As part of the development, this paper mainly focuses on a new generalized control hardware architecture based on embedded on-board wireless communication network between the robot's subsystems. This approach results in a modular control hardware architecture since no wire connections are used between the actuators and sensors in each of the mobile robot subsystems and also provides operational fault-tolerance. The effectiveness of this approach is experimentally demonstrated and validated by implementing it in the hybrid mobile robot system. The new control hardware architecture and mechanical design demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative performance improvements of the mobile robot in terms of the new locomotion and manipulation capabilities it provides. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate new operative tasks that the robot was able to accomplish, such as traversing challenging obstacles, and manipulating objects of various capacities; functions often required in various challenging applications, such as search and rescue missions, hazardous site inspections, and planetary explorations.
