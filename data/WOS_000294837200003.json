Different from previous relevance models that can only propagate keywords from the training images to the test ones, the proposed model can perform extra keyword propagation among the test images. We also give a convergence analysis of the iterative algorithm inspired by the proposed model. Moreover, to estimate the joint probability of observing an image with possible annotation keywords, we define the inter-image relations through proposing a new spatial Markov kernel based on 2D Markov models. The main advantage of our spatial Markov kernel is that the intra-image context can be exploited for automatic image annotation, which is different from the traditional bag-of-words methods. Experiments on two standard image databases demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art annotation models.", "paper_title": "Automatic Image Annotation Based on Generalized Relevance Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000294837200003"}
