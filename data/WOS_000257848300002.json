An auxiliary-state-driven fuzzy controller is proposed to deal with nonlinear systems. With a particular and systematic design, the system stability of fuzzy control systems is implied by the auxiliary and error systems. Instead of studying the system stability of the fuzzy control systems directly, the system stability of the auxiliary system and the error model is investigated. Furthermore, the auxiliary system offers a favourable property that some system parameters can be freely designed. As a result, except the feedback gains of the fuzzy controller, these freely designed parameters can also contribute themselves to relax stability conditions. Based on the Lyapunov-based approach, the stability and performance conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities are derived. Simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and design procedure of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Auxiliary-state-driven fuzzy controller for nonlinear systems based on TS-fuzzy-model-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000257848300002"}
