Here, we first show that chaotic resonance is a robust phenomenon, as it does not depend upon the details of the inferior olive neuronal model. Second, we show that chaotic resonance enhances learning of a neural controller for fast arm movements. Furthermore, when both coupling and noise are considered simultaneously, we found that chaotic resonance widens the range of noise intensity within which efficient learning can be realized. We suggest that, from an energetic viewpoint, the spiking activity induced by chaos can be more economical than that induced by noise. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
