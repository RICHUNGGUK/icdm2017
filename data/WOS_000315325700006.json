In fact, the decision makers often have to face vague operational conditions. In this paper, a novel JRP model with fuzzy minor replenishment cost and fuzzy inventory holding cost is developed. More concisely, this model is a fuzzy dependent-chance programming (DCP) model. Subsequently, the technique of the traditional fuzzy simulation (FS) approach and differential evolution algorithm (DE) are integrated to design a hybrid intelligent algorithm named FSDE-I to solve this practical fuzzy JRP. Thirdly, another intelligent algorithm named FSDE-II using an improved FS approach is proposed to estimate the credibility more precisely. Finally, FSDE-I and FSDE-II are illustrated with numerical examples and the results show the effectiveness of FSDE-II. Crown Copyright (c) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
