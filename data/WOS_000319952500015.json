This method relies on the approximation of the notion of probability density for functional random variables, which generally does not exist. Using the Karhunen-Loeve expansion of a stochastic process, this approximation leads to define an approximation for the density of functional variables. Based on this density approximation, a parametric mixture model is proposed. The parameter estimation is carried out by an EM-like algorithm, and the maximum a posteriori rule provides the clusters. The efficiency of Funclust is illustrated on several real datasets, as well as for the characterization of the Mars surface. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
