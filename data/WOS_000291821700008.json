In particular, perfect cloning is impossible, due to this trade-off, while optimal imperfect cloning saturates the trade-off relation. We investigate by numerical methods the deep nature of this trade-off relation, in the case of optimal cloning, and find that it reveals a subtle interplay between fidelity and entanglement.", "paper_title": "ABOUT OPTIMAL CLONING AND ENTANGLEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000291821700008"}
