Using data from 18 core source LIS journals in China covering 6 years, we construct the LIS coauthorship network. We analyze the network from both macro and micro perspectives and identify some key features of this network: this network is a small-world network, and follows the scale-free character. In the micro-level, we calculate each author's centrality values and compare them with citation counts. We find that centrality rankings are highly correlated with citation rankings. We also discuss the limitation of current centrality measures for coauthorship network analysis.", "paper_title": "Mapping library and information science in China: a coauthorship network analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000275417400008"}
