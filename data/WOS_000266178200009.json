Conway, On Numbers and Games, Academic Press, New-York, 1976, Second edition (2001), A.K. Peters, Wellesley, MA], J.H. Conway introduced twelve versions of compound games. We analyze these twelve versions for the Node-Kayles game on paths. For usual disjunctive compound, Node-Kayles has been solved for a long time under normal play, while it is still unsolved under misere play. We thus focus on the ten remaining versions, leaving only one of them unsolved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
