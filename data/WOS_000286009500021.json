This paper discusses educational content and content repurposing in medical education, presenting different repurposing contexts. Finally, it proposes a novel approach to content repurposing via Web 2.0 social networking of learning resources. The proposed social network is augmented by a graphical representation module in order to capture and depict the relationships among different repurposed medical educational resources, based on educational resource \"families\" and inheritance. The ultimate goal is to provide a conceptually different approach to educational resource organization and retrieval via \"social\" associations among learning resources.", "paper_title": "Depicting Educational Content Repurposing Context and Inheritance", "paper_id": "WOS:000286009500021"}
