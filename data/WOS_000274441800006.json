Implementing anonymity of mobile users not only protects their privacy but also reduces the chances of attacks based on impersonation; therefore security can be improved. Untraceability is a related issue to anonymity. If a user is traceable, its hidden identity can be revealed through profiling the activities associated to a user. In this paper, we conduct a survey on anonymity issues of wireless communication systems. We first discuss general issues of anonymity in wireless communication systems. Then we survey some protocols in the literature, which are designed for wireless mobile systems as well as wireless ad hoc networks.
