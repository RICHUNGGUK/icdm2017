The risk for the trajectories is evaluated by calculating the area of the cross section of the fuzzy danger zones in the operator's path. The workplace is discretised into rectangular cells, and the optimal trajectory is approximated by a polygon, connecting the centres of ordered cells. This method is adapted for both determining the optimal operator paths and simulating the operator behaviour in the virtual engineering platforms. The results are useful to develop emergency safety procedures, risk concept training and to evaluate safety in the workplace.", "paper_title": "An approach to optimise an avatar trajectory in a virtual workplace", "paper_id": "WOS:000286660400001"}
