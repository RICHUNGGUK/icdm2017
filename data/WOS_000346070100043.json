Solving these problems using interior-point methods requires the solution of a linear system that has a block-angular structure at each iteration. Parallel solution is possible using a Schur-complement decomposition. In an explicit Schur-complement decomposition, the computational cost of forming and factorizing the Schur-complement is prohibitive for problems with many coupling variables. In this paper, we show that this bottleneck can be overcome by solving the Schur-complement equations implicitly, using a quasi-Newton preconditioned conjugate gradient method. This new algorithm avoids explicit formation and factorization of the Schur-complement. The computational efficiency of this algorithm is compared with the serial full-space approach, and the serial and parallel explicit Schur-complement approach. These results show that the PCG Schur-complement approach dramatically reduces the computational cost for problems with many coupling variables.
