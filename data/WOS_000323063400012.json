This paper presents a fuzzy modelling method of cutting forces based on subtractive clustering. The subtractive clustering combined with the least-square algorithm identifies the fuzzy prediction model directly from the information obtained from the sensors. In the micro-milling experimental case study, four sets of cutting force data are used to generate the learning systems. The systems are tested against each other to choose the best model. The obtained results prove that the proposed solution has the capability to model the cutting force in spite of uncertainties in the micromilling process.", "paper_title": "Experimental and fuzzy modelling analysis on dynamic cutting force in micro milling", "paper_id": "WOS:000323063400012"}
