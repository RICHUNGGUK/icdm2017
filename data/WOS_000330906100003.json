We discuss how such knowledge may be used to the advantage of system developer and what kinds of improvements can be achieved. We focus on systems that incorporate creation and processing of compound data objects within the RDBMS framework. These basic considerations are illustrated with several examples of implemented database solutions.", "paper_title": "Using Domain Knowledge in Initial Stages of KDD: Optimization of Compound Object Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000330906100003"}
