The proposed method utilized fuzzy neural clustering of DIC method instead of constructing exact mathematical model. After normalizing the sample data, together with prior knowledge, a fuzzy neural network is used to evaluate work status. An adaptive algorithm is developed to diagnose the leak fault. The experiment results have shown the validity and practicability of the method.", "paper_title": "Algorithm of pipeline leak detection based on discrete incremental clustering method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300073"}
