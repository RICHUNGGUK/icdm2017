The key feature of the method is that mass-lumping linear finite element L-2 projections act on the curl and divergence partial differential operators so that the singular solution can be sought in a setting of L-2 (Omega) space. We shall use the nodal-continuous linear finite elements, enriched with one element bubble in each element, to approximate the singular and non-H-1 solution. Discontinuous and nonhomogeneous media are allowed in the method. Some error estimates are given and a number of numerical experiments for source problems as well as eigenvalue problems are presented to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed method.
