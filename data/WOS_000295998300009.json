The purpose of this paper is to review some of the literature aimed at gathering opinion, sentiment and information from blogs. This paper also extends the previous literature in a number of directions, extending the use of knowledge from tags on blogs, finding the need for domain specific terms to capture a richer understanding of mood of a blog and finding a relationship between information in message boards and blogs. The relationship between blog chatter and sales, and blogs and public image are also examined. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
