The analyser uses multivariate techniques for the quantitative predication of the aspen fibre (aspen) and the birch bark contents of sheets of unbleached hardwood pulp. The NIR analyser is a prototype constructed from standard NIR components. The spectroscopic data was processed by using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square (PLS) regression. Three sample sets were collected from three experimental designs, each composed of known pulp contents of birch, aspen and birch bark. Sets I and 2 were used for model calibration and set 3 was used to validate the models. The PLS model that produced the best predictions gave an error of prediction (RMSEP) of 13% for aspen and less than 2% for birch bark. Eight components resulted in an R(2)X of 99.3%, R(2)Y of 99.6%. and Q(2) of 95.3%. For additional validation of aspen, three unbleached hardwood samples from the mill's production were calculated to lie between -7% and +6%, regarding to the PIS model. When vessel cells were counted under a light microscope a value for the aspen content of 4.7% was obtained. The predictive models evaluated were suitable for quality assessments rather than quantitative determination. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
