In this article we are interested in developing a reactive design through process log analysis ensuring process re-engineering and execution reliability. We propose to analyse workflow logs to discover workflow transactional behaviour and to subsequently improve and correct related recovery mechanisms. Our approach starts by collecting workflow logs. Then, we build, by statistical analysis techniques, an intermediate representation specifying elementary dependencies between activities. These dependencies are refined to mine the transactional workflow model. The analysis of the discrepancies between the discovered model and the initially designed model enables us to detect design gaps, concerning particularly the recovery mechanisms. Thus, based on this mining step, we apply a set of rules on the initially designed workflow to improve workflow reliability.", "paper_title": "Log-based transactional workflow mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000264518900003"}
