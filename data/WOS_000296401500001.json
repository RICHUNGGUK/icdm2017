Although previous research has proposed leakage management techniques by turning off inactive cache blocks, these techniques can be further improved by exploiting the various run-time characteristics of target applications in CMPs. By exploiting particular access sequences observed in producer-consumer sharing patterns and the spatial locality of shared buffers, our technique enables a more aggressive turn-off of L2 cache blocks of these buffers. Experimental results using a CMP simulator show that our proposed technique reduces the energy consumption of on-chip L2 caches, a shared bus, and off-chip memory by up to 31.3% over the existing cache leakage power management techniques with no significant performance loss.
