We present the FERRY COVER problem (FC), where the objective is to determine the minimum required boat size to safely transport n items represented by a graph G and demonstrate a close connection with VERTEX COVER which leads to hardness and approximation results. We also completely solve the problem on trees. Then we focus on a variation of the same problem with the added constraint that only 1 round-trip is allowed (FC(1)). We present a reduction from MAX-NAE{3}-SAT which shows that this problem is NP-hard and APX-hard. We also provide an approximation algorithm for bipartite graphs with a factor asymptotically equal to 4/3 and a 1.56-approximation algorithm for planar graphs. Finally, we generalize the above problem to define FC(m), where at most m round-trips are allowed, and MFT(k), which is the problem of minimizing the number of round-trips when the boat capacity is k. We present some preliminary lemmata for both, which provide bounds on the value of the optimal solution, and relate them to FC.", "paper_title": "The Ferry Cover Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000263099400007"}
