The bandwidth of the filter can be programmed from 200 kHz to 8 MHz to accommodate both standards. The proposed filter provides low power, and small area design solution. Post-layout simulation results show that the filter satisfies the selectivity and dynamic range requirements of both applications while consuming total standby power of 1.88 mW.", "paper_title": "A new CMOS channel select filter for dual mode bluetooth/WLAN direct-conversion receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000275398000006"}
