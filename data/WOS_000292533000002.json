In the job scheduling process, the algorithm establishes dual fairness constraint. The first constraint is to classify user tasks by QoS preferences, and establish the general expectation function in accordance with the classification of tasks to restrain the fairness of the resources in selection process. The second constraint is to define resource fairness justice function to judge the fairness of the resources allocation. We have expanded simulation platform CloudSim, and have implemented the job scheduling algorithm proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively execute the user tasks and manifests better fairness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
