However, due to environmental constrains, social concerns and financial costs, the construction of new power transmission lines is an arduous task. In addition, power transmission systems are often loaded close to their nominal values. Therefore, improving power transmission system efficiency and reliability is a matter of concern. This work deals with a 400 kV, 3000 A, 50 Hz extra-high-voltage expansion substation connector used to connect two substation bus bars of 150 mm diameter each. This substation connector has four aluminum wires which provide the conductive path between both bus bars. Preliminary tests showed an unequal current distribution through the wires which was mainly attributed to the proximity effect. A three-dimensional finite elements method approach was applied to improve the design and evaluate the electromagnetic and thermal behavior of both the original and improved versions of the connector. Experimental tests made under laboratory conditions have validated the accuracy of the simulation method presented in this paper, which may be a valuable tool to assist the design process of substation connectors, therefore allowing improving both the thermal performance and reliability of the redesigned connectors.
