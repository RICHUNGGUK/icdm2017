This system converts the basic modeling components of geometry units such as points, lines, and triangles, etc., into the semantic components such as streets, blocks, patches, and houses, etc. To implement the urban modeling system semantically, an XML based description and DTD [ISO/TC 211/WG 4/PT 19136 Geographic information-Geography Markup Language (GML) https://portal.opengeospatial.org/files/?artifact_id = 7174] based verification technique is used to control the generation process of urban, and this DTD based verification technique can avoid the disadvantage of the grammar system and can ensure the coherent architecture styles of ancient vernacular houses. It has been applied to preserve the digital heritage of southeast China vernacular architecture.
