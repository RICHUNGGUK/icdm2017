In this paper, the VLC system design problem is solved by using a multi-objective optimization method. Based on the results of the optimization process, we can determine the parameters to get a VLC system with optimal performance in respect of maximum link quality and minimum power consumption while illumination and other constraints are all satisfied.", "paper_title": "Optimization for link quality and power consumption of visible light communication system", "paper_id": "WOS:000339802200001"}
