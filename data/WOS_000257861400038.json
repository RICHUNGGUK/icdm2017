Binary [15s + t, 4] optimal self-orthogonal codes are characterized by systems of linear equations. Based on these two results, the complete classification of [15s + t, 4] optimal self-orthogonal codes for t is an element of {1,2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14} and s >= 1 is obtained, and the generator matrices and weight polynomials of these 4-dimensional optimal self-orthogonal codes are also given.", "paper_title": "On the classification of binary optimal self-orthogonal codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000257861400038"}
