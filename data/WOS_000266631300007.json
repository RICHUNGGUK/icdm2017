In contrast to the authors' previous paper [Z. Lu. R.D.C. Monteiro, and J.W. O'Neal, An iterative solver-based infeasible primal-dual path-following algorithm for convex quadratic programming. SIAM J. Optim. 17(1) (2006). pp. 287-310], we propose a new linear system, which we refer to as the hybrid augmented normal equation (HANE), to determine the primal-dual search directions. Since the iterative linear solver can only generate an approximate solution to the HANE, this solution does not yield a primal-dual search direction satisfying all equations of the primal-dual Newton system. We propose a recipe to compute an inexact primal-dual search direction, based on a Suitable approximate solution to the HANE. The second difference between this paper and [Z. Lu, R.D.C. Monteiro. and J.W. O'Neal. An iterative solver-based infeasible primal-dual path-following algorithm for convex quadratic programming. SIAM J. Optim. 17 (1)(2006), pp. 287-310] is that, instead of using the maximum weight basis (MWB) preconditioner in the aforesaid recipe for constructing the inexact search direction. this paper proposes the use of any member of a whole class of preconditioners. of which the MWB preconditioner is just a special case. The proposed recipe allows us to: (i) establish a polynomial bound on the number of iterations performed by our path-following algorithm and (ii) establish a uniform bound, depending on the quality of the preconditioner. on the number of iterations performed by the iterative solver.", "paper_title": "An iterative solver-based long-step infeasible primal-dual path-following algorithm for convex QP based on a class of preconditioners", "paper_id": "WOS:000266631300007"}
