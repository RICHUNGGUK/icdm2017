Economic theory that is based on fictitious market cannot manage building them, because it is one-sided and fails; the model suggests solving the crises and building new economy and society based on human requisite holism (HRH), creativity-based well-being (CBWB) and social responsibility (SR). The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative economic analysis using HRH, CBWB, SR and dialectical systems theory (DST) is applied. Findings - The current global socio-economic/environmental crisis reflects decision-makers' one-sidedness and resulting oversights. HRH and SR support both holism and honesty and help to combat the negative impact of decision-makers' behaviour. SR can support holism and honesty better, if well-being is extended to CBWB, and if SR is upgraded with increasing CBWB, not welfare alone. Both SR and CBWB support HRH. The innovative synergy of CBWB and SR enables the solution of crises and the new economy and society beyond the currently practiced fictitious market. DST backs HRH, CBWB and SR, an ethic of interdependence and requisite holism (RH) approach, enabling requisite wholeness of outcomes. Research limitations/implications - Empirical data are from Slovene enterprises. Practical implications The RH approach to managing socio-economic crises helps practitioners to rebuild modern society. Originality/value - Available literature offers no similar concept.", "paper_title": "Creativity-based well-being of employees as a basis of future economy and society", "paper_id": "WOS:000332133600005"}
