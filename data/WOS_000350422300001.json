Most of the current approaches for computational experiment conservation and reproducibility have focused so far on two of the main components of the experiment, namely, data and method. In this paper, we propose a new approach that addresses the third cornerstone of experimental reproducibility: the equipment. This work focuses on the equipment of a computational experiment, that is, the set of software and hardware components that are involved in the execution of a scientific workflow. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal, we describe a use case scenario on the Text Analytics domain and the application of our approach to it. From the original workflow, we document its execution environment, by means of a set of semantic models and a catalogue of resources, and generate an equivalent infrastructure for reexecuting it.", "paper_title": "Towards Reproducibility in Scientific Workflows: An Infrastructure-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350422300001"}
