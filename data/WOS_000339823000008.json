There has been a gradual evolution in the application of this idea from using increasing geodesic subspaces of submanifolds in analogy with PCA to using a \"backward sequence\" of a decreasing family of subspaces. We provide a version of the backwards approach by using a \"nested sequence of relations\" which define the decreasing sequences of subspaces which need not be geodesic. Because these are naturally inductively added in a backward sequence, they are frequently more tractable and overcome difficulties with using geodesics.", "paper_title": "Backwards Principal Component Analysis and Principal Nested Relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000339823000008"}
