In this paper we define the problem and present an integer programming and a constraint programming formulation for the problem. Furthermore, we describe a hybrid integer programming/constraint programming approach and a branch and bound algorithm for solving the Timetable Constrained Distance Minimization Problem. Finally, the computational performances of the four solution methods are tested and compared.", "paper_title": "The Timetable Constrained Distance Minimization Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238117300015"}
