We developed an anatomically precise finite element numerical model of a pregnant woman. This numerical model was validated using experimental data from crash tests using cadavers given to science. For a frontal impact at a speed of 20km/h, the mean value of peak strain levels at the utero-placenta interface were found to be close to 20%, independent of placenta position, representing an adverse foetal outcome risk of approximately 15%. This study found no significant effect of placenta position on the risk of placenta abruption. Our anatomically precise approach does however confirm the interest of using a numerical model when studying injury mechanisms in pregnant women involved in car crashes.", "paper_title": "Does placenta position modify the risk of placental abruption in car crashes?", "paper_id": "WOS:000268912000003"}
