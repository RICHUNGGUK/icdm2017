The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) controls the location of the regions where the Fukui function is negative, supporting the postulate that negative values of the Fukui function are associated with orbital relaxation effects and nodal surfaces of the frontier orbitals. Significant negative values for the condensed Fukui function, however, were not observed.", "paper_title": "In pursuit of negative Fukui functions: examples where the highest occupied molecular orbital fails to dominate the chemical reactivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600011"}
