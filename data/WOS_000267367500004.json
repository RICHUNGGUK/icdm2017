Although many GPS-based applications have been developed and successfully deployed in various fields, their applicabilities are hindered by the obstruction of the objects in the environment. Essentially, as satellite signals cannot penetrate the walls of buildings, the coverage of GPS systems is limited to outdoor environments. To fully exploit the benefit of location-based services, approaches that determine the location of a device in indoor environments need to be established. This study presents a novel location determination mechanism that uses an indoor WLAN and back-propagation neural network (BPN). A museum is taken as the context of the example indoor environment. Location determination is achieved using the combined strengths of 802.11b wireless access signals. With a significant number of access points (APs) installed in the museum, hand-held devices can sense the strengths of the signals from all APs to which the devices can connect. Using a back-propagation network, device locations can be estimated with sufficient accuracy. A novel adaptive algorithm is implemented for enhancing the accuracy of the estimation.", "paper_title": "Location determination of mobile devices for an indoor WLAN application using a neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000267367500004"}
