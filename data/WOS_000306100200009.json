We propose the use of a Tikhonov functional, where the penalty term is based on the difference of integral invariants. As a case example, we consider the problem of inverting the Radon transform of an object with only limited angular data available. We approximate the ill-posed operator equation by a minimization problem involving a Tikhonov functional and show existence of minimizers of the functional. Because of its nondifferentiability, we derive for the numerical minimization smooth approximations, which converge in the sense of Gamma-limits.", "paper_title": "Shape Reconstruction with A Priori Knowledge Based on Integral Invariants", "paper_id": "WOS:000306100200009"}
