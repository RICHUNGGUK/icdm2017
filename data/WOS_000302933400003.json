We present a spectral transformation allowing the computation of the least stable eigenmodes in a prescribed frequency range, based on the filtering of the linearized equations of motion. This \"shift-relax'' method has the advantage of low memory requirements and is therefore suitable for large two- or three-dimensional problems. For demonstration purposes, this new method is applied to compute eigenmodes of a compressible jet. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
