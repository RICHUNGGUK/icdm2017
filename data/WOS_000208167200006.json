We study the impact of the communication link between CPU and coprocessor hardware for a typical ECC design, and demonstrate that the SoC may become performance-limited due to coprocessor data-and instruction-transfers. A dual strategy is proposed to remove the bottleneck: introduction of control hierarchy as well as local storage. The performance of the ECC coprocessor can be almost independent of the selection of bus protocols. Besides performance, the proposed ECC coprocessor is also optimized for scalability. Using design space exploration of a large number of system configurations of different architectures, our proposed ECC coprocessor architecture enables trade-offs between area, speed, and security.", "paper_title": "Optimized System-on-Chip Integration of a Programmable ECC Coprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000208167200006"}
