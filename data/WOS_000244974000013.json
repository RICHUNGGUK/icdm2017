All uncertainties are assumed to be norm-bounded by unknown constants. Two methods are proposed to estimate these unknown bounds. Then, by making use of the updated values of these unknown bounds, two kinds of memory state feedback controllers are designed. It is shown that the close-loop neutral delay systems resulting from two proposed adaptive robust control schemes are both uniformly ultimately bounded. The corresponding results can be changed into the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Two design schemes for robust adaptive control of a class of linear uncertain neutral delay systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244974000013"}
