Decision support systems (DSS) may support clinicians in finding the correct balance. The objective of this study was to evaluate a computerized model-based DSS for its advice on inspired oxygen fraction, tidal volume and respiratory frequency. The DSS was retrospectively evaluated in 16 intensive care patient cases, with physiological models fitted to the retrospective data and then used to simulate patient response to changes in therapy. Sensitivity of the DSS's advice to variations in cardiac output (CO) was evaluated. Compared to the baseline ventilator settings set as part of routine clinical care, the system suggested lower tidal volumes and inspired oxygen fraction, but higher frequency, with all suggestions and the model simulated outcome comparing well with the respiratory goals of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network from 2000. Changes in advice with CO variation of about 20% were negligible except in cases of high oxygen consumption. Results suggest that the DSS provides clinically relevant and rational advice on therapy in agreement with current 'best practice', and that the advice is robust to variation in CO.", "paper_title": "Retrospective evaluation of a decision support system for controlled mechanical ventilation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298648400005"}
