Its OFDMA mode has enabled the mobile Internet to emerge as the latest mobile seamless service. In order to enhance the IEEE 802.16 broadband wireless access systems, this paper focuses on inefficient aspects of the existing MAP message, which may be a major overhead in a frame. We propose a further compressed MAP called Tiny MAP where redundant elements are removed through small modifications of the standard. We show that the throughput of the OFDMA PHY frame is improved by comparing the existing MAC data rate with the improved MAC data rate. The simulation evaluates the performance of the proposed Tiny MAP message in terms of improvement ratio, considering the impact of several influential factors such as channel bandwidth, the number of users, burst count, FFT size and frame utilization.
