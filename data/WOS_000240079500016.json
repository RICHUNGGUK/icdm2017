We made research on the application of SVD-based metabolite quantification methods in 21) MRSI by comparing two different SVD algorithms. In the quantification process, first, the FID signals are rearranged into a data matrix. Then, we can make full SVD by Golub algorithm or partial SVD by Lanczos algorithm. Last, the parameter estimation on each metabolite can be acquired by the definition of the linear parameter model. The ordinary full SVD must decompose all the singular value, with a big cost of the time. The partial SVD just needs to calculate the less singular by the character of the Hankel matrix to improve the estimation speed. When the SNR of MRS signals is higher than ten, the computation time on partial SVD is decreased by thirteen times of the ordinary method. But the speed of quantification is only half of the ordinary one when the SNR is lower than one. Improvements of speed and accuracy in metabolite quantification are key factors for 2D MRSI to be a clinical tool in the future.", "paper_title": "Application of SVD-based metabolite quantification methods in magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500016"}
