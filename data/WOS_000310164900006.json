In particular, we identify the minimum information required for fast recognition of images of directly perceivable real-world buildings displayed on a mobile device. Resolution, image size, and JPEG compression of images of facades were manipulated in a same-different recognition task carried out in the field. Best-effort performance is shown to be reachable with significantly lower detail granularity than previously thought. For best user performance, we recommend presenting images as large as possible on the screen and decreasing resolution accordingly.", "paper_title": "How Real Is Real Enough?
