Using a link between GIS tools and gOcad, stratigraphic and tectonic surfaces can be reconstructed taking into account any geometrical constraint derived from field observations. Complex surfaces can be reconstructed using large data sets analysed by Suitable geometrical techniques. Three main typologies of geometric features and related attributes are exported from it GIS-geodatabase: (1) topographic data as points from a digital elevation model; (2) stratigraphic and tectonic boundaries, and linear features as 2D polylines, (3) structural data as points. After having imported the available information into gOcad, the following Steps should be performed: (1) construction of the topographic surface by interpolation of points; (2) 3D mapping of the linear geological boundaries and linear features by vertical projection oil the reconstructed topographic surface; (3) definition of geometrical constraints from planar and linear outcrop data; (4) construction Of a network of cross-sections based oil field observations and geometrical constraints; (5) creation of 3D surfaces, closed volumes and grids from the constructed objects. Three examples of the reconstruction of complex geological bodies from the Italian Alps are presented here. The methodology demonstrates that although only outcrop data were available, 3D modelling has allows the checking of the geometrical consistency of the interpretative 2D sections and of the field geology, through a 3D visualisation of geometrical models. Application ON 3D geometrical model to the case studies can be very useful in geomechanical modelling for slope-stability or resource evaluation. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
