This approach increases the error correcting capability of IRS codes compared to other known approaches (e.g. joint decoding) with high probability. It is a generalization of well-known decoding approaches and its complexity is quadratic with the length of the code. Asymptotic parameters of the new approach are calculated and simulation results are shown to illustrate its performance. Moreover, an upper bound on the failure probability is derived.", "paper_title": "Decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes beyond their joint error-correcting capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000332869500005"}
