We employ hybrid dynamical systems to model such networks. The main and new achievement of the paper is that we propose a distributed implementable in real time scheduling rule such that the corresponding closed-loop system is stable and optimal. In stable systems the processes converge to periodic ones. The paper gives computing relations for the determination of the parameters of the periodic processes. These are very much suitable for planning purposes. On this basis-and this, we consider, is also a new, significant result-optimal arrival (demand) rates determination method is proposed. Quality characteristics are outlined. Field of application of hybrid dynamical approach for FMS scheduling is analyzed. The results open perspectives for MRP level task planning. Example and simulation results are presented.
