In this paper, an automatic classification method of spatial relationships between the adjacent symbols in a pair is presented. This classification is important to realize an accurate structure analysis module of math OCR. Experimental results on very large databases showed that this classification worked well with an accuracy of 99.525% by using distribution maps which are defined by two geometric features, relative size and relative position, with careful treatment on document-dependent characteristics.", "paper_title": "Automatic Classification of Spatial Relationships among Mathematical Symbols Using Geometric Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000272773300006"}
