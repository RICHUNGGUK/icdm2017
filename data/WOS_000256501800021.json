This property gives membranes the ability to adopt dramatic shape changes. In this paper, a finite element model is developed to study static equilibrium mechanics of membranes. In particular, a viscous regularization method is proposed to stabilize tangential mesh deformations and improve the convergence rate of nonlinear solvers. The augmented Lagrangian method is used to enforce global constraints on area and volume during membrane deformations. As a validation of the method, equilibrium shapes for a shape-phase diagram of lipid bilayer vesicle are calculated. These numerical techniques are also shown to be useful for simulations of three-dimensional large deformation problems: the formation of tethers (long tube-like extensions); and Ginzburg-Landau phase separation of a two lipid-component vesicle. To deal with the large mesh distortions of the two-phase model, modification of viscous regularization is explored to achieve r-adaptive mesh optimization. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
