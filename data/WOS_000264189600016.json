The noisy functional MS data collected by current technologies, however, require consistent, sensitive and robust data-processing techniques for successful biomedical application. Therefore, it is important to detect features precisely for each spectrum, quantify them well and assign a unique label to features from the same protein/peptide across spectra. Results: In this article, we propose a new comprehensive MS data preprocessing package, Wave-spec, which includes several novel algorithms. It can overcome several conventional difficulties. Wave-spec can be applied to multiple types of MS data generated with different MS technologies. Results from this new package were evaluated and compared to several existing approaches based on a MALDI-TOF MS dataset.", "paper_title": "A novel comprehensive wave-form MS data processing method", "paper_id": "WOS:000264189600016"}
