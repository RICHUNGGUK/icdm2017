Our method processes a Gaussian pyramid from coarse to fine, and at each level, applies a nonlinear filter bank to the neighborhood of each pixel. Outputs of these spatially-varying filters are merged using global optimization. The optimization problem is solved using an explicit mixeddomain ( real space and DCT transform space) solution, which is efficient, accurate, and easy-to-implement. We demonstrate applications of our method to a set of problems, including detail and contrast manipulation, HDR compression, nonphotorealistic rendering, and haze removal.", "paper_title": "Mixed-Domain Edge-Aware Image Manipulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318476800018"}
