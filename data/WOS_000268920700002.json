In this paper, we consider quantitative, objective interestingness measures for \"if..., then...\" association rules. We focus on three popular interestingness measures, namely rule interest function of Piatetsky-Shapiro, gain measure of Fukuda et al., and dependency factor used by Pawlak. We verify whether they satisfy the valuable property M of monotonic dependency on the number of objects satisfying or not the premise or the conclusion of a rule, and property of hypothesis symmetry (HS). Moreover, analytically and through experiments we show an interesting relationship between those measures and two other commonly used measures of rule support and anti-support.", "paper_title": "Analysis of monotonicity properties of some rule interestingness measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000268920700002"}
