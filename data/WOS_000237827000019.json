Using the new addressing scheme, many routing algorithms designed for networks using square-based topologies such as mesh and torus can also be applied to hexagonal networks. Methods of applying the turn model to hexagonal networks are derived, with some new minimal and partial adaptive routing algorithms obtained. Simulations of the new routing algorithms under different working conditions are carried on hexagonal networks of various sizes. The results show that the proposed algorithms can offer lower packet delay and loss rate than the popular dimension order routing algorithm.", "paper_title": "Routing in hexagonal networks under a corner-based addressing scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000237827000019"}
