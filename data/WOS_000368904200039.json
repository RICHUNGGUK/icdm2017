For graphics-heavy applications that run at 30 fps, we easily observed very noticeable flickering artifacts. Further, the workload imposed by high resolutions at high frame rates directly decreases the battery life. Unlike the recent frame rate up sampling algorithms which remedy the flickering but cause inevitable significant overheads to reconstruct intermediate frames, we propose a dynamic rendering quality scaling (DRQS) that includes dynamic rendering based on resolution changes and quality scaling to increase the frame rate with negligible overhead using a transform matrix. Further DRQS reduces the workload up to 32% without human visual-perceptual changes for graphics-light applications.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Rendering Quality Scaling Based on Resolution Changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200039"}
