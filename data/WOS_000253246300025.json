Cross-species analysis allows coping with the high levels of noise that are typical to these data. The NetworkBLAST web-server provides a platform for identifying protein complexes in protein-protein interaction networks. It can analyze a single network or two networks from different species. In the latter case, NetworkBLAST outputs a set of putative complexes that are evolutionarily conserved across the two networks.", "paper_title": "NetworkBLAST: comparative analysis of protein networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000253246300025"}
