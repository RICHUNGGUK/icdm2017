Drowsy driving was considered and has approximately reasoned to an extra reaction time to modify NHTSA algorithm. FUZZY approach to pre-crash warning was employed to design a fault-tolerant mechanism. for accommodating the perturbed input signal. Analyzing four types of collision warning demonstrated that collision warning distance with drowsy driving will be prolonged to be a longer distance comparing with the one with normal driving and collision warning level raise to a higher level for those associated with the middle level of collision warning. Several tests have verified systems reliability and validity based on statistics. Experimental results show that our proposed approach out performs two current well-known collision warning systems (AWS-Mobileye and ACWS-Delphi) due to short detection time (less than 0.6 seconds) and the best reduced accident rate (above 70%).", "paper_title": "SIMULATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE COLLISION WARNING SYSTEM FOR MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY USING EMBEDDED ANFIS PREDICTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100014"}
