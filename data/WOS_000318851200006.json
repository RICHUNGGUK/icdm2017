The intractability of these problems plays a key role in the security of the class of public key cryptographic constructions based on linear recurring sequences. We de fine new discrete logarithm, Diffie-Hellman and decisional Diffie-Hellman problems for any nontrivial linear recurring sequence in any finite field whose minimal polynomial is irreducible. Then, we prove that these problems are polynomially equivalent to the discrete logarithm, Diffie-Hellman and decisional Diffie-Hellman problems in the subgroup generated by any root of the minimal polynomial of the sequence.", "paper_title": "DISCRETE LOGARITHM LIKE PROBLEMS AND LINEAR RECURRING SEQUENCES", "paper_id": "WOS:000318851200006"}
