A liver material model, derived from laboratory experiments, was implemented as a viscoelastic material. A finite element simulation of this laboratory test confirmed the accuracy of the liver material model. This material model was then used as the tissue model to study wheel performance. A helical wheel moving on the liver model was used to replicate laboratory experiments that included several different slip ratios and applied loads. The drawbar force produced in this model showed good agreement with the physical tests. These results have provided the baseline for studying how changes in wheel geometry, such as tread height, tread spacing and wheel diameter, affect drawbar force and ultimately wheel performance. These results will be used in future surgical robot wheel designs.", "paper_title": "The development of a material model and wheel-tissue interaction for simulating wheeled surgical robot mobility", "paper_id": "WOS:000263717100012"}
