In this paper, one-state on-off intermittency and two-state on-off intermittency are observed in two five-dimensional continuum systems, respectively, where each system has a two-dimensional subsystem driven by the chaotic Chen system. The phenomenon of intermingled basins is observed below the blowout bifurcation. Basic statistical properties of the intermittency axe investigated. It is shown that the distribution of the laminar phase follows a -3/2 power law, and that of the burst amplitudes follows a -1 power law, consistent with the basic statistical chaxacteristics of on-off intermittency.", "paper_title": "ON-OFF INTERMITTENCY IN CONTINUUM SYSTEMS DRIVEN BY THE CHEN SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000260388800003"}
