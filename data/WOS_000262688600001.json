We are interested in two types of non-stationary noise that may be present during test, namely slowly varying and abruptly varying noises. The context of our work is the Stochastic Matching framework. The Stochastic Matching compensation method transforms test data using ail affine compensation function whose parameters are computed off-line. Stochastic Matching approaches are interesting since they make little assumptions about the nature and the level of the noise but they are best suited for the compensation of stationary noise. In this paper we propose an original contribution to the Stochastic Matching framework. It is based oil an on-line frame-synchronous version of Stochastic Matching method to compensate for slowly varying noise. Our contribution extends this compensation algorithm in order to compensate for abruptly varying noise. The basic idea of the proposed methods is to perform the compensation and the recognition steps at the same time. The environment changes are identified using monitoring algorithms. The performance of our proposed methods is evaluated oil two speech databases, one recorded in moving cars (VODIS), and another one obtained by corrupting VOIDIS with abruptly varying noise from NOISEX. The proposed approaches significantly outperform classical compensation methods (Off-line Stochastic Matching, Sequential Mean Cep-strum Removal, Parallel Model Combination, Spectral Subtraction). For instance, we obtain up to 32.6% word error rate reduction over S-MCR oil database corrupted by a 10 dB abruptly varying white noise. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
