In this paper, we introduce a pre-processing step that eliminates data points from the training data that are not crucial for clustering. Pre-processing is efficiently implemented using the R*-tree data structure. Experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets show that pre-processing drastically decreases the run-time of the clustering algorithm. Also, in many cases reduction in the number of support vectors is achieved. Further, we suggest an improvement for the step of identification of clusters. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
