Multipower domain design is widely used for low-power and high-performance applications. Data transfer between power domains needs a cross-power domain interface (CPDI). The existing level-conversion flip-flop (LCFF) structures all need dual power rails, which lead to large area and performance overhead. In this article, we propose a scanable CPDI circuit, utilizing monolithic 3D technology. This interface functions as a flip-flop and provides reliable data conversion from one power domain to another. It has a built-in scan feature, which makes it a testable design. Our design separates power rails in each tier, substantially reducing physical design complexity and area penalty. The design is implemented in a 20nm, 28nm, and 45nm low-power technology. It shows a 20%-35% smaller insertion delay compared to normal designs. This proposed design also shows scalability and better energy consumption than previous LCFF circuits.", "paper_title": "Testable Cross-Power Domain Interface (CPDI) Circuit Design in Monolithic 3D Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424100005"}
