In our model, Message 1 that is known just to Encoder 1 should be decoded by both receivers. Message 2-known only to Encoder 2-should be decoded by Decoder 2 and kept as secret as possible from Decoder 1. The uncertainty of Decoder 1 about Message 2 is measured by means of the equivocation rate. In addition, a noisy feedback is provided to Encoder 2. We derive an achievable rate-equivocation region for this model and an outer bound for the \"noisy cribbing\" regime without secrecy, the gap being the Markov conditions satisfied by one of the auxiliary random variables. Furthermore, we consider a simplified causal cognitive interference model: the interference channel with a cribbing encoder. We derive an inner bound on the rate region for this model and prove that when the interference channel is degraded conditionally on the input of Encoder 1, our inner bound is tight.", "paper_title": "The Discrete Memoryless Interference Channel With One-Sided Generalized Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000321925900007"}
