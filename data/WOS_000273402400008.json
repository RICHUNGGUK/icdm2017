(The 11th Annual International Symposium on Algorithms and Computation (ISAAC 2000), pp. 539-551, 2000) introduced the notion of a k -phylogenetic root. A k-phylogenetic root of a graph G is a tree T such that the leaves of T are the vertices of G, two vertices are adjacent in G precisely if they are within distance k in T, and all non-leaf vertices of T have degree at least three. The k-phylogenetic root problem is to decide whether such a tree T exists for a given graph G. In addition to introducing this problem, Lin et al. designed linear time constructive algorithms for ka parts per thousand currency sign4, while left the problem open for ka parts per thousand yen5. In this paper, we partially fill this hole by giving a linear time constructive algorithm to decide whether a given tree chordal graph has a 5-phylogenetic root; this is the largest class of graphs known to have such a construction.", "paper_title": "Linear time construction of 5-phylogenetic roots for tree chordal graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000273402400008"}
