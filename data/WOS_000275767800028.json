It is essential to increase the capability of the fault-tolerance and reliability of a wormhole network, to cope with the influence of faulty components and to reach a common agreement in the presence of faults before performing certain tasks. However, the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems. In this study, a protocol for achieving the task of agreement between nodes in a wormhole network is proposed. The proposed protocol is referred to as the Wormhole Agreement Protocol (WAP). In this study, it is demonstrated to make each correct node reach an agreement and to cope with the influence from faulty components in a wormhole network", "paper_title": "REACHING AN AGREEMENT UNDER WORMHOLE NETWORKS WITHIN DUAL FAILURE COMPONENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800028"}
