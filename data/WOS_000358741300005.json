This problem is known to be NP-complete, even when restricted to planar graphs or interval graphs. Moreover, although the problem is fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by k due to a celebrated result by Robertson and Seymour, it is known not to admit a polynomial kernel unless NP subset of coNP/poly. We prove that DISJOINT PATHS remains NP-complete on split graphs, and show that the problem admits a kernel with O(k(2)) vertices when restricted to this graph class. We furthermore prove that, on split graphs, the edge-disjoint variant of the problem is also NP-complete and admits a kernel with O(k(3)) vertices. To the best of our knowledge, our kernelization results are the first non-trivial kernelization results for these problems on graph classes.", "paper_title": "Finding Disjoint Paths in Split Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000358741300005"}
