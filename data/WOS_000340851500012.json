The mixture model consists of variable-density mass and momentum equations and uses a barotropic equation of state for the density that depends on only the local static pressure and the vapor pressure of the liquid. In that case, the primary equations are homogeneous, and a conventional hybrid multistage explicit method based on central differencing and second- and fourth-order scalar artificial dissipation can be applied to solve both the primary and adjoint systems. Results are presented for both surface- and volume-based vapor minimization cost functions for a two-dimensional cavitating hydrofoil in which the geometry is parameterized using B-splines. The cost function gradients computed using the adjoint method are shown to compare well with gradients computed using the complex-step method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
