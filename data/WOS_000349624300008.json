Xu et al. (2007) [1] fails to obtain the stable solutions to the stable linear dynamical systems with fuzzy initial conditions. As it will be explained, this shortcoming is caused by neglecting to move the stability property of the fuzzy system to the quasi-level-wise system. Moreover, to handle this, another approach is proposed similar to the previous one for the stable and unstable systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
