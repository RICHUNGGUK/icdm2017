Starting with a random graph G generated by some rule, form an auxiliary graph G' whose vertices are the k-cliques of G, in which two vertices are joined if the corresponding cliques share k - 1 vertices. They considered in particular the case where G = G(n, p), and found heuristically the threshold function p = p(n) above which a giant component appears in G'. Here we give a rigorous proof of this result, as well as many extensions. The model turns out to be very interesting due to the essential global dependence present in G'.
