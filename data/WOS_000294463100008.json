We show that this phenomenon occurs when the singular point s is located at the midpoint of each subinterval and obtain the corresponding supercovergence analysis. Then we apply the rule to construct a collocation scheme for solving the relevant hypersingular integral equation, by choosing the midpoints as the collocation points. It's interesting that the inverse of coefficient matrix for the resulting linear system has an explicit expression, by which an optimal error estimate is established. At last, some numerical experiments are presented to confirm the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of a certain hypersingular integral equation of the first kind", "paper_id": "WOS:000294463100008"}
