The range problem for the theory H asks whether a closed term has always (up to equality in H) either an infinite range or a singleton range (that is, it is a constant function). Here we give a solution to a natural version of this problem, giving a positive answer for the theory H restricted to Combinatory Logic. The method of proof applies also to the Lazy lambda-Calculus.", "paper_title": "Solution to the Range Problem for Combinatory Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000297871900004"}
