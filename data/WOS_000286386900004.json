Usually some text is unnecessary. Thus, one requires an approach to remove the text and complete the video. However, few conventional approaches complete the video well due to the large-sized text, structure regions, and various types of videos. In response, this study designed a text-video completion algorithm that poses text-video completion as structure repair and texture propagation. To repair the structure regions, the structure interpolation uses the new model's rotated block matching to estimate the initial location of completed regions and later refine the coordinates of completed regions. The information in the neighboring frames then fills the structure regions. To complete the structure regions without tedious manual interaction, the structure extension utilizes the spline curve estimation. Afterwards, derivative propagation realizes the texture region completion. The experiment results are based on several real TV programs, where all of the text regions were completed with spatio-temporal consistency. Additionally, comparisons present that the performance of the proposed algorithm is superior to those of conventional approaches. Its advantages include the reduction of design complexity by only integrating the structure information in multi-frame and the demonstration of structure consistency for realistic videos.", "paper_title": "Text-Video Completion Using Structure Repair and Texture Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286386900004"}
