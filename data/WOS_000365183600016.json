Then we give the qualitative and quantitative descriptions of the entanglement dynamics of the quantum states in Grover's search algorithm. Our results show that for most instances (1) the separable degrees of these states and ranges of their maximum Schmidt numbers are invariable by following the dynamics of Grover's search algorithm; (2) the dynamics of Grover's search algorithm is almost \"filled\" by the fully entangled states.", "paper_title": "Multipartite entanglement in Grover's search algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000365183600016"}
