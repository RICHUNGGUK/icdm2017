The traffic identification on VoIP applications becomes an important issue in network management and traffic analysis. In this paper, a new traffic identification scheme, which combines traffic flow statistic analysis with host behavior estimation, is proposed to identify the VoIP traffic at the transport layer of the Internet. The host IP addresses and the port numbers are examined as the host behavior to distinguish the VoIP traffic from traditional traffic flows. The packet size has been modeled by a function of entropy while the inter-packet time has been modeled by the self-adaptive estimation. The experiment results show that our scheme could obtain a stable performance. At the same time, the proposed scheme could maintain its validity when existing VoIP applications are updated or the new ones admitted. Both accuracy and flexibility can be improved.", "paper_title": "A VoIP Traffic Identification Scheme Based on Host and Flow Behavior Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000287527200007"}
