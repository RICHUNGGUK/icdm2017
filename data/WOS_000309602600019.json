Online news is offered combined with relevant service attributes such as pictures, small text, users' recommendations, etc. We previously investigated the Web user's choice of online news, focusing on the trade-offs between reputation and other service attributes, which may explain the user's choice of an unknown source, such as a blog. In the present study, we investigate the Web user's choice of online news in a multi-attribute context. Our findings indicate that the most important service attribute is the accompanying text, followed by the source's reputation, then the percentage of readers recommending or having read the link, and then the picture. We further explore the trade-offs between the attributes through simulations. These findings provide useful insights to practitioners on how to use the service attributes in the framing strategies in order to increase the probability of the choice of online news.
