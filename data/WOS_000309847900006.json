Its integrates novel computational tools, running from medical image processing to numerical simulation and visualization. As a simulation tool, it allows to accommodate complex physiological and/or pathophysiological (virtual) scenarios aimed to retrieve detailed information from the numerical computations. Such application makes possible to speed up research in the study and analysis of the cardiovascular system and, to provide a virtual laboratory for medical training and education, and specialized Human Resources development. In order to demonstrate the modeling and simulation capabilities of HeMoLab some cases of use are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
