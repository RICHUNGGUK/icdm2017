Although multiobjective optimization (MOO) has to a considerable extent been successfully applied to enhance crashworthiness of vehicular structures, majority of existing designs were restricted to single or uniform thin-walled components. Limited attention has been paid to such non-uniform components as TWB structures. In this paper, MOO of a multi-component TWB structure that involves both the B-pillar and inner door system subjected to a side impact, is proposed by considering the structural weight, intrusive displacements and velocity of the B-pillar component as objectives, and the thickness in different positions and the height of welding line of B-pillar as the design variables. The MOO problem is formulated by using a range of different metamodeling techniques, including response surface methodology (RSM), artificial neural network (ANN), radial basis functions (RBF), and Kriging (KRG), to approximate the sophisticated nonlinear responses. By comparison, it is found that the constructed metamodels based upon the radial basis function (RBF, especially multi-quadric model, namely RBF-MQ) fit to the design of experiment (DoE) checking points well and are employed to carry out the design optimization. The performance of the TWB B-pillar and indoor panel system can be improved by optimizing the thickness of the different parts and height of the welding line. This study demonstrated that the multi-component TWB structure can be optimized to further enhance the crashworthiness and reduce the weight, offering a new class of structural/material configuration for lightweight design.", "paper_title": "Crashworthiness design of multi-component tailor-welded blank (TWB) structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000325079300013"}
