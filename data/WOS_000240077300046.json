In this problem we are given bins of capacity B with C compartments, and n items of Q different classes. The problem is to pack the items into the minimum number of bins, where each bin contains items of at most C different classes and has total items size at most B. We present several approximation algorithms for off-line and online versions of the problem.", "paper_title": "The class constrained bin packing problem with applications to video-on-demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300046"}
