The rise in complexity comes from an increasingly complex set of coupled, non-linear equations as well as increasing problem scales, and attempts to encapsulate effects occurring across different time and length scales. Portability, reuse and scalability of code, and solvers in particular, are thus becoming increasingly important for the community. This paper analyses the scalability of fundamental and highly reused components within a suite of geodynamics codes that utilize the Particle-In-Cell Finite Element Method. The components demonstrate highly scalable domain-decomposed meshes and particle swarms. Performance measures of processor counts, mesh and swarm sizes, and the size/number of state variables are provided, together with factors that can affect scalability (especially 3D decompositions).
