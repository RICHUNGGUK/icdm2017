Several machine learning (ML) methods have been proposed in the literature as a promising solution to this problem. Surprisingly, very few works have studied the traffic classification problem with Sampled Net Flow data. However, Sampled Net-Flow is a widely extended monitoring solution among network operators. In this paper we aim to fulfill this gap. First, we analyze the performance of current ML methods with Net-Flow by adapting a popular ML-based technique. The results show that, although the adapted method is able to obtain similar accuracy than previous packet-based methods (approximate to 90%), its accuracy degrades drastically in the presence of sampling. In order to reduce this impact, we propose a solution to network operators that is able to operate with Sampled Net Flow data and achieve good accuracy in the presence of sampling.
