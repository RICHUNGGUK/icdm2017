Mating of a wire harness onto a car body is among the representative tasks. Academically, this kind of problems are known as automatic manipulation of deformable linear objects. Previous technical approaches for solving the problem is characterized by employment of multiple contactless sensors and complex sensor based algorithms. These attempts are verified to be feasible only for simplified environments. The dependence of the approaches on real-time measurement to the state of the deformable targets limits their application in practical factory environment. In this paper, it is proposed to utilize wire tracing operation in recognizing the wire harness for the purpose of automatic mating. This method is inspired from the behaviors of humans demonstrated when they deal with similar problems. The proposed method is implemented and verified in a robot system. The feasibility and effectiveness demonstrated in the preliminary experiments show the potential of the proposed method for substantially simplifying the wire recognition problems which is thought to be crucial for practices in factory environments.
