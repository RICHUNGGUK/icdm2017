However, the various methods of developing knowledge maps mostly depend on unsystematic processes and the judgment of domain experts with a wide range of untapped information. Thus, this research aims to propose a new approach to generate knowledge maps by mining document databases that have hardly been examined, thereby enabling an automatic development process and the extraction of significant implications from the maps. To this end, the accepted research proposal database of the Korea Research Foundation (KRF), which includes a huge knowledge repository of research, is investigated for inducing a keyword-based knowledge map. During the developmental process, text mining plays an important role in extracting meaningful information from documents, and network analysis is applied to visualize the relations between research categories and measure the value of network indices. Five types of knowledge maps (core R&D map, R&D trend map, R&D concentration map, R&D relation map, and R&D cluster map) are developed to explore the main research themes, monitor research trends, discover relations between R&D areas, regions, and universities, and derive clusters of research categories. The results can be used to establish a policy to support promising R&D areas and devise a long-term research plan.", "paper_title": "Development and application of a keyword-based knowledge map for effective R&D planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000283090300012"}
