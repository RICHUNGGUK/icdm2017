The control law to track the pitch rate command is developed based on system theory. Neural network with linear filters and back propagation through time learning algorithm is used to approximate the control law. The bounded signal requirement to develop the neural controller is circumvented using an off-line finite time training scheme, which provides the necessary stability and tracking performances. On-line learning scheme is implemented to compensate for uncertainties due to variation in aerodynamic coefficients, control surface failures and also variations in center of gravity position. The performance of the proposed control scheme is validated at different flight conditions. The disturbance rejection capability of the neural controller is analyzed in the presence of the realistic gust and sensor noises. Hardware-in-loop simulation is also carried out to study the behavior of control surface deflections in real-time. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
