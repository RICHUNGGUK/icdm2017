Firstly, the moving human figures are subtracted using simple background modeling to obtain binary silhouettes. Secondly, these silhouettes are characterized with three kinds of gait representations including Fourier descriptor, wavelet descriptor and pseudo-Zernike moment. Then, ICA and GFSVM classifier are chosen for recognition and the method is tested on two gait databases. Comparative performance between these feature representations is investigated and better performance has been achieved than either one individually. Meanwhile, one multiple views fusion recognition approach on the decision level based on product of sum (POS) rule is introduced to overcome the limitation of most single view recognition methods, which achieves better performance than the traditional rank-based fusion rules. Experimental results show that our method has encouraging recognition accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
