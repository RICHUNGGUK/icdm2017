Microsoft issued a patch that allegedly fixed the problem so that the patched Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 now implement the Wichmann-Hill RNG, as least according to Microsoft. We show that whatever RNG it is that Microsoft has implemented in these versions of Excel, it is not the Wichmann-Hill RNG. Microsoft has now failed twice to implement the dozen lines of code that define the Wichmann-Hill RNG. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
