We define formal models for such execution traces, allowing to capture various realistic scenarios of partial information about these traces. We then define corresponding notions of types, and the problems of type inference and type checking in this context. We further provide a comprehensive study of the decidability and complexity of these problems, in various cases, and suggest efficient algorithms where possible.", "paper_title": "Type inference and type checking for queries over execution traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000299170700003"}
