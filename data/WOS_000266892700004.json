Contrary to expectations, we find that the academic community was not the protagonist in the early stages of Mexican scientific practices, but that there was a strong contribution coming from researchers associated with the public-health sector and the chemical and mining industries. We were able to identify in this half century four different modes of scientific production: amateur, institutional, academic, and industrial, which in turn correspond to distinct stages in the evolution of the Mexican scientific production. We characterize these modes of production with a variety of indicators: publication and citation patterns, author output, journal and subject categories, institutional collaborations, and geographical distribution.", "paper_title": "Early Patterns of Scientific Production by Mexican Researchers in Mainstream Journals, 1900-1950", "paper_id": "WOS:000266892700004"}
