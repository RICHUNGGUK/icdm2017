New similarity descriptors are result of comparision RDFs at different intervals. In a practical example we used RDFs similarity descriptors to correlate the CBG activity of steroids. The models with high internal predictivity measured with Q(2) have been reported in this work. On the other hand applicabilty of this method for QSAR modeling is rather limited due the fact that few descriptors apearing in proposed models are selected from very large pool of RDF similarity descriptors (217 descriptors vs 31 compounds) this may lead to chance correlation and missleading statistics.", "paper_title": "Similarity of radial distribution function's intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000242725300003"}
