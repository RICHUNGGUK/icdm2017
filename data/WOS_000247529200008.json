A sensor node saves energy by suspending its sensing and communication activities according to a Markovian stochastic process. We show that a power level to induce a coverage radius w(n)/n is sufficient for connectivity provided that w (n) -> infinity. The paper presents a Markov model and its solution for steady state distributions to determine the operation of a single node. Given the steady state probabilities, we construct a non-linear optimization problem to minimize the power consumption. Simulation studies to examine the collective behavior of large number of sensor nodes produce results that are predicted by the analytical model.", "paper_title": "Joint problem of power optimal connectivity and coverage in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000247529200008"}
