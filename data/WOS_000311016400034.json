In this short communication, a new optimal consensus method with minimum cost in fuzzy GDM is proposed. The main contribution of our work is that the limit of each expert's compromise is under consideration in the process of reaching group consensus. The numerical example shows the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
