This approach is based on a formal model of on-line conversations and a set of ranking measures including SNA centrality metrics, time-related conversational metrics and other specific features of current microblogging sites. The ranking approach has been compared to other methods and tested on two well known social network sites (Twitter and Friendfeed) showing that the inclusion of SNA metrics in the ranking function and the usage of a model of conversation can improve the results of search tasks.", "paper_title": "Conversation retrieval for microblogging sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000304307800008"}
