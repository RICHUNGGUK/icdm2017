However, to improve the system-user interaction, it seems more adequate to express these linguistic weights and degrees by means of unbalanced linguistic scales, that is, linguistic term sets with different discrimination levels on both sides of the middle linguistic term. In this contribution we present an information retrieval system that accepts weighted queries whose weights are expressed using unbalanced linguistic term sets. Then, the system provides the retrieved documents classified in linguistic relevance classes assessed on unbalanced linguistic term sets. To do so, we propose a methodology to manage unbalanced linguistic information and we use the linguistic 2-tuple model as the representation base of the unbalanced linguistic information. Additionally, the linguistic 2-tuple model allows us to increase the number of relevance classes in the output and also to improve the performance of the information retrieval system.
