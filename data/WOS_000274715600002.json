Inhibition of HSP90 represents a new target of antitumor therapy, since it may influence many specific signaling pathways. Many HSP90 inhibitors bind to the ATP-binding pocket, inhibit chaperone function, resulting in cell death. Recent clinical trials for treatment of cancer have put HSP90's importance into focus and have highlighted the need for full scale research into HSP90 related pathways. Here we report five novel HSP90 inhibitors which were identified by using pharmacophore models and docking studies. We used highly discriminative pharmacophore model as a 3D query to search against database of similar to 1 M compounds and cluster analysis results yielded 455 compounds which were further subjected for docking. Glide docking studies suggested 122 compounds as in silico hits and these compounds were further selected for the cytotoxicity assay in the HSP90-over expressing SKBr3 cell line. Of the 122 compounds tested, 5 compounds inhibited cell growth with an IC(50) value less than 50 mu M. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
