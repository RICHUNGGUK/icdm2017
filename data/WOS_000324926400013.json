The framework allows to capture expressive fluent annotations as well as data awareness in a uniform way. It allows for a declarative specification of a business process but also for encoding processes specified in conventional workflow languages. Verification of temporal properties of a business process, including verification of compliance to business rules, is performed by bounded model checking techniques in Answer Set Programming, extended with constraint solving for dealing with conditions on numeric data.", "paper_title": "Business process verification with constraint temporal answer set programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000324926400013"}
