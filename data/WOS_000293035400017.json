In this work, we present a comparative explicit water molecular dynamics (MD) study on the free and inhibitor-bound HLE. Knowledge of the flexibility and conformational changes induced by this irreversible inhibitor, whether in a prebound stage or covalently bound at the enzyme binding site, encases fundamental biological interest and is particularly relevant to ongoing structure-based drug design studies. Our results suggest that HLE operates by an induced-fit mechanism with direct intervention of a surface loop which is open toward the solvent in the free enzyme and closed while in the presence of the ligand. MM-PBSA free energy calculations furthermore elucidate the energetic contributions to the distinct conformations adopted by this loop. Additionally, a survey of the major contributions to the inhibitor binding free energies was attained. Our findings enforce the need to account for HLE flexibility, whether through the use of MD-generated ensembles of HLE conformations as targets for molecular docking or via sophisticated flexible-docking algorithms. We anticipate that inclusion of the observed HLE dynamic behavior into future drug design methodologies will have a relevant impact in the development of novel, more efficient, inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Characterizing the Dynamics and Ligand-Specific Interactions in the Human Leukocyte Elastase through Molecular Dynamics Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000293035400017"}
