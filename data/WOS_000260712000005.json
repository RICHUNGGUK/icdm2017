In this note we argue that the classical security notion for standard public key encryption schemes does not suffice for DD-PKE schemes. and propose a new natural definition. Additionally, we illustrate the usefulness of the new security definition by showing that a DD-PKE scheme presented in the workshop Selected Areas in Cryptography 2005 is insecure tinder this augmented security notion.
