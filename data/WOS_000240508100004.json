By using the Lyapunov method, some useful criteria of global exponential stability for the systems are derived. These stability conditions are formulated as linear matrix inequalities ( LMIs) which can easily be solved by various convex optimization algorithms. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the application of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability analysis for neutral delay-differential systems: an LMI approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240508100004"}
