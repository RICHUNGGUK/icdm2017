Transfer learning, which has successfully addressed the cross-domain classification or recognition problem. is presented for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition. First, by using the maximum mean discrepancy embedding (WADE) optimization and dimension reduction algorithms, two close low-dimensional feature spaces are obtained for source and target speech corpora, respectively. Then, a classifier function is trained using the learned low-dimensional features in the labeled source corpus, and directly applied to the unlabeled target corpus for emotion label recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the transfer learning method can significantly outperform the traditional automatic recognition technique for cross-corpus speech emotion recognition.", "paper_title": "Speech Emotion Recognition Using Transfer Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784600037"}
