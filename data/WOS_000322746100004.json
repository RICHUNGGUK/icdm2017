The security of our scheme is based on the difficulty of the elliptic curve discrete algorithm problem. Therefore, it offers much smaller key lengths for the desired security levels, along with much faster cryptographic processes, leading to fewer hardware and software requirements. According to our simulation results, the relative performance improvement of our proposed BDS scheme is up to 96% when compared with previously proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "A blind digital signature scheme using elliptic curve digital signature algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000322746100004"}
