Recently, objectives like the average cost or the longtime peak power consumption of a system have been modeled by weighted automata which are not semiring weighted anymore. Instead, operations like limit superior, limit average, or discounting are used to determine the behavior of these automata. Here, we introduce a new class of weight structures subsuming a range of these models as well as semirings. Our main result shows that such weighted automata and Kleene-type regular expressions are expressively equivalent both for finite and infinite words.", "paper_title": "WEIGHTED AUTOMATA AND REGULAR EXPRESSIONS OVER VALUATION MONOIDS: Dedicated to Werner Kuich on the occasion of his 70th birthday", "paper_id": "WOS:000299094200006"}
