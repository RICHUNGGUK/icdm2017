Current research efforts are therefore targeting the efficient realization of a flexible radio interface and network architecture. The wide range of application scenarios seems to prohibit a \"one radio interface fits all\" solution. Instead, it requires a multitude of solutions tailored for,specific communication environments. Ideally, these solutions-are related radio interface in odes that have a common technology basis. This article presents:a protocol reference architecture that enables,the efficient integration of multiple such modes in a complementary way. This architecture essentially benefits from the commonalities between these modes. Hence it facilitates the coexistence and cooperation of different modes in all devices of a future relay-based radio access network: user terminals, access points, and relay nodes. This article focuses on the realization, of the multimode capability of user and control planes and the related management of the protocols of a flexible radio interface. A proof of concept and its evaluation are presented at the example of relay-based 4G broadband networks and IEEE. 802.16 (WiMAX).", "paper_title": "Efficient multimode protocol architecture for complementary radio interfaus in relay-based 4G networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238547100005"}
