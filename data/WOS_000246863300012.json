The algorithm integrates uniform design (UD) and mapping distance. An effective yet simple measurement of uniformity of a set of points, namely k-nearest neighbor, is suggested in the UD. Compared with the available methods, the proposed algorithm does not need any calculation of gradient and assumption of initial point. Furthermore, this algorithm has a high convergence rate and is not sensitive to the size of circuit. Therefore, it can be utilized to optimize the nominal performance as well as improve parametric yield. The efficiency of this algorithm is illustrated with two circuit examples.", "paper_title": "A novel optimization method for parametric yield: Uniform design mapping distance algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000246863300012"}
