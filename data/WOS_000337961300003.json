In some situations, attentional tunneling is likely to appear and leads to excessive focus and poor decision making. In this study, we propose a formal approach to detect the occurrence of such an attentional impairment that is based on machine learning techniques. An experiment was conducted to provoke attentional tunneling during which psycho-physiological and oculomotor data from 23 participants were collected. Data from 18 participants were used to train an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). From a machine learning point of view, the classification performance of the trained ANFIS proved the validity of this approach. Furthermore, the resulting classification rules were consistent with the attentional tunneling literature. Finally, the classifier was robust to detect attentional tunneling when performing over test data from four participants.", "paper_title": "Formal Detection of Attentional Tunneling in Human Operator-Automation Interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000337961300003"}
