We present techniques to exploit the recently proposed hybrid-double multipliers for fast inversions in binary fields GF(2(m)) with normal bases. A hybrid-double multiplier computes a double multiplication, the product of three elements in GF(2(m)) , with a latency comparable to the latency of single multiplication of two elements. Traditional approaches, such as Itoh-Tsujii, cannot utilize hybrid-double multipliers. We devise a new inversion algorithm based on ternary representations that exploits their potential. The algorithm reduces the latency of inversion significantly for the fields recommended by NIST if hybrid-double multipliers are employed. For example, the algorithm computes an inversion in GF(2(163)) with only five double multiplications whereas the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm requires nine single or double multiplications. We propose a new inverter architecture using this new algorithm and a hybrid-double multiplier. We show that it is faster than the existing techniques by providing ASIC synthesis results using 65-nm CMOS technology. For example, our inverter for GF(2(163)) achieves about 34 percent shorter computation time than an inverter using the Itoh-Tsujii algorithm and a single multiplier.", "paper_title": "Fast Inversion in GF(2(m)) with Normal Basis Using Hybrid-Double Multipliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000333472500020"}
