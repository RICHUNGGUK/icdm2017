The antenna orientation and beamwidth of each sectorized cell can be estimated by the precise determination of valid fingerprints. The proposed iterative fingerprint data management detects the valid fingerprints and makes a coherently compensated fingerprint per grid. A proper weighting scheme for linear regression approach can efficiently estimate the sectorized cell configuration of each base station without difficult manual field measurements. The mobile service providers can economically plan network configurations and manage subscribers using these advances in the estimation of sectorized cell configuration. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
