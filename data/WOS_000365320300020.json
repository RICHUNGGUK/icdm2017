A novel distributed control law based on internal reference models is first presented for output consensus of heterogeneous discrete-time multiagent systems without structural uncertainties, where internal reference models embedded in controllers are designed with the objective of reducing communication costs. Then based on the distributed internal reference models and the well-known internal model principle, a distributed control law is further presented for output consensus of heterogeneous discrete-time multiagent systems with structural uncertainties. It is shown in both cases that the consensus trajectory of the internal reference models determines the output trajectories of agents. Finally, numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control schemes.", "paper_title": "Output Consensus of Heterogeneous Linear Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems With Structural Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000365320300020"}
