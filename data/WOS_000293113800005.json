We extend this property to the bivariate Bernstein basis over a triangle domain for constructing triangular Bezier surfaces, and prove that this good property is satisfied with the triangular Bernstein basis in the case of uniform parameters. Due to the particular advantages of triangular Bezier surfaces or rational triangular Bezier surfaces in CAD (computer aided design), it has wide application prospects in reverse engineering.
