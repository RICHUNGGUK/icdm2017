They search for images that are not only perceptually similar but replicas of an image generated through mild image processing operations. In this paper, we examine the use of color descriptors based on a 24-color quantized palette for image fingerprinting. Comparisons are provided between different similarity measures methods as well as regarding the use of color-only and spatial chromatic histograms.", "paper_title": "Color features for image fingerprinting", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100051"}
