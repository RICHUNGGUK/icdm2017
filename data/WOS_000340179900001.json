The Gaussian kernel function is used to evaluate the similarity between nodes, and the location of the unknown nodes will be commonly decided by all the nodes within communication radius through selection of sparse preserve projection self-adaptation and maintaining of the topological structure between adjacent nodes. Therefore, the algorithm can effectively solve the nonlinear problem while ranging, and it becomes less affected by the measuring error and beacon nodes quantity.", "paper_title": "A Graph Embedding Method Based on Sparse Representation for Wireless Sensor Network Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000340179900001"}
