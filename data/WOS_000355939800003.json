Our main result shows that Max-Cut parameterized above the Edwards-ErdAs bound is fixed-parameter tractable: we give an algorithm that for any connected graph with n vertices and m edges finds a cut of size in time 2 (O(k))a <...n (4), or decides that no such cut exists. This answers a long-standing open question from parameterized complexity that has been posed a number of times over the past 15 years. Our algorithm has asymptotically optimal running time, under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, and is strengthened by a polynomial-time computable kernel of polynomial size.", "paper_title": "Max-Cut Parameterized Above the Edwards-ErdAs Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000355939800003"}
