The mixed delays mean the simultaneous presence of both the discrete delay, and the distributive delay. Furthermore, the parameter of matrix is taken values in a interval and controlled by a unknown, but bounded function. By using a suitable Lyapunov-Krasovskii function with the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, we obtain a sufficient condition to ensure the global robust exponential stability for the interval BAM neural networks with mixed delays under uncertainty, which is more generalized and less conservative, restrictive than previous results. In the last section, the validity of our stability result is demonstrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "Global robust exponential stability of interval BAM neural network with mixed delays under uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000244454200003"}
