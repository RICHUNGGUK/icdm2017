With various key performance indicator ratios to spun the input, space, we applied the SOM algorithm to project the multi-dimensional performance ratio data onto the two-dimensional lattice grid of SOM and construct performance analysis maps of Indian industries. The trajectory movement of various industry groups, on the SOM plane during this period, has also been examined. The study reveals interesting features and patterns of the changing face of Indian industries in the backdrop of global liberalization.", "paper_title": "STUDYING THE IMPACT OF POLICY REFORMS ON INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT IN INDIA USING SELF-ORGANIZING MAPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260173300002"}
