The uncertain inner coupling under consideration is characterized in terms of the interval matrix. In order to save the communication and computation resources, the event-based mechanism is adopted and the event-triggered synchronization control scheme is proposed for the complex networks. First, we transform the event-triggered synchronization control problem into the exponential stabilization problem for a new class of dynamical systems with multiple delays. Then, by employing the Lyapunov stability theory, we derive a sufficient condition under which the multi-delayed system is exponentially stable. Subsequently, a set of event-triggered synchronization controllers is designed in terms of the solution to a linear matrix inequality that can be solved effectively by using available software. Finally, a numerical simulation example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed event-triggered control scheme.", "paper_title": "Event-triggered synchronization control for complex networks with uncertain inner coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100008"}
