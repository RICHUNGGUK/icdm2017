A new performance evaluation link cognitive cooperation air time metric (LCCATM) and a novel cross layer multicarrier MIMO cognitive cooperation scheme are proposed. The proposed scheme integrated the attributes both of the new performance evaluation of the cooperative diversity and the attributes of the topology space. With the help of the proposed scheme, the cooperative ability of the networks is not only cognitive, but also topology aware. The average achievable sum rates and the outage probability of the networks are all examined with the cross layer constraints. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme can enhance the average rate performance and make the outage probability stable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
