The proposed control method minimizes not only the switching loss by operating like a pure buck or boost converter, but also the conduction loss by reducing the average inductor current even when four switches are used. Digital dither control is introduced to implement a buffer region for smooth transition between buck and boost modes. A minimum ripple dither with higher fundamental frequency is adopted to decrease the output voltage ripple. A window delay-line analog to digital converter (ADC) with delay calibration is achieved to digitalize the control voltage. The step-up/step-down DC-DC converter has been designed with a standard 0.5 mu m CMOS process. The output voltage is regulated within the input voltage ranged from 2.5 V to 5.5 V, and the output voltage ripple is reduced to less than 25 mV during the mode transition. The peak power efficiency is 96%, and the maximum load current can reach 800 mA.", "paper_title": "A High Efficiency Hybrid Step-Up/Step-Down DC-DC Converter Using Digital Dither for Smooth Transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800024"}
