However, the order of the filter to be modeled is a key factor for determining the computational load for the adaptive algorithms associated with active noise control (ANC), particularly for multi-channel algorithms. In this letter, the relationships, among the filter's order, the plant modeling error and the location of poles for the transfer functions of the physical paths in an ANC system are theoretically examined and numerical examples are given to verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "An investigation on the plant modeling filter's parameters for active noise control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500060"}
