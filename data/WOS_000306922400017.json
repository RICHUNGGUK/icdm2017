By exploiting Fibonacci number system, we propose a family of Fibonacci coding techniques for crosstalk avoidance, relate them to some of the existing crosstalk avoidance techniques, and show how the encoding logic of one technique can be modified to generate codewords of the other technique.", "paper_title": "Fibonacci Codes for Crosstalk Avoidance", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400017"}
