We show that the logic of time based on the real numbers in this language is finitely axiomatizable, answering an implicit question of Shehtman (1993). We also show that the logic has PSPACE-complete complexity, but is not Kripke complete and has no strongly complete axiomatization.", "paper_title": "On the Priorean temporal logic with 'around now' over the real line", "paper_id": "WOS:000343398800003"}
