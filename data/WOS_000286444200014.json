The parametrization process was performed with a large, diverse set of solvation free energies that included highly polar and ionic molecules. The mean absolute error for 1200 solvation free energies of the 379 neutral molecules in 9 organic solvents and water was 0.40 kcal/mol, and for 90 hydration free energies of ions was 1.7 kcal/mol. Overall, the calculated solvation free energies of a wide range of solute functional groups in diverse solvents were consistent with experimental data.", "paper_title": "Calculation of the Solvation Free Energy of Neutral and Ionic Molecules in Diverse Solvents", "paper_id": "WOS:000286444200014"}
