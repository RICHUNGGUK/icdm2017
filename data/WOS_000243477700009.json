The transition probabilities evolve, as time goes by, along the trajectory of an ergodic Markovian environment, whereas the spatial parameter just acts on long runs. Our model complements the one considered by Guillotin-Plantard and Schott (Random Struct Algorithm 21 (2002) 3-4, 371-396) where transitions are governed by a dynamical system, and appears as a new (small) step towards more general time and space dependent protocols. Our analysis relies on well-known techniques from stochastic homogenization theory and investigates the asymptotic behavior of the resealed algorithm as the total amount of resources available for allocation tends to infinity. In the two-dimensional setting, we manage to exhibit three different possible regimes for the deadlock time of the limit system. To the best of our knowledge, the way we distinguish these regimes is completely new. We interpret our results in terms of stabilization of the algorithm.
