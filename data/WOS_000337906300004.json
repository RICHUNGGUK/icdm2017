MKL formulations have been devised and solved for a broad spectrum of machine learning problems, including multitask learning (MTL). Solving different MKL formulations usually involves designing algorithms that are tailored to the problem at hand, which is, typically, a nontrivial accomplishment. In this paper we present a general multitask multiple kernel learning (MT-MKL) framework that subsumes well-known MT-MKL formulations, as well as several important MKL approaches on single-task problems. We then derive a simple algorithm that can solve the unifying framework. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed framework, we formulate a new learning problem, namely partially-shared common space MT-MKL, and demonstrate its merits through experimentation.", "paper_title": "A Unifying Framework for Typical Multitask Multiple Kernel Learning Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337906300004"}
