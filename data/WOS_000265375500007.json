Moreover, encoding schemes based on beta-complemetary sequences provide very good tradeoff performance between PMEPR and code rate. This observation follows from an intrinsic property of the beta-complementary sequences considered. Furthermore, the distribution of code rate versus beta is determined, and numerical results based on these properties are presented. Finally, comparisons with the well-known Golay complementary sequences and the generalized Golay complementary sequences (called \"G(N)-complementary sequences\" in this paper) are made.", "paper_title": "A novel complementary sequence and PMEPR reduction in OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000265375500007"}
