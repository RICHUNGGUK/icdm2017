We have created a bioinformatics system to extend MapMan to any organism by using a new BIN structure based on the KEGG database. Gene sequences are assigned to this ontology by homology relationships in four reference databases: KEGG, COG, Swiss-Prot and Gene Ontology. We applied this system to tailor MapMan to the GeneChips of two model legumes, Glycine max and Medicago truncatula. We also developed a module to identify the most relevant pathways involved.", "paper_title": "Extending MapMan: application to legume genome arrays", "paper_id": "WOS:000242246300022"}
