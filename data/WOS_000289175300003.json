Due to the complex connections among the arguments, we further give two nonlinear aggregation operators and discuss their properties. Then we extend these aggregation operators to hesitant fuzzy environments in which there are some difficulties in determining the membership of an element to a set. Several numerical examples are used to compare the proposed aggregation operators.", "paper_title": "INDUCED AGGREGATION UNDER CONFIDENCE LEVELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289175300003"}
