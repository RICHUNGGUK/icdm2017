The charge equalizer is a crucial element for an effective use of a Li-ion battery consisting of many series-connected cells. We describe a fully distributed charge equalizer based on a circular balancing bus, which outperforms other recently published approaches. Its safety requirements have formally been verified using a model checker, showing that formal methods and, in particular, the Symbolic Analysis Laboratory environment, can be effective to verify the safety requirements of a BMS.", "paper_title": "Design and Safety Verification of a Distributed Charge Equalizer for Modular Li-Ion Batteries", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800015"}
