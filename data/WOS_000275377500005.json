We develop an effective metaheuristic, simulated annealing with novel operators, to potentially solve the problem. Simulated annealing is a well-recognized algorithm and historically classified as a local-search-based metaheuristic. The performance of simulated annealing critically depends on its operators and parameters, in particular, its neighborhood search structure. In this paper, we propose an effective neighborhood search structure based on insertion neighborhoods as well as analyzing the behavior of simulated annealing with different types of operators and parameters by the means of Taguchi method. An experiment based on Taillard benchmark is conducted to evaluate the proposed algorithm against some effective algorithms existing in the literature. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
