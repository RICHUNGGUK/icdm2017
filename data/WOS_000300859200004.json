To provide satisfactory usability, mobile searches must consider the nature of handsets. Being both pervasive and person-centric, handsets continuously capture information about users and their context. Context awareness can enhance the mobile search experience by augmenting user queries with context information captured through handset sensors. The authors' unified architecture supports context awareness in mobility. Based on real-life contextual data captured from handsets, they describe various design approaches and the benefits of making mobile searches more context-aware.", "paper_title": "Augmenting Mobile Search Engines to Leverage Context Awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000300859200004"}
