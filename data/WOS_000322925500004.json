This controller is composed of a fuzzy second-order time-delay identifier with on-line parameter estimation, and a stable generalized predictive control with abilities of accurate tracking and disturbance rejection. Numerical simulations for controlling two highly nonlinear processes reveal excellent disturbance rejection and setpoint tracking performance of the proposed control method in comparison with other methods. The results clearly indicate effectiveness and merit of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Stable Generalized Predictive Control Using TSK Fuzzy Model for Nonlinear Discrete-Time Systems with Time-Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000322925500004"}
