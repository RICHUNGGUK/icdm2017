In these yards, one major factor that affects their operational efficiency is the need to re-shuffle containers when accessing a container that is buried beneath other containers. One way to achieve higher loading efficiency is to pre-marshal the containers in such a way that it fits the loading sequence. In this research, we present a mathematical model for the container pre-marshalling problem. With respect to a given yard layout and a given sequence that containers are loaded onto a ship, the model yields a plan to re-position the export containers within the yard, so that no extra re-handles will be needed during the loading operation. The optimization goal is to minimize the number of container movements during pre-marshalling. The resulting model is an integer programming model composed of a multi-commodity flow problem and a set of side constraints. Several possible variations of the model as well as a solution heuristic are also discussed. Computation results are provided. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
