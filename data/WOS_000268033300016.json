This paper proposes a novel face recognition method which exploits both global and local discriminative features. In this method, global features are extracted from the whole face images by keeping the low-frequency coefficients of Fourier transform, which we believe encodes the holistic facial information, such as facial contour. For local feature extraction, Gabor wavelets are exploited considering their biological relevance. After that, Fisher's linear discriminant (FLD) is separately applied to the global Fourier features and each local patch of Gabor features. Thus, multiple FLD classifiers are obtained, each embodying different facial evidences for face recognition. Finally, all these classifiers are combined to form a hierarchical ensemble classifier. We evaluate the proposed method using two large-scale face databases: FERET and FRGC version 2.0. Experiments show that the results of our method are impressively better than the best known results with the same evaluation protocol.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Ensemble of Global and Local Classifiers for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000268033300016"}
