Several diversified technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), computational intelligence, machine type communication, big-data, and sensor technology can be incorporated together to improve the data management and knowledge discovery efficiency of large scale automation applications. So in this work, we need to propose a Cognitive Oriented IoT Big-data Framework (COIB-framework) along with implementation architecture, IoT big-data layering architecture, and data organization and knowledge exploration subsystem for effective data management and knowledge discovery that is well-suited with the large scale industrial automation applications. The discussion and analysis show that the proposed framework and architectures create a reasonable solution in implementing IoT big-data based smart industrial applications.", "paper_title": "A Cognitive Adopted Framework for IoT Big-Data Management and Knowledge Discovery Prospective", "paper_id": "WOS:000363151700001"}
