It allows two mutually untrusted communicants to negotiate an unpredictable key that has a randomness guaranteed by the laws of quantum mechanics. In contrast to conventional QKD (e.g., BB84) in which one communicant has to trust the other for key distribution or quantum key agreement (QKA) in which the communicants have to artificially contribute subkeys to a negotiating key, PQKD is a natural and simple method for distributing a secure random key. The communicants in the illustrated PQKD take Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pairs as quantum resources and then use entanglement swapping and Bell-measurements to negotiate an unpredictable key.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC QUANTUM KEY DISTRIBUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172800006"}
