Our analysis, backed by numerical evidence, establishes thresholds for eavesdropping attacks on the raw data and on the generated key at quantum bit error rates of 10% and 6.15%, respectively. Both thresholds are lower than the threshold for unconditional security in the standard BB84 protocol.", "paper_title": "Raw-data attacks in quantum cryptography with partial tomography", "paper_id": "WOS:000244055200010"}
