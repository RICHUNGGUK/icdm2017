Here we introduce two new variants of monotonicity for restarting automata and for two-way restarting automata: left-monotonicity and right-left-monotonicity. It is shown that for the various types of deterministic and nondeterministic (two-way) restarting automata without auxiliary symbols, these notions yield infinite hierarchies, and we compare these hierarchies to each other. Further, as a tool used to simplify some of the proofs, the shrinking restarting automaton is introduced, which is a generalization of the standard (length-reducing) restarting automaton to the weight-reducing case. Some of the consequences of this generalization are also discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
