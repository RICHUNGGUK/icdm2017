Given a clip of character animation, our approach generates a static object. Looking at the object at different views, a similar deformation can be observed. To accomplish this challenging mission, we give qualitative and quantitative analysis of hollow-face illusion. Methodology in computer vision and human perception are utilized to design the algorithm. A static object is first generated to satisfy the relative motion illusion constraints. The illusion is then strengthened by back projecting the object to the 3D face space. Considering both \"bottom-up\" visual signal and \"top-down\" knowledge, the intended illusion can be generated. Experiments have shown the effectiveness of our algorithm. For example, expression varying illusion on an oil painting can be created by our method. The self-moving objects can be used in applications such as design, entertainment, advertisement, and public safety.", "paper_title": "Mona Lisa alive Create self-moving objects using hollow-face illusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000319478400008"}
