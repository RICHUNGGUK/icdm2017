This shows us that neural networks are working in the same way as logical circuits when the connection between them is through the fuzzy logic. However, the main difference between them is that logical circuits can be constructed without using any kind of optimization-based learning methods. Based on these results, we propose a new neuro-fuzzy computing system. As verified by simulation results, it can effectively be implemented on the memristor crossbar structure and therefore can be a good approach to emulating the computing power of human brain. One important feature of the designed hardware is that it has the potential to be directly trained using the Hebbian learning rule and without the need for any optimization. The system is also very capable of dealing with a large number of input-out training data without facing problems like overtraining or sensitivity to outliers.", "paper_title": "The Neuro-Fuzzy Computing System With the Capacity of Implementation on a Memristor Crossbar and Optimization-Free Hardware Training", "paper_id": "WOS:000344751200017"}
