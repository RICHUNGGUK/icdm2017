The proposed method is applied to the QSPR modeling of the entropy of formation for 1133 different organic compounds. By using the MPSOPLS approach, three descriptors are selected from a large set of molecular descriptors, and a linear model is developed. Analysis of the results indicates the squared correlation coefficient of 0.9691 for MPSOPLS model. Thus, MPSOPLS is a promising technique, which is helpful for developing the QSAR/QSPR models with high accuracy.
