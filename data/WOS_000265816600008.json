Minimizing the area of their corresponding rectangular layouts is a key problem. We study the area-optimization problem and show that it is NP-hard to find a minimum-area rectangular layout of a given contact graph. We present O(n)-time algorithms that construct O(n(2))-area rectangular layouts for general contact graphs and O(n log n)area rectangular layouts for trees. ( For trees, this is an O(logn)-approximation algorithm.) We also present an infinite family of graphs (respectively, trees) that require Omega(n(2)) ( respectively, Omega(n log n)) area. We derive these results by presenting a new characterization of graphs that admit rectangular layouts, using the related concept of rectangular duals. A corollary to our results relates the class of graphs that admit rectangular layouts to rectangle-of-influence drawings.", "paper_title": "Rectangular Layouts and Contact Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000265816600008"}
