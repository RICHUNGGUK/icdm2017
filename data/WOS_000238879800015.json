One involves transporting astronomical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the other involves computing histograms from multiple high-volume data streams. Both rely on newly developed data transport and data mining middleware. Specifically, we describe a new version of the UDT network protocol called Composible-UDT, a file transfer utility based upon UDT called UDT-Gateway, and an application for building histograms on high-volume data flows called BESH (for Best Effort Streaming Histogram). For both demonstrations, we include a summary of the experimental studies performed at iGrid 2005. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
