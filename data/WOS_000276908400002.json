We propose an Alternating Control Tree Search (ACT) method for these problems that iteratively transfers control between the following three components: (1) ACT-1, a process that solves an LP relaxation of the current form of the KCP. (2) ACT-2, a method that partitions the variables according to 0, 1, and fractional values to create sub-problems that can be solved with relatively high efficiency. (3) ACT-3, an updating procedure that adjoins inequalities to produce successively more constrained versions of KCP, and in conjunction with the solution processes of ACT-1 and ACT-2, ensures finite convergence to optimality. The ACT method can also be used as a heuristic approach using early termination rules. Computational results show that the ACT-framework successfully enhances the performance of three widely different heuristics for the KCP. Our ACT-method involving scatter search performs better than any other known method on a large set of KCP-instances from the literature. The ACT-based methods are also found to be highly effective on the MKP.", "paper_title": "Alternating control tree search for knapsack/covering problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000276908400002"}
