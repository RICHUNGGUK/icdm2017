Multiple Description Coding (MDC) methods are used to overcome the jitter and delay problems arising from frame losses by making the transmitted data more error resilient. Meanwhile, varying characteristics of receiving devices require adaptation of video data. Data transmission in multiple descriptions provides the feasibility of receiving it partially and hence having a scalable and adaptive video. In this paper, a new method based on integrating MDC and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scalable video coding algorithms is proposed. Our method introduces a transform on data to permit transmitting them using independent descriptions. Our results indicate that on average 1.71dB reduction in terms of Y-PSNR occurs if only one description is received.", "paper_title": "Multiple description coding for SNR scalable video transmission over unreliable networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333209300013"}
