To address these two issues, the view of understanding product design exploration is first sought. In this view, the exploration of designs is not only categorized as a problem-solving activity but also as a problem-finding activity. A computational framework is developed based oil this view. and it encompasses the belief that these two activities go hand in hand to accomplish the design tasks in an interactive design environment, The framework adopts all integration approach of two key computational techniques, shape, grammars and evolutionary computing, for addressing the above two critical issues. For the issues of stylistic consistency, this paper focuses oil the computational techniques in balancing the conflicts of stylistic consistency and innovation with shape grammars. For the issues Of controlling design process. the practical concerns of monitoring the design process through various activities starting from the preparation works to the implementation of shape grammars have been emphasized in the development of this framework. To evaluate the effectiveness of the framework, the experiments have been set up to reflect the practical Situations with which the designers have to deal. The system generates a number of models from scratch with numerical analysis that call be evaluated effectively by the designers. This reduces the designers' time and allows the designers to concentrate their efforts oil performing higher level of design activities such its evaluation of designs and making design decisions.", "paper_title": "Evolving product form designs using parametric shape grammars integrated with genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000264275200003"}
