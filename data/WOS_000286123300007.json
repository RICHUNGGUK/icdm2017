However, SDIs have limited analytical capabilities, an essential task to turn data into understandable information. Geospatial data are typically processed on desktop computers, but their limited power limits the types of analyses that can be conducted given ever-increasing amounts of high resolution data. With the recently introduced Web Processing Service and the availability of large storage and computing facilities offered by Grid infrastructures, new opportunities are emerging within the environmental sciences communities. The enviroGRIDS project, funded by the European Commission \"Seventh Framework Programme\" (EU/FP7), will target these issues. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
