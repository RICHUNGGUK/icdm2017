Real-time wireless body area sensor networks (WBASNs), as a special purpose WPAN, can perfectly use the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for its wireless connection. In this paper, we propose an adaptive GTS allocation scheme for real-time WBASN data transmissions with different priorities in consideration of low latency, fairness, and bandwidth utilization. The proposed GTS allocation scheme combines a weight-based priority assignment algorithm with an innovative starvation avoidance scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing GTS implementation for the traditional IEEE 802.15.4 in terms of average delay, contention free period bandwidth utilization, and fairness.", "paper_title": "Adaptive GTS allocation scheme with applications for real-time Wireless Body Area Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900010"}
