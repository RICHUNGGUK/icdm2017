Fixed and reconfigurable approaches to wavelength assignment are modeled and evaluated under nonstationary traffic conditions. The performance improvement is obtained in terms of bit rate gain relative to the nominal bandwidth and depends on the number of wavelength channels as well as the magnitude of the load offered by the optical network units. In addition, frame delay and frame loss in relation to the bit rate performance are obtained for Pareto and exponentially distributed traffic. Simulations show that when introducing reconfigurability, typical peak bit rate gains with respect to the fixed case are 17%, and maxima of 175% are potentially possible when traffic demands are particularly uneven.", "paper_title": "On the Conditions That Justify Requiring Dynamic Reconfigurability in WDM-TDMA Optical Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291439500001"}
