In addition, to test the hypothesis of independence in such contingency tables, a novel method of decision making is developed based on a concept of fuzzy p-value. The applicability of the proposed approach is explained using a numerical example.", "paper_title": "GOODMAN-KRUSKAL MEASURE OF ASSOCIATION FOR FUZZY-CATEGORIZED VARIABLES", "paper_id": "WOS:000288625300009"}
