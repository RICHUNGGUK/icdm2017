To implement it compact but high performance device, which can be used in consumer applications, the reconfigurable architecture distinctively performs 8-bit operations required for media processing whereas fine-grained operations are executed with the cooperation of a host processor. A heterogeneous reconfigurable array is composed of four types of cells, for which configuration data size is reduced by focusing application domain on media processing. Implementation results show that a multi-standard video decoding can be achieved by the proposed reconfigurable architecture with 1.1 x 1.4 mm(2) in a 90 run CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Area-Efficient Reconfigurable Architecture for Media Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800030"}
