The existing distinction between procedural and declarative knowledge unnecessarily confounds these two aspects (action-centeredness and accessibility), and can be made clearer through separating the two aspects. The model is used to simulate human data in a letter counting task. The work shows how the data in this task may be captured using either action-centered knowledge alone or both action-centered and non-action-centered knowledge, though the combined approach produced a better fit. The results demonstrate the difference between these approaches and provide a new Perspective oil skill learning. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
