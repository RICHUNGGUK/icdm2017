With these deficiencies in mind, we propose a complete new framework for authorization in structured P2P networks based on Attribute Certificates (ACs) and a fully distributed certificate revocation system. We argue that the proposed framework yields a more flexible and secure authorization scheme for structured P2P networks while improving the efficiency of the assignment of privileges.
