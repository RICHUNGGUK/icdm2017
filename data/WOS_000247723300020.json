In order for negotiation to take place between two or more agents there is need for a negotiation protocol that defines the rules of the game; consequently, a variety of agent negotiation protocols have been proposed in literature. However, most of them are inappropriate for Group-Choice Decision Making (GCDM) because they do not explicitly exploit tradeoff to achieve social optimality, and their main focus is solving two-agent negotiation problems such as buyer-seller negotiation. In this paper we present an agent negotiation protocol that facilitates the solving of GCDM problems. The protocol is based on a hybrid of analytic and artificial intelligence techniques. The analytic component of the protocol utilizes a Game Theory model of an n-person general-sum game with complete information to determine the agreement options, while the knowledge-based (artificial intelligence) component of the protocol is similar to the strategic negotiation protocol. Moreover, this paper presents a tradeoff algorithm based on Qualitative Reasoning, which the agents employ to determine the 'amount' of tradeoff associated with various agreement options. Finally, the paper presents simulation results that illustrate the operational effectiveness of our agent negotiation protocol. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
