This network is setup on fly without any infrastructure. The mobility nature of this network and the lack of infrastructure make it very challenging to be secured. In this paper, we introduce a formal model for Identity-based RSA (Id-RSA) scheme proven secure in the random oracle model. The proposed scheme relies on establishing fast cryptography operations to enhance the network performance. We compare our scheme with RSA-based Threshold Cryptography scheme (RSA-TC) and ECC-based Threshold Cryptography scheme (ECC-TC) in terms of speed and overheads caused by the security messages. We show that the threshold cryptography operations involved in RSA-TC and ECC-TC schemes cause a lot of overheads and delay. We implement these three schemes using the JAVA-based simulation framework (JIST/SWANS). The results show that our Id-RSA scheme is more suitable for MANET mobility environment that require lightweight and secure solutions.", "paper_title": "Towards providing a new lightweight authentication and encryption scheme for MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000289730300002"}
