One of the most important results in this field is a theorem of Sabitov, asserting that the volume of a flexible polyhedron is constant during the flexion. In this paper we study flexible polyhedral surfaces in , doubly periodic with respect to translations by two non-collinear vectors, that can vary continuously during the flexion. The main result is that the period lattice of a flexible doubly periodic surface that is homeomorphic to the plane cannot have two degrees of freedom.", "paper_title": "Deformations of Period Lattices of Flexible Polyhedral Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000335753000010"}
