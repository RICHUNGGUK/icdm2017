According to travel schedules, travel media often have implicit thematic structure. Correlation between different modalities also provides implicit cues to media analysis. In this system, we exploit techniques of near-duplicate detection to select representative photos, and determine region-of-interest in photos to enhance browsing experience. For face-name association, a face clustering module based on visual language models is constructed. To systematically segment travel videos of bad visual quality and significant motion, we explore correlation between photos and videos based on approximate visual word histogram matching. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches and show that they are practical functions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
