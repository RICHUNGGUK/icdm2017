In this paper, we analyze a natural approach to eliminate this machine-dependence. Our method is to assign algorithmic probabilities to the different computers themselves, based oil the idea that \"unnatural\" computers should be hard to emulate. Therefore, we study the Markov process of universal Computers randomly emulating each other. The corresponding stationary distribution, if it existed, would give a natural and machine-independent probability measure on the computers, and also oil the binary strings. Unfortunately, we show that no stationary distribution exists on the set of all computers; thus, this method cannot eliminate machine-dependence. Moreover, we show that the reason for failure has a clear and interesting physical interpretation, suggesting that every other conceivable attempt to get rid of those additive constants must fail in principle, too. However, we show that restricting to some subclass of computers might help to get rid of some amount of machine-dependence in some situations, and the resulting stationary Computer and string probabilities have beautiful properties.
