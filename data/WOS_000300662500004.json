A recent study revealed that different diversity levels in an ensemble of learning machines are required in order to maintain high generalization on both old and new concepts. Inspired by this study and based on a further study of diversity with different strategies to deal with drifts, we propose a new online ensemble learning approach called Diversity for Dealing with Drifts (DDD). DDD maintains ensembles with different diversity levels and is able to attain better accuracy than other approaches. Furthermore, it is very robust, outperforming other drift handling approaches in terms of accuracy when there are false positive drift detections. In all the experimental comparisons we have carried out, DDD always performed at least as well as other drift handling approaches under various conditions, with very few exceptions.", "paper_title": "DDD: A New Ensemble Approach for Dealing with Concept Drift", "paper_id": "WOS:000300662500004"}
