This work has been mainly motivated by the complexity and interoperability problems related to the large number of wireless APIs available today. ULLA provides database and object oriented service abstractions to applications through a generic query mechanism, a method to setup asynchronous notifications and a command interface. It encapsulates link level heterogeneity by defining a unified model for link technologies. We describe design details, various implementation options and discuss how the proposed ULLA design provides an extensible, scalable and platform independent framework, enabling seamless link access and control in various types of device platforms. Application programming using ULLA is illustrated using code examples. Numerous usage scenarios for ULLA are presented, highlighting unified access to heterogeneous link standards while encouraging application innovation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
