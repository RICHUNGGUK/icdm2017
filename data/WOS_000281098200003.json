This motivates us to study a negative event-related potential-mismatch negativity (MMN) estimated by the single-trial based ICA (sICA) and averaged trace based ICA (aICA), respectively. To sICA, an optimal digital filter (ODF) was used to remove low-frequency noise. As a result, this study demonstrates that the performance of the sICA+ODF and aICA could be different. Moreover, MMN under sICA+ODF fits better with the theoretical expectation, i.e., larger deviant elicits larger MMN peak amplitude.", "paper_title": "SINGLE-TRIAL BASED INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS ON MISMATCH NEGATIVITY IN CHILDREN", "paper_id": "WOS:000281098200003"}
