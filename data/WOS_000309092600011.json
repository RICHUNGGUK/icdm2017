CoNoC is built upon all-optical switches (AOSs) which passively route optical data streams based on their wavelengths. The key idea of the proposed architecture is the utilization of per-receiver wavelength in the data network to prevent optical contention at the intermediate nodes. Routing optical packets according to their wavelength eliminates the need for resource reservation at the intermediate nodes and the corresponding latency, power, and area overheads. Since passive architecture of the AOS confines the optical contention to the end-points, we propose an electrical arbitration architecture for resolving optical contention at the destination nodes. By performing a series of simulations, we study the efficiency of the proposed architecture, its power and energy consumption, and the data transmission latency. Moreover, we compare the proposed architecture with electrical NoCs and alternative ONoC architectures under various synthetic traffic patterns. Averaged across different traffic patterns, the proposed architecture reduces per-packet power consumption by 19%, 28%, 29%, and 91% and achieves per-packet energy reduction of 28%, 40%, 20%, and 99% over Columbia, Phastlane, lambda-router, and electrical torus, respectively.
