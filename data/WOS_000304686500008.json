The scattering angle of the main part of gas spray increased from 15.0 degrees to 17.4 degrees given by k-epsilon model and 17.2 degrees to 19.0 degrees given by RSM model, as the nozzle intersection angle increased from 5 degrees to 65 degrees at the operating gas pressure of 1.0 MPa, which also moved the merging position of the annular peak. There is a high pressure area downstream of the delivery tube which contributes to the sheet breakup. Comparing the simulation results with the experimental data, it is found that RSM model is more accurate than k-epsilon model and proved that computational fluid dynamics is an effective method to simulate the gas flow of the close coupled atomizer.
