The objective is to assign jobs to several factories and schedule the jobs in each factory with the minimum total completion time (TCT). In view of the NP-hardness of the DTSAFSP, we develop heuristics method to deal with the problem and propose three hybrid meta-heuristics (HVNS, HGA-RVNS, and HDDE-RVNS). The parameters of HGA-RVNS and HDDE-RVNS are tuned by using the Taguchi method and that of HVNS is done by using the single factor ANOVA method. Computational experiments have been conducted to compare the performances of the proposed algorithms. The analyses of computational results show that, for the instances with small numbers of jobs, HDDE-RVNS obtains better performances than HGA-RVNS and HVNS; whereas for the instances with large numbers of jobs, HGA-RVNS is the best one in all the proposed algorithms. Computational results indicate that the performances of the HDDE-RVNS and HGA-RVNS are not much affected by the number of machines at the first stage and factories. The experimental results also show that the RVNS-based local search steps in both HGA-RVNS and HDDE-RVNS are efficient and effective. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
