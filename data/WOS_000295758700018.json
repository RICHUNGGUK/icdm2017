In this article, we study the transshipment scheduling problem in a multiple inbound and outbound dock configuration. The operations manager has several decisions to make: he can decide to transship products directly from inbound to an outbound truck, if an outbound truck is available; he can temporarily store certain products and have them loaded later on; or he can replace an outbound truck to facilitate direct loading. The objective is to find the best schedule of transshipment operations to minimize the sum of inventory holding and truck replacement costs. In this article, we present several heuristics to attain this objective. Numerical experiments are presented and the results are compared with the optimal solution to evaluate the performance of the heuristics. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
