DFIGs can be used as reactive power sources to control the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC). The controller is designed to compensate for the voltage at the PCC by simultaneously regulating the reactive and active power generated by WTs. The performance of the controller is evaluated in different case studies considering a different number of wind farms in different locations. Simulations carried out on a real 37-bus weak distribution system confirmed that the proposed controller can enhance the FRT capability.", "paper_title": "Improving Fault Ride-Through Capability of Variable Speed Wind Turbines in Distribution Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325403000020"}
