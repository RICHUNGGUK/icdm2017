In order to well maintain those sensor devices, it is often necessary to evolve devices to function correctly by allowing device management (DM) entities to remotely monitor and control devices without consuming significant resources. In this paper, we propose a lightweight RESTful Web service (WS) approach to enable device management of wireless sensor devices. Specifically, motivated by the recent development of IPv6-based open standards for accessing wireless resource-constrained networks, we consider to implement IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN)/routing protocol for low power and lossy network (RPL)/constrained application protocol (CoAP) protocols on sensor devices and propose a CoAP-based DM solution to allow easy access and management of IPv6 sensor devices. By developing a prototype cloud system, we successfully demonstrate the proposed solution in efficient and effective management of wireless sensor devices.", "paper_title": "Lightweight Management of Resource-Constrained Sensor Devices in Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098700007"}
