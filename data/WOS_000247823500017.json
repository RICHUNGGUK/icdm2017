ABS-MPVT algorithm, for solving a system comprising linear equations and linear inequalities is presented. This method is characterized by solving the system of linear equations first via the ABS algorithms and then solving an unconstrained minimization obtained by substituting the ABS general form of solutions into the system of linear inequalities. For the unconstrained minimization problem it can be solved by a (modified) parallel algorithm. The convergence of this method is also given. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
