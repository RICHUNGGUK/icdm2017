Second it can prove rigorously the existence of solutions. However, none of these advantages can be used for under-constrained systems of equations, which have manifolds of solutions. A new framework is proposed in this paper to extend the advantages of the preconditioned interval Newton to under-constrained systems of equations. This is achieved simply by allowing domains of the NCSP to be parallelepipeds, which generalize the boxes usually used as domains.", "paper_title": "A new framework for sharp and efficient resolution of NCSP with manifolds of solutions", "paper_id": "WOS:000275546300003"}
