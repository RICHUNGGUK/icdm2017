An improved method is proposed, which captures the characteristic of sampled-data systems. Some delay-dependent criteria are derived to ensure the exponential stability of the error systems, and thus the master systems synchronize with the slave systems. The desired sampled-data controller can be achieved by solving a set of linear matrix inequalitys, which depend upon the maximum sampling interval and the decay rate. The obtained conditions not only have less conservatism but also have less decision variables than existing results. Simulation results are given to show the effectiveness and benefits of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Exponential Synchronization of Neural Networks With Discrete and Distributed Delays Under Time-Varying Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965800003"}
