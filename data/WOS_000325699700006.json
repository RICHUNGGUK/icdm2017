The main drawback of single projection structured light methods is that moving the projector changes significatively the appearance of the scene at every acquisition time. Classical multi-view stereovision approaches based on the appearance matching are then not useable. The presented work is based on a two-cameras and one single slide projector system embedded in a hand-held device for industrial applications (reverse engineering, dimensional control, etc). We propose a method to achieve multi-view modelling for camera pose and surface reconstruction estimation in a joint process. The proposed method is based on the extension of a stereo-correlation criterion. Acquisitions are linked through a generalized expression of local homographies. The constraints brought by this formulation allow an accurate estimation of the modelling parameters for dense reconstruction of the scene and improve the result when dealing with detailed or sharp objects, compared to pairwise stereovision methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-view dense 3D modelling of untextured objects from a moving projector-cameras system", "paper_id": "WOS:000325699700006"}
