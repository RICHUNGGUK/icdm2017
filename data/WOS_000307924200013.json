ArcMine provides four tools to (a) assess mine subsidence hazards, (b) estimate the erosion of mine wastes, (c) analyze flow paths of mine water at the surface, and (d) identify suitable tree species for mine reforestation. A spatial database incorporating a topographical map, geological map, mine drift map, and borehole data was designed and utilized in ArcMine to examine distributed mine hazards that can damage the surrounding environment. Application to abandoned mining areas in Korea shows that ArcMine could provide useful information on mine hazards to support reclamation planning. This paper reports the concept, development, and implementation of ArcMine. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
