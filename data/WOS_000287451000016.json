One of them involved including a \"bifuzzy variable\" as a fuzzy element for describing the more complete systems. The properties of bifuzzy variable were obtained by introducing the concept of \"chance distribution\". In this paper, we will present a sufficient and necessary condition for chance distribution of bifuzzy variable. Here we present a constructive proof base on credibility theory for the sufficient part.", "paper_title": "The sufficient and necessary condition for chance distribution of bifuzzy variable", "paper_id": "WOS:000287451000016"}
