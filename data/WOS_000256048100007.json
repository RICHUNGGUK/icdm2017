Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual approach is taken in the paper. Findings - Given the fact that the set N = {x vertical bar n(x)} of all natural numbers, where n(x) =(df) \"x is a natural number\" is a self-contradicting non-set in this paper, the authors prove that in the framework of modern axiomatic set theory ZFC, various uncountable infinite sets are either non-existent or self-contradicting non-sets. Therefore, it can be astonishingly concluded that in both the naive set theory or the modem axiomatic set theory, if any of the actual infinite sets exists, it must be a self-contradicting non-set. Originality/value - The first time in history, it is shown that such convenient notion as the set of all real numbers needs to be reconsidered.", "paper_title": "Inconsistency of uncountable infinite sets under ZFC framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000256048100007"}
