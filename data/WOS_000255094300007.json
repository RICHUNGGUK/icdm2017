The ferroelectric thin film with high dielectric constant can reduce the size of circuit and make it possible to realize tunable devices such as filter by applying voltage on it. Actually, this kind of slow wave structure is a periodic guided-wave structure and can be analyzed by using classic finite difference frequency domain (FDFD) method for periodic guided-wave structures. However, the very compact slow-wave structures will usually result in simulation errors when the classic FDFD method is adopted, which will lead to a nonsymmetrical generalized eigenvalue problem. In this article, the shift-and-invert (SI) Arnoldi method is used to directly resolve this nonsymmetrical generalized eigenvalue problem. As a result, the accuracy of FDFD algorithm is improved. Especially for the large scale eigenvalue problem, SI method can also have a very fast speed of calculation. By means of its complex propagation constant obtained from simulation, one can extract circuit parameters of the interdigital capacitor. Consequently, one can analyze and design relevant resonators and filters in a quick and accurate manner, which are constructed with such interdigital slow wave structures.
