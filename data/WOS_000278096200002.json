The general and explicit existing regions of equilibrium points are discussed based on dissipative theory, fixed point principle of iteration mapping and Brouwer Fixed-point Theorem. The sufficient condition is obtained to ensure the existence, uniqueness, local asymptotical stability of the equilibrium point in each saturation sub-region. Moreover, we give the condition for equilibrium point to be globally exponentially stable, and the explicit existing region of the unique equilibrium point is also located. These results extend previous works on these issues for the standard delayed cellular neural networks. Two numerical examples are given to show the validity of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Equilibrium Analysis for Improved Signal Range Model of Delayed Cellular Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278096200002"}
