At the time of this writing, there exists no simple way to transform statistical data into Linked Data since the raw data comes in different shapes and forms. Given that SDMX (Statistical Data and Metadata eXchange) is arguably the most widely used standard for statistical data exchange, a great amount of statistical data about our societies is yet to be discoverable and identifiable in a uniform way. In this article, we present the design and implementation of SDMX-ML to RDF/XML XSL transformations, as well as the publication of OECD, BFS, FAO, ECB, and IMF datasets with that tooling.", "paper_title": "Linked SDMX Data Path to high fidelity Statistical Linked Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000357874100002"}
