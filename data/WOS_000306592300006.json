However, the construction of these systems is not a simple task. In this paper, we construct the 3-band wavelet system with those properties. In this approach, we first designate the scaling filter length which means compact support, then the vanishing moments is set beforehand in spectral factorization formulation. Consequently, the scaling filters with desirable properties are obtained by solving nonlinear equations which implies less parameters. Moreover, we proposed a lattice structure decomposition of polyphase matrix for 3-band wavelet system, which imposed with paraunitary property. With this method, the corresponding wavelet filters are constructed.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTION OF HIGH VANISHING MOMENTS LINEAR PHASE 3-BAND WAVELETS BASED ON LATTICE STRUCTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000306592300006"}
