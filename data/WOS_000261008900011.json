We considered indoor/outdoor classification because the images of these classes present different content and are usually taken under different illumination conditions. We have designed different strategies for the selection and the tuning of the most appropriate algorithm (or combination of algorithms) for each class. We also considered the adoption of an uncertainty class which corresponds to the images where the indoor/outdoor classifier is not confident enough. The illuminant estimation algorithms considered here are derived from the framework recently proposed by Van de Weijer and Gevers. We present a procedure to automatically tune the algorithms' parameters. We have tested the proposed strategies on a suitable subset of the widely used Funt and Ciurea dataset. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that classification based strategies outperform general purpose algorithms.", "paper_title": "Improving Color Constancy Using Indoor-Outdoor Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000261008900011"}
