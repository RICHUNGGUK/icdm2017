Under regularization theory, we aim to solve this model selection problem through developing an entropy regularized likelihood (ERL) learning on Gaussian mixtures. We further present a gradient algorithm for this ERL learning. Through some theoretic analysis, we have shown a mechanism of generalized competitive learning that is inherent in the ERL learning, which can lead to automatic model selection on Gaussian mixtures and also make our ERL learning algorithm less sensitive to the initialization as compared to the standard expectation-maximization algorithm. The experiments on simulated data using our algorithm verified our theoretic analysis. Moreover, our ERL learning algorithm has been shown to outperform other competitive learning algorithms in the application of unsupervised image segmentation.", "paper_title": "Generalized Competitive Learning of Gaussian Mixture Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000267865200009"}
