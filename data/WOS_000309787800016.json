Despite its importance, little attention is paid to developing empirical models for predicting the deformation moduli obtained from the field tests. To cope with this issue, this paper presents the development of a new prediction model for the pressuremeter soil deformation modulus utilizing a linear genetic programming (LGP) methodology. The LGP model relates the soil secant modulus obtained from the pressuremeter tests to the soil index properties. The best model was selected after developing and controlling several models with different combinations of the influencing parameters. The experimental database used for developing the models was established upon several pressuremeter tests conducted on different soil types at depths of 3-40 m. To verify the applicability of the derived model, it was employed to estimate the soil moduli of portions of test results that were not included in the analysis. Further, the generalization capability of the model was verified via several statistical criteria. The sensitivity of the soil deformation modulus to the influencing variables was examined and discussed. Moisture content and soil dry unit weight were found to be efficient representatives of the initial state and consolidation history of the soil for determining its deformation modulus. The results indicate that the LGP approach accurately characterizes the soil deformation modulus leading to a very good prediction performance. The correlation coefficients between the experimental and predicted soil modulus values are equal to 0.908 and 0.901 for the calibration and testing data sets, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
