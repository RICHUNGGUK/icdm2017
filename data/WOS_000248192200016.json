However, selection of support vectors and intensive optimization of kernel width of a nonlinear SVM are inclined to get trapped into local optima, leading to an increased risk of underfitting or overfitting. To overcome these problems, a new nonlinear SVM algorithm is proposed using adaptive kernel transform based on a radial basis function network (RBFN) as optimized by particle swarm optimization (PSO). The new algorithm incorporates a nonlinear transform of the original variables to feature space via a RBFN with one input and one hidden layer. Such a transform intrinsically yields a kernel transform of the original variables. A synergetic optimization of all parameters including kernel centers and kernel widths as well as SVM model coefficients using PSO enables the determination of a flexible kernel transform according to the performance of the total model. The implementation of PSO demonstrates a relatively high efficiency in convergence to a desired optimum. Applications of the proposed algorithm to QSAR studies of binding affinity of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitors and activity of 1-phenylbenzimidazoles reveal that the new algorithm provides superior performance to the backpropagation neural network and a conventional nonlinear SVM, indicating that this algorithm holds great promise in nonlinear SVM learning.", "paper_title": "Radial basis function network-based transform for a nonlinear support vector machine as optimized by a particle swarm optimization algorithm with application to QSAR studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000248192200016"}
