Global information is extracted with a feature-based representation and recognized by using an ensemble of classifiers. Moreover, we show that methods based on tokenised pseudo-random numbers and user specific signature features are highly dependent upon a parameter, the hashing threshold; we demonstrate that using an ensemble of classifiers it is possible to solve this problem leading to a considerable performance improvement.
