It is shown that the original theorem is nonconstructive, and that a natural weakening of the theorem is constructively equivalent to Ishihara's principle BD-N. The paper ends with a number of results that, while not as strong as Landau's theorem, nevertheless contain positive computational information related to its conclusion.", "paper_title": "A Constructive Study of Landau's Summability Theorem", "paper_id": "WOS:000289720300003"}
