Traditionally, decision making models are based on crisp data. The shortcoming of these data in capturing the reality and lack of information persuaded researchers to develop decision making methods with uncertain data. In this paper, the ELECTRE method is extended with black numbers, under ambiguous environment. The proposed method is applied in a supplier selection problem. It's an outstanding method that can be used in real world problems with ill-defined and incomplete data.", "paper_title": "Decision Making with Unknown Data: Development of ELECTRE Method Based on Black Numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000333867900002"}
