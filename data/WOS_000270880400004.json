We analyzed semantics equivalence in transformations involving Platform Specific Models (PSMs). In this paper, considering concurrent systems domain, we show how this extended MDA architecture copes with the correctness verification of horizontal model transformations involving Platform Independent Models (PIMs). Our approach is supported by four formal techniques: behavioral equivalence relation, category theory, bisimulation and model-checking. This set of techniques allows the analysis of semantics equivalence between system model before and after transformation enabling the decomposition of the system model into a set of concurrent sub-models, considered as components. The validation of our approach occurs in a net splitting operation, where PIMs are defined as Petri nets models according to the PNML metamodel with transformations representing formal operations in this domain.", "paper_title": "Checking Semantics Equivalence of MDA Transformations in Concurrent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000270880400004"}
