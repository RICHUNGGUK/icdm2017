This paper presents gait image features based on the information set theory, henceforth these are called gait information image features. The information set stems from a fuzzy set with a view to represent the uncertainty in the information source values using the entropy function. The proposed gait information image (GII) is derived by applying the concept of information set on the frames in one gait cycle and two features named gait information image with energy feature (GII-EF) and gait information image with sigmoid feature (GII-SF) are extracted. Nearest neighbor (NN) classifier is applied to identify the gait. The proposed features are tested on Casia-B dataset, SOTON small database with variations in clothing and carrying conditions and On OU-ISIR Treadmill B database with large variation in clothing conditions. Moreover, experiments are carried out on OU-ISIR Treadmill A database with slight variation in the walking speeds to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
