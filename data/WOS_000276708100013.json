We include features such as the contact physiological features (e.g., ECG and EEG), and apply the first-order Hidden Markov Model to compute the dynamics of the Bayesian network at different time slices. The experimental validation shows the effectiveness of the proposed system; also it indicates that the contact physiological features (especially ECG and EEG) are significant factors for inferring the fatigue state of a driver.
