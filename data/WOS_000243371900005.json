Multi-dimensional radio resource management has recently been identified to exploit the full dimensions of freedom for more flexible and efficient utilization of scarce radio spectrum while provide diverse quality of service (QoS) guarantees. In this work, a multi-dimensional radio resource scheduling scheme is proposed to achieve above goals in hybrid orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) and space division multiple access (SDMA) systems. Cochannel interference (CCI) introduced by frequency reuse under SDMA is eliminated by frequency division and time division between highly interfered users. This scheme maximizes system throughput subjected to the minimum data rate guarantee for heterogeneous users and transmit power constraint. By numerical examples, system throughput and fairness superiority of the our scheduling scheme are verified.", "paper_title": "A multi-dimensional radio resource scheduling scheme for MIMO-OFDM wireless systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243371900005"}
