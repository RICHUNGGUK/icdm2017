In this study, we investigate an idea of rough fuzzy random sets. This construct provides us with a certain generalization of rough sets by introducing the concept of inclusion degree. The underlying objective behind this development is to address the problems which involve co-existing factors of fuzziness and randomness thus giving rise to a notion of the fuzzy random approximation space based on inclusion degree. Some essential properties of rough approximation operators of such rough fuzzy random sets are discussed. Further theoretical foundations for the formation of rules constructed on a basis of available decision tables are offered as well.", "paper_title": "A Development of Inclusion-degree-based Rough Fuzzy Random Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000262368100007"}
