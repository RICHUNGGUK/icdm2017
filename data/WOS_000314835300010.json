The proposed array control circuit employs an improved structure to minimize the leakage of memory bit cells. With the proposed array circuit design, the passive RFID tag can operate drawing a low quiescent current. The RFID tag with the proposed EEPROM was fabricated in a standard 0.35-mu m four-metal two-poly CMOS process. Measurement results show that the erasing/writing current is 45 mu A, and reading current consumption is 3 mu A with a supply voltage of 3.3 V. The data read time is 300 ns/bit.", "paper_title": "Design techniques of low-power embedded EEPROM for passive RFID tag", "paper_id": "WOS:000314835300010"}
