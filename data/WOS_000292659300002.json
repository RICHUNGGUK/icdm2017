In this paper, some new necessary and sufficient conditions for identifying geometric isomorphism of symmetric designs with prime levels are provided. A new algorithm for checking geometric isomorphism is proposed and a searching result for geometrically non-isomorphic 3-level orthogonal arrays of 18 runs is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
