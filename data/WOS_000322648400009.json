Different from previous work that was based on the static interference model, we assume a dynamic number of competing flows, such as continuous transfers of file transport protocol or web browsing sessions. The complex, dynamic interaction of the amount of backlogged traffic at the D2D and cellular links introduced by the strong impact of interference between them is captured by the coupled-processors server in the formulated model. The energy efficiency and spectral efficiency of the different resource-sharing strategies are analyzed using the semidefinite optimization approach. It is shown that the simulation results match well with the analytical bounds under different traffic loads and topologies.", "paper_title": "Flow-Level Analysis of Energy Efficiency Performance for Device-to-Device Communications in OFDM Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322648400009"}
