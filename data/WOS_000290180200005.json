The proposed Web Service Data Forwarding (WSDF) framework harnesses the Web Service Resource Framework (WSRF) to meet this requirement. A WSDF compliant service in a workflow can forward the result to its successor service for future usage. This result forwarding function is implemented at the WSDF server level and is transparent to functional services. Our prototype system has shown that this framework can save data transfer time and significantly improve the overall performance of some workflows. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
