We present a rule-based transformation system, which transforms a non-deterministic one into a deterministic one, together with examples of the transformation. We prove that the transformation system is simulation sound and simulation complete. We also prove that the transformation system is complete for some class by introducing a strategy for the transformation system. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
