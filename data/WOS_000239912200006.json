This process is well studied on Z(d); here we investigate it on regular and general infinite trees and on non-amenable Cayley graphs. The critical probability is the infimum of those values of p for which the process achieves complete occupation with positive probability. On trees we find the following discontinuity: if the branching number of a tree is strictly smaller than k, then the critical probability is 1, while it is 1-1/k on the k-ary tree. A related result is that in any rooted tree T there is a way of erasing k children of the root, together with all their descendants, and repeating this for all remaining children, and so on, such that the remaining tree T' has branching number br(T') <= max{br(T) - k, 0}. We also prove that on any 2k-regular non-amenable graph, the critical probability for the k-rule is strictly positive.", "paper_title": "Bootstrap percolation on infinite trees and non-amenable groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000239912200006"}
