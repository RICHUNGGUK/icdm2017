The image signature algorithm referred is based on Image Independent Block Feature (IIBF) obtained by Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Simulations demonstrate the robustness of this method. In addition, this invisible watermarking method can be applied to protect the visible-watermarked image. That is to say, we can claim the ownership of the image after visible watermark removal by the invisible watermark.", "paper_title": "A novel watermarking method with image signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300043"}
