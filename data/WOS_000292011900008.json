A simple two-step subranging ADC architecture is used as an extra ADC in order to extract the data points of the stage-under-calibration and perform correction process without imposing any changes on the main ADC architecture which is the main trend of the current work. Contrary to the conventional calibration methods that use high resolution reference ADCs, averaging and chopping concepts are used in this work to allow the resolution of the extra ADC to be lower than that of the main ADC.
