Crucial to the effectiveness of the methodology is the use of a morphological geometry representation that defines valid structural geometries that are inherently free from checkerboard patterns, disconnected segments, or poor connectivity. A graph-theoretic chromosome encoding, together with compatible reproduction operators, helps facilitate the transmission of topological/shape characteristics across generations in the evolutionary process. A multicriterion target-matching problem developed here is a novel test problem, where a predefined target geometry is the known optimum solution, and the good results obtained in solving this problem provide a convincing demonstration and a quantitative measure of how close to the true optimum the solutions achieved by GA methods can be. The methodology is then used to successfully design a path-generating compliant mechanism by solving a multicriterion structural topology optimization problem.", "paper_title": "Target-matching test problem for multiobjective topology optimization using genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000255419500004"}
