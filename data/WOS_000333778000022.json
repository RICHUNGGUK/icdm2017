We start from constructing an innovation ratio two-stage DEA model and then applies fuzzy multiple objective programming approaches to calculate the efficiency score. This model provides a common scale for comparing performance, increases the discriminating power, and simplifies the calculation process. The links between IC and the BHCs' performance are also investigated by means of the truncated-regression model, and a positive relationship between them is found. The decision-making matrix combined with an efficiency improvement map proposed in this study can clearly define the benchmark that can be emulated by inefficient BHCs and help BHC managers to develop appropriate strategies needed to enhance their overall efficiency.
