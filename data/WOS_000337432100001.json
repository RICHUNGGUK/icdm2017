In vehicular sensor networks (VSNs), with the intervehicle cooperative communication, vehicle nodes can detect the abnormal traffic events and disseminate the related information to the interesting vehicles or persons. This paper gives out a survey of the abnormal traffic information detection and transmission mechanisms in VSNs. Firstly, we overview the origin, characteristic, and application of VSNs. Meanwhile, the definition and features of traffic abnormal information are also introduced and presented. Then, we put more energy on elaborating the existing information detection and transmission mechanisms based on VSNs. Finally, the challenges and problems are discussed.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Abnormal Traffic Information Detection and Transmission Mechanisms in VSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000337432100001"}
