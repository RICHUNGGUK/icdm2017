A number of interesting projects with an eye on practicality are reviewed, a few involving practicing designers of highrise building structures. A review of literature indicates that performing a formal optimization can result in cost savings in the range of 5 to 15 % which can be especially significant in design of highrise and superhighhrise building structures. Since optimization of highrise building structures is a large-scale optimization problem the choice of the optimization approach is an important one. It should be one that is not entrapped in a local optimum solution and is stable for large-scale optimization subjected to discontinuous constraints of commonly-used design codes. The nature-based optimization approaches such as the neural dynamics model of Adeli and Park and genetic algorithms appear to be the preferred choice.", "paper_title": "Advances in optimization of highrise building structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000349395800001"}
