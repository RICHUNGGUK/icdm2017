At each period, the player observes a quoted price which expires before the next period, and decides irrecoverably the amount of the asset to be sold at the price. We present a deterministic online algorithm and prove it optimal for the case where k <= n - 1. For the other case where k >= n, we show by numerical illustration that the gap between the upper and the lower bound of competitive ratio is quite small for many situations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
