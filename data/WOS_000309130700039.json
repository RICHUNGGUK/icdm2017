However, signal integrity at receiving ends will be strongly dependent on the off chip transmission path even using LVDS transmission technique. In this paper, we propose a novel high-speed off chip data transmission driver with built-in self detection functions which include frequency detection and duty-cycle detection capabilities. With these built-in detection functionalities, we can monitor signal quality at the end of off-chip transmission path no matter which kind of transmission path system user chooses. Besides, users can also utilize the detection information to make adjustment on the input signal at the beginning of transmission path. Therefore, the novel proposed transmission driver simultaneously posses high-speed and good signal integrity for off-chip transmission applications. The design was implemented using standard 3.3 V 0.35 mu m CMOS technology with overall chip size of 0.91 mm(2). Simulation and measurement results both successfully verify the novelty and achievement of this work.", "paper_title": "High-speed driver with built-in self detection functions for off-chip transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000309130700039"}
