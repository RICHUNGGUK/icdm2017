A software tool based on this model was developed to provide useful reference for transport planners in carrying out service planning, routing, and scheduling for an inter-modal transit network. The development of this model is briefly described here. A numerical example is used to illustrate its implementation. Results of sensitivity analyses demonstrate that it is capable of providing reasonable solutions and is responsive to changes in the planning environment.", "paper_title": "A new computational model for the design of an urban inter-modal public transit network", "paper_id": "WOS:000249193500005"}
