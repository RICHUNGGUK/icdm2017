In this work, within the context of a pressure-based finite volume method under an unstructured grid, a solution procedure without the need for explicit specification of flow profiles at any of these boundaries when simulating incompressible fluid flow is proposed and numerically examined. Within this methodology, the flow at any open boundary is not necessarily assumed to be unidirectional or fully developed; indeed, the sole information required is the mass flow rate crossing the boundary. As a result, one can select the specific region of interest to perform simulations, rather than having to artificially increase the flow domain so as to invoke fully developed flow at all open boundaries. This not only greatly reduces computational costs (both in terms of memory requirements and simulation run-time) but provides the means to engage with flow problems, which otherwise cannot be solved with currently available methods for handling the flow conditions at open boundaries. The proposed methodology is demonstrated by simulating laminar flow of an incompressible fluid in a two-dimensional planar channel with a 90 degrees T-branch, a known inflow rate, and flow splits for the two outflow channels. The results obtained by placing the entrance and the two exits at different locations show that the flow behavior predicted is completely unaffected by using a highly truncated domain.
