The profile of an ordering alpha of G is prf(alpha)(G) = Sigma(v is an element of V)(alpha(v) - min{alpha(u) : u is an element of N[v]}), here N[v] denotes the closed neighborhood of v. The profile prf(G) of G is the minimum of prf(alpha)(G) over all orderings alpha of G. It is well-known that prf(G) equals the minimum number of edges in an interval graph H that contains G as a subgraph. We show by reduction to a problem kernel of linear size that deciding whether the profile of a connected graph G = (V, E) is at most /V/ - 1 + k is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the parameter k. Since /V/ - 1 is a tight lower bound for the profile of a connected graph G = (V, E), the parameterization above the guaranteed value /V/ - 1 is of particular interest.", "paper_title": "Fixed-parameter complexity of minimum profile problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241482800006"}
