To overcome the frequent disconnections, DTN nodes are required to store data packets for long periods of time until they come near other nodes. Moreover, to increase the delivery probability, they spread multiple copies of the same packet on the network so that one of them reaches the destination. Given the limited storage and energy resources of many DTN nodes, there is a tradeoff between maximizing delivery and minimizing storage and energy consumption. In this paper, we study the routing problem in DTN with limited resources. We formulate a mathematical model for optimal routing, assuming the presence of a global observer that can collect information about all the nodes in the network. Next, we propose a new protocol based on social grouping among the nodes to maximize data delivery while minimizing network overhead by efficiently spreading the packet copies in the network. We compare the new protocol with the optimal results and the existing well-known routing protocols using real life simulations. Results show that the proposed protocol achieves higher delivery ratio and less average delay compared to other protocols with significant reduction in network overhead.", "paper_title": "SGBR: A Routing Protocol for Delay Tolerant Networks Using Social Grouping", "paper_id": "WOS:000326501400016"}
