Some modified versions have been subsequently proposed, incorporating the methods such as adapted vocabularies, fast indexing, and Gaussian mixture models. In this paper, we propose an improvement of replacing the Harris-affine detection method by a random sampling procedure together with an increased number of sample points. Experimental results show that this new method improves categorization accuracy on a five-category problem using the Caltech-4 dataset. It is concluded that random sampling produces higher attainable point density and better categorization performance.", "paper_title": "AN IMPROVED FEATURE VOCABULARY BASED METHOD FOR IMAGE CATEGORIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000291002600006"}
