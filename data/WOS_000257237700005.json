A number of production objectives are taken into account. Two fuzzy based strategies: fuzzy-job and fuzzy-machine are proposed and their performance is compared to two well known dispatching rules such as SPT (Shortest Processing Time) and WEED (Weighted Earliest Due Date). The sequencing algorithm was implemented on a standard personnel computer and the scheduler was interfaced to a robot controller for implementing loading and unloading strategy within the cell. The proposed fuzzy-based methodologies especially fuzzy-job shows a superior performance compared to the traditional dispatching rules considered.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-based methodology for multi-objective scheduling in a robot-centered flexible manufacturing cell", "paper_id": "WOS:000257237700005"}
