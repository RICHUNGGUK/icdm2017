As such, one often wishes to reconstruct a signal from intensity measurements, that is, perform phase retrieval. In this paper, we provide a novel measurement design which is inspired by interferometry and exploits certain properties of expander graphs. We also give an efficient phase retrieval procedure, and use recent results in spectral graph theory to produce a stable performance guarantee which rivals the guarantee for PhaseLift in [Candes, Strohmer, and Voroninski, PhaseLift: Exact and Stable Signal Recovery from Magnitude Measurements via Convex Programming, preprint, arXiv: 1109.4499, 2011]. We use numerical simulations to illustrate the performance of our phase retrieval procedure, and we compare reconstruction error and runtime with a common alternating-projections-type procedure.", "paper_title": "Phase Retrieval with Polarization", "paper_id": "WOS:000333762900002"}
