Due to high rates of unexpected node/link failures, robust data delivery through multiple hops also becomes a critical issue. In this article we present a state-free gradient-based forwarding (SGF) protocol to address these challenges. Nodes running SGF do not maintain states of neighbors or network topology and thus can scale to very large networks. Without using routing tables, SGF builds a cost field called gradient that provides each node the direction to forward data. The maintenance of gradient is purely driven by data transmissions and hence incurs little overhead. To adapt to transient channel variations and topology changes, the forwarder of a routing node is selected opportunistically among multiple candidate nodes through a distributed contention process. Simulation results show that SGF achieves significant energy savings and outperforms several existing data forwarding protocols in terms of packet delivery ratio and end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "SGF: A State-Free Gradient-Based Forwarding Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000267018000005"}
