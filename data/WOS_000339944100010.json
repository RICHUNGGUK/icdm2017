In the first stage, traditional sizing optimization is performed. Based on the buckling or collapse-like deformed shape evaluated for the optimized design, the panel can be divided in sub-regions each of which shows characteristic deformations along axial and circumferential directions. Layout optimization is then performed using a stiffener spacing distribution function to represent the location of each stiffener. A layout coefficient is assigned to each sub-region and the overall layout of the panel is optimized. Three test problems are solved in order to demonstrate the validity of the proposed optimization framework: remarkably, the load-carrying capacity improves by 17.4 %, 66.2 % and 102.2 % with respect to the initial design.", "paper_title": "Two-stage size-layout optimization of axially compressed stiffened panels", "paper_id": "WOS:000339944100010"}
