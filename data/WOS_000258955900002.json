Such attacks exploit differences that are impossible at some intermediate state of the cipher algorithm. The best-known impossible differential attack against AES-128 has applied to six rounds. An attack on AES-128 up to seven rounds is proposed. The proposed attack requires 2(115.5) chosen plaintexts and 2(109) bytes of memory and performs 2(119) seven-round AES encryptions. This is also the best-known attack on a reduced version of the AES-128 till now.", "paper_title": "Impossible differential attack on seven-round AES-128", "paper_id": "WOS:000258955900002"}
