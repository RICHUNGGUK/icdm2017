The Multi-Algorithm-Voting (MAV) methodology enables not only visualization of results produced by diverse clustering algorithms, but also provides quantitative analysis of the results. The current research applies MAV methodology to the case of recommending new-car pricing. The findings illustrate the impact and the benefits of such decision support system. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
