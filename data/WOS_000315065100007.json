In this paper, a first and partial study of the validity of the following deductive scheme is presented, If A, then B If not-A, then B B. This study is done assuming that the statements A and B are representable in Boolean algebras, De Morgan algebras, orthomodular lattices, or in standard algebras of fuzzy sets, and with the conditional statements 'If/then' translated into several conditional operators by taking always into account the consequence operator.
