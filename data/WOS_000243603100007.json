In evaluating the suitability of alternatives, quantitative/qualitative assessments are often required to deal with uncertainty, subjectiveness and imprecise data, which are best represented with fuzzy data. This paper presents a new method of analysis of multicriteria based on the incorporated efficient fuzzy model and concepts of positive ideal and negative ideal points to solve decision-making problems with multi-judges and multicriteria in real-life situations. As a result, effective decisions can be made on the basis of consistent evaluation results. Finally, this paper uses a numerical example of location selection to demonstrate the applicability of this method, with its simplicity in both concept and computation. The results show that this method can be implemented as an effective decision aid in selecting location or decision-making problems. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
