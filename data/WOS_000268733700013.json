Discrete stochastic state-space mathematical model is considered for behavioral and emotional transition processes of the autonomous mobile robot in the dynamic realistic environment. The term of cognitive mechanism system which is composed from rule base and reinforcement self-learning algorithm explain all of the deliberative events such as learning, reasoning and memory (rule spaces) of the autonomous mobile robot. The artificial cognitive model of autonomous robot control architecture has a dynamic associative memory including behavioral transition rules which are able to be learned for achieving multi-objective robot tasks. Motivation module of architecture has been considered as behavioral gain effect generator for achieving multi-objective robot tasks. According to emotional and behavioral state transition probabilities, artificial emotions determine sequences of behaviors for long-term action planning. Also reinforcement self-learning and reasoning ability of artificial cognitive model and motivational gain effects of proposed architecture can be observed on the executing behavioral sequences during simulation. The posture and speed of the robot and the configurations, speeds and torques of the wheels and all deliberative and cognitive events can be observed from the simulation plant and virtual reality viewer. This study constitutes basis for the multi-goal robot tasks and artificial emotions and cognitive mechanism-based behavior generation experiments on a real mobile robot. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
