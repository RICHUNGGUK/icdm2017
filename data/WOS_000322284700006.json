The ICIE (Immersive Collaborative Interaction Environment) is a platform which can present socio-spatial information, obtain human behavior with noncontact sensors, and have components to interpret socio-spatial information. In this paper, we explain the framework of ICIE and main architectures to capture human behavior and to provide virtual spaces in ICIE. We then discuss socio-spatial interaction using ICIE, and introduce some applications and studies which implement this.", "paper_title": "Design of Immersive Environment for Social Interaction Based on Socio-Spatial Information and the Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000322284700006"}
