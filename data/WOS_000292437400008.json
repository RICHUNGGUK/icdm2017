However, past studies have found that the ECM, based on extrinsic motivations (e.g. perceived usefulness, user satisfaction), has limitations insofar as people often have both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations simultaneously. This study used the belief of causal attributions to extend the ECM and verify it in a web-based learning system (WLS) context. Nine hypotheses were derived from the modified ECM. Empirical data were collected by a mail survey from faculty with experience of WLS in Taiwanese universities. The final sample used for further analysis comprised of 144 respondents. The results revealed that the modified ECM has greater power to explain the continued intention of WLS usage even if the effects of user satisfaction and perceived usefulness on continued intention are reduced.
