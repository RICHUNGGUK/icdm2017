The buses stop at each bus stop to pick up passengers and are not allowed to change lane. The cars may change lane when hindered by preceding vehicles. Our simulations show that with a fixed number of buses, four states of the traffic system are identified. The spatial-temporal plots of the four traffic states, and the trajectories of buses at different densities are presented. A gradual transition instead of sharp phase transition from bunching state to homogeneous state of the buses is found. Next, we study the system behavior at different number of bus stops, and an optimal number of stops is suggested. Finally, the influence of bus stops on the fundamental diagram is studied.", "paper_title": "Traffic behavior in a two-lane system consisting of a mixture of buses and cars", "paper_id": "WOS:000254193800007"}
