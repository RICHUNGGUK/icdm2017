Within this concept, a prototype demonstrator has been developed, called 'the virtual welding environment', which provides functionality for an immersive and interactive process execution within a virtual environment. The simulation features of this environment enable the user to set up, execute and validate the results of a welding process. This environment demonstrates a promising potential for supporting process design and training procedures related to manual welding.", "paper_title": "A prototype virtual reality-based demonstrator for immersive and interactive simulation of welding processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000236577100010"}
