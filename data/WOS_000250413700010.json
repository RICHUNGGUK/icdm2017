To extract an abstract model of a timed system we propose to use static analysis, namely a technique called path compression. The idea behind the path compression consists in identifying a path (or a set of paths) on which a process executes a sequence of transitions that do not influence a property being verified, and replacing this path with a single transition. The method is property driven since it depends on a formula in question. The abstraction is exact with respect to all the properties expressible in the temporal logic CTL-X*.", "paper_title": "Path compression in timed automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000250413700010"}
