However, they fail when the corresponding color distributions overlap. Other methods that define correlation between neighboring pixels based on color aim to propagate the opacity parameter a from known pixels to unknown pixels. However, strong edges of textured regions may block the propagation of alpha. In this paper, a new matting strategy is proposed that delivers an accurate matte by considering texture as a feature that can complement color even if the foreground and background color distributions overlap and the image is a complex one with highly textured regions. The texture feature is extracted in such a way as to increase distinction between foreground and background regions. An objective function containing color and texture components is optimized to find the best foreground and background pair among a set of candidate pairs. The effectiveness of proposed method is compared quantitatively as well as qualitatively with other matting methods by evaluating their results on a benchmark dataset and a set of complex images. The evaluations show that the proposed method presented the best among state of the art matting methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
