Therefore, there are many advantages for designing family monitoring systems. Based on our previous research architecture, we implemented a monitoring system for family environments based on Wi-Fi and sensor technologies. Humidity, gas, smoke, and temperature sensors are applied for designing and developing the intelligent home environment monitoring system in this paper. A system prototype is proposed in this research, and the experimental results are discussed. The results showed that the system is workable and remarkable for environment monitoring. The contribution of this is to propose a framework for future home environment monitoring system developers to refer to.", "paper_title": "Development of a Multisensor Embedded Intelligent Home Environment Monitoring System Based on Digital Signal Processor and Wi-Fi", "paper_id": "WOS:000357799700001"}
