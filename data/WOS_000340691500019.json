Pitts in his thesis [7]. Using the Suslin-Kleene theorem, we show that the representable functions for this realizability are exactly the hyperarithmetical (Delta(1)(1)) functions. We show that there is a realizability interpretation of nonstandard arithmetic, which, despite its classical character, lives in a very non-classical universe, where the Uniformity Principle holds and Konig's Lemma fails. We conjecture that the local operator gives a useful indexing of the hyperarithmetical functions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
