Routing algorithms play a major role for the communication quality and performance of the on-chip interconnection networks. This paper proposes TagNoC, as an on-chip network router architecture with novel hybrid routing approach which reduces latency and power consumption at a fixed cost based on information redundancy. TagNoC is a hybrid routing approach which combines the source and distributed routing methods together. While eliminating packet routing in each router, TagNoC determines the forwarding output port in parallel with input buffering. For a marginal cost increase in header size, as compared to distributed routing techniques, routing latency can be hidden while eliminating power consuming portion of the routing, increasing router throughput and decreasing latency. The proposed TagNoC router is compared to baseline router with distributed routing implementation on a 16-node CMP mesh. Physical implementation of all routers is modeled using synthesized RTL, detailed area analysis, and accurate channel models. Performance evaluation is also carried out utilizing RTL simulation and detailed power analysis on both synthetic and application traffic is performed using post-synthesis gate-level simulation. The simulation results illustrate that TagNoC outperforms as compared to baseline distributed architecture and other source routing methods in terms of power, latency, and throughput.
