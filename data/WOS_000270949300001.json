Radiation forces are a key component of force-to-motion models used in simulators, motion control designs, and also for initial performance evaluation of wave-energy converters. The software described provides tools for preparing non-parmatric data and for identification with automatic model-order detection. The identification problem is considered in the frequency domain.", "paper_title": "A Matlab Toolbox for Parametric Identification of Radiation-Force Models of Ships and Offshore Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000270949300001"}
