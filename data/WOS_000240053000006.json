The first one sees places as generators of a commutative monoid and transitions as rewriting rules on it: this setting is totally equivalent to Petri nets, but lacks any graphical intuition. The second one considers places as one-dimensional cells and transitions as two-dimensional ones: this translation recovers a graphical meaning but raises many difficulties since it uses explicit permutations. Finally, the third translation sees places as degenerated two-dimensional cells and transitions as three-dimensional ones: this is a setting equivalent to Petri nets, equipped with a graphical interpretation.
