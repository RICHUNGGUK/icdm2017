To this end, we suggest single-step-down testing procedures based on three different types of weighted logrank statistics, respectively. The comparative results of a Monte Carlo error rate and power/bias study for a variety of survival and censoring distributions are then presented and discussed. The application of the testing procedures for identifying the MED is finally illustrated by using a numerical example of prostate cancer data. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
