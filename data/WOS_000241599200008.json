The first analytical model is based on Markov processes and queuing theory, and the second is a pure Markov process. In order to validate the models and assess their accuracy, two different numerical examples are presented. The two numerical examples use system parameters that are realistic and appropriate for modern hardware. Both analytical models give closed-form solutions that facilitate the study of a number of important system performance metrics. These metrics include throughput, latency, stability condition, CPU utilizations of interrupt handling and protocol processing, and CPU availability for user applications. The two models give mathematically equivalent closed-form solutions for all metrics except for latency. To address latency, we compare the results of both models with the results of a discrete-event simulation. The latency accuracy of the two models is assessed relative to simulation in terms of differences and percentage errors. The paper shows that the second model is more accurate. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
