The system features a user interface similar to Google Search that allows users to type text queries on their activities (e.g., \"Where did I buy books?\") and receive textual answers based on their GPS signals. iDiary uses novel algorithms for semantic compression and trajectory clustering of massive GPS signals in parallel to compute the critical locations of a user. We encode these problems as follows. The k-segment mean is a k-piecewise linear function that minimizes the regression distance to the signal. The (k, m)-segment mean has an additional constraint that the projection of the k segments on R-d consists of only m <= k segments. A coreset for this problem is a smart compression of the input signal that allows computation of a (1 + epsilon)-approximation to its k-segment or (k, m)-segment mean in O(nlog n) time for arbitrary constants e, k, and m. We use coresets to obtain a parallel algorithm that scans the signal in one pass, using space and update time per point that is polynomial in log n. Using an external database, we then map these locations to textual descriptions and activities so that we can apply text mining techniques on the resulting data (e.g., LSA or transportation mode recognition). We provide experimental results for both the system and algorithms and compare them to existing commercial and academic state of the art. This is the first GPS system that enables text-searchable activities from GPS data.", "paper_title": "iDiary: From GPS Signals to a Text-Searchable Diary", "paper_id": "WOS:000368188500008"}
