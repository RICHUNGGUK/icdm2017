However, its origins are difficult to detect and trace given similarities between abusive and normal traffic. So far, there is no capable and scalable mechanism to deal with bandwidth abuse. This paper proposes a distributed edge-to-edge model for monitoring service level agreement (SLA) violations and tracing abusive traffic to its origins. The mechanism of policing misbehaving user traffic at a single random early detection (RED) gateway is used in the distributed monitoring of SLA violations, including violations carried out through several gateways. Each RED gateway reports misbehaving users who have been sent notifications of traffic policing to an SLA monitoring unit. Misbehaving users are considered suspicious users and their consumed bandwidth shares are aggregated at every gateway to be compared with SLA-specified ratios. Bandwidth is abused when SLA-specified ratios are exceeded. By reporting bandwidth abuse, illegitimate users can be isolated from legitimate ones and source hosts of abusive traffic may be traced. Approximate simulation results show that the proposed model can detect any SLA violation and identify abusive users. In addition, the proposed model can trace user violations back to their source machines in real time.", "paper_title": "Service Violation Monitoring Model for Detecting and Tracing Bandwidth Abuse", "paper_id": "WOS:000315624500003"}
