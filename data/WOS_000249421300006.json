Particularly we discussed the horse power problem whether the motion of a horse (knight) fills the infinite chess board or Z(2)- that is, an algebraic problem whether a subset of a group generates it or not. Among others we proved that a horse fills Z(2) even when its move is restricted to properly chosen 3 directions and gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a generalized 3-horse to fill Z(2). This paper gives further developments of the horse power problem, say, on the higher dimensional Euclidean grid, the hexagonal grid and the hyperbolic plane.", "paper_title": "On algebraic structure of Neighborhoods of cellular automata - horse power problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000249421300006"}
