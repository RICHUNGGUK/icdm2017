Obviously, with no knowledge of the transmitted data and many unknown parameters at the receiver, such as the signal power, carrier frequency and phase offsets, timing information, etc., blind identification of the modulation is a difficult task. This becomes even more challenging in real world. In this paper I develop a novel algorithm using Two Threshold Sequential Algorithmic Scheme (TTSAS) algorithm and pattern recognition to identify the modulation types of the communication signals automatically. I have proposed and implemented a technique that casts modulation recognition into shape recognition. Constellation diagram is a traditional and powerful tool for design and evaluation of digital modulations. In this paper, modulation classification is performed using constellation of the received signal by fuzzy clustering and consequently hierarchical clustering algorithms are used for classification of Quadrature-Amplitude Modulation (QAM) and Phase Shift Keying (PSK) modulations and also modulated signal symbols constellation utilizing TTSAS clustering algorithm, and matching with standard templates, is used for classification of QAM modulation. TTSAS algorithm used here is implemented by the Hamming neural network. The simulation results show the capability of this method for modulation classification with high accuracy and appropriate convergence in the presence of noise. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
