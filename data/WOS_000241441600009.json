A linear programming model is proposed to exclude the arbitrage opportunity by appending a scenario to the generated scenario set. By means of a cited stochastic linear goal programming portfolio model, a case is given to exhibit the virtues of this scenario generation approach.", "paper_title": "A novel method for multistage scenario generation based on cluster analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241441600009"}
