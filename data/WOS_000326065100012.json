The current research attempts to employ architecture of artificial neural networks for approximating solution of a system of fuzzy equations. For this aim, a multi-layer fuzzified feed-forward neural network (FFNN) on the real connection weights space is used. The proposed neural network architecture is able to approximate the unknowns by using a supervised learning algorithm which is based on the gradient descent method. The given approach has been illustrated by several examples with computer simulations.", "paper_title": "On the Solution of Nonlinear Fuzzy Equations System by Fuzzy Neural Networks Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000326065100012"}
