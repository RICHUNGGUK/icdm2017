Resource subscription can be divided into two categories, namely long-term reservation and on-demand subscription. Although customers need to pay the upfront fee for a long-term reservation contract, the usage charge of reserved resources is generally much cheaper than that of the on-demand subscription. To provide a better Internet service by using cloud resource, service operators will expect to make a trade-off between the amount of long-term reserved resources and that of on-demand subscribed resources. Therefore, how to properly make resource provision plans is a challenging issue. In this paper, we present a two-phase algorithm for service operators to minimize their service provision cost. In the first phase, we propose a mathematical formulae to compute the optimal amount of long-term reserved resources. In the second phase, we use the Kalman filter to predict resource demand and adaptively change the subscribed on-demand resources such that provision cost could be minimized. We evaluated our solution by using real-world data. Our numerical results indicated that the proposed mechanisms are able to significantly reduce the provision cost.", "paper_title": "Cost Optimization of Elasticity Cloud Resource Subscription Policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000348906400004"}
