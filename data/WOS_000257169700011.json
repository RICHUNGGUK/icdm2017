We developed Swelfe to find internal repeats at three levels. Swelfe quickly identifies statistically significant internal repeats in DNA and amino acid sequences and in 3D structures using dynamic programming. The associated web server also shows the relationships between repeats at each level and facilitates visualization of the results.", "paper_title": "Swelfe: a detector of internal repeats in sequences and structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000257169700011"}
