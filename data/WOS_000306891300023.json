Existing roadmaps, frameworks and systems do not comprehensively support sustainable business transformation nor do they allow decision makers to explore interrelationships and influences between the sustainability dimensions. This leads to silo-based decision making where vision and strategies are not mapped to execution, and sustainability modelling and reporting processes are uncoordinated. This research proposes and implements a generic sustainable business transformation roadmap, which is supported by a framework and architecture for integrated sustainability modelling and reporting. The implementation leverages system dynamics, workflow modelling and adaptable system concepts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
