In order to use multiple network interfaces to transmit streaming data smoothly, a multipath datagram congestion control protocol (MP-DCCP) is proposed and presented in this paper. Video streaming transmission through multipath faces three problems: (1) unordered and untimely received packets at the receiver side, (2) the importance of frames/packets are different and (3) the stability of the total throughput of a multipath transmission. This work proposes the adaptive ordering predicting scheduling (AOPS) scheme to relieve the first two problems. AOPS estimates packets' arrival orders at the receiver side through these multiple paths and then derives packets' transmission schedule at the sender side. A flow-sharing congestion control (FSCC) mechanism for MP-DCCP is proposed in this work to tackle the third problem i.e., the total throughput's stability. From the simulation results, we illustrated that the packets' disorder and received situations in MP-DCCP can be improved using our proposed AOPS scheme and the unstable condition of the total throughput in MP-DCCP can also be relieved using the proposed FSCC mechanism.", "paper_title": "Packet Scheduling and Congestion Control Schemes for Multipath Datagram Congestion Control Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000350220200002"}
