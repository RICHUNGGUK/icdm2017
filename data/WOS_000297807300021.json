The weight matrices of the square CODs are all unitary and obtainable from the unitary matrix representations of Clifford Algebras when the number of transmit antennas n is a power of 2. The rate of the square CODs for n = 2(a) has been shown to be a+1/2(a) complex symbols per channel use. However, SSD codes having unitary-weight matrices need not be CODs, an example being the minimum-decoding-complexity STBCs from quasi-orthogonal designs. In this paper, an achievable upper bound on the rate of any unitary-weight SSD code is derived to be a/2(a)-1 complex symbols per channel use for 2(a) antennas, and this upper bound is larger than that of the CODs. By way of code construction, the interrelationship between the weight matrices of unitary-weight SSD codes is studied. Also, the coding gain of all unitary-weight SSD codes is proved to be the same for QAM constellations and conditions that are necessary for unitary-weight SSD codes to achieve full transmit diversity and optimum coding gain are presented.", "paper_title": "Maximum Rate of Unitary-Weight, Single-Symbol Decodable STBCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000297807300021"}
