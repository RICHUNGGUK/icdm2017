The multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform (MPFRFT) is a generalized fractional Fourier transform, which not only includes FRFT as special cases, but also provides a unified framework for the study of FRFT. In this paper, we present in detail the discretization method of the MPFRFT and define the discrete multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform (DMPFRFT). Then, we utilize the tensor product to define two-dimensional multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform (2D-MPFRFT) and the corresponding two-dimensional discrete multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform (2D-DMPFRFT). Finally, as an application, a novel image encryption method based on 2D-DMPFRFT is proposed. Numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate that the proposed method is reliable and more robust to blind decryption than several existing methods.", "paper_title": "The discrete multiple-parameter fractional Fourier transform", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900012"}
