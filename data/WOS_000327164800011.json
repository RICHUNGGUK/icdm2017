A neurobiological model, stating that the energy of motoneurons is minimized and that dynamic and static efforts are processed separately, is considered. This paradigm is used to produce humanoid robot's reaching movements obeying the rules of human kinematics. A nonlinear programming problem is solved to determine optimal trajectories. The optimal movements are then encoded by using a basis of motor primitives determined by principal component analysis. Finally, generalization to new movements is obtained by solving of a low-dimensional optimization problem in the operational space. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
