We consider generalizations of the Centerpoint Theorem in which halfspaces are replaced with wedges (cones) of angle alpha. In R(2), we give bounds that are tight for all values of ff and give an O(n) time algorithm to find a point satisfying these bounds. We also give partial results for R(3) and, more generally, R(d).", "paper_title": "Centerpoint Theorems for Wedges", "paper_id": "WOS:000263104200004"}
