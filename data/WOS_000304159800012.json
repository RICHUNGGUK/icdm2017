The riverbed approach was devised using the image foresting transform with a never-exploited connectivity function. We analyze its properties in the derived image graphs and discuss its theoretical relation with other popular methods such as live wire and graph cuts. Several experiments show that riverbed can significantly reduce the number of user interactions (anchor points), as compared to live wire for objects with complex shapes. This paper also includes a discussion about how to combine different methods in order to take advantage of their complementary strengths.", "paper_title": "Riverbed: A Novel User-Steered Image Segmentation Method Based on Optimum Boundary Tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000304159800012"}
