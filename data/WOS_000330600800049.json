In this paper, we propose a novel method in recommending music by analyzing the textual input of users. To this end, we mine a large corpus of documents from a Korean radio station's online bulletin board. Each document, written by the listener, is composed of a song request associated with a brief, personal story. We assume that such stories are closely related with the background of the song requests and thus, our system performs text analysis to recommend songs that were requested from other similar stories. We evaluate our system using conventional metrics along with a user evaluation test. Results show that there is close correlation between document similarity and song similarity, indicating the potential of using text as a source to recommending music. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
