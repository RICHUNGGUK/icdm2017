A key feature of the controlled system is that each subsystem is not required to share the same input channel, which was usually assumed in some existing works. By means of a weighted sum of the input matrix, a common sliding surface is designed in this work. It is shown that the reachability of the sliding surface can be ensured by the present sliding mode controller. Moreover, the sliding motion on the specified sliding surface is asymptotically stable under the proposed switching signal dependent on the state and time. Additionally, the above results are further extended to the case that the system states are unavailable. Both the sliding surface and sliding mode controller are designed by utilising state-observer. Finally, numerical simulation examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the present method.", "paper_title": "Design of sliding mode control for a class of uncertain switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000346067800004"}
