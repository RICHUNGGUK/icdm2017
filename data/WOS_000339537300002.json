By regarding the interval variables as constants, the random interval matrix and vector are firstly expanded by the first-order Taylor series. Then the expectation and variance of response vector can be calculated based on the matrix perturbation theory and random moment method. At last, the bounds of expectation and variance of the response vector can be obtained by the interval perturbation method. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
