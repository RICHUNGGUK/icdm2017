In this paper, we address the energy efficient multicast problem for discrete power levels in ad hoc wireless networks. The problem of our concern is: given n nodes deployed over 2-D plane and each node v has l(v) transmission power levels and a multicast request (s,D) (clearly, when D is Va-{s}, the multicast request is a broadcast request), how to find a multicast tree rooted at s and spanning all destinations in D such that the total energy cost of the multicast tree is minimized. We first prove that this problem is NP-hard and it is unlikely to have an approximation algorithm with performance ratio rho lnn(rho < 1). Then, we propose a general algorithm for the multicast/broadcast tree problem. And based on the general algorithm, we propose an approximation algorithm and a heuristics for multicast tree problem. Especially, we also propose an efficient heuristic for broadcast tree problem. Simulations ensure our algorithms are efficient.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms for multicast routing in ad hoc wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289145600002"}
