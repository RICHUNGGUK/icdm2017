The present soil model employs Mohr-Coulomb yield criterion and associative flow rule. The value of N-gamma is found to decrease significantly with an increase in r(i)/r(o), which is the ratio of internal radius to external radius of the ring. The value of N-gamma for a rough ring footing, especially for lager values of phi, is obviously higher than that for a smooth footing. The results are compared with those available in the literature.
