In those applications where the requirement of response time is critical, however, the conventional techniques developed for a general purpose NDR are limited, because expensive post-processing like spatial verification or hashing is usually employed to compromise the quantization errors among the visual words used for the images. In this paper, we argue that most of the errors are introduced because of the quantization process where the visual words are considered individually, which has ignored the contextual relations among words. We propose a \"spelling or phrase correction\" like process for NDR, which extends the concept of collocations to visual domain for modeling the contextual relations. Binary quadratic programming is used to enforce the contextual consistency of words selected for an image, so that the errors (typos) are eliminated and the quality of the quantization process is improved. The experimental results show that the proposed method can improve the efficiency of NDR by reducing vocabulary size by 1000% times, and under the scenario of merchandize image NDR, the expensive local interest point feature used in conventional approaches can be replaced by color-moment feature, which reduces the time cost by 9202% while maintaining comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Visual Typo Correction by Collocative Optimization: A Case Study on Merchandize Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000329581800004"}
