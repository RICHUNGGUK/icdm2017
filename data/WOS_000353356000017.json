The task of I-MLOF is to identify MI outlier. However, I-MLOF algorithm works in batch mode, where all samples must be provided for once. In some real applications such as industrial detection and traffic monitoring, MI outlier is required to be identified from data stream. The batch-mode outlier detection methods usually cannot be applied directly to these applications. In this paper, an incremental MI outlier detection algorithm \"Inc I-MLOF\" is proposed. MI outlier detection can be done for sequentially arrived data with Inc I-MLOF. We prove theoretically that Inc I-MLOF achieves the equal result to that of I-MLOF. The experimental results illustrate Inc I-MLOF achieves good performance on several synthetic and real data sets.", "paper_title": "Incremental multiple instance outlier detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000353356000017"}
