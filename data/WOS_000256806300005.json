This article argues for developing multiprogram performance metrics in a top-down fashion starting from system-level objectives. The authors propose two performance metrics: average normalized turnaround time. A user-oriented metric, and system throughput, a system-oriented metric.", "paper_title": "System-level performance metrics for multiprogram workloads", "paper_id": "WOS:000256806300005"}
