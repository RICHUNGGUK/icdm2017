Among the multimedia such as text, image, audio and video, video is a dominant component in terms of the performance of proxy server due to its traffic characteristics. For the fast caching process, caching sequences for videos are obtained to decrease both the buffer size and the required bandwidth and saved into metatiles in advance. Then, we present a novel caching and replacing algorithms for Multimedia objects based on the metatiles. Finally, experimental results are provided to show the superior performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A novel dynamic and scalable caching algorithm of proxy server for multimedia objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000245923000003"}
