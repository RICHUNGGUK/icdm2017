Numerous experts work together for the design, construction, and supply of materials. Reinforcement bar configurations are usually designed and specified by structural engineers during the construction document phase without input from the project stakeholders such as rebar detailers, fabricators, and spacers. Rebar detailers use shop drawings to form reinforcement bars for fabrication and placement. The adoption of new technologies such as set-based design and lean construction can save time and cost and ensure quality and safety during the construction process. This article examines and considers the contribution factors of downstream project stakeholders through their experiences such as rebar detailers, fabricators, and spacers during structural design using the Building Information Modeling (BIM) system. In this article, the novel modeling technology of placing reinforcement bar in the reinforced concrete flat plate floor system has been developed using the parametric design technology of 3D structural BIM, which can be converted into working drawings and shop drawings. The model can also be used for the rebar fabrication with an automatic bar bending and cutting machine. This research examines the interoperability among the structural model, the structural analysis and design results of a concrete flat plate that satisfy minimum thickness requirements and sustained and long-term deflection criteria. The numerical experiment for the automated concrete flat plate modeling using a 66-story mixed-use building in a 3D virtual environment including reinforcement bar modeling using structural BIM has been completed as the part of this study.", "paper_title": "Reinforcement Placement in a Concrete Slab Object Using Structural Building Information Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000328101600005"}
