This research is motivated by the strong demand for an efficient index structure design for main-memory database systems of RFID applications. In this paper, a signature-based Grid index structure is proposed for efficient data queries and storage. An efficient methodology is proposed to locate duplicates and to execute batch deletions and range queries based on application domain knowhow. The capability of the design is implemented in an open source main-memory database system H2 and evaluated by realistic workloads of RFID applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
