However, despite such an effort, the problem is still acknowledged to be challenging, with much room for improvements in regard to accuracy. Furthermore, most of the existing techniques are labor intensive, requiring delineations of the endo- and/or epi-cardial boundaries in all frames of a cardiac sequence. The purpose of this study is to investigate a real-time machine-learning approach which uses some image features that can be easily computed, but that nevertheless correlate well with the segmental cardiac function. Starting from a minimum user input in only one frame in a subject dataset, we build for all the regional segments and all subsequent frames a set of statistical MRI features based on a measure of similarity between distributions. We demonstrate that, over a cardiac cycle, the statistical features are related to the proportion of blood within each segment. Therefore, they can characterize segmental contraction without the need for delineating the LV boundaries in all the frames. We first seek the optimal direction along which the proposed image features are most descriptive via a linear discriminant analysis. Then, using the results as inputs to a linear support vector machine classifier, we obtain an abnormality assessment of each of the standard cardiac segments in real-time. We report a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed algorithm over 928 cardiac segments obtained from 58 subjects. Compared against ground-truth evaluations by experienced radiologists, the proposed algorithm performed competitively, with an overall classification accuracy of 86.09% and a kappa measure of 0.73.", "paper_title": "Regional Assessment of Cardiac Left Ventricular Myocardial Function via MRI Statistical Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000331298000021"}
