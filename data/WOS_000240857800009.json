In this paper the authors present a true plurigaussian simulation (PGS) method, which can be applied in a simple way to any number of geological facies by using any number of Gaussians. A recursive technique is used for multi-dimensional integration of the Gaussian functions, which forms the major part of the PGS computation. A binary, dynamic contact matrix (DCM) is used to specify the contact relations among the facies; this method has proved to be simple, flexible and capable of dealing with general, complex contact relations. A method for incorporating into PGS multivariate correlations among any number of random variables is also included. A simulated example is used to demonstrate the application of the generalised PGS. This example shows that PGS is more robust to under-sampling than traditional direct indicator simulation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
