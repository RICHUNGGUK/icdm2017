Its contributions are threefold. First, we use the Kohnoprov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit test to show that statistical differences between real data obtained by collective sampling in time dimension from multiple servers and that of obtained from a single server are insignificant. Second, we show using the real data that collective data analysis of 3-way data arrays (users x keywords,E time) known as high order tensors is more efficient than centralized algorithms with respect to both space and computational cost. Furthermore. we show that this gain is obtained without loss of accuracy. Third, we examine the sensitivit.y of collective constructions and analysis of high order data tensors to the choice of server selection and sampling window size. We construct 4-way tensors (users x keywords x time x servers) and analyze them to show the impact of server and window size selections on the results.", "paper_title": "Collective sampling and analysis of high order tensors for chatroom communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800019"}
