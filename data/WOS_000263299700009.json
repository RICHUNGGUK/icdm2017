This model exhibits three main difficulties. The first one is the coupling of PDE's posed both in Fourier space and in physical space. The second one is a three-waves resonance condition that has to be verified. The third one is the boundary conditions. We overcome these difficulties using, respectively a splitting scheme, a numerical dispersion relation and absorbing boundary conditions. We present some comparison between several phenomena that are involved and the influence of the Raman amplification and the Landau damping.
