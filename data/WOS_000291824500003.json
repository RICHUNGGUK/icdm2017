In this paper, such agents are enhanced with techniques based on neural networks (NNs) to predict their opponents' negotiation behaviour, thus achieving more profitable results and better resource utilization. The NNs are used to early detect the cases where agreements are not achievable, supporting the decision of the agents to withdraw or not from the negotiation threads. The designed NN-assisted negotiation strategies have been evaluated via extensive experiments and are proven to be very useful.", "paper_title": "USING NEURAL NETWORKS FOR EARLY DETECTION OF UNSUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION THREADS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291824500003"}
