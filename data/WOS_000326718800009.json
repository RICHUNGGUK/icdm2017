Taking into account that the difference in cost from previously known solutions was small, we have looked for a simpler albeit sub-optimal family of solutions. As a result, we have obtained three sub-optimal families, including one with a simple circular arc. The three families are compared with the benchmarks, and we have found that all three are of practical interest, because they increase the cost only by a small amount in spite of their simplicity.", "paper_title": "Near-optimal solutions for two point loads between two supports", "paper_id": "WOS:000326718800009"}
