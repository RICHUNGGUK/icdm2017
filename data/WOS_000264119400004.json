We derive the lower and upper bounds on the lifetime of cluster-based TH-IR UWB sensor networks. The results indicate that the lifetime of cluster-based network is Theta(n/S log n)(alpha/2)), which is at least (n(1/2)/(log n)(alpha 1/2)) times longer than that of non-cluster-based TH-IR UWB network; thus clustering can significantly improve the network lifetime. The bounds also reveal that the network lifetime increases with node density n/S, thus the large-scale dense cluster-based TH-IR UWB wireless sensor network is more practical.", "paper_title": "Bounds on lifetime of cluster-based ultra-wide band wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000264119400004"}
