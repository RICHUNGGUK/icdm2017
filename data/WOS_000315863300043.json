The methodology is based on the concept of Leadership group recently introduced by one of the authors. We show how to analyze the structure of the Leadership group as a function of a single parameter. Zachary's network and a Facebook university network are used to illustrate the applicability of the model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
