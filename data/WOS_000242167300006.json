In this paper, a (t, k)-diagnosis algorithm under the MM* model is proposed for matching composition networks, which include many well-known interconnection networks, such as hypercubes, crossed cubes, twisted cubes, and Mobius cubes. It is shown that a matching composition network of n dimensions is (Omega(2(n)*logn/n), n)-diagnosable.", "paper_title": "(t, k)-diagnosis for matching composition networks under the MM* model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242167300006"}
