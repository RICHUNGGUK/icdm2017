It generalizes the notion of a palindrome into a Theta-palindrome-a word invariant under Theta. For languages closed under Theta we give the relation between Theta-palindromic complexity and factor complexity. We generalize the notion of richness to Theta-richness and we prove analogous characterizations of words that are Theta-rich, especially in the case of set of factors invariant under H. A criterion for Theta-richness of Theta-episturmian words is given together with other examples of Theta-rich words. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
