Each of the RBF basis functions has a tunable center vector and an adjustable diagonal covariance matrix. A multi-innovation recursive least square (MRLS) algorithm is applied to update the weights of RBF online, while themodeling performance is monitored. When the modeling residual of the RBF network becomes large in spite of the weight adaptation, a node identified as insignificant is replaced with a new node, for which the tunable center vector and diagonal covariance matrix are optimized using the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. The major contribution is to combine the MRLS weight adaptation and QPSO node structure optimization in an innovative way so that it can track well the local characteristic in the nonstationary system with a very sparse model. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm has significantly better performance than existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Online Modeling With Tunable RBF Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000319010000011"}
