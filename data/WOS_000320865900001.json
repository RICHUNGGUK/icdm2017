Structural models often combine discrete and continuum members and current requirements for efficiency and extreme structures push research in the field of optimization. Examples of varied complexity and dimensional space are analyzed and compared, highlighting the advantages of the proposed method. The goal of this work is to provide a simple formulation for the discrete component of the structure, more specifically the truss, to be optimized in presence of a continuum.", "paper_title": "Truss layout optimization within a continuum", "paper_id": "WOS:000320865900001"}
