We examine previous approaches, including grammar-based methods, embedded systems and cellular models. Each system can be classified as endogenous (internally determined) or exogenous (externally determined), with some models exhibiting features of both. We then introduce a new model, the Simplicial Developmental System (SDS), which simulates individual cells embedded in a physical environment, with cell division, movement and growth controlled by morphogenetic chemical simulation. SDS uses a tetrahedral mesh as its base representation for geometric modelling and physical simulation. Cell growth, movement and division are determined by simulating chemical morphogens that are diffused between cells according to a set of user defined rules. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this model in terms of the competing goals of user control, developmental complexity and open-ended development (the ability to generate new component structures without explicit specification). Examples highlighting the strengths of the model are illustrated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Developmental modelling with SDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280908600002"}
