However, proposed service-oriented architectures are typically based on centralised components, such as service registries or service brokers, that introduce reliability, management, and performance issues. This paper describes an approach to fully decentralise a service-oriented architecture using a self-organising peer-to-peer network maintained by service providers and consumers. The design is based on a gradient peer-to-peer topology, which allows the system to replicate a service registry using a limited number of the most stable and best performing peers. The paper evaluates the proposed approach through extensive simulation experiments and shows that the decentralised registry and the underlying peer-to-peer infrastructure scale to a large number of peers and can successfully manage high peer churn rates.", "paper_title": "Decentralising a service-oriented architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000284095500006"}
