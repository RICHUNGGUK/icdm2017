The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of photograph use, model use, and the physical attractiveness of the model on bidding behavior. Design/methodology/approach - A mock online auction website was built to manipulate picture use, model use, and the physical attractiveness of the model. The experiment recruited volunteers and randomly assigned each participant into one of four treatments. After experiencing the stimulus for two minutes, the researchers asked participants to evaluate their bidding intention and write down the highest price they would bid. Findings - The results show that using a photograph to introduce the product acquires a higher bidding intention and bidding amount than not using a photograph. In addition, a web page using physically attractive models in photographs acquires a higher bidding intention and bidding price than a web page using physically unattractive models in photographs. Originality/value - This study is unique in discussing the effect of the visual content of the product description block on online bidding behavior. The results of this study provide suggestions and a product information presentation strategy for online auction sellers.", "paper_title": "Photograph and model use within an online auction page for influencing buyer's bidding behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000322935200002"}
