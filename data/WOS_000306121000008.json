Therefore, latency can be considered as the main web performance metric from the user's point of view. Many studies have demonstrated that web prefetching can be an interesting technique to reduce such latency at the expense of slightly increasing the network traffic. In this context, this paper presents an empirical study to investigate the maximum benefits that web users can expect from prefetching techniques in the current web. Unlike previous theoretical studies, this work considers a realistic prefetching architecture using real traces. In this way, the influence of real implementation constraints are considered and analyzed. The results obtained show that web prefetching could improve page latency up to 52% in the studied traces.", "paper_title": "Key factors in web latency savings in an experimental prefetching system", "paper_id": "WOS:000306121000008"}
