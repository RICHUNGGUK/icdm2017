Similar to other multi-agent methods, Ray Optimization has a number of particles consisting of the variables of the problem. These agents are considered as rays of light. Based on the Snell's light refraction law when light travels from a lighter medium to a darker medium, it refracts and its direction changes. This behavior helps the agents to explore the search space in early stages of the optimization process and to make them converge in the final stages. This law is the main tool of the Ray Optimization algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
