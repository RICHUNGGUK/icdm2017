In OVRP a vehicle does not return to the depot after servicing the last customer on a route. A particular decoding method is proposed for implementing PSO for OVRP. In the decoding method, a vector of the customer's position is constructed in descending order. Then each customer is assigned to a route with taking into account feasibility conditions. Finally one-point move has been applied on constructed routes that seem promising to result in a better solution. Experimental evaluations on benchmark data sets demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
