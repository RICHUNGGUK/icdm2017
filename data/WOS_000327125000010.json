These smoothers also include the modified additive and multiplicative smoothers which result from subspace decomposition. Without full elliptic regularity assumption, it is shown that the multigrid methods with these smoothers converge uniformly for second-order nonselfadjoint elliptic boundary value problems if the mesh size of the coarsest grid is sufficiently small (but independent of the number of the multigrid levels). Numerical results are reported to confirm the theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Convergence analysis of HSS-multigrid methods for second-order nonselfadjoint elliptic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000327125000010"}
