The proposed sampling technique has the capability to be incorporated in the structure of the SA-ADC. The proposed SA-ADC changes the rate of sampling in accordance with the rate of changes of the signal. In this way, the data volume is reduced considerably without losing the important information in the signal. Simulation results in the 0.18 um CMOS technology shows a power saving of up to 90.5 % and a compression ratio of 7.5 compared to the conventional sampling technique of ECG signals.", "paper_title": "A new non-uniform adaptive-sampling successive approximation ADC for biomedical sparse signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700002"}
