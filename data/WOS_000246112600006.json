The resulting platform is capable of running real applications, thus allowing a precise measurement of the execution overheads, and a fair comparison of the hardware and software speedups at several implementation levels. By using this approach, we determine which field operations ( e. g., multiplication) are better suited to constrained environments, and which ones provide an enhanced performance in general-purpose systems. Experimental results reveal that by using our fastest field multiplier implemented as a custom instruction in a combined hardware/ software approach, we accelerate point multiplication ( the fundamental operation in Elliptic Curve Cryptography) over 126 times.", "paper_title": "A custom instruction approach for hardware and software implementations of finite field arithmetic over F-2163 using Gaussian normal bases", "paper_id": "WOS:000246112600006"}
