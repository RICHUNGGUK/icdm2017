The interactions between solid and fluid were modeled by the finite volume particle (FVP) method. The distinct element method (DEM) together with a multi-time-step algorithm was introduced into the FVP method to calculate the effects of contact between solid bodies and between solid bodies and walls. The introduced DEM model was verified by experimental analyses for the collapse of multiple solid cylinder layers. The proposed algorithm using the optimized DEM model was then applied to a water dam breaking, involving multiple solid cylinder layers. A comparison between experiments and simulations demonstrated the DEM model introduced into the FVP method is effective in representing solid-fluid mixture flows reasonably well.
