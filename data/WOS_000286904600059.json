This paper points to better formalize the global measure of imbalance reported in Camillo and D'Attoma (2010) and D'Attoma (2009) and to introduce a multivariate imbalance test. We consider the global measure of imbalance and the multivariate imbalance test as tools for investigating the dependence relationship between categorical covariates and the assignment-to-treatment indicator variable within a more complex strategy whose final aim is to find balanced groups. We will show in simulated data how the strategy works in practice. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
