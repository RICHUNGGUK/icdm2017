We focus on the synchronization tasks in the receiver. Our objective is to minimize the required overhead, in order to improve the spectral efficiency with regard to a single carrier waveform system. A non pilot aided algorithm is used for fine synchronization. It is preceded by a coarse synchronization stage, which relies on a limited overhead (short cyclic prefix associated to some pilots). The performance of the proposed receiver is assessed through simulation results.", "paper_title": "OFDM Receiver for Fixed Satellite Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000286292500003"}
