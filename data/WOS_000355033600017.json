The incompatible modes are directly adjoint to known EAS elements. In the context of explicit time integration, the incompatible degrees of freedom are treated as regular unknowns with associated modal masses and incorporated into the global equations instead of being condensed-out locally decreasing the computational effort. The issue of artificial kinetic energy is briefly discussed. Further the implementation concept applying symbolic programming is described. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
