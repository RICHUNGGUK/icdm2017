This coupling between Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Computational Structural Dynamics (CSD) is achieved through a Multi-Disciplinary Computing Environment (MDICE), which allows several computer codes or 'modules' to communicate in a highly efficient fashion. The present approach offers the advantage of utilizing well-established single-disciplinary codes in a multi-disciplinary framework. The flow solver is density-based for modeling compressible, turbulent flow problems using structured and/or unstructured grids. A modal approach is employed for the structural response. Flutter predictions performed on an AGARD 445.6 wing at different Mach numbers are presented and compared with experimental data. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
