In particular, we apply the novel paradigm of the Semantic Web of Things to enhance information management and users' experience in a museum exhibition where artworks assume a proactive role and provide visitors with enriched information. According to the Linked Data principles, the content delivery system is empowered by the introduction of suited semantic annotations to the objects. This enables things in the real world to be linked to their corresponding descriptions on the Web of Data and, in turn, it enables users to increase their knowledge and discover new facts. Moreover, the deployment of education-oriented annotations, which specify how to use the sensorized objects in learning activities, makes possible to match their features with educational tasks and users characteristics, thus providing personalized services and improving the learning experience.
