It is demonstrated on the stabilisation optimization of a diamagnetic levitation system for biomedical applications. Design/methodology/approach - Surface approach was used to compute analytically the magnetic field induction. This modeling is depending on system to design (approximation, equation simplifications due to specific geometries) coupled with a design framework which is based on symbolic equation derivation and SQP constrained optimization algorithm. Findings - Optimally stabilized magnetic levitating systems, for a pyrolitic graphite micro plate and for a latex bead. Research limitations/implications - The analytical or semi-analytical modeling of magnetic field induction and forces produced by complex geometries is sometimes either hard to establish or not adequate to perform a fast optimization, due to heavy numerical parts implemented into the device modeling. Practical implications - Implications are of two kinds. First are results of the magnetic levitating system which can improve lab on a chip for biomedical applications. Second is design framework improvement with diamagnetic modeling capabilities. Originality/value - Stability optimization of diamagnetic levitation system, based on an original approach of modeling and sizing with dedicated tools.", "paper_title": "Efficient modeling approach for optimization of a system based on passive diamagnetic levitation as a platform for bio-medical applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000246638700013"}
