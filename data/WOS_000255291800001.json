The input data are assumed to be gamma-srnooth (gamma = r + Q: the rth derivatives satisfy a Q-Holder condition). Recently, the following almost sharp estimate of the order of the nth minimal error was given by Kacewicz [Almost optimal solution of initial-value problems by randomized and quantum algorithms, J. Complexity 22 (2006) 676-690, see also (http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0510045 >]: c(1)n(-gamma-1/2) <= e(n)(ran) <= c(2)(epsilon)n(-gamma-1/2+epsilon), with an arbitrary epsilon > 0. We present a Taylor Monte Carlo method and show that it has error rate n(-gamma-1/2) way establishing the exact order of the randomized nth minimal error. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
