This research also uses RFID to successfully create a smart-shelf-enabled system as an advanced decision-making mechanism for managers. A case study based on a well-known fashion retailing company is used to demonstrate how the proposed system can significantly improve daily business operations. In addition, this research also used artificial neural network to predict the VIP member classification and customer retention rate. The experimental results figure out that the artificial intelligence approach would be outperformed the statistical and decision tree methods. Finally, a questionnaire was administered to 120 customers and investigated their degree of RFID usage willingness and purchase intention based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. The empirical results of our study present the easy-to-use and social influence factors that would be most influenced the customers' usage willing and purchase intention with RFID technology.", "paper_title": "RFID-based intelligent shopping environment: a comprehensive evaluation framework with neural computing approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800014"}
