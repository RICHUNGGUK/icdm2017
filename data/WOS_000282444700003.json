Given a set of quality requirements, one can choose to either find the optimal composition or a \"good enough\" composition, which satisfies these requirements. Since optimizing compositions of semantic services under quality constraints is known to be NP-hard, it is unsuitable for realistic problems within large search spaces. The authors address the issue by using the \"good enough\" approach, selecting the first composition that passes their quality threshold. Firstly, this paper defines quality constraints within an innovative and extensible model designed to balance semantic fit (or functional quality) with quality of service (QoS) metrics. The semantic fit criterion evaluates the quality of semantic links between the semantic descriptions of Web services parameters, while QoS focuses on non-functional criteria of services. User quality requirements are met by selecting a valid composition. To allow the use of this model with a large number of candidate services as foreseen by the strategic EC-funded project SOA4All the authors formulate the selection problem as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem and test the use of a stochastic search method.", "paper_title": "Satisfying End User Constraints in Service Composition by Applying Stochastic Search Methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000282444700003"}
