The stability analysis is based on Lyapunov functions that are continuous and piecewise quadratic. It is shown that the stability of the fuzzy large-scale systems can be established if a piecewise Lyapunov function can be constructed, and, moreover, the function can be obtained by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) that are numerically feasible. It is also demonstrated via a numerical example that the stability result based on the piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions is less conservative than that based on the common quadratic Lyapunov functions. The H., controllers can also be designed by solving a set of LMIs based on these powerful piecewise quadratic Lyapunov functions.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis and H-infinity controller design of fuzzy large-scale systems based on piecewise Lyapunov functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238069200018"}
