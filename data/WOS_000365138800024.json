The MG includes different renewable sources such as Wind Turbine (WT), Fuel Cell (FC), Micro Turbine (MT) and Photovoltaics (PVs) as well as battery as the storage device. In order to make the analysis practical, different classes of PHEVs and chargers are included in the proposed problem. The optimization framework tries to optimize the total MG cost when considering several operational and security constraints. In order to solve the problem optimally, a new modification method based on bat algorithm (BA) is employed. In addition, a new modification method is introduced for the BA to reduce the possibility of trapping in local optima. The simulation results show the satisfying performance of the proposed method for managing the MG with high penetration level of PHEVs.", "paper_title": "Effect of plug-in electric vehicles demand on the renewable micro-grids", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800024"}
