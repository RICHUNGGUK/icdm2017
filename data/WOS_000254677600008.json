In this paper, we present general bounds for the sample complexity of the identification and decision versions of the hidden subgroup problem. As a consequence of the bounds, we show that the sample complexity for both of the decision and identification versions is Theta(log vertical bar H vertical bar/ log p) for a candidate set H of hidden subgroups in the case where the candidate nontrivial subgroups have the same prime order p, which implies that the decision version is at least as hard as the identification version in this case. In particular, it does so for the important cases such as the dihedral and the symmetric hidden subgroup problems. Moreover, the upper bound of the identification is attained by a variant of the pretty good measurement. This implies that the concept of the pretty good measurement is quite useful for identification of hidden subgroups over an arbitrary group with optimal sample complexity.", "paper_title": "Quantum measurements for hidden subgroup problems with optimal sample complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000254677600008"}
