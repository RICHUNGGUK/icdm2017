Without introducing proper privacy protection mechanisms, widespread deployment of RFID could raise privacy concerns to both companies and individuals. As a fundamental issue for the design and analysis of secure RFID systems, some formal RFID privacy frameworks were proposed in recent years to give the principles for evaluating the security and privacy in RFID system. However, readers can be confused with so many proposed frameworks. In this paper, we make a comparative and survey study on the proposed RFID privacy frameworks. We mainly divide the existing models into three categories, the four-oracle framework, eight-oracle framework and Universal Composability framework. We give a brief review on the existing models and describe their abilities to model the adversarial behavior in RFID systems. We then analyze relations among those existing RFID privacy models and make some comparisons among their properties.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Privacy Frameworks for RFID Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588600002"}
