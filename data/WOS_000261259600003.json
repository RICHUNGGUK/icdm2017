The standard SS is modified such that the hierarchical clustering is used for the update of the solutions needed to diversify the solution set. The nonlinear analysis called refined plastic hinge method is used for structural analysis. The nonlinear relations between rotations and bending moments of semi-rigid joints are modeled by the three-parameter models. Three design problems are formulated as combinatorial problems and solved by SS. Finally, the characteristics of the optimal solutions are discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
