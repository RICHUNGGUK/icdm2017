This paper presents a dithered H-infinity robust fuzzy control scheme to stabilize chaotic systems that ensures disturbance attenuation bounds. In the proposed scheme, Takagi-Sugeno (T-s) fuzzy linear models are used to describe the relaxed models of the dithered chaotic system, and fuzzy controllers are designed based on an extension to the concept of parallel distributed compensation (PDC). Sufficient condition for the existence of the H-infinity robust fuzzy controllers is presented in terms of a novel linear matrix inequalities (LMI) form which takes full consideration of modeling error and disturbances, but cannot be solved by the standard procedures. In order to solve the LMI problem and to identify the chaotic systems as T-S fuzzy modes, we propose a compound optimization strategy called the island-based random-walk algorithm (IRA). The algorithm is composed of a set of communicating random-walk optimization procedures concatenated with the down-hill simplex method. The design procedure and validity of the proposed scheme is demonstrated via numerical simulation of the dithered fuzzy control of a chaotic system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
