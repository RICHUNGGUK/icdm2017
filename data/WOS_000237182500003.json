At time 0 two disjoint finite sets xi(1), xi(2) subset of Z(d) are infected with type 1 and type 2 infection respectively. An uninfected site then becomes type 1 (2) infected at a rate proportional to the number of type 1 (2) infected nearest neighbours and once infected it remains so forever. The main result in this paper is, loosely speaking, that the choice of the initial sets xi(1) and xi(2) is irrelevant in deciding whether or not the event of mutual unbounded growth for the two infection types has positive probability.", "paper_title": "The initial configuration is irrelevant for the possibility of mutual unbounded growth in the two-type Richardson model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237182500003"}
