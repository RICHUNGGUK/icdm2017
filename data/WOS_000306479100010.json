Engineering teams are becoming more and more interdisciplinary and distributed, products and the environments they are created, used and recycled in are increasingly complex. Design engineers, system architects as well as requirements engineers and managers have to be able to understand the product and its whole lifecycle in order to be able to respect the constraints and requirements that are imposed on the product by different actors. Many of these skills have to be developed and improved in the course of a professional career rather than in initial education. This paper gives insight into the development of one component of a consistent qualification and certification scheme, which is in its entirety particularly targeted at Integrated Design Engineers in various industrial sectors.
