The driving force behind the proposed system is to allow for self-configuration of MANETs by enabling them to be adaptive to varying conditions. Emphasis is placed on describing the requirements and specifications of the supporting platform's functionality. We propose the distributed management of the MANET through a proactively constructed body of nodes in order to cope with the inherently dynamic nature of MANETs. We present our work on deploying the designed system on our experimental MANET testbed and provide results of its performance based on extended testing.", "paper_title": "Context-driven self-configuration of mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237211100006"}
