Several challenges arise from this domain, related with participant heterogeneity, transient behavior, scalability or quality of service. The use of standards is important here, where a multidiscipline approach is required. We propose ServiceDDS, a framework that combines different standard technologies to solve the problems related with the integration of components into the described environment. ServiceDDS is based on DDS to support dynamic distributed interactions, XMPP to provide Web access, and RTSJ for real-time performance. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
