The system under consideration is linear time-invariant, multi-input multi-output and an H-2 norm of tracking error signal is used as tracking performance index. The encoder-decoder with an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) is employed in feedback channel or feed-forward channel. The aim is to determine the minimal error in tracking a Brownian motion, which can be obtained by all possible stabilizing two-parameter controllers. It is shown that the best achievable tracking performance is closely related to the nonminimum phase zeros and unstable poles of the plant, determined by their locations and directions. We also demonstrated that AWGN may degenerate the tracking performance and encoder-decoder can be designed to eliminate the negative effect of AWGN and improve the systems' tracking ability. A typical example is given to illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
