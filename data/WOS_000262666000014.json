The basic idea here is to progressively modify the vertices of an original mesh to generate a new control mesh whose limit surface interpolates all vertices in the original mesh. The scheme is applicable to meshes with any size and any topology, and it has the advantages of both a local scheme and a global scheme.", "paper_title": "Progressive Interpolation based on Catmull-Clark Subdivision Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000262666000014"}
