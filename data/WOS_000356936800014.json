The result of identification can provide valuable support for topic-based entity search. However, current identification models focus on limited factors (either meta-description or entity feature of networks) and lack the derivation process for topic clusters, which often lead to dumb results. In this paper, we present a two-level identification model called MetaEntity to identify meta-level topic clusters and entity-level topic clusters. Unlike traditional approaches, both meta-description and entity feature are fully used to improve the accuracy of identification. Specially, MetaEntity can support identification from multiple points of view. In addition, an interactive derivation algorithm is proposed to incrementally maintain the identified topic clusters. As a result, quality of both meta-level topic clusters and entity-level topic clusters is mutually promoted, which means both of them are getting more accurate and complete. The experiments demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithms compared with traditional approaches.", "paper_title": "Two-level interactive identification and derivation of topic clusters in complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000356936800014"}
