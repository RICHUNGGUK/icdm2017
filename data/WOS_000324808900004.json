The optimized network architecture was ten input parameters, two hidden layers, and one output. The feed forward back propagation neural network of ten and four neurons in first and second hidden layers using TRAINLM training function predicted highly accurate and more precise load-deflection diagrams compared to classical linear regression (LR). The ANN's MSE values are 40 times smaller than the LR's. The test data R value from ANN is 0.9931; thus indicating a high confidence level.", "paper_title": "Application of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and linear regressions (LR) to predict the deflection of concrete deep beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000324808900004"}
