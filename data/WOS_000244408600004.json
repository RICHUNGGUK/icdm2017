This paper attempts at enriching the ER model based on association rules (AR) discovered from large databases by introducing specializations and sub-types into the ER model. The proposed framework is extended to deal with more general, flexible and linguistic knowledge in fuzzy association rules. Moreover, transforming an AR-enriched-ER (AR-EER) schema to a relational database (RDB) schema is also investigated. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
