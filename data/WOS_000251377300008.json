Despite this, stage data in cancer registries is often incomplete, inaccurate, or simply not collected. This article describes a prototype software system (Cancer Stage Interpretation System, CSIS) that automatically extracts cancer staging information from medical reports. The system uses text classification techniques to train support vector machines (SVMs) to extract elements of stage listed in cancer staging guidelines. When processing new reports, CSIS identifies sentences relevant to the staging decision, and subsequently assigns the most likely stage. The system was developed using a database of staging data and pathology reports for 710 lung cancer patients, then validated in an independent set of 179 patients against pathologic stage assigned by two independent pathologists. CSIS achieved overall accuracy of 74% for tumor (T) staging and 87% for node (N) staging, and errors were observed to mirror disagreements between human experts.", "paper_title": "Collection of cancer stage data by classifying free-text medical reports", "paper_id": "WOS:000251377300008"}
