The framework contains a generic crystallizer model from which a wide range of problem-system specific models can be created through a model generation procedure. The modelling framework allows one to study a wide range of chemical (crystallization) systems as well as different crystallizer operation phases (scenarios) through choices of different forms of models for phenomena such as nucleation, crystal growth, agglomeration and breakage. Applications of the modelling framework are highlighted through: (i) a paracetamol crystallization case study illustrating the ability of the modelling framework to develop and further extend models and to switch between different chemical systems; and (ii) a potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) case study to demonstrate how the model complexity can be changed by switching between one-dimensional and two-dimensional descriptions.
