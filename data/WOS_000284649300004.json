The proposed growing procedure without pruning not only simplifies the online learning process but also facilitates the formation of a more parsimonious fuzzy neural network. By virtue of optimal parameter identification, high performance and accuracy can be obtained. The learning phase of the PAFNN involves two stages, namely structure learning and parameter learning. In structure learning, the PAFNN starts with no hidden neurons and parsimoniously generates new hidden units according to the proposed growth criteria as learning proceeds. In parameter learning, parameters in premises and consequents of fuzzy rules, regardless of whether they are newly created or already in existence, are updated by the extended Kalman filter (EKF) method and the linear least squares (LLS) algorithm, respectively. This parameter adjustment paradigm enables optimization of parameters in each learning epoch so that high performance can be achieved. The effectiveness and superiority of the PAFNN paradigm are demonstrated by comparing the proposed method with state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results on various benchmark problems in the areas of function approximation, nonlinear dynamic system identification and chaotic time-series prediction demonstrate that the proposed PAFNN algorithm can achieve more parsimonious network structure, higher approximation accuracy and better generalization simultaneously.", "paper_title": "AN ONLINE SELF-ORGANIZING SCHEME FOR PARSIMONIOUS AND ACCURATE FUZZY NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000284649300004"}
