However, the increasing needs of the current control schemes have already been shown. In this paper, we theoretically analysis the features of neural network structure and convex optimization related method. There are a lot of shortcomings but the cable network should be restricted the wiring in some situations, for example, wiring, reroute workload big, easy to damage, in the network, each node cannot move and so on. With the mathematical optimization, game theory, mathematical economics and optimal control theory to the development of disciplines, convex analysis are increasingly brought to the attention of the people. Our proposed methodology combines the neural network and optimization theory to obtain better performance, the experimental result shows the performance of our approach compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.", "paper_title": "Research on Modification and Optimization of Network Topology and Internet Security based on Neural Network Structure and Mathematical Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000369385600001"}
