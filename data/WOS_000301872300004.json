The Particle Swarm method is a numerical optimization technique that simulates the social behavior of birds, fishes and bugs. In nature fish school, birds flock and bugs swarm not only for reproduction but for other reasons such as finding food and escaping predators. Similar to birds seek to find food, the optimum design process seeks to find the optimum solution. In the particle swarm optimization each particle in the swarm represents a candidate solution of the optimum design problem. In the optimum design algorithm presented the design constraints are imposed in accordance with LRFD-AISC (Load and Resistance Factor Design, American Institute of Steel Construction). In the design of beam-column members the combined strength constraints are considered that take into account the lateral torsional buckling of the member. The algorithm developed selects optimum W sections for beams and columns of unbraced frame from the list of 272 W-sections list. This selection is carried out such that design constraints imposed by the LRFD are satisfied and the minimum frame weight is obtained. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated considering a number of design examples. (C) 2011 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
