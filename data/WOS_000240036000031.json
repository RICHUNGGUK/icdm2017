In particular several methods based on line shape descriptors used to identify newborns from the biometric information of the ears are developed. The process steps are the following: image acquisition, ear segmentation, ear normalization, feature extraction and identification. Several shape signatures are defined from contour images. These are formulated in terms of zoning and contour crossings descriptors. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the used techniques.", "paper_title": "Biometric recognition based on line shape descriptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000031"}
