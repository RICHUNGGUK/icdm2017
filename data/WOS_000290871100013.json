Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption is a promising cryptographic solution to these issues for enforcing access control policies defined by a data owner on outsourced data. However, the problem of applying the attribute-based encryption in an outsourced architecture introduces several challenges with regard to the attribute and user revocation. In this paper, we propose an access control mechanism using ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption to enforce access control policies with efficient attribute and user revocation capability. The fine-grained access control can be achieved by dual encryption mechanism which takes advantage of the attribute-based encryption and selective group key distribution in each attribute group. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed mechanism to securely manage the outsourced data. The analysis results indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure in the data outsourcing systems.", "paper_title": "Attribute-Based Access Control with Efficient Revocation in Data Outsourcing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000290871100013"}
