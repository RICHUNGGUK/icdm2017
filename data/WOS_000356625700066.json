Here, we introduce a sequential trimming-and-retrieving alignment approach for investigating DNA methylation patterns, which significantly improves the number of mapped reads and covered CpG sites. The method is implemented in an automated analysis toolkit for processing bisulfite sequencing reads.", "paper_title": "A trimming-and-retrieving alignment scheme for reduced representation bisulfite sequencing", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625700066"}
