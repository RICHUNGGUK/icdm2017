However, when mobile node (MN) roams between network segments, the handoff latency results in packet losses and transmission delay. In this paper, we propose a multihomed fast handoff scheme (MFH-MIP) to decrease the handoff cost. In the proposed MFH-MIP scheme, each MN is implemeted with the link layer trigger and multihomed techniques. Based on the link layer trigger, MN can collect signal strengths of nearby access points (APs) and switch to a new link automatically when the old link becomes unsuitable to connect. Using the multihomed technique, MN can prepare for handoff using two (or more) interfaces, in which (i) one is connected with the old link to receive packets and (ii) the other one is used to access nearby APs and select the most suitable one as the new link, in parellel. In this way, MN can continuously transmit and receive packets during handoff. Based on the proposed method, MN can roam smoothly among different networks in the wireless environment.
