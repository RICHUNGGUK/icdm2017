Dejean's Conjecture, which has been recently proven, provides this threshold for all alphabet sizes. Motivated by a question of Krieger, we deal here with the analogous threshold when the infinite word is restricted to be a D0L word. Our main result is that, asymptotically, this threshold does not exceed the unrestricted threshold by more than a little.", "paper_title": "ON THE D0L REPETITION THRESHOLD", "paper_id": "WOS:000283579400001"}
