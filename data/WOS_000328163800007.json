Many attempts in using expectation maximization for TFBSs discovery are successful in past. However, identifying highly degenerate motifs and reducing the effect of local optima are still an arduous task. To alleviate the vulnerability of EM to local optima trapping, we present a heuristic cluster-based EM algorithm, CEM, which refines the cluster subsets in EM method to explore the best local optimal solution. Based on experiments using both synthetic and real datasets, our algorithm demonstrates significant improvements in identifying the motif instances and performs better than current widely used algorithms. CEM is a novel planted motif finding algorithm, which is able to solve the challenging instances and easy to parallel since the process of solving each cluster subset is independent.", "paper_title": "A HEURISTIC CLUSTER-BASED EM ALGORITHM FOR THE PLANTED (l, d) PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000328163800007"}
