A novel split-and-merge technique(SMT) is proposed. SMT starts with an initial shape boundary segmentation, split and merge are then alternately done against the shape boundary. The procedure is halted when the pre-specified iteration number is achieved. For increasing stability of SMT and improving its robustness to the initial segmentation, a ranking-selection scheme is utilized to choose the splitting and merging points. The experimental results show its superiority.", "paper_title": "A novel split-and-merge technique for error-bounded polygonal approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100037"}
