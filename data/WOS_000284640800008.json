It is established by signal description and transformation with considerations of input referred noise sources. It predicts that CDS operation has different noise effects: it suppresses reset noise and attenuates 1/f noise from the equivalent input noise voltage, but it has no noise-reduction effect on the input referred noise current. Parametrical analysis can also be performed by using this model. For example, by varying integration duration, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) will first be proportional to t(int), then to t(int)(1/2) , and finally limited by the 1/f noise component becoming predominant. This proposed model is validated by comparison of analysis results with those from temporal noise analysis using SpectreRF of Cadence (TM) CAD tool. Unlike time-hungry temporal noise analysis, this model provides rapid results.", "paper_title": "Cyclostationarity-based model for noise analysis of charge amplification with correlated double sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000284640800008"}
