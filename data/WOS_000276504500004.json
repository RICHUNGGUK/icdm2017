We show that (w,r,d)-cover-free-families form a class of (s,l) (e) -disjunct matrices. Moreover, a decoding algorithm for pooling designs based on (s,l) (e) -disjunct matrices is considered.", "paper_title": "A class of error-correcting pooling designs over complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000276504500004"}
