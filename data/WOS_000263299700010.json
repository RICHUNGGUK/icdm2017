These pre-images are approximated by continuous, piecewise-linear lines. The enforcement of the discrete version of the incompressibility constraint is a very important issue to determine correctly the flux polygons and to reduce considerably the integration, discretization and interpolation numerical errors. The proposed method compares favorably with other previous multidimensional advection methods as long as the initial interface line is well reconstructed. Conversely, we show that when the interface is very fragmented the total numerical error is completely dominated by the reconstruction error and in these conditions it is very difficult to assess which advection scheme is the most reliable one.
