The proposed modulator has the characteristics of wide bandwidth for WCDMA applications and low distortion in the low frequency band for GSM applications. Low-distortion and interpolative techniques are used in this modulator to enhance the performance. The low-distortion technique has not only the swing-suppressing characteristic, but it can reduce the power consumption. Moreover, the resolution can be improved even under non-linearity effects. An experimental chip is implemented in the standard 0.18-mu m 1P6M CMOS technology. The measurements indicate a dynamic range of 76/68 dB and a peak signal to noise plus distortion ratio of 70/61 dB for GSM/WCDMA applications. The core area is 1 9 1.4 mm(2) and the power consumption is 10.5/28 mW for GSM/WCDMA at 1.8 V.", "paper_title": "A low power sigma-delta modulator for dual-mode wide-band receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400003"}
