However, the exact nature of the transport of oxygen from the arteriole to the surrounding tissue remains shrouded in mystery, in part because the experimental data are not in accordance with the well-established Krogh diffusion model. In this paper, arteriolar pulsation is added to Krogh's model to show that simple vasomotor changes in the arterioles' diameter are insufficient to explain the high mobility of oxygen away from the arteriolar wall.
