A analysis for oscillators guides the reduction of oscillator intensities and improvement of oscillator's immunity to noise. design-oriented approach to circuit analysis efficiently design constraints and reduces the dimensionality of the optimization problem. The perturbation projection vector based noise computation makes the proposed optimization general and applicable to all types of oscillators, independent circuit topology. Several examples illustrate the benefits of the optimization approach.", "paper_title": "Automated Design and Optimization of Low-Noise Oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000265486900001"}
