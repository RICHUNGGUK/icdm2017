The approach adopted is based on a waterfall style approach consisting of a series of three phases each of which contributes to the progression and improvement of a cognitive prosthetic-based solution. Within each phase, distinct stages of design, development and evaluation of the cognitive solution are conducted. The current paper discusses the distinct stages conducted in the first phase of the project which resulted in the design and development of a user driven solution based on the needs of 17 patient/carer dyads across three trial sites.
