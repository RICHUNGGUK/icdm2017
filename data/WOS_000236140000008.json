This single wafer approach allows for faster wafer processing and better control of process parameters on the wafer. However, as feature sizes become smaller, and wafer uniformity demands become more stringent, there is an increased demand from rapid thermal (RT) equipment manufacturers to improve control, uniformity and repeatability of processes on wafers. In RT processes, the main control problem is that of temperature regulation, which is complicated due to the high non-linearity of the heating process, process parameters that often change significantly during and between the processing of each wafer, and difficulties in measuring temperature and edge effects. This paper summarizes work carried out in cooperation with Steag CVD Systems, in which algorithms for steady state and dynamic temperature uniformity were developed. The steady-state algorithm involves the reverse engineering of the required power distribution, given a history of past distributions and the resulting temperature profile. The algorithm for dynamic temperature uniformity involves the development of a first-principles model of the RTP chamber and wafer, its calibration using experimental data, and the use of the model to develop a controller.
