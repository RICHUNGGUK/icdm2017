However, when the data set is large, naively scanning the entire data set to find the top matches is not scalable. In this work, we propose a kernel indexing strategy to substantially prune the search space and, thus, improve the performance of top-k queries. Our kernel indexer (KDX) takes advantage of the underlying geometric properties and quickly converges on an approximate set of top-k instances of interest. More importantly, once the kernel ( e. g., Gaussian kernel) has been selected and the indexer has been constructed, the indexer can work with different kernel-parameter settings ( e. g., gamma and sigma) without performance compromise. Through theoretical analysis and empirical studies on a wide variety of data sets, we demonstrate KDX to be very effective. An earlier version of this paper appeared in the 2005 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining [ 24]. This version differs from the previous submission in providing a detailed cost analysis under different scenarios, specifically designed to meet the varying needs of accuracy, speed, and space requirements, developing an approach for insertion and deletion of instances, presenting the specific computations as well as the geometric properties used in performing the same, and providing detailed algorithms for each of the operations necessary to create and use the index structure.", "paper_title": "KDX: An indexer for support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000236851800003"}
