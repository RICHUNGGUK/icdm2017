They can be non-deterministic as well as augmented with a pushdown stack. First, we prove that adding a pushdown stack properly strengthens the deterministic counter machines. Non-deterministic counter machines with a pushdown stack are then compared with multihead finite automata. The proof of their incomparability involves an interesting technique: an assumption that a language be accepted by a non-deterministic counter machine would bring a contradictory algorithm to decide an undecidable language. Furthermore, we will show that over bounded languages, these two kinds of machines have the same power, and neither non-determinism nor a pushdown stack makes them stronger. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
