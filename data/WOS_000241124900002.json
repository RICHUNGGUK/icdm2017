The collected data, such as body temperature, blood pressure, and heart rate, can then be stored in the computer of a network management center to facilitate the medical staff in a nursing center to monitor in real time or analyze in batch mode the physiological changes of the patients under observation. Our proposed system is bidirectional, has low power consumption, is cost effective, is modular designed, has the capability of operating independently, and can be used to improve the service quality and reduce the workload of the staff in a nursing center.", "paper_title": "RTWPMS: A real-time wireless physiological monitoring system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241124900002"}
