In particular, we consider the task scheduling problem when the system configuration changes. With mutual-exclusive resource accessing, we show that new violations of the timing constraints of tasks might occur even when a more powerful processor or device is adopted. The concept of scheduler stability and rules are then proposed to prevent scheduling anomaly from occurring in task executions that might be involved with task synchronization or I/O access. Finally, we explore policies for bounding the duration of scheduling anomalies. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
