Using transformation-based learning, we have developed a tool which outperforms the combination of existing tools for pre-annotation of the tectogrammatical structure by 29% (measured as a relative error reduction) and for the deep functor (i.e., the semantic function) by 47%. Moreover, using machine-learning technique makes our tool almost independent of the language being processed. This paper gives details of the algorithm and the tool.", "paper_title": "Transformation-based tectogrammatical analysis of Czech", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500017"}
