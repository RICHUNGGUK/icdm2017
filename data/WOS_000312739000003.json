It is assumed that the signal model p(x) is known and that w similar to CN(w; 0, Sigma(w)) for known Sigma(w). The objective is to design a projection matrix M is an element of C-lxm to maximize key information-theoretic quantities with operational significance, including the mutual information between the signal and the projections I(x; y) or the Renyi entropy of the projections h(alpha) (y) (Shannon entropy is a special case). By capitalizing on explicit characterizations of the gradients of the information measures with respect to the projection matrix, where we also partially extend the well-known results of Palomar and Verdu from the mutual information to the Renyi entropy domain, we reveal the key operations carried out by the optimal projection designs: mode exposure and mode alignment. Experiments are considered for the case of compressive sensing (CS) applied to imagery. In this context, we provide a demonstration of the performance improvement possible through the application of the novel projection designs in relation to conventional ones, as well as justification for a fast online projection design method with which state-of-the-art adaptive CS signal recovery is achieved.", "paper_title": "Communications-Inspired Projection Design with Application to Compressive Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000312739000003"}
