Therefore, how to accomplish tasks with the lowest cost has become an important issue, especially considering the rate at which the resources on the Earth are being used. The goal of this research is to design a sub-optimal resource allocation system in a cloud computing environment. A prediction mechanism is realized by using support vector regressions (SVRs) to estimate the number of resource utilization according to the SLA of each process, and the resources are redistributed based on the current status of all virtual machines installed in physical machines. Notably, a resource dispatch mechanism using genetic algorithms (GAs) is proposed in this study to determine the reallocation of resources. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme achieves an effective configuration via reaching an agreement between the utilization of resources within physical machines monitored by a physical machine monitor and service level agreements (SLA) between virtual machines operators and a cloud services provider. In addition, our proposed mechanism can fully utilize hardware resources and maintain desirable performance in the cloud environment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
