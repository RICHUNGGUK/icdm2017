The paper starts by proposing a methodology to encode an action language (with conditional effects and static causal laws), a slight variation of 0, using Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains. The approach is then generalized to raise the use of constraints to the level of the action language itself. A prototype implementation has been developed, and the preliminary results are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Multivalued action languages with constraints in CLP(FD)", "paper_id": "WOS:000275990700002"}
