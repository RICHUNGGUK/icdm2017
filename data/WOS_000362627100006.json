First, an Ultra Wide Band (UWB) antenna structure with a rhombic radiating patch and a simple ground plane is proposed. Then, aiming at the filtering of interfering frequency bands from UWB frequency range, two pairs of joint slots are embedded in the antenna body. By the inclusion of these slots, surface current distribution is disturbed at the vicinity of the slots and as a result, 5.15-5.825 GHz Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) band and 8.025-8.4 GHz International Telecommunication Union (ITU) band are rejected. In the next step, with the aim of comparing the presented antenna with the previously designed structures regarding different features such as size, bandwidth, gain variations and number of the filtered frequency bands simultaneously, an efficient framework is established. The proposed method is based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) that is one of the Multi Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques. The design process, simulation and measured results, and the AHP based method will be discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "Novel CPW-fed antenna for dual frequency band notch applications evaluated in AHP framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100006"}
