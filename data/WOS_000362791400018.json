Motivated by new requirements in virtualized environments, this architecture ensures that all resource consumption is measured, that resource consumption resulting from a scheduling decision is attributable to an activity, and that scheduling decisions are fine-grained. Vortex, implemented for multi-core x86-64 platforms, instantiates the omni-kernel architecture, providing a wide range of operating system functionality and abstractions. With Vortex, we experimentally demonstrated the efficacy of the omni-kernel architecture to provide accurate scheduler control over resource allocation despite competing workloads. Experiments involving Apache, MySQL, and Hadoop quantify the cost of pervasive monitoring and scheduling in Vortex to be below 6 percent of CPU consumption.", "paper_title": "Omni-Kernel: An Operating System Architecture for Pervasive Monitoring and Scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791400018"}
