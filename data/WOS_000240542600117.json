The new version of SCORM 1.3 attempts to add the sequence concept into this course standard. The sequencing describes how the sequencing process is invoked, what occurs during the sequencing process and the potential outputs of the sequencing process. However, the related research of sequence trap is lack. Sequence trap results from improper sequence composing. The more complex course is the higher trap-probability arises. When the sequence trap occurs, it will block any learning activities and cannot go on any course object. As a result, we apply the valuable features of Petri net to decrease the complexity of the sequencing definition model in the SCORM 1.3 specification and process the input sequencing information to detect the sequencing trap in advance.", "paper_title": "Automatic trap detection of ubiquitous learning on SCORM sequencing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600117"}
