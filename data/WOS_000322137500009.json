Our work is in line with what was suggested by Glover et al. (in Eur. J. Oper. Res. 137, 272-287, 2002) who proposed one pass heuristics as alternatives to the well-known Devour Digest Tidy-up procedure (DDT) of Boros et al. (in RRR 39-89, 1989). The \"devour\" step sets a term of the current representation to 0 or 1, and the \"tidy-up\" step substitutes the logical consequences derived from the \"digest\" step into the current quadratic function. We propose several versions of the DDT constructive heuristic based on the alternative representation of the quadratic function. We also present an efficient implementation of local search using one-flip and two-flip moves that simultaneously change the values of one or two binary variables. Computational experiments performed on instances up to 7000 variables show the efficiency of our implementation in terms of quality improvement and CPU use enhancement.", "paper_title": "Several versions of the devour digest tidy-up heuristic for unconstrained binary quadratic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000322137500009"}
