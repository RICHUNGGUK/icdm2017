To address these issues, we develop a multiview clustering method through which users are iteratively clustered from the views of both rating patterns and social trust relationships. To accommodate users who appear in two different clusters simultaneously, we employ a support vector regression model to determine a prediction for a given item, based on user-, item- and prediction-related features. To accommodate (cold) users who cannot be clustered due to insufficient data, we propose a probabilistic method to derive a prediction from the views of both ratings and trust relationships. Experimental results on three real-world data sets demonstrate that our approach can effectively improve both the accuracy and coverage of recommendations as well as in the cold start situation, moving clustering-based recommender systems closer towards practical use.
