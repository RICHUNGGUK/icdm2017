The Interpolative Boolean algebra (IBA) is real-valued realization of Boolean algebra, mostly used in performance measuring and uncertainty modeling. IBA is based on the principle of structural functionality. This principle focuses on the structure instead of the values, so the existing software solutions based on the conventional fuzzy logic are inappropriate. The proposed software, jFuzzyIBATranslator, can process any expression and transform it to an analog Generalized Boolean Polynomial (GBP). All transformation steps are shown and explained. In this way the program transparency is achieved. The software also provides support for the IBA value level, entering the values and performing the necessary calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
