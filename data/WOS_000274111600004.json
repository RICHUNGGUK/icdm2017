Secondly, we compare the transfer function model of the observed citing process with other classical citation distribution models and find that the model is superior to others. Finally, using the model, we identify parameters of actual referencing and citation processes from data of age distributions of references and citations of 38 journals of neurology and applied mathematics in JCR, respectively; and then compare differences of identified parameters and obtain some interesting conclusions.", "paper_title": "Identification of referencing and citation processes of scientific journals based on the citation distribution model", "paper_id": "WOS:000274111600004"}
