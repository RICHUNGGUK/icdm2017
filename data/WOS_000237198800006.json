By comparing the differences of the temporal profiles for the same topic at the two different periods, we find that the temporal profiles for a topic at the new period may result from three kinds of concepts replacements of the temporal profiles at the old period, namely broad replacement, parallel replacement and narrow replacement. Such findings provide new ways to generate potential relationships from the current biomedical literature.", "paper_title": "Investigation of the changes of temporal topic profiles in biomedical literature", "paper_id": "WOS:000237198800006"}
