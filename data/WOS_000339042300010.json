It is thus important that such information be provided uniformly along the airway tree, not on a sparse (cross-section) sampling basis. The volumetric segmentation of the airway wall from CT data is the issue addressed in this paper by exploiting a patient-specific surface active model. An original aspect taken into account in the proposed deformable model is the management of auto-collisions for this complex morphology. The analysis of several solutions ended up with the design of a motion vector field specific to the patient geometry to guide the deformation. The segmentation result, presented as two embedded inner/outer surfaces of the wall, allows the quantification of the tissue thickness based on a locally-defined measure sensitive to even small surface irregularities. The method is validated with respect to several ground truth simulations of pulmonary CT data with different airway geometries and acquisition protocols showing accuracy within the CT resolution range. Results from an ongoing clinical study on moderate and severe asthma are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Volumetric Quantification of Airway Wall in CT via Collision-Free Active Surface Model: Application to Asthma Assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000339042300010"}
