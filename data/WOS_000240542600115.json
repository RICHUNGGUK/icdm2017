Since prior research has found that lack of information is one of the main barriers for people to travel, provide location-based information to people visiting and staying at a new location should be useful and valuable. This research attempts to find out travelers' attitude toward location-based service (LBS). \"What factors will affect the travelers' willingness to adopt this new service\" is what we tried to find out in this research. Our findings shows that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and security & privacy are associated with travelers' attitude toward using LBS, but location information, context awareness, and device functions are not. Our findings can be referenced by tourism industry for the purpose of the design and development of successful business applications to catch the revolutionary opportunity and benefit of LBS.", "paper_title": "Location-based services for tourism industry: An empirical study", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600115"}
