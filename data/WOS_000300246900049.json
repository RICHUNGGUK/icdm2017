The proposed quantum error correcting codes are based on the binary quasi-cyclic Calderbank, Shor, and Steane (CSS) codes. The resulting quantum codes outperform the best known quantum codes and surpass the performance limit of the bounded distance decoder. By increasing the size of the underlying Galois field, i.e.,, the error floors are considerably improved.", "paper_title": "Quantum Error Correction Beyond the Bounded Distance Decoding Limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900049"}
