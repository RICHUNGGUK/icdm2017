The construction involves enumerating a d-regular tree for a fixed number of layers and employing a connection algorithm based on permutations or mutually orthogonal Latin squares to close the tree. Methods are presented for degrees d = p(s) and d = p(s) + 1, for p a prime. One class corresponds to the well-known finite-geometry and finite generalized quadrangle LDPC codes; the other codes presented are new. We also present some bounds on pseudocodeword weight for p-ary LDPC codes. Treating these codes as p-ary LDPC codes rather than binary LDPC codes improves their rates, minimum distances, and pseudocodeword weights, thereby giving a new importance to the finite-geometry LDPC codes where p > 2.", "paper_title": "Tree-based construction of LDPC codes having. good pseudocodeword weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000014"}
