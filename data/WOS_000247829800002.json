This is useful in studying Boolean functions and in engineering. For example, we classify all 8-variable homogeneous bent functions of degree 3 into two classes; 2) Reed-Muller codes R(4,6)/R(1,6), R(3,7)/R(1,7) are classified efficiently.", "paper_title": "Analysis of affinely equivalent Boolean functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000247829800002"}
