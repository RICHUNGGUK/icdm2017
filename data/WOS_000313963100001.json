Inspired by their work, we present a more general framework for multivariate public key cryptosystems, which combines ideas from both triangular and oil-vinegar schemes. Within this framework, we propose a new public key cryptosystem based on a solution of a Diophantine equation over polynomial rings.", "paper_title": "Multivariate public key cryptosystems from diophantine equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000313963100001"}
