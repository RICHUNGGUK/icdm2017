By analyzing the dimension increase process in ELM, this paper gives an approximate relation between the uniformities before and after the linear transformation. Furthermore, by restricting ELM with a two-dimensional space, it gives an upper bound of ELM approximate error which is dependent on the distributive uniformity of training samples. The analytic results provide some useful guidelines to make clear the impact of random weights on ELM approximate ability and improve ELM prediction accuracy.", "paper_title": "AN ANALYSIS OF ELM APPROXIMATE ERROR BASED ON RANDOM WEIGHT MATRIX", "paper_id": "WOS:000326630600002"}
