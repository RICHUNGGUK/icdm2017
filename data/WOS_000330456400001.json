In this paper we focus on the localization of mobile users in sparse mobile networks which exist in many practical scenarios where users are distributed over a vast area. The unique characteristics of sparse mobile networks present several challenges for accurate localization, such as constant movement and little information from anchors. By analyzing five large datasets of real users traces with entropy analysis from five sites, we make an important observation that there are strong patterns with user mobility. Motivated by this observation, we propose a localization approach called EMP by exploiting mobility patterns of users for localization in sparse mobile networks. EMP implements a range-free distributed algorithm, with which each user collaboratively estimates its current location by fusing two localization sources, that is, network connectivity with other nodes and mobility patterns. With trace driven simulations, we demonstrate that EMP significantly improves the localization accuracy, comparing with other existing localization approaches.", "paper_title": "EMP: Exploiting Mobility Patterns for Collaborative Localization in Sparse Mobile Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330456400001"}
