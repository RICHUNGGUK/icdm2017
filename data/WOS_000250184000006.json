In our proposed algorithm, an image is first decomposed into a base layer and a detailed layer, which represent its smoothed and fine details, respectively. The problem of overall impression preservation is regarded as a global issue in our algorithm. Statistical-based histogram adjustment is employed to deal with the base layer. The reproduction of visual details is regarded as a local issue. The detailed layer obtained using a spatial filter is adaptively enhanced according to the mapping function used for the base layer. The main contributions of our algorithm are that: (1) an adaptive detail-enhancement method is proposed and (2) a gain map is defined to combine the local and global issues. Experimental results show the superior performance of our approach in terms of visual quality.
