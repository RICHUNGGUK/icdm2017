Design/methodology/approach - The proposed methodology provides all levels of employees with the ability to formulate nearly optimal sets of fuzzy rules to identify possible solutions for eliminating the number of defect items. Findings - The application of the proposed methodology in the slider manufacturer has been studied. After performing the spatial analysis, the results obtained indicate that it is capable of ensuring the finished products with promising quality. Research limitations/implications - In order to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, only some processes within the supply chain are chosen. Future studies can advance this research by applying the proposed approach in different industries and processes. Originality/value - Because of the complexity of the logistics operations along the supply chain, the traditional quality improvement approaches cannot address all the quality problems automatically and effectively. This newly developed GA-based approach can help to optimize the process parameters along the supply chain network.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy rule sets for enhancing performance in a supply chain network", "paper_id": "WOS:000260522200006"}
