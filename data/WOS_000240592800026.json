The scheme embeds ownership information by modifying a set of selected cell values. The embedded message will not affect the usefulness of data cubes in the sense that the sum queries at any aggregation level are not affected. At the same time, the errors introduced to individual cell values are under control. The embedded message can be detected with a high probability even in the presence of typical data cube attacks. The proposed scheme can thus be used for protecting data cubes from piracy in an open, distributed environment.", "paper_title": "Rights protection for data cubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800026"}
