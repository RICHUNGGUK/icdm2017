The six continuity conditions are continuity from above, order continuity, strong order continuity, exhaustivity, continuity from below, and null-continuity, and the two null-additivity conditions are null-additivity and weak null-additivity. The implication relationship is summarized in a diagram. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
