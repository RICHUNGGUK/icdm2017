RVC-CAL is a dynamic dataflow language that enables describing complex data-dependent programs such as video decoders. To this date, design automation toolchains for RVC-CAL have enabled creating workstation software, dedicated hardware and embedded application specific multiprocessor implementations out of RVC-CAL programs. However, no solution has been presented for executing RVC-CAL applications on generic embedded multiprocessing platforms. This paper presents a dataflow-based multiprocessor communication model, an architecture prototype that uses it and an automated toolchain for instantiating such a platform and the software for it. The complexity of the platform increases linearly as the number of processors is increased. The experiments in this paper use several instances of the proposed platform, with different numbers of processors. An MPEG-4 video decoder is mapped to the platform and executed on it. Benchmarks are performed on an FPGA board.", "paper_title": "Towards Generic Embedded Multiprocessing for RVC-CAL Dataflow Programs", "paper_id": "WOS:000322738600003"}
