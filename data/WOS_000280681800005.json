The proposed algorithm selects the most efficient PHY (physical) mode and retransmission limit of WLAN (wireless local area network) multi-rate service at each node in a distributed way. The control parameters of the proposed algorithm (i.e. PHY mode and retransmission limit) are determined based on the available information at application, MAC, and physical layers in order to satisfy the end-to-end delay constraint and maintain packet loss rate in the tolerable range at the receiver. Finally, experimental results are provided to show the performance of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Cross Layer Optimized Video Streaming based on IEEE 802.11 Multi-rate over Multi-hop Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280681800005"}
