It includes two aspects: maximum links scheduling (MLS) and maximum weighted links scheduling (MWLS). In this paper we propose two heuristic algorithms for the two NP-hard problems with obvious power assignments under the SINR (signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio) model. For MLS, we propose an algorithm MTMA (maximum tolerance and minimum affectance), which improves the currently best approximation algorithm by 28%-62% on average. For MWLS, we give an effective heuristic algorithm MWMA (maximum weighted and minimum affectance), which performs better on improving the throughput and reducing the running time. The correctness and performance of our algorithms are confirmed through theoretical analysis and comprehensive simulations.", "paper_title": "Heuristic Algorithms for One-Slot Link Scheduling in Wireless Sensor Networks under SINR", "paper_id": "WOS:000354296000001"}
