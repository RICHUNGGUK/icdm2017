Most intrusions to a computer system may result from illegitimate or irregular calls to the operating system, so analyzing the system-call sequences becomes an important and fundamental technique to detect potential intrusions. This paper proposes two models based on data mining technology, respectively called frequency patterns (FP) and tree patterns (TP) for intrusion detection. FP employs a typical method of sequential mining based on frequency analysis, and uses a short sequence model to find out quickly frequent sequential patterns in the training system-call sequences. TP makes use of the technique of tree pattern mining, and can get a quality profile from the training system-call sequences of a given system. Experimental results show that FP has good performances in training and detecting intrusions from short system-call sequences, and TP can achieve a high detection precision in handling long sequences.", "paper_title": "Intrusion Detection Models Based on Data Mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572700003"}
