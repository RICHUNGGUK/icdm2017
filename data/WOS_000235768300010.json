A face verification system is vulnerable not only to variations in ambient lighting, facial expression and facial pose, but also to the effect of small sample size during the training phase. In this paper, we propose an approach to face verification based on Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks and bagging. The technique seeks to offset the effect of using a small sample size during the training phase. The RBF networks are trained using all available positive samples of a subject and a few randomly selected negative samples. Bagging is then applied to the outputs of these RBF-based classifiers. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show the validity of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Face verification based on bagging RBF networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300010"}
