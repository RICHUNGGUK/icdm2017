In this paper, we analyze the information capacity of visual attention. Our hypothesis is that the limit of perceptible spatial frequency is related to observing time. Given more time, one can obtain higher resolution - that is, higher spatial frequency information, of the presented visual stimuli. We designed an experiment to simulate natural viewing conditions, in which time dependent characteristics of the attention can be evoked; and we recorded the temporal responses of 6 subjects. Based on the experiment results, we propose a person-independent model that characterizes the behavior of eyes, relating visual spatial resolution with the duration of attentional concentration time. This model suggests that the information capacity of visual attention is time-dependent.", "paper_title": "A time-dependent model of information capacity of visual attention", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100015"}
