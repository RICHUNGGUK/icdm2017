The algorithm is based on a repetitive preamble that allows the use of a short cross correlator with an exponential average filter for postprocessing before a threshold detection. The signals in the correlation have been quantized with 1 bit, and the correlations have been implemented as a hard-wired tree adder to reduce the hardware cost. This solution has been verified in a passive optical network (PON) system using a directly modulated distributed feedback (DFB) laser achieving excellent performance with low computing processing complexity even in low signal-to-noise ratio scenarios. Finally, a parallel hardware architecture has been proposed for this time synchronization algorithm, and it has been implemented in a field programmable gate array device reaching a sample rate throughput up to 7.4 Gs/s.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Time Synchronization Algorithm for Optical OFDM PON System Using a Directly Modulated DFB Laser", "paper_id": "WOS:000365405100015"}
