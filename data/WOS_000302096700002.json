In this paper, we propose an actively self-training clustering method, in which the samples are actively selected as training set to minimize an estimated Bayes error, and then explore semisupervised learning to perform clustering. Traditional graph-based semisupervised learning methods are not convenient to estimate the Bayes error; we develop a specific regularization framework on graph to perform semisupervised learning, in which the Bayes error can be effectively estimated. In addition, the proposed clustering algorithm can be readily applied in a semisupervised setting with partial class labels. Experimental results on toy data and real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed clustering method on the unsupervised and the semisupervised setting. It is worthy noting that the proposed clustering method is free of initialization, while traditional clustering methods are usually dependent on initialization.", "paper_title": "Initialization Independent Clustering With Actively Self-Training Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000302096700002"}
