However, much of the literature on such MDPs takes a monolithic approach, by modelling a system as a particular MDP; properties of the system are then inferred by analysis of that particular MDP. In contrast in this paper we develop compositional methods for reasoning about weighted MDPs, as a possible basis for compositional reasoning about their quantitative behaviour. In particular we approach these systems from a process algebraic point of view. For these we define a coinductive simulation-based behavioural preorder which is compositional in the sense that it is preserved by structural operators for constructing weighted MDPs from components. For finitary convergent processes, which are finite-state and finitely branching systems without divergence, we provide two characterisations of the behavioural preorder. The first uses a novel quantitative probabilistic logic, while the second is in terms of a novel form of testing, in which benefits are accrued during the execution of tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
