This equality has consequences for both problems. On one hand, it allows us to prove the A(P-completeness of the CLEANING problem, which was conjectured by Messinger et al. [M.-E. Messinger, R.J. Nowakowski, P. Pralat, Cleaning a network with brushes, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 399 (2008) 191-205]. On the other hand, it also enables us to design a faster algorithm for the BALANCED VERTEX-ORDERING problem [J. Kara, K. Kratochvil, D.
