The indicator, called x-index, compares a researcher's output to a reference set of research output from top researchers, identified in the journals where the researcher has published. It reflects publication quantity and quality, uses a moderately sized data set, and works with a more refined definition of scientific fields. x-index was developed to rank researchers in a scientific excellence award in the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto. The data set collected for the 2009 edition of the award is used to study the indicator's features and design choices, and provides the basis for a discussion of its advantages and limitations.", "paper_title": "A made-to-measure indicator for cross-disciplinary bibliometric ranking of researchers performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000284888600009"}
