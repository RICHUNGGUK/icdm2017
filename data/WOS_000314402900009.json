The presented system includes two main phases called: training and verification phases. At first, the system is trained using some genuine signatures provided by each customer in training phase. Then verifying the signatures on incoming checks is carried out in the verification phase. Feature extraction step is conducted based on a new approach that uses Multitresolution box-counting (MRBC) method for estimating the fractal dimension of signatures. Here, signature verification is modeled as testing hypothesis, and decision about acceptance or rejection of signatures on incoming checks is carried out using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The presented system has been tested on two databases: our new created database and NISDCC database which was used for ICDAR 2009 signature verification competition. Our database has 1000 genuine signatures provided by 100 participants and 200 skilled forgeries copied from genuine samples by five forgers. In total our database includes 1200 Persian signatures. Obtained results show promising performance of the presented system for its application on Persian banks.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL AND PRACTICAL SYSTEM FOR VERIFYING SIGNATURES ON PERSIAN HANDWRITTEN BANK CHECKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000314402900009"}
