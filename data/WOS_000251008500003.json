The LEADSTO language is a declarative order-sorted temporal language, extended with quantitative notions like integer and real. Dynamic processes can be modelled in LEADSTO by specified the direct temporal dependencies between state properties in successive states. Based on the LEADSTO language, a software environment was developed that performs simulations of LEADSTO specifications, generates data-files containing traces of simulations for further analysis, and constructs visual representations of traces. The approach proved its worth in a number of research projects in different domains.", "paper_title": "A language and environment for analysis of dynamics by simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000251008500003"}
