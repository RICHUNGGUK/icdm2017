All existing data discovery and dissemination protocols suffer from two drawbacks. First, they are based on the centralized approach; only the base station can distribute data items. Such an approach is not suitable for emergent multi-owner-multi-user WSNs. Second, those protocols were not designed with security in mind and hence adversaries can easily launch attacks to harm the network. This paper proposes the first secure and distributed data discovery and dissemination protocol named DiDrip. It allows the network owners to authorize multiple network users with different privileges to simultaneously and directly disseminate data items to the sensor nodes. Moreover, as demonstrated by our theoretical analysis, it addresses a number of possible security vulnerabilities that we have identified. Extensive security analysis show DiDrip is provably secure. We also implement DiDrip in an experimental network of resource-limited sensor nodes to show its high efficiency in practice.", "paper_title": "Secure and Distributed Data Discovery and Dissemination in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351453000019"}
