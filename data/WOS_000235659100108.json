Netbutterfly Grid Computing System (NGCS) is designed, Some of key issues, such as the architecture of NGCS job distributing, system communications, fault tolerance and security problem are analyzed and discussed. And a new science computing method is advanced. Finally, an example on Grid computing environments is presented. The experiment shows that it's the results are satisfying.", "paper_title": "The research of scientific computing environment on scilab", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100108"}
