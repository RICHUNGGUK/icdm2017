This family contains also all CA with memory m <= 0 (one-sided CA) which can act both on A(Z) and on A(N). We study several set theoretical and topological properties for these classes. In particular, we investigate whether the properties of a given CA are preserved when considering the CA obtained by changing the memory of the original one (shifting operation). Furthermore. we focus our attention on the one-sided CA acting on A(Z), starting from the one-sided CA acting on A(N) and having the same local rule (lifting operation). As a particular consequence of these investigations, we prove that the long-standing conjecture [Surjectivity double right arrow Dense Periodic Orbits (DPO)] can be restated in several different (but equivalent) ways. Furthermore, we give some results on properties conserved under the iteration of the CA global map. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
