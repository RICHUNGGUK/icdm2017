Specifically, a new architecture of switching elements is used for the construction of MINs. This switch element uses two parallel queues in order to serve dual priority traffic. Besides this, uniform traffic conditions are presupposed and the bulk of packet arrivals in each cycle to the network inputs follow a Bernoulli distribution. A new analytical model for evaluating single buffered MIN's with 2 x 2 special switching elements supporting internally two classes' priority traffic is presented. Equations for the steady state are derived. These equations are then used in finding the most important multistage network performance metrics, such as throughput, and packet latency. The results are also validated using simulation and compared with previous related work in marginal cases. This proposed analytical model is accurate for various network sizes and various values of offered traffic to the multistage network inputs. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
