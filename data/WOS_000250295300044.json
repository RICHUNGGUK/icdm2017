In this paper we propose a location-aware recommender system that accommodates a customer's shopping needs with location-dependent vendor offers and promotions. Specifically, we propose a recommender system for recommending vendors' webpages - include offers and promotions - to interested customers. We present the developed system and the constructed approaches in this paper. The results of experiments using both synthetic and empirical data are also reported and discussed.
