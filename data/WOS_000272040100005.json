We consider what portions of the policy state must be monitored to detect violations of integrity constraints. Then, we address the fact that not all participants in a trust-management system can be trusted to assist in such monitoring, and show how many integrity constraints can be monitored in a conservative manner so that trusted participants detect and report if the system enters a policy state from which evolution in unmonitored portions of the policy could lead to a constraint violation.", "paper_title": "Maintaining Control While Delegating Trust: Integrity Constraints in Trust Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000272040100005"}
