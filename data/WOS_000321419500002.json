The mathematical tool for this proof is the so-called consistently linearized eigenproblem in the frame of the Finite Element Method. The physical meaning of the mentioned maximum is the one of,a minimum of the percentage bending energy of the total strain energy. The paper provides mathematical and physical background knowledge on numerical results that were obtained 35 years ago. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
