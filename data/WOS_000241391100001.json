We derive the statistics of the received signal, as well as a theoretical bound on the packet drop rate at the receiver. Based on these results, a bandwidth allocation algorithm is proposed at the packet level, which incorporates the effects of both the changing channel conditions and the dynamics of the source content. Detailed simulations are done to evaluate the performance of the system, and the sensitivity of the system to estimation error is presented.", "paper_title": "Error-resilient video communications over CDMA networks with a bandwidth constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000241391100001"}
