A functional relation has been developed using GEP with non-dimensional variables. The development of a GEP non-dimensional model is described. This paper compares current prediction equation with the existing GEP model for the same rivers (Zakaria et al. in Sci Total Environ 408:5078-5085, (2010). The presented model in this study is a less input GEP model and that predicts good performance. The proposed GEP approach gives satisfactory results compared to existing predictors.", "paper_title": "Development of GEP-based functional relationship for sediment transport in tropical rivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000330318500003"}
