In turn, this allows pinpointing of those areas where the actual supply chain can be improved and hence manage the chain's performance. This paper shows how the constituents, key parameters and performance indicators are modelled into the environment and through a case study illustrates how the decision support environment may be used to improve the performance of a collaborative supply chain by pinpointing areas for improvement.
