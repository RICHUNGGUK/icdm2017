In the main control room of the nuclear power generations, about 4000 numbers of alarms and monitoring devices are equipped to handle the signals corresponding to operating equipments. Thus, operators have to deal with massive information and to analyze the situation immediately. In this paper, the fault diagnosis system is designed using 2-steps neural networks. This diagnosis method is based on the pattern of the principal variables which could represent the type and severity of faults.", "paper_title": "Predictive fault detection and diagnosis of nuclear power plant using the two-step neural network models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300062"}
