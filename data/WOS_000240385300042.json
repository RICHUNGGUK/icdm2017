The new approach firstly introduces polarimetric Whitening Filter for improving the ability to detect targets in clutter by reducing the effect of speckle without affecting the resolution. Then point-like targets are detected based on multi-resolution statistic energy level method which adapt to different clutter backgrounds and detect targets efficiently. Finally, a generic algorithm based searching approach is applied to extracting series of power transmission towers from all the remaining potential point-like targets. Good experimental results are obtained when our method is applied to single-look, high resolution, X-band full polarimetric SAR images.", "paper_title": "Power transmission towers extraction in polarimetric SAR imagery based on genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300042"}
