Numerical properties of this family for linear elastic systems are exactly the same as those of the Newmark family method since they have the same characteristic equation. A subfamily of this family possesses unconditional stability for linear elastic systems. However, the most important aspects of this subfamily are the possibility of unconditional stability for nonlinear systems and second-order accuracy. The possibility of unconditional stability and second-order accuracy allows using a large time step; and the explicitness of each time step involves no iterative procedure. Hence, many computational efforts can be saved. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
