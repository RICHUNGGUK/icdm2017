First the subject receives a stimulus, then holds it in the working memory, and finally makes a decision by comparing it with another stimulus. A neurocomputational model using generic neural microcircuits with feedback is presented here that integrates the three computational stages into a single unified framework. The architecture is tested using the two-interval discrimination and delayed-match-to-sample experimental paradigms as benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Modeling working memory and decision making using generic neural microcircuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100054"}
