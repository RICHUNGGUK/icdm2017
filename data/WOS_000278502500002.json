We develop our aerial image simulation engine by enhancing the traditional sum of coherence system method. Subject to the shape changes, a strong correlation between the aerial image intensity difference maps of pre-optical proximity correction (OPC) and post-OPC schemes is found. We collect near a litho hotspot in a pre-OPC layout some fix actions that are local shape changes to optimize the optical intensity. Then, fix guidances will be selected from the collected fix actions by a heuristic algorithm and input to a router for fixing the hotspot. We integrate the fix guidance generation method with a commercial lithography hotspot detection tool to create an automatic post-route optical-simulation-embedded local fix (OSELF) flow and test with industry 65 nm designs. Compared with the commercial flow that uses only local fix, our method has a 1.4x-1.9x fix rate, similar run time, no new design rule check violation, and negligible circuit timing impacts. We also combine our OSELF algorithm with a rip-up and reroute engine, and test on the same designs. Compared to the commercial tool that uses a hybrid (local fix plus reroute) fix flow, our combined flow runs 1.7x-2.9x faster with 45-55% circuit timing impact. Both flows achieve a 100% hotspot fix rate.", "paper_title": "An Automatic Optical Simulation-Based Lithography Hotspot Fix Flow for Post-Route Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000278502500002"}
