When the codewords employed by them form a Go lay complementary sequence (CS) mate, this system enjoys the upper bound of peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) as low as 4. This letter presents a construction method for producing S16-QAM and A16-QAM Go lay CS mates, which arrives at the upper bound 4 of PMEPR. And when used as a Go lay CS pair, they have an upper bound 2 of PMEPR, which is the same ones in both [18] and [17]. However, both cannot produce such mates.", "paper_title": "Asterisk and Star 16-QAM Go lay Complementary Sequence Mates", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400034"}
