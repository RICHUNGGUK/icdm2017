An efficient method for generating 3D curvilinear wire-frames from three orthographic views is presented, which is the pivotal stage of solid reconstruction by wire-frame-oriented approaches. By unifying the recovery of spatial conics without restrictions on their positions, our method can improve the efficiency and reliability Of Curvilinear wire-frame reconstruction. A projection matching algorithrn is proposed to efficiently reveal all match projections according to the projective properties of spatial edges. Furthermore, a four-point method, which is based on the rational Bezier form of conics, is proposed to uniformly generate various types of conics in arbitrary positions. Several examples are provided. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
