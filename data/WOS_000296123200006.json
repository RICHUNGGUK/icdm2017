We provide theoretical interpretation of the new approaches, based on mixtures of Laplace distributions. The two extensions preserve the methodological simplicity and computational efficiency of their original methods, and in general can achieve more robust performance when the data for either class is skew and heavy-tailed. We also discuss some limitations of the new approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Median-based image thresholding", "paper_id": "WOS:000296123200006"}
