In this paper, we propose Distributed Court System (DCS), a complete Intrusion Detection System that intends to solve these challenges in a low-cost and robust way. We do not deploy any centralized entity, but rely on the collaboration among the nodes neighbouring the suspected node, to integrate information, improve the detection accuracy, and reject dissemination of malicious accusation. Through mathematical analysis and simulation, the proposed DCS is proved to be effective in a highly mobile and hostile network environment. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
