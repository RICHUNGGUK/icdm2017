In this paper, we verify that the current state-of-the-art retrieval algorithms for CBVR can be improved with active learning. Active learning algorithms query a user for relevance feedback on specific items within the search database, using the additional labeled datapoints to improve the accuracy of the user's original query. We propose a simple CBVR system with SVM relevance feedback, and integrate it with active learning using a simple query pool selection algorithm, based on two co-testing learners. Our experiments demonstrate that such a system performs significantly better with active learning than without, surpassing the state-of-the-art. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
