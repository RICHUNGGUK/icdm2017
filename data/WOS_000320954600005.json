For the early transition metal derivatives (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = V, Cr) there are two types of such structures. In one structural type the metals are sandwiched between two heptahapto heptalene rings with metal-metal distances (3.5-3.8 ) too long for direct metal-metal bonding. The other type of (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = V, Cr, Mn) structure has a pair of bonded metal atoms sandwiched between a fully bonded heptalene ligand and a heptalene ligand bonded to the metals only through an eight-carbon heptafulvene subunit, leaving an uncomplexed cis-1,3-diene unit. The formal metal-metal bond orders in these latter structures are 3, 2, and 1 for M = V, Cr, and Mn with predicted bond lengths of 2.5, 2.7, and 2.8 , respectively. For (C12H10)(2)Fe-2 a singlet structure with each iron atom sandwiched between a hexahapto and a tetrahapto heptalene ring is energetically preferred over an alternate structure with ferrocene-like iron atoms sandwiched between two pentahapto heptalene rings. Partial bonding of each heptalene ring to the metal atoms occurs in the late transition metal derivatives (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = Co, Ni). This leads to an unsymmetrical structure for the cobalt derivative and a structure for the nickel derivative with each nickel atom sandwiched between a trihapto ligand and a tetrahapto ligand.", "paper_title": "Bis(heptalene) \"submarine\" metal dimer sandwich compounds (C12H10)(2)M-2 (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)", "paper_id": "WOS:000320954600005"}
