Such data require a huge amount of memory space and computation time for processing. One of the approaches to cope with these problems is using prototypes. We propose volume prototypes as an extension of traditional point prototypes. A volume prototype is defined as a geometric configuration that represents some data points inside. A volume prototype is akin to a data point in the usage rather than a component of a mixture model. We show a one-pass algorithm to have such prototypes for data stream, along with an application for classification. An oblivion mechanism is also incorporated to adapt concept drift.
