The core-based fault tolerance scheme provides a flexibleway to control a number of core nodes with less control overheads for searching the routing path, wavelength assignment (RWA), and restoration paths when fault occurs in the one-to-many multicast domain. Compared with the source-based scheme, core-based schemes are easier to maintain, and specifically scalable in large-scale topologies. In the core-based fault tolerance scheme, k-tuple domination nodes are selected to form a minimum sized vertex subset such that each vertex in the graph is dominated by at least k vertices, where the k is defined as two in this paper. The proposed DCS algorithm is defined as each node in multicast tree session must be directly connected to at least one core node in multicast tree session and also has to be directly connected to at least one core node out of multicast tree session. The primary aim of this work is to provide the scalable and fast local survivability based on the information from core nodes. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the Dual Tree and MRLR algorithms in terms of total hop counts needed for all recovery paths and blocking probability for different network topologies.", "paper_title": "One-to-many multicast restoration based on dynamic core-based selection algorithm in WDM mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270743400002"}
