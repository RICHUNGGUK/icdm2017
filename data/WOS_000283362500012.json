To this end, an inviscid compressible flow solver is adopted with an axi-symmetric patched grid system. To improve the shape of the train nose, multi-step design optimization is performed using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm with a response surface model. The optimization reveals that the optimal nose shapes differ for different nose lengths. For a short nose, the shape has an extremely blunt front end, and the cross-sectional area decreases in the middle section. As the nose length increases, the nose shape flattens around the middle section. These optimal shapes divide one large compression wave into two small waves by causing a strong expansion effect between the front and rear ends. As a result, through the nose shape optimization, the intensity of the micro-pressure wave is reduced by 18-27% compared to a parabolic nose, which has a minimum variation of the cross-sectional area change. The optimized distribution of the cross-sectional area can be used as a guideline for the design of three-dimensional nose shapes of high-speed trains, further improving their aerodynamic performance.", "paper_title": "Optimal cross-sectional area distribution of a high-speed train nose to minimize the tunnel micro-pressure wave", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362500012"}
