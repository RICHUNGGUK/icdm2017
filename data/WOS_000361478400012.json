In order to obtain the comprehensive attribute values of alternatives, the induced generalized Shapley interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic hybrid Choquet averaging (IGS-IVIULHCA) operator is defined, which globally considers not only the importance of elements and the ordered positions but also their correlations. Based on gray relational analysis (GRA) method, models for the optimal fuzzy measures are constructed. Then, a new decision approach is developed, which considers the interactive characteristics between elements in a set. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach and demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.", "paper_title": "An approach to interval-valued intuitionistic uncertain linguistic multi-attribute group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000361478400012"}
