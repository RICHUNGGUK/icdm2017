The results obtained show that there are factors which have a positive influence on these indicators, such as having a third-cycle programme, with public financing obtained in competitive selection procedures, having a large number of full-time researchers or involvement in collaborations with international institutions. However, other factors which appear to have the opposite effect were also noted. These include a higher number of students per lecturer or a lower proportion of lecturers with recognised six-year periods.", "paper_title": "An analysis of the determinants in Economics and Business publications by Spanish universities between 1994 and 2004", "paper_id": "WOS:000244692200006"}
