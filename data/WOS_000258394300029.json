The proposed architecture fully exploits full-page burst accesses of DRAM and minimizes the number of DRAM activate and precharge operations. Simulation results revealed that the architecture reduces the number of clock cycles for DRAM memory accesses as well as the DRAM power consumption with moderate cost of internal memory. Evaluation of the VLSI implementation of the architecture showed that the throughput of wavelet filtering was increased by parallelizing row filtering with a minimum area cost, thereby enabling DRAM full-page burst accesses to be exploited.", "paper_title": "Parallel architecture for 2-D discrete wavelet transform with low energy consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300029"}
