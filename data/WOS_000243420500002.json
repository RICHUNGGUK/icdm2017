Filtering an image with a sequence of Gray-Code Kernels is highly efficient and requires only two operations per pixel for each filter kernel, independent of the size or dimension of the kernel. We show that the family of kernels is large and includes the Walsh-Hadamard kernels, among others. The GCK can be used to approximate any desired kernel and, as such forms, a complete representation. The efficiency of computation using a sequence of GCK filters can be exploited for various real-time applications, such as, pattern detection, feature extraction, texture analysis, texture synthesis, and more.", "paper_title": "The Gray-Code filter kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000243420500002"}
