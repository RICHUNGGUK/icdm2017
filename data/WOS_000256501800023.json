Though the method is based on the Fourier expansion of order parameter, a priori symmetric information is not required, and more significantly, the period structure can be adjusted automatically during the iteration as well. The method enables us to calculate the phase diagram, discover new meta-stable phases, validate the epitaxial relation in the phase transition process, and find the inefficiency of the Landau-Brazovskii model for some situations.
