Different aspects of self-reference are discussed from the viewpoint of logic, linguistics, and artificial intelligence. Previous work in the area of fuzzy logic is also revisited in this context. It is shown that the reasoning based on the truth qualification principle requires some modifications so that it naturally gives rise to type-2 fuzzy sets, in order to capture the uncertainty about selection of a solution for a set of self-referential statements.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy logic and self-referential reasoning: a comparative study with some new concepts", "paper_id": "WOS:000330956700003"}
