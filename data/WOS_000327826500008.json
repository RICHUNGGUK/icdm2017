The optimum switching thresholds are derived so that the spectrum efficiency (SE) under an average power and a target bit error rate (BER) constraint is maximized. By the switching thresholds, average BER and SE are further derived. As a result, closed-form expressions are obtained. Besides, the exact and approximate BER expressions of VP AM and constant-power (CP) AM systems with delayed feedback are respectively derived. Simulation results show that the theoretical SE and BER can match the corresponding simulation well. The results indicate that VP-AM with STBC provide higher spectrum efficiency than the CP counterparts, and has slighter bite error rate performance degradation when the normalized delay is less than 0.01.", "paper_title": "Performance of orthogonal STBC-MIMO with variable-power adaptive modulation and delayed feedback in Nakagami fading channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000327826500008"}
