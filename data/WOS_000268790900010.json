The method performs efficiently for extended surface models such as Ti36O90H36. Molecular dynamics simulations have revealed that NB is linked to TiO2 surface at the titanium ion via the oxygen atoms of NO2 group. In addition, the computed vibrational density of states for the adsorbed NB molecule is in reasonably good agreement with the available experimental data and theoretical results. In order to identify the primary photochemical and photocatalytic (OH)-O-center dot initiated photooxidation intermediates, we have employed two different theoretical approaches, frontier orbital theory and Wheland localization theory. It has been found that the meta- hydroxynitrocyclohexadienyl radical is energetically more favored than para- and ortho-hydroxynitrocyclohexadienyl radicals for the photochemical photolysis, whereas in the case of photocatalysis, the (OH)-O-center dot radical attack is unselective and all three possible isomers have comparable stabilities.", "paper_title": "Computational modeling of the adsorption and (OH)-O-center dot initiated photochemical and photocatalytic primary oxidation of nitrobenzene", "paper_id": "WOS:000268790900010"}
