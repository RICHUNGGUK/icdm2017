Some crisp equivalent models are presented and a traditional algorithm based on an interactive fuzzy satisfying method is proposed to obtain the decision maker's satisfying solution. In addition, the technique of fuzzy random simulation is adopted to handle general fuzzy random objective functions and fuzzy random constraints which are usually hard to be converted into their crisp equivalents. Furthermore, combined with the techniques of fuzzy random simulation, a genetic algorithm using the compromise approach is designed for solving a fuzzy random multiobjective programming problem. Finally, illustrative examples are given in order to show the application of the proposed models and algorithms. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
