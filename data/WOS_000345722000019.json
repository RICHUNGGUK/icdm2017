Two complementary steps are addressed. In the first step the direct problem is modeled using RLCG circuit parameters. Then the Finite Difference Time Domain method is used to solve the telegrapher's equations. This model provides a simple and accurate method to simulate Time Domain Reflectometry responses. In the second step the optimization methods are combined with the wire propagation model to solve the inverse problem and to deduce physical information's about defects from the reflectometry response. Several configurations are studied in order to demonstrate the applicability of each approach. Further, in order to validate the obtained results for both inversion techniques, they are compared with experimental measurements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
