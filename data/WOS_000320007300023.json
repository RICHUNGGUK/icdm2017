This new computing technology requires that the users ensure that their infrastructure is safety and that their data and applications are protected. In addition, the customer must ensure that the provider has taken the proper security measures to protect their information. In order to achieve fine-grained and flexible access control for cloud computing, a new construction of hierarchical attribute-based encryption(HABE) with Ciphertext-Policy is proposed in this paper. The proposed scheme inherits flexibility and delegation of hierarchical identity-based cryptography, and achieves scalability due to the hierarchical structure. The new scheme has constant size ciphertexts since it consists of two group elements. In addition, the security of the new construction is achieved in the standard model which avoids the potential defects in the existing works. Under the decision bilinear Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption, the proposed scheme is provable security against Chosen-plaintext Attack(CPA). Furthermore, we also show the proposed scheme can be transferred to a CCA(Chosen-ciphertext Attack) secure scheme.", "paper_title": "New Constructions of Hierarchical Attribute-Based Encryption for Fine-Grained Access Control in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000320007300023"}
