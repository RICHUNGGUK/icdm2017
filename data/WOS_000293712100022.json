An advanced field inversion method and the scheduler-controlled datapath are integrated into the processor to provide high-throughput and energy-adaptive security computing with power-performance trade off. Using 130-nm CMOS technology, the fabricated chip measures 4.97 mm(2) with the core area of 1.35 mm(2). A 160-bit point scalar multiplication with coordinate conversion can be done in 385 mu s at 141 MHz with core power of 80.4 mW over GF(p) and in 272 mu s at 158 MHz with 79.6 mW over GF(2(m)). The comparison of throughput, area, power, and energy consumption among different ECC designs justifies that our high-throughput processor chip provides power-and energy-efficient implementation with the flexibility of dual-field ECC.", "paper_title": "Energy-Adaptive Dual-Field Processor for High-Performance Elliptic Curve Cryptographic Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293712100022"}
