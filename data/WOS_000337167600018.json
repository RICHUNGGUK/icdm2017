A thermal model is constructed based on a Green function with discrete cosine transform (DCT) to generate full chip temperature profile. Our thermal model is tightly integrated with an analytical placer implemented based on the SimPL framework. A temperature spreading force based on the Gaussian model is proposed to reduce the maximum on-chip temperature and optimize tradeoff between total half-perimeter wirelength and on-chip maximum temperature. The temperature profile generated using our thermal model is verified by the ANSYS ICEPAK and obtains an average deviation within 3.0% with 240x speedup.", "paper_title": "Fast Thermal Aware Placement With Accurate Thermal Analysis Based on Green Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000337167600018"}
