Our contribution is three folds-First, the proposed component based selective encryption scheme achieves high image Security, while incurring little encryption overhead; furthermore, the proposed adaptive encryption scheme achieve the best security effort Within delay bound finally, the proposed transmission rate optimization improves energy efficiency, and feeds back effective path capacity parameters for adaptive encryption. Simulation results show a significant gain in both energy efficiency and security based oil the proposed approach for image secure transmissions in WSN.
