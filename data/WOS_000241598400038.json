These data are capacitance measurements obtained non-invasively according to the well known ECT technique (Electrical Capacitance Tomography). Every 313 pixels image frame is derived from 66 capacitance measurements sampled from the real time process. The neural nets have been trained using the backpropagation algorithm where training samples have been created synthetically from a computational model of the real ECT sensor. To create the image 313 neuronal nets, each with 66 inputs and one output, are used in parallel. The resulting image is finally filtered and displayed. The different ECT system stages along with the different tests performed with synthetic and real data are reported. We show that the image resulting from our method is a faster and more precise practical alternative to previously reported ones.", "paper_title": "An application of neural networks for image reconstruction in electrical capacitance tomography applied to oil industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400038"}
