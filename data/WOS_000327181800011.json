A clustering process is made on the basis of delta representation of time series, i.e., we are interested in characters of changes between two consecutive data points in time series instead of original data points. Most algorithms use similarity measures to compare time series. In the paper, we propose to use a measure based on temporal rough set flow graphs. This measure has a probabilistic character and it is considered in terms of the Decision Theoretic Rough Set (DTRS) model. To perform ant-based clustering, the algorithm based on the versions proposed by J. Deneubourg, E. Lumer and B. Faieta as well as J. Handl et al. is used.", "paper_title": "Ant-Based Clustering in Delta Episode Information Systems Based on Temporal Rough Set Flow Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000327181800011"}
