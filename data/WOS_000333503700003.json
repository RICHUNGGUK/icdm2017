The widely used cosine similarity, found to possess the null-invariance property and the anti-cross-support-pattern property, is adopted as the interestingness measure in CosMiner(t). CosMiner(t) is generally an FP-growth-like depth-first traversal algorithm that rests on an important property of the cosine similarity: the conditional anti-monotone property (CAMP). The combined use of CAMP and the depth-first support-ascending traversal strategy enables the pre-pruning of uninteresting patterns during the mining process of CosMiner(t). Extensive experiments demonstrate the high efficiency of CosMiner(t) in interesting pattern discovery, in comparison to the breath-first strategy and the post-evaluation strategy. In particular, CosMiner(t) shows its capability in suppressing the generation of cross-support patterns and discovering rare but truly interesting patterns. Finally, an interesting case of landmark recognition is presented to illustrate the value of cosine interesting patterns found by CosMiner(t) in real-world applications. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
