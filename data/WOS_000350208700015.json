First, the new method starts from basic physics-based heat equations to model 3-D-ICs with intertier liquid cooling microchannels and directly solves the resulting partial differential equations. Second, we develop a new parallel GPU-GMRES solver to compute the resulting thermal systems on a CPU-GPU platform. We also explore different preconditioners (implicit and explicit) and study their performances on thermal circuits and other types of matrices. Experimental results show the proposed GPU-GMRES solver can deliver orders of magnitudes speedup over the parallel LU-based solver and up to 4x speedup over CPU-GMRES for both dc and transient thermal analyzes on a number of thermal circuits and other published problems.", "paper_title": "Parallel Thermal Analysis of 3-D Integrated Circuits With Liquid Cooling on CPU-GPU Platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000350208700015"}
