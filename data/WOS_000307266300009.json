Most existing schemes against pollution attacks either bring significant redundancy to the original message or require a high computational complexity to verify received blocks. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme against pollution attacks based on probabilistic key pre-distribution and homomorphic message authentication codes (MACs). In our scheme, each block is attached with a small number of MACs and each node can use these MACs to verify the integrity of the corresponding block with a high probability. Compared to previous schemes, our scheme still leverages a small number of keys to generate MACs for each block, but more than doubles the detection probability.Meanwhile, our scheme is able to efficiently restrict pollution propagation within a small number of hops. Experimental results show that our scheme is more efficient in verification than existing ones based on public-key cryptography.", "paper_title": "An efficient MAC scheme for secure network coding with probabilistic detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000307266300009"}
