The proposed high-speed, low-complexity FFT architecture can provide a higher throughput rate and low hardware complexity by using a two-parallel data-path scheme and a single-path delay-feedback (SDF) structure. The radix-2(4) FFT algorithm is also realized in our processor to reduce the number of complex multiplications. The proposed FFT/IFFT processor has been designed and implemented with 0.18-mu m CMOS technology in a supply voltage of 1.8 V. The proposed two-parallel FFT/IFFT processor has a throughput rate of up to 900 Msample/s at 450 MHz while requiring much smaller hardware complexity and low power consumption.", "paper_title": "A high-speed two-parallel radix-2(4) FFT/IFFT processor for MB-OFDM UWB systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255647700036"}
