Various parameters including flow rate ratio, capillary number, geometry, and wetting property are investigated. The results show that due to the confinement of the main channel, the T-junction microchannel is prone to generate elliptic droplets, while the flow focusing configuration is likely to generate spherical droplets. In particular, the work shows that the geometry effect, i.e., the width ratio of main channel to lateral channel of T-junction, and the width of the orifice in flow focusing configuration, plays a significant role in the determination of shape and length or the diameter of droplets. It also demonstrates that the lattice Boltzmann method with free energy model is an effective way to simulate the generation of droplets in T-junction microchannel as well as in flow focusing configuration.
