A function D : Omega bar right arrow {0,1}(m) is a disperser for C with entropy threshold k and error epsilon if for any distribution X in C such that X gives positive probability to at least 2(k) elements we have that the distribution D(X) gives positive probability to at least (1 - epsilon)2(m) elements. A long line of research is devoted to giving explicit (that is polynomial time computable) dispersers (and related objects called \"extractors\") for various classes of distributions while trying to maximize m as a function of k. For several interesting classes of distributions there are explicit constructions in the literature of zero-error dispersers with \"small\" output length m. In this paper we develop a general technique to improve the output length of zero-error dispersers. This strategy works for several classes of sources and is inspired by a transformation that improves the output length of extractors (which was given by Shaltiel (CCC'06; Proceedings of the 21st Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity, (2006) 46-60.) building on earlier work by Gabizon, Raz and Shaltiel (SIAM J Comput 36 (2006) 1072-1094). Our techniques are different than those of Shaltiel (CCC' 06; Proceedings of the 21st Annual IEEE Conference on Computational Complexity (2006) 46-60) and in particular give non-trivial results in the errorless case. Using our approach we construct improved zero-error 2-source dispersers. More precisely, we show that for any constant delta > 0 there is a constant eta > 0 such that for sufficiently large n there is a poly-time computable function D : {0, 1}(n) x {0, 1}(n) bar right arrow {0, 1}(eta n) such that for every two independent distributions X-1,X-2 over {0, 1}(n) each with support size at least 2(delta n), the output distribution D(X-1,X-2) has full support. This improves the output length of previous constructions by Barak, Kindler, Shaltiel, Sudakov and Wigderson (Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (2005) 1-10) and has applications in Ramsey theory and in improved constructions of certain data structures from the work of Fiat and Naor [SIAM J Comput 22 (1993)]. We also use our techniques to give explicit constructions of zero-error dispersers for bit-fixing sources and affine sources over polynomially large fields. These constructions improve the best known explicit constructions due to Rao (unpublished data) and Gabizon and Raz [Combinatorica 28 (2008)] and achieve m = Omega(k) for bit-fixing sources and m = k - o(k) for affine sources over polynomial size fields.
