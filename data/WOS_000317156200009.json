For the network under study, the effects of both random and vague factors are considered. By stochastic analysis techniques, we establish sufficient conditions for the coupled fuzzy neural networks to be exponentially synchronized in the mean square. It is demonstrated that the network synchronizability is largely dependent on the coupling structure of such network. Moreover, the information exchange network needs not to be undirected or strongly connected. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the usefulness and effectiveness of our results.
