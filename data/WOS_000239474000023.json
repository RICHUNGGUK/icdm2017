We also prove that if a public-key encryption scheme is secure in the sense of PATK, then it is also secure in the sense of IK-CCA. Since it looks much easier to prove that a public-key encryption scheme is secure in the sense of PATK than to prove directly that it is secure in the sense of IK-CCA, the notion of PATK is useful to prove the anonymity property of public-key encryption schemes. We also propose the first generic conversion for the anonymity, that is, we prove that the public-key encryption scheme derived from the Fujisaki-Okamoto conversion scheme, where the basic public-key encryption scheme is secure in the sense of IK-CPA, is secure in the sense of IK-CCA in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "PA in the two-key setting and a generic conversion for encryption with anonymity", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474000023"}
