With the uncertainty involved in wafer lot movement, dynamically allocating vehicles to each intrabay is very difficult. The cycle time and overall tool productivity of the wafer lots are affected when a vehicle takes too long to arrive. In the current study, a Markov decision model is developed to study the vehicle allocation control problem in the AMHS. The objective is to minimize the sum of the expected long-run average transport job waiting cost. An interesting exhaustive structure in the optimal vehicle allocation control is found in accordance with the Markov decision model. Based on this exhaustive structure, an efficient algorithm is then developed to solve the vehicle allocation control problem numerically. The performance of the proposed method is verified by a simulation study. Compared with other methods, the proposed method can significantly reduce the waiting cost of wafer lots for AMHS vehicle transportation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
