However, it is well-known that the switching frequency of a switched-mode power converter with hysteresis control depends on many factors such as loading current and delay of the controller which vary from time to time. It results in a wide noise spectrum and leads to difficulty in shielding electro-magnetic interference. In this work, a phase-lock loop (PLL) is utilized to control the hysteresis level of the comparator used in the controller, while not interfering with the intrinsic behavior of the hysteresis controller. Some design techniques are used to solve the integration problem and to improve the settling speed of the PLL. Moreover, different control modes are implemented. A buck converter with proposed control scheme is fabricated using a commercial 0.35-mu m CMOS technology. The chip area is 1900 mu m x 2200 mu m. The switching frequency is locked to 1 MHz, and the measured frequency deviation is within +/- 1%. The measured load transient response between 160 and 360 mA is 5 mu s only.", "paper_title": "A Fast-Response Pseudo-PWM Buck Converter With PLL-Based Hysteresis Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000305181800002"}
