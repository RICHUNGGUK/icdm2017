However, successful CR networking functions such as routing prefer on the knowledge of radio resource availability associated with location, which is a challenge of traditional spectrum sensing. We introduce the concept of spectrum map encompassing spectrum and location information to facilitate multihop routing in highly dynamic environment, in addition to utilizing statistics of opportunistic links. Because traditional spectrum sensing only knows local information of CR transmitter, it is difficult and resource consuming to construct the entire spectrum map. We therefore extend the compressed sensing technique requiring very limited local sensing to establish spectrum map. We analyze the communication overhead and practically construct the spectrum map via expander graph. Finally, we demonstrate using spectrum map to reliably route packets of CRs in an end-to-end way, under the guaranteed outage for nodes in primary system and maximizing the throughput among cooperative CRs.
