Among those, k-coreness has found a number of applications in areas as diverse as sociology, proteinomics, graph visualization, and distributed system analysis and design. This paper proposes new distributed algorithms for the computation of the k-coreness of a network, a process also known as k-core decomposition. This technique 1) allows the decomposition, over a set of connected machines, of very large graphs, when size does not allow storing and processing them on a single host, and 2) enables the runtime computation of k-cores in \"live\" distributed systems. Lower bounds on the algorithms complexity are given, and an exhaustive experimental analysis on real-world data sets is provided.", "paper_title": "Distributed k-Core Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839100007"}
