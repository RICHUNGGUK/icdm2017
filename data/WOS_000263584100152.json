The proposed IPSO method consists of the modified evolutionary direction operator (MEDO) and the traditional PSO. A novel MEDO combining the evolutionary direction operator (EDO) and the migration operation is also proposed. Hence, the proposed IPSO method can improve the ability of searching global solution. Experimental results have shown that the proposed IPSO method has a better performance than the traditional PSO in the human body classification and the skin color detection. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
