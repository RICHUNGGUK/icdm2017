This paper introduces a general framework for production scheduling (PS) and detailed production scheduling (DPS) using a two-level hierarchical approach. The PS activity generates a monthly production schedule based on information on orders and forecasts, and the DPS activity handles disturbances in production on an hourly basis. The focus is on disturbances in the supply of utilities, which often cause great losses at process industrial sites. The research has been conducted in close collaboration with Perstorp, a world-leading company within several sectors of the specialty chemicals market. A specification list provided by Perstorp has been used as a starting point for formulating the PS and DPS activities as optimization problems. An example that is inspired by a real industrial site is presented to show how the PS and DPS may operate and how the integration of these two functions behaves. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
