The radial basis function (RBF) neural networks are utilised to model the actuator faults. The adaptive fault estimation observer is designed by exploiting the on-line learning ability of RBF neural networks to approximate the actuator fault. The adaptive algorithm of the RBF networks is established by the Lyapunov theory, and the design of the proposed observer is reformulated as a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can be conveniently solved by standard LMI tools. Finally, two simulation examples are used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis method.", "paper_title": "Actuator fault estimation for a class of nonlinear descriptor systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324683200034"}
