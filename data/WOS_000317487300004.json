Predistortion is applied to the baseband signal and the bias of the high-efficiency power amplifier is adaptively changed according to the envelope distribution of the baseband signal and the power amplifier itself. This novel transmitter can simultaneously achieve high average efficiency and linearity even with a high peak to average ratio signal. A comprehensive simulation framework has been developed using EDA software to validate this adaptive bias scheme with 16, 32, and 64 quadrature amplitude modulation signals. The simulation results show that this novel scheme can help in improving the average overall efficiency of the LINC transmitter by 15% while sustaining expected linearity.
