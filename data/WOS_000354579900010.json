The enhanced colliding bodies optimization (ECBO) that utilizes memory to save some historically best solution and uses a random procedure to avoid local optima is also applied to skeletal structures. The capability of the CBO and ECBO are compared through two trusses and two frames structures. The design constraints of steel frames are imposed according to the provisions of LRFD-AISC. The numerical results show the successful performance of the ECBO algorithm in comparison to the CBO, and some other well-known meta-heuristics in structural optimization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
