The integration of MRAM in FPGAs allows the logic circuit to rapidly configure the algorithm, the routing and logic functions, and easily realize the Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) and multicontext configuration. However, the conventional MRAM technology based on the Field Induced Magnetic Switching (FIMS) writing approach consumes very high power, large circuit surfaces, and produces high disturbance between memory cells. These drawbacks prevent FIMS-MRAM's further development in memory and logic circuit. Thermally Assisted Switching (TAS)-based MRAM is then evaluated to address these issues. In this article, some design techniques, novel computing architecture, and logic components for FPGA logic circuits based on TAS-MRAM technology are presented. By using STMicroelectronics CMOS 90nm technology and a complete TAS-MTJ spice model, some chip characteristic results such as the programming latency (similar to 25ns) and power dissipation (similar to 124pJ) have been calculated or simulated to demonstrate the expected performance of TAS-MRAM-based FPGA logic circuits.", "paper_title": "TAS-MRAM-Based Low-Power High-Speed Runtime Reconfiguration (RTR) FPGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000208166500002"}
