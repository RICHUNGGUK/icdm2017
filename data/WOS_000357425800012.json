The proposed GeNOSA framework uses a global optimization algorithm (OptNCA) to cope with the stringent limitations of NCA approaches in large-scale qGRNs. Results: OptNCA performs well against existing NCA-derived algorithms in terms of utilization of connectivity information and reconstruction accuracy of inferred GRNs using synthetic and real Escherichia coli datasets. For comparisons with other non-NCA-derived algorithms, OptNCA without using known qualitative regulations is also evaluated in terms of qualitative assessments using a synthetic Saccharomyces cerevisiae dataset of the DREAM3 challenges. We successfully demonstrate GeNOSA in several applications including deducing condition-dependent regulations, establishing high-consensus qGRNs and validating a sub-network experimentally for dose-response and time-course microarray data, and discovering and experimentally confirming a novel regulation of CRP on AscG.", "paper_title": "GeNOSA: inferring and experimentally supporting quantitative gene regulatory networks in prokaryotes", "paper_id": "WOS:000357425800012"}
