We develop new techniques that lead to new and improved lower bounds for simplex range reporting as well as some other geometric problems. Simplex range reporting is the problem of storing n points in the d-dimensional space in a data structure such that the k points that lie inside a query simplex can be found efficiently. This is one of the fundamental and extensively studied problems in computational geometry. Currently, the best data structures for the problem achieve Q(n) + O(k) query time using (O) over tilde((n/ Q(n))(d)) space in which the (O) over tilde(.) notation either hides a polylogarithmic or an n(epsilon) factor for any constant epsilon > 0, (depending on the data structure and Q (n)). The best lower bound on this problem is due to Chazelle and Rosenberg who showed any pointer machine data structure that can answer queries in O(n(gamma) + k) time must use Omega(n(d-epsilon-d gamma)) space. Observe that this bound is a polynomial factor away from the best known data structures. In this article, we improve the space lower bound to Omega ((n/Q(n))(d)/2(O(root log Q(n)))). Not only this bridges the gap from polynomial to sub-polynomial, it also offers a smooth trade-off curve. For instance, for polylogarithmic values of Q(n), our space lower bound almost equals Omega((n/Q(n))(d)); the latter is generally believed to be the \"right\" bound. By a simple geometric transformation, we also improve the best lower bounds for the halfspace range reporting problem. Furthermore, we study the external memory model and offer a new simple framework for proving lower bounds in this model. We show that answering simplex range reporting queries with Q(n) + O(k/B) I/Os requires Omega(B(n/(BQ(n)))(d)/2(O(root logQ (n)))) space or Omega((n/(BQ(n)))(d)/2(O(root logQ(n)))) blocks, in which B is the block size.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED POINTER MACHINE AND I/O LOWER BOUNDS FOR SIMPLEX RANGE REPORTING AND RELATED PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000339653900002"}
