We propose a characterisation of partial preference orders through a uniform axiomatic treatment of a variety of qualitative uncertainty notions. To this end, we prove a representation result that connects qualitative notions of partial uncertainty to their numerical counterparts. We describe an executable specification, in the declarative framework of Answer Set Programming, that constitutes the core engine for qualitative management of uncertainty. Some basic reasoning tasks are also identified.", "paper_title": "Comparative uncertainty: theory and automation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255227600004"}
