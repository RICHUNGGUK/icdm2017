For interactions with general equations of state and material interfaces, a new generalized Roe average is proposed. For single-phase interactions, this new Roe average does not introduce artificial states and satisfies the U-property exactly. For interactions at material interfaces, the U-property is satisfied by introducing ghost states for the internal energy. A number of numerical tests suggest that the proposed Riemann solver is suitable for general equations of state and has an accuracy comparable to iterative Riemann solvers, while being significantly more robust and efficient.
