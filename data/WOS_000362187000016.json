The model using the selected features is often regarded as if it had generated the data. By taking its uncertainty into account, the discrimination capabilities can be measured by a global selection index (GSI), which can be used in the prediction function. In this paper, we propose a latent selection augmented naive (LSAN) Bayes classifier. By introducing a latent feature selection indicator, the GSI can be factorized into each local selection index (LSI). Using conjugate priors, the LSI for feature evaluation can be explicitly calculated. Then the feature subset selection models can be pruned by thresholding the LSIs, and the LSAN classifier can be achieved by the product of a small percentage of single feature model averages. The numerical results on some real datasets show that the proposed method outperforms the contrast feature weighting methods, and is very competitive if compared with some other commonly used classifiers such as SVM.
