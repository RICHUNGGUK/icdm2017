This procedure is typically referred to as laminate tailoring. Traditionally, tailoring is done by keeping the fibre orientation angle within each layer constant throughout a structural component. Allowing the fibres to follow curvilinear paths within the plane of the laminates constitutes all advanced tailoring option that can lead to modification of load paths within the laminate to result in more favourable stress distributions and improve the laminate performance. Based on numerical simulations, the present work demonstrates the advantages of variable-stiffness over straight-fibre laminates in terms of compressive buckling and first-ply failure. A physically based set of failure criteria, able to predict the various modes of failure of a composite laminated structure, is implemented in finite element models of straight and variable-stiffness panels under compression. Non-linear analyses are carried out to simulate first-ply failure in the postbuckling regime. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
