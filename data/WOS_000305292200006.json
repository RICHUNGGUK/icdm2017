The graph model reveals the inherent symmetries involved in calculating the Hessian. The algebraic model, based on Griewank and Walther's [Evaluating derivatives, in Principles and Techniques of Algorithmic Differentiation, 2nd ed., Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), Philadelphia, PA, 2008] state transformations synthesizes the calculation of the Hessian as a formula. These dual points of view, graphical and algebraic, lead to a new framework for Hessian computation. This is illustrated by developing edge_pushing, a new truly reverse Hessian computation algorithm that fully exploits the Hessian's symmetry. Computational experiments compare the performance of edge_pushing on 16 functions from the CUTE collection [I. Bongartz et al. Cute: constrained and unconstrained testing environment, ACM Trans. Math. Softw. 21(1) (1995), pp. 123-160] against two algorithms available as drivers of the software ADOL-C [A. Griewank et al.
