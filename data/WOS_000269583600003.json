In 1996, Sadeghiyan and Mohajeri proposed a so-called \"new universal test for bit strings\", based on the theoretical next bit test. In this paper, we study different aspects of this test and show its weakness. Then, we improve it both theoretically and practically for better classification of the sequences. As a result, a Practical Next Bit (PNB) test is introduced in two Global and Local versions and a histogram, which gives an impression of the global evaluation of the underlying sequence. Testing samples of nonrandom sequences, using both the PNB test and the NIST Statistical Test Suite, indicates the superiority of the PNB test power over that of the NIST.", "paper_title": "Practical Next Bit Test for Evaluating Pseudorandom Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000269583600003"}
