They are: (i) h-adaptive grid refinement techniques that reduce the total number of degrees of freedom in the real space grid while improving on the approximate resolution of the wanted solution; and (ii) subspace recycling of the approximate solution in self-consistent cycles with the aim of improving the performance of the generalized eigenproblem solver. These techniques are shown to give a convincing speed-up in the computation process by alleviating the overhead normally associated with computing systems with many degrees-of-freedom.
