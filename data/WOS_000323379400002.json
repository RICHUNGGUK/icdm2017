However, privacy is still among the key challenges that keep hampering DaaS service composition solution. Indeed services may follow different, conflicting privacy specifications with respect to the data they use and provide within a composition. In this paper, the authors propose an approach for privacy-aware composition of DaaS services. The authors' approach allows verifying the compatibility of privacy specifications of services involved in a composition. In the case when any composition will be incompatible in terms of privacy, the authors introduce a novel approach based on negotiation to reach compatibility of concerned services. The negotiation approach is cautiously operated with without any privacy damaging of services. The authors validate the applicability of their proposal through a set of experiments.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Respecting Privacy Specification when Composing DaaS Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000323379400002"}
