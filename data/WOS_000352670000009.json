The heterogeneity of spectrum is embodied via exploiting multiple attributes, based on which a valuation function is devised to evaluate the preference of an SU over a spectrum band. We first propose an auction scheme consisting of a greedy-like winner determination algorithm and a critical value based discriminatory pricing policy. We then extend the proposed auction scheme to a more challenging scenario by considering spectrum sharing among SUs. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our auction schemes achieve individual rational, budget balance, value-truthfulness of SUs, and weak value-truthfulness of PUs. Our simulation results verify the advantage of combinatorial auction, the functionality of spectrum sharing and the economic robustness of our auction schemes. (c) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
