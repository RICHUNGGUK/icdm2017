For this reason, researches are now interested not only in the accuracy but also in the scalability of the machine learning algorithms. To deal with large-scale databases, feature selection can be helpful to reduce their dimensionality, turning an impracticable algorithm into a practical one. In this research, the influence of several feature selection methods on the scalability of four of the most well-known training algorithms for feedforward artificial neural networks (ANNs) will be analyzed over both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that feature selection is an effective tool to improve scalability. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
