This bio-inspired parallel algorithm has been implemented in a novel device architecture called CUDA (TM)(Compute Unified Device Architecture). The implementation has been designed via tissue P systems on the framework of Membrane Computing. Some examples and experimental results are also presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
