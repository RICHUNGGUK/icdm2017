The authors' network resource model and network abstraction layer (NAL) software offer an extensible network resource abstraction to applications running on mobile devices. The NAL service can be used in conjunction with well-known APIs, such as the Socket API, which provide access to these resources; it also accommodates support for mobility-management facilities, such as Mobile IP, if available.", "paper_title": "Network resource awareness and control in mobile applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000244571200006"}
