Upon comparing Gaussian and nonGaussian states within the class, we collect some evidence that Gaussian states are maximally robust against noise, i.e. the complete loss of entanglement occurs in maximal time. However, the gap with respect to nonGaussian states is negligible for sufficiently high energy of the states.", "paper_title": "DECOHERENCE OF GAUSSIAN AND NONGAUSSIAN PHOTON-NUMBER ENTANGLED STATES IN A NOISY CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800004"}
