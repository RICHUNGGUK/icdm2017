This paper presents our work on designing behavior model for virtual humans in a crowd simulation under normal-life and emergency situations. Our mode! adopts an agent-based approach and employs a layered framework to reflect the natural pattern of human-like decision making process, which generally involves a person's awareness of the situation and consequent changes on the internal attributes. The social group and crowd-related behaviors are modeled according to the findings and theories observed from social psychology (e.g., social attachment theory). By integrating our model into an agent execution process, each individual agent call response differently to the perceived environment and make realistic behavioral decisions based oil various physiological, emotional, and social group attributes. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, a case study has been conducted, Which shouts that realistic human behaviors call be generated at both individual and group level.
