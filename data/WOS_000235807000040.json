In order to minimize the delta between these views we propose a highly dynamic Round-Trip Engineering (RTE) technique where the elements of the various views are one and the same. We combine Extended Entity-Relationship diagrams with an object-oriented prototype-based language in a two-phased technique that allows for the rapid prototyping of the modeled applications. Run-time objects are included in the RTE process resulting in advanced constraint enforcement. Moreover support is provided for straightforward role modeling.", "paper_title": "SelfSync: A dynamic round-trip engineering environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807000040"}
