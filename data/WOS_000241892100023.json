Through the construction of a suitable function, the problem of data fitting can be viewed as that of parameter optimization, and then the CAS is used to search the parameter space so as to find the optimal estimations of the system parameters. To investigate the performances of the CAS, the CAS is compared with the particle swarm optimization (PSO) on two test problems. Simulation results indicate that the CAS achieves better performances.", "paper_title": "Data fitting via chaotic ant swarm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100023"}
