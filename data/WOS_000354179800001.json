It has been proven that the coldstart phenomenon is highly transient, nonlinear and uncertain and therefore has absorbed an increasing attention of the researchers of automotive society. In this paper, we prove that a proper integration of intelligent methods can result in a very efficient tool suited for identifying the characteristics of coldstart phenomenon. To do so, a recent spotlighted natural-inspired optimiser called mutable smart bee algorithm is utilised to evolve a Gaussian generalised regression neural network such that the resulted framework can conduct a fast, robust and accurate identification. The outcomes of the conducted experiments endorse on the applicability of intelligent techniques for engine coldstart identification, and also, pave the way for future investigations on intelligent-based analysis of demanding automotive problems.", "paper_title": "Coupling Gaussian generalised regression neural network and mutable smart bee algorithm to analyse the characteristics of automotive engine coldstart hydrocarbon emission", "paper_id": "WOS:000354179800001"}
