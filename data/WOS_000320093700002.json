Efficient large-scale algorithms for evaluating these barriers and their derivatives are important in interior-point methods for nonsymmetric conic formulations of sparse semidefinite programs. The algorithms are based on the multifrontal method for sparse Cholesky factorization.", "paper_title": "Logarithmic barriers for sparse matrix cones", "paper_id": "WOS:000320093700002"}
