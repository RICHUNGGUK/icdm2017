In this paper, we focus on rough clustering methods based on rough-set representation. Rough k-Means (RKM) is one of the rough clustering method proposed by Lingras et al. Outputs of many clustering algorithms, including RKM depend strongly on initial values, so we must evaluate the validity of outputs. In the case of objective-based clustering algorithms, the objective function is handled as the measure. It is difficult, however to evaluate the output in RKM, which is not objective-based. To solve this problem, we propose new objective-based rough clustering algorithms and verify theirs usefulness through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "On Objective-Based Rough Hard and Fuzzy c-Means Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000370188200004"}
