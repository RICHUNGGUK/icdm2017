The inherent ambiguity of keyword query is prone to unsatisfied query results. Moreover some existing techniques on Web query, keyword query in relational databases and XML databases cannot be completely applied to keyword query in dataspaces. So we propose KeymanticES, a novel keyword-based semantic entity search mechanism in dataspaces which combines both keyword query and semantic query features. And we focus on query intent disambiguation problem and propose a novel three-step approach to resolve it. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and correctness of our proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Query Intent Disambiguation of Keyword-Based Semantic Entity Search in Dataspaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000318508700015"}
