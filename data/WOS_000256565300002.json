Hence, consumption behaviors on related items from different domains can be useful to inform RS to make recommendations. This paper reports our efforts on uncovering the association between user preferences on related items across domains. In addition, we have also tested collaborative filtering technique on our cross-domain dataset for which results are reported here.", "paper_title": "If you like the devil wears prada the book, will you also enjoy the devil wears prada the movie?
