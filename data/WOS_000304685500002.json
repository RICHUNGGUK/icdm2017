The two main results of the paper are the following. First, we show that it is decidable, given a circular splicing language and a regular language, whether they are equal. Second, we prove the language generated by an alphabetic splicing system is context-free. Alphabetic splicing systems are a generalization of simple and semi-simple splicing systems already considered in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
