In this paper we consider a communication system that transmits binary data sequence or M frequency shaft keying over a channel. With noncoherent detection, the MFSK tones on a given hop must be separated in frequency by an integer multiple of chip rate to provide orthogonality. The worst case partial-band noise jammer chooses ftaction (rho) to maximize the bit error probability (P-h) for a given M and signal to noise ratio. It has been observed from the simulation results that increases with K illustrating the effectiveness of worst-case jamming (rho(wc)) against FH/MFSK signals at typical operating points. It may be noted that rho(wc) decreases as E-b/N-j gets larger.", "paper_title": "Performance analyses of fast frequency hopping spread spectrum and jamming systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257681100002"}
