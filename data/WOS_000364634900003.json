This paper is about a novel homologous decision tree crossover operator. Contrary to other tree crossover operators it defines the context for a decision tree node and elaborates a fast one-sample-based tree alignment procedure. The idea is to replace a sub-tree with a better one from the same context, as defined by the decision tree training process. This operator does not rely on the topological properties of the tree but rather on its behavioral properties. During empirical testing the new operator showed the best generalization capabilities.", "paper_title": "Prudent alignment and crossover of decision trees in genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000364634900003"}
