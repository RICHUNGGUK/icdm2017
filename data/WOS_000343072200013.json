In UWSNs, Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol has attracted strong attention due to its potentially large impact to the overall network performance. Unlike terrestrial networks, which mainly rely on radio waves for communications, UWSNs utilize acoustic waves, which pose a new research challenge in the design of MAC protocols. To present the development of MAC protocols in UWSNs, this paper surveys the current state-of-the-art MAC protocols for UWSNs. In the early development, the performance in terms of delay and throughput of the UWSNs has been the major concern of the MAC layer protocol design. Later, the design of energy-efficient MAC protocols becomes a new research focus because sensor nodes are generally powered by batteries which are less likely to be recharged. In this paper, we first describe the underwater acoustic environment and the challenges to the MAC protocols design in UWSNs. We then provide a comparative study of several types of MAC protocols according to current existing diverse implementations. Furthermore, open research issues will be summarized. Hopefully, this survey will inspire more active research in this area.", "paper_title": "A Survey on MAC Protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343072200013"}
