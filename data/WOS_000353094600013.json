Contrary to most existing techniques, the proposed method provides a closed form approximate solution. The optimal representation of the solution is obtained in the primal-dual setting. The model is built by incorporating the initial/boundary conditions as constraints of an optimization problem. The developed method is well suited for problems involving singular, variable and constant coefficients as well as problems with irregular geometrical domains. Numerical results for linear and nonlinear PDEs demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method over existing methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
