Design/methodology/approach - A conceptual framework is formed based on technology acceptance model literature. Data were collected through a survey on 127 ERP users in small- to middle-sized Chinese firms. Multiple regression analysis was employed. Findings - Subjective norm and output quality determine the perceived usefulness of ERP. Communication has a significant impact on both perceived usefulness and perceived ease of the use of ERP, which further influence ERP usage. Research limitations/implications - Future research should consider the adoption of different kinds of ERP systems in other countries. Practical implications - The findings may help organizations effectively use ERP and other kinds of technology systems. In particular, efficient training should be a focus of organizational support in systems implementation. Originality/value - This study focuses on the impact of organizational training and output quality on end-users' usage of ERP in China.", "paper_title": "Factors impacting end-users' usage of ERP in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000327368800004"}
