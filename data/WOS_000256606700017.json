More specifically, each variable of the network can be modeled through a logistic regression model, in which the parents of the variable define the covariates. When all main effects and interactions between the parent variables are incorporated as covariates, the conditional probabilities are estimated without restrictions, as in a traditional Bayesian network. By incorporating interaction terms up to a specific order only, the number of parameters can be drastically reduced. Furthermore, ordered logistic regression can be used when the categories of a variable are ordered, resulting in even more parsimonious models. Parameters are estimated by a modified junction tree algorithm. The approach is illustrated with the Alarm network. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
