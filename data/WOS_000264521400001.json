In this paper, we have developed and tested an offline application namely the dynamic photorefraction system (DPRS) which allows an accurate analysis of accommodation and pupil size from eccentric photorefraction images. The application uses the Microsoft componentized technology known as the Component Object Model (COM), includes distinct libraries for importing photorefraction videos and provides an accurate analysis and output of pupil size and accommodation. In addition, the system can interface with any custom built photorefractor allowing a widespread application in vision science experiments involving simultaneous measures of ocular focus and pupil size.
