Design/methodology/approach - Smith predictor is selected to solve pure time delay of the HAGC system The model of thickness predictor is identified by the extended recursive least square algorithm The parameters of controller are adjusted by particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO). The simulation result shows that the Smith predictor has good response performance and anti-disturbances ability Findings - The control precision of the HAGC system in the finished mill call be obviously improved by Smith predictor with PSO arithmetic The Smith predictor with PSO arithmetic is suitable to solve the pure time delay in the HAGC system. Research limitations/implications - Randomicity in rolling process, and the effect of other mill stands are the main limitations based on which the model will be applied Practical implications - A very useful method to improve the precision of the strip Originality/value - This paper presents a new method of Smith predictor with PSO arithmetic is designed for a HAGC system in the finished mill to solve a pure time delay problem, The object model is acquired by system identification method", "paper_title": "The application of the Smith predictor with PSO in HAGC system", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500018"}
