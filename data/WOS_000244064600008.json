This paper develops an intelligent technique based on fuzzy- genetic algorithm ( FGA) for automatically detecting faults on HVAC system. Many researchers have proposed only using fuzzy systems to effect fault detection and diagnosis. Other applications of the FGA are mainly focused on the synthesis of fuzzy control rules. The proposed automatic fault detection system ( AFD) monitors the HVAC system states continuously by fuzzy system. The optimization capability of genetic algorithms allows the generation of optimal fuzzy rules. Faults are represented as different fault levels in the AFD system and are distinguished by fuzzy system after tuning its rule table. Simulation studies are conducted to verify the proposed AFD system for the single zone air handler system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
