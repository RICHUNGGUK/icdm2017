Comparing with conventional I/O circuit, this work consists of input equalizer, limiting amplifier with active-load inductive peaking, duty cycle correction and CML output buffer. To enhance circuit bandwidth for 10-GB/s operation, several techniques include active load inductive peaking and active feedback with current buffer in Cherry-Hooper topology. With these. techniques, it reduces 30%-65% of the chip area comparing with on-chip inductor peaking method. This design also passes the interoperability test with switch fabric successfully. It provides 600-mV(pp) differential voltage swing in driving 50-Omega output loads, 40-dB input dynamic range, 40-dB voltage gain, and 8-mV input sensitivity. The total power consumption is only 85 mW in 1.8-V supply and the chip feature die size is 700 mu m x 400 mu m.", "paper_title": "A 10-Gb/s CML I/O Circuit for Backplane Interconnection in 0.18-mu m CMOS Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000265457700009"}
