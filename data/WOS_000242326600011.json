Uncertainty principles can be derived by using a group theoretic approach. This approach yields also a formalism for finding functions which are the minimizers of the uncertainty principles. A general theorem which associates an uncertainty principle with a pair of self-adjoint operators is used in finding the minimizers of the uncertainty related to various groups. This study is concerned with the uncertainty principle in the context of the Weyl-Heisenberg, the SIM(2), the Affine and the Affine-Weyl-Heisenberg groups. We explore the relationship between the two-dimensional affine group and the SIM(2) group in terms of the uncertainty minimizers. The uncertainty principle is also extended to the Affine-Weyl-Heisenberg group in one dimension. Possible minimizers related to these groups are also presented and the scale-space properties of some of the minimizers are explored.", "paper_title": "The uncertainty principle: Group theoretic approach, possible minimizers and scale-space properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000242326600011"}
