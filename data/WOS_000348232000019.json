GP-SIMD employs a two-dimensional access memory with modified SRAM storage cells and a bit-serial processing unit per each memory row. An analytic performance model of the GP-SIMD architecture is presented, comparing it to associative processor and to conventional SIMD architectures. Cycle-accurate simulation of four workloads supports the analytical comparison. Assuming a moderate die area, GP-SIMD architecture outperforms both the associative processor and conventional SIMD coprocessor architectures by almost an order of magnitude while consuming less power.", "paper_title": "GP-SIMD Processing-in-Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000348232000019"}
