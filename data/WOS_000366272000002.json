The approach uses an incremental learning procedure to simultaneously select the model inputs, to choose the neural network structure, and to update the network weights. Candidate models with larger and smaller number of input variables than the current model are constructed and tested concurrently. The procedure employs a statistical test in each learning step to choose the best model amongst the current and candidate models. Membership functions can be added or deleted to adjust input space granulation and the neural network structure. Granulation and structure adaptation depend of the modeling error. The weights of the neural networks are updated using a gradient-descent algorithm with optimal learning rate. Prediction and nonlinear system identification examples illustrate the usefulness of the approach. Comparisons with state of the art evolving fuzzy modeling alternatives are performed to evaluate performance from the point of view of modeling error. Simulation results show that the evolving adaptive input selection modeling neural network approach achieves as high as, or higher performance than the remaining evolving modeling methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Input Selection and Evolving Neural Fuzzy Networks Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000366272000002"}
