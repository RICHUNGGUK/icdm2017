The online algorithms try not to remember irrelevant information instead of synthesizing all available information (as opposed to classic batch learning algorithms). Today, combining classifiers is proposed as a new road for the improvement of the classification accuracy. However, most ensemble algorithms operate in batch mode. For this reason, we propose an incremental ensemble that combines five classifiers that can operate incrementally: the Naive Bayes, the Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE), the 3-Nearest Neighbors, the Non-Nested Generalised Exemplars (NNGE) and the Kstar algorithms using the voting methodology. We performed a large-scale comparison of the proposed ensemble with other state-of-the-art algorithms on several datasets and the proposed method produce better accuracy in most cases.", "paper_title": "An incremental ensemble of classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000298332400001"}
