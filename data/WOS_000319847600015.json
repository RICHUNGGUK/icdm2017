In this paper, an approach based on application scenarios is put forward for facilitating dynamic adaptations of decentralized software systems in unpredicted situations. Scenarios offer behavior norms to regulate the behavior of autonomous software entities under specific situations so that software entities can take fitted and coordinative actions when they are confronted with diverse and even unpredicted situations. At the end of this paper, a simulation traffic system is developed and studied. The experimental results show that the adaptability of the system is improved remarkably after application scenarios are deployed. In the case study, the efficiency and scalability of the scenario-based adaptation mechanism are also experimented and analyzed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
