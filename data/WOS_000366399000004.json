No-reference logarithmic model is introduced to quantify service experience for each user and the objective is to maximize sum of all user's mean of score (MOS). We firstly formulate the optimal problem into an S-dimensional (S-D) assignment problem. Then, to solve this problem, the modified Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is deduced to obtain the suboptimal result of joint user-paring and subchannel allocation. The merits of this solution are as follows. First, the gap between its results and the global optimal one can be quantified and controlled by balancing the complexity and accuracy, which merit the other suboptimal algorithms do not have. Secondly, it has the polynomial computational complexity and the worst case complexity is O(3LN(3)), where L is the maximum iteration time and N is the number of subchannels. Simulations also prove that our proposed algorithm can effectively improve quality of experience and the gap between our proposed and the optimal algorithms can be controlled below 8%.", "paper_title": "QoE-driven Joint Resource Allocation and User-paring in Virtual MIMO SC-FDMA Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000004"}
