From geometric considerations of the enzyme structure and AFM tip, we could estimate the average number of active sites available to interact with substrate molecules in the bulk. The procedure was exploited to determine the interaction force between acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme (ACC enzyme) and its substrate diclofop, for which steered molecular dynamics (SMD) was used. The theoretical force of (1.6 +/- 0.5) nN per enzyme led to a total force in remarkable agreement with the experimentally measured force with AFM, thus demonstrating the usefulness of the procedure proposed here to assist in the interpretation of nanobiosensors experiments.
