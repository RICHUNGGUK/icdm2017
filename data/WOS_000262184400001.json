We consider the multi-user detection (MUD) technique, denoted interference subspace rejection (ISR), because it offers a wide range of canonic suppression modes that range in performance and complexity between interference cancellers and linear receivers. To further broaden our study, we propose a modified ISR scheme called hybrid ISR to cope better with multi-rate transmissions. The performance analysis, which is based on the Gaussian assumption (GA) and validated by simulations, takes into account data estimation errors,carrier frequency mismatch, imperfect power control, identification errors of time-varying multipath Rayleigh channels and intercell interference. This analysis enables us to optimize the selection of the MUD mode for multi-rate transmissions in different operating conditions. The effectiveness of interference cancellation is indeed investigated Under different mobile speeds, numbers of receiving antennas, near-far situations, channel estimation errors, and out-cell to in-cell interference ratios. This investigation suggests that the out-of-cell interference, the residual in-cell interference, the noise enhancement as well as low mobility favor the simplest MUD modes as they offer the best performance/complexity tradeoffs.
