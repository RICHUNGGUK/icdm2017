We propose a novel solution by treating this problem as the problem of finding dominant sets in weighted graphs. The nodes of the graph are pairs composed of model contour parts and image edge fragments, and the weights between nodes are based on shape similarity. Because of high consistency between correct correspondences, the correct matching corresponds to a dominant set of the graph. Consequently, when a dominant set is determined, it provides a selection of correct correspondences. As the proposed method is able to get all the dominant sets, we can detect multiple objects in an image in one pass. Moreover, since our approach is purely based on shape, we also determine an optimal scale of target object without a common enumeration of all possible scales. Both theoretic analysis and extensive experimental evaluation illustrate the benefits of our approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
