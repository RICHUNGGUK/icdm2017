The algorithms are based on two approaches: a Benders decomposition algorithm and a branch-and-cut method. We also develop a hybrid algorithm that combines these two approaches. Two variants of each of the three resulting algorithms are considered: a stand-alone version and an iterative probing variant. The latter variant is based on a simple property of the problem, which states that if no connected dominating set of a given cardinality exists, then there are no connected dominating sets of lower cardinality. We present computational results on a large set of instances from the literature.", "paper_title": "Benders Decomposition, Branch-and-Cut, and Hybrid Algorithms for the Minimum Connected Dominating Set Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000343127300001"}
