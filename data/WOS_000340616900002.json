If clashes are not identified and designed out before manufacture, product function will be reduced or substantial cost will be incurred in rework. This paper introduces a novel approach for eliminating clashes by identifying which parameters defining the part features in a computer aided design (CAD) assembly need to change and by how much. Sensitivities are calculated for each parameter defining the part and the assembly as the change in clash volume due to a change in each parameter value. These sensitivities give an indication of important parameters and are used to predict the optimum combination of changes in each parameter to eliminate the clash. Consideration is given to the fact that it is sometimes preferable to modify some components in an assembly rather than others and that some components in an assembly cannot be modified as the designer does not have control over their shape. Successful elimination of clashes has been demonstrated in a number of example assemblies.", "paper_title": "A Sensitivity Approach for Eliminating Clashes From Computer Aided Design Model Assemblies", "paper_id": "WOS:000340616900002"}
