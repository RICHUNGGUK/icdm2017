By exploring the energy compaction property of 2-D SVD coefficient matrices, high coding efficiency is achieved. The proposed scheme is for the better compromise of computational complexity and temporal redundancy reduction, i.e., compared with the existing video coding methods. In addition, the problems caused by frame decoding dependence in hybrid video coding, such as unavailability of random access, are avoided. The comparison of the proposed 2-D SVD coding scheme with the existing relevant non-ME-based low-complexity codecs shows its advantages and potential in applications.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Video Coding Based on Two-Dimensional Singular Value Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700021"}
