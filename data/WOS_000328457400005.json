By reasonably fixing parts of the plaintexts of 10-round Serpent the number of texts required in a linear attack with single approximation can be significantly reduced by a factor of 2(22). The authors also give the best data complexity on 10-round Serpent so far, which is 2(80). Moreover, the authors extend the chosen-plaintext technique to the linear attack using multiple approximations and improve the results of cryptanalysis in data complexity or/and time complexity in different scenarios. As an application to show the usefulness of this technique, an experiment in the multidimensional linear model on 5-round Serpent is given.", "paper_title": "Chosen-plaintext linear attacks on Serpent", "paper_id": "WOS:000328457400005"}
