Numerous 3D imaging techniques have been developed, but only a few of them have the potential to achieve realtime. Of these few, fringe analysis based techniques stand out, having many advantages over the rest. This paper will explain the principles behind fringe analysis based techniques, and will provide experimental results from systems using these techniques.", "paper_title": "High-resolution, real-time 3D imaging with fringe analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000303242600006"}
