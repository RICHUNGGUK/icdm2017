Generation of this entangled state can be difficult with many schemes already proposed. We present an abstract scheme which can create 2D cluster states as a universal resource for quantum computing. We find a linear scaling of grid size with cluster depth. The scheme is also capable of creating more exotic topologies including, 3D structures and the unit cell for topological error correction. We note its relevance to the cavity QED scheme in [29] although it could be applied to various architectures.", "paper_title": "Generation of Topologically Useful Entangled States", "paper_id": "WOS:000297774300004"}
