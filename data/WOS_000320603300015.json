The method is based on Lamb's solution to Stokes flow and the Method of Reflections, and is arbitrarily accurate given sufficient computer memory and time. It is more accurate than multipole methods, but much less efficient. Although it is too numerically intensive to be suitable for more than three spheres, it can easily handle spheres of different sizes. We find no convergence difficulties provided we study mobility problems, rather than resistance problems. After validating against the existing literature, we make a direct comparison with Stokesian Dynamics (SD), and find that the largest errors in SD occur at a sphere separation around 0.1 radius. Finally, we present results for an example system having different-sized spheres. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
