The framework is based on the decomposition of business processes into non-value-added (NVA) and business activities and it is also based on process performance indicators (PIs) to measure interoperability. The developed methodology is then founded on this framework and is aimed to provide support for validating interoperability solutions. A causal performance measurement model (CPMM) is used to define how interoperability improvement may influence the achievement of all of the partners' objectives. An application of the methodology to an illustrative example has been presented.", "paper_title": "A methodology for the evaluation of interoperability improvements in inter-enterprises collaboration based on causal performance measurement models", "paper_id": "WOS:000327813700001"}
