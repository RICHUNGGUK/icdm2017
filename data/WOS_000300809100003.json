This paper proposes a methodology that addresses different dimensions of scalability of mixed-initiative voice search in automatic spoken dialog systems. The strategy is based on splitting the complexity of the fully-constrained grammar (one that tightly covers the entire hypothesis space) into a fixed/low complexity phonotactic grammar followed by an index mechanism that dynamically assembles a second-pass grammar that consists of only a handful of hypotheses. The experimental analysis demonstrates different dimensions of scalability achieved by the proposed method using actual WHITEPAGEs-residential data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
