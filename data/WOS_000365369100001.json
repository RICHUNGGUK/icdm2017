However, it cannot design controllers with the optimal control performance based on the standard VRFT approach as performance indices are not explicitly represented in its objective function. To deal with this problem, this paper presents a novel intelligent VRFT (IVRFT) based on adaptive binary ant system harmony search (ABASHS) where the reference model of VRFT, which potentially determines the control performance, is coordinately optimized with the controller by ABASHS to achieve the best control performance. Finally, the proposed ABASHS-based intelligent virtual reference feedback tuning (ABASHS-IVRFT) method is applied to the temperature control of the heat treatment electric furnace. The simulation results demonstrate that ABASHS-IVRFT is valid and can implement the optimal non-overshoot control easily and efficiently. Considering the characteristics such as ease of implementation and no need of the model information of controlled objects, ABASHS-IVRFT is a promising approach for engineering applications.
