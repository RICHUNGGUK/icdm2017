In today's economy, a new asset comes into play: knowledge. Knowledge has become the most valuable resource for many organizations, and its proper use often determines the survival of enterprises in a competitive environment. However, determining how much knowledge is accessible is not as simple as counting how many units of a product are in inventory. Measuring knowledge quantity has been the focus of active research recently. This article presents an approach for knowledge quantification that offers a novel way of estimating the depth of an agent's knowledge in an automated way. The knowledge quantity measures described in this article are used in the e-decisional community, an integrated knowledge sharing platform that aims at the creation of markets where knowledge is provided as a service.", "paper_title": "Estimating Knowledge Quantity in the e-Decisional Community", "paper_id": "WOS:000304453800003"}
