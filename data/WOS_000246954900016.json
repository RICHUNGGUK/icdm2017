A differential equation describing the oxygenation of the whole retina, at different degrees of detachment, was set up and solved numerically. The results show that the choroid can supply the outer retina with a fairly large amount of oxygen as long as the detachment height is lower than about 1 mm. This study thus supports the view that hyperoxia may well prove to be clinically beneficial. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
