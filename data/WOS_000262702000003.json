But the failure of radiometric correction in post-processing leads to residual radiometric differences between CCD images, which then affect the quality of the images in further applications. This paper, via analyzing the characters and causes of such a phenomenon, proposes a repair approach based on hierarchical location using edge curve. The approach employs a hierarchical strategy to locate the transition area and seam-line automatically and then repair the image through the global reconstruction between CCD images and the local reconstruction in the transition area. Experiments indicate that the approach proposed by this paper is feasible and can improve the quality of images effectively.", "paper_title": "Repair approach for DMC images based on hierarchical location using edge curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702000003"}
