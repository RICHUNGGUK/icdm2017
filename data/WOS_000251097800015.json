Experiments were conducted by emitting 40 kHz ultrasound beam, which is set tone burst mode by 1 ms period to a subject chest. Normal respiration condition and a simulated sleep apnea syndrome condition were measured while subjects were holding breath. To obtain the actual respiration signal from the raw signal, ultrasound attenuation characteristics were considered. The Doppler ultrasound signal was detectable once the received signal obtained by demodulation circuits passed through a low pass filter (LPF). The signal's ripples were eliminated by moving average method and the signal's peaks were detected by phase portrait reconstruction method to measure the respiration rate.", "paper_title": "A study on a non-contacting respiration signal monitoring system using Doppler ultrasound", "paper_id": "WOS:000251097800015"}
