LiSiCA, which runs in parallel on multiple processor cores, was successfully tested on the Database of Useful Decoys Enhanced, to evaluate its ability to discriminate active molecules from decoys. We then applied LiSiCA for the discovery of novel inhibitors of human butyrylcholinesterase, a promising anti-Alzheimer target, using a known inhibitor as the reference compound. We demonstrated that LiSiCA is capable of finding potent nanomolar inhibitors, whose scaffolds differed from the reference compound, thus proving its ability for scaffold hopping and usefulness in drug discovery.", "paper_title": "LiSiCA: A Software for Ligand-Based Virtual Screening and Its Application for the Discovery of Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000360322800003"}
