Let k >= 1 be an integer. Suppose that a fire breaks out at a vertex v of G. A firefighter starts to protect vertices. At each time interval, the firefighter protects k-vertices not yet on fire. At the end of each time interval, the fire spreads to all the unprotected vertices that have a neighbour on fire. Let sn(k)(v) denote the maximum number of vertices in G that the firefighter can save when a fire breaks out at vertex nu. The k-surviving rate rho(k)(G) of G is defined to be Sigma(nu is an element of V(G)) sn(k)(nu)/n(2), which is the average proportion of saved vertices. In this paper, we investigate the surviving rate of outerplanar graphs G with n >= 2 vertices. The main results are as follows: (1) lim(n ->infinity) rho(5)(G) = 1; and (2) rho(1)(G) >= 43/81 - 5/3n + 3/n(2) if n >= 8, and rho(1)(G) >= 1/3 if n >= 2, which improves the result in [LCai, W.Wang, The surviving rate of a graph for the firefighter problem, SIAM].
