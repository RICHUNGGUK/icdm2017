From an application programmer's point of view, CAST makes it possible for operations to be executed at arbitrary locations in space, at prescribed times which may be in the future, and on remote hosts even when no end-to-end connected route exists between the initiator and target(s) of the operation. To accomplish this, CAST assumes that each host moves in space in accordance with a motion profile which is accurate but which at any given time extends into the future for a limited duration. These motion profiles are freely exchanged among hosts in the network through a gossiping protocol. Knowledge about the motion profiles of the other hosts in the network allows for source routing of operation requests and replies over disconnected routes. In this paper, we present the CAST model and its formalization. We also discuss the feasibility of realizing this model.", "paper_title": "Tuple space coordination across space and time", "paper_id": "WOS:000239479100017"}
