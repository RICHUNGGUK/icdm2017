Wavelet-based image fusion is the most common fusion method, which fuses the information from the source images in the wavelet transform domain according to some fusion rules. We specifically propose new fusion rules for fusion of low and high frequency wavelet coefficients of the source images in the second step of the wavelet-based image fusion algorithm. First, the source images are decomposed using dual-tree discrete wavelet transform (DT-DWT). Then, a fuzzy-based approach is used to fuse high frequency wavelet coefficients of the IR and visible images. Particularly, fuzzy logic is used to integrate the outputs of three different fusion rules (weighted averaging, selection using pixel-based decision map (PDM), and selection using region-based decision map (RDM)), based on a dissimilarity measure of the source images. The objective is to utilize the advantages of previous pixel-and region-based methods in a single scheme. The PDM is obtained based on local activity measurement in the DT-DWT domain of the source images. A new segmentation-based algorithm is also proposed to generate the RDM using the PDM. In addition, a new optimization-based approach using population-based optimization is proposed for the low frequency fusion rule instead of simple averaging. After fusing low and high frequency wavelet coefficients of the source images, the final fused image is obtained using the inverse DT-DWT. This new method provides improved subjective and objectives results as compared to previous image fusion methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
