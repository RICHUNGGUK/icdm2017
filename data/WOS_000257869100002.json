Distributed certification pertains to the case where several CAs are involved in issuing certificates. This also includes the case of multiattribute certification, where different CAs approve different user's attributes. In delegated certification, agents transfer certificate issuing authority in hierarchical chain. Distributed, multiattribute, and delegated certification techniques that have a low computational complexity are presented in this paper. It is shown how multiplicity aspects of the various applications are mapped into a multiplied exponents mathematical implementation of the form Pi(m)(i=1) Lambda(bi)(i) mod p, which is essentially equivalent to a single exponentiation for a moderate m. A fundamental feature of the presented procedures pertains to implementing distributed/multiattribute certification by referring to any desired subset of participating CAs.", "paper_title": "Computationally efficient distributed and delegated certification", "paper_id": "WOS:000257869100002"}
