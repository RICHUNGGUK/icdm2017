Unlike previous work on the diffusion of theories as innovations, this theory functions model differs in several important respects from the findings of previous studies that employed Everett Rogers's classic typology of \"innovation characteristics that promote diffusion.\" The model is also presented as a contribution to a more integrated theory of citation.", "paper_title": "The diffusion of theories: A functional approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000234932600005"}
