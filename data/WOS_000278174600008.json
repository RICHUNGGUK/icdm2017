Second order approximation of tool envelope surface for 5-axis machining with single point contact. Computer-Aided Design 2008;40:604-15]. Based on them, for a given tool path with single cutter contact point, a new local optimization method of tool positions is presented to maximize the machining strip width by minimizing the relative normal curvature between the tool envelope surface and the designed surface. Since the BCELTP are accurate analytical expressions, the proposed optimization method of tool positions is accurate and effective in computation. Furthermore, another new optimization method of tool positions based on a dual-parameter envelope is subsequently proposed. The most interesting point is that it will result in the same results as the method based on the BCELTP. It also proves the correctness of the method based on the BCELTP from a different angle. Finally, several examples are given to prove its effectiveness and accuracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
