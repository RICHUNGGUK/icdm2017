Inf. Theory, Vol. 50, pp. 2402-2407, 2004). Let Psi(m, k, lambda) denote the maximal possible number of sequences in an (m, k, lambda)-IRS. In this paper, a fundamental equivalence between impulse radio sequences and strictly cyclic packing having the impulse position property is established. With their relationship, the exact value of Psi(m, k, k - 1) is finally determined for any positive integers m and k", "paper_title": "Determination of the Exact Value for Psi (m, k, k-1)", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900047"}
