This result generalizes the recent deterministic logspace algorithm for S-T Connectivity on undirected graphs [Reingold, 2008]. It identifies knowledge of the stationary distribution as the gap between the S-T Connectivity problems we know how to solve in logspace (L) and those that capture all of randomized logspace (RL).", "paper_title": "S-T Connectivity on Digraphs with a Known Stationary Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000293799400003"}
