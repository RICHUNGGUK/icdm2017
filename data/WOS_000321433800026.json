The contact method solves a multi-directional Riemann-like problem at each penetrating or touching node along the contact surface. The velocity of a penetrating or touching node and the corresponding forces are explicitly calculated using the Riemann-like nodal solver. The contact method works with material strength and allows surfaces to impact, slide, and separate. Results are presented for several test problems involving both gases and materials with strength. The new contact surface approach extends the modeling capabilities of CCH. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.
