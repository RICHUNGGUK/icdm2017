The de-noising process is efficientlY accomplished for both Gaussian and Rayleigh noise distributions. Furthermore, a segmentation technique, based on gray level intensity analysis and the Moore-Neighbor contour tracing algorithm for a robust differentiation of the hemangioma area are employed. This new proposed technique is almost fully automatic, fast, and simple and its results are satisfactory. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
