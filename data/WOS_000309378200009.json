In the process mining framework, we propose a method automatically extracting the most frequent task flows from transport usage histories. Considering characteristics of our application, we use a clustering technique to identify heterogeneous groups of process instances, and then derive a process model independently by group. Process models extracted from real-world transportation logs, are verified by domain experts and labelled based on their interpretations. Consequently, we conceptualize the \"standard process\" from one global process model. Moreover, local models derived from groups of process instances reflect unknown context regarding characteristics of blocks. Our proposed method can provide conceptualized process models and process (or waiting in stockyards) times as a performance indicator. Providing reasonable answers to their questions, it helps domain experts better understand and manage the actual process. With the extension of the conventional methodology for our application problem, the main contributions of this research are that our proposed approach provides insight into the after-assembly block manufacturing process, and describes the first step for reducing transportation costs.
