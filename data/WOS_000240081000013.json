When such a web service enabled device engages in a conversation with a service provider, it becomes necessary to define an interaction logic required between them. For this purpose, one can use a choreography language to specify the rules of engagement between the device and the web service provider. This paper presents a framework for automatically synthesizing conversation protocols from a choreography description defined in WS-CDL. The proposed framework adopts WSCL as a conversation protocol language, and defines a set of rules that can be used to effectively transform a WS-CDL specification into WSCL documents for collaborating peers. It is expected that the work presented in this paper can enhance the interoperability between web service-based processes in ubiquitous systems through automating the process of extracting conversation protocols from a choreography definition.", "paper_title": "Automatic extraction of conversation protocols from a choreography specification of ubiquitous web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000013"}
