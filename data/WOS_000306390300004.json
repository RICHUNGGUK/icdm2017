This work is a natural surface-based extension of the volume-based structural approach presented in a previous paper. A multi-scale surface-based representation of individual activation maps is first computed for each subject. Then the inter-subject matching and the activation detection decision are performed jointly by optimization of a Markovian model. Finally, a significance measure is computed in a non-parametric way for the results, in order to assess their relevance and control the risk of type I error. The method is applied on simulated and real data and the results are compared to those produced by standard analyses. The surface-based structural analysis is shown to be particularly robust to inter-subject spatial variability and to produce relevant results with good specificity and sensitivity. We also demonstrate the advantages of the surface-based approach by comparing with the results of a 3D structural analysis. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
