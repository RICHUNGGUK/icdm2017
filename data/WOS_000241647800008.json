In the study of visual cryptography, pixel expansion and contrast are two important issues. Since pixel-expansion based methods encode a pixel to many pixels on each share, the size of the share is larger than that of the secret image. Therefore, they result in distortion of shares and consume more storage space. In this paper, we propose a method to reach better contrast without pixel expansion. The concept of probability is used to construct an optimization model for general access structures, and the solution space is searched by genetic algorithms. Experimental result shows that the proposed method can reach better contrast and blackness of black pixels in comparison with Ateniese et al.'s.", "paper_title": "An optimization model for visual cryptography schemes with unexpanded shares", "paper_id": "WOS:000241647800008"}
