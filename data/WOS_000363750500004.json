Such studies fall short in advising customised intervention plans based on the user type. This paper investigates perceptions of both educators and students, and tests the moderating role of user type (educators vs. students) in determining the satisfaction and continued use of the LMS. We adopted the information systems (IS) continuance model extended with ease of use and placed user type as a moderator. We test the model by collecting data from 170 educators and 233 students in a Finnish university who use a popular LMS, Moodle. Partial least squares (PLS) technique is employed to test the possible moderation effects. The PLS analysis results revealed that user type moderates most of the relationships in the extended IS continuance model such that the relationships are stronger for students than educators.", "paper_title": "The moderation effect of user-type (educators vs. students) in learning management system continuance", "paper_id": "WOS:000363750500004"}
