To address such issues, monobit sampling with Nyquist rate was introduced, and the corresponding receiver without inter-symbol interference (ISI) was obtained. In this paper, we consider the case with ISI, especially when the data rate is high, e.g. 100 mega-bits per second (Mbps). For implementation simplicity, the interference from other symbols is approximated as Gaussian noise, and thus the monobit receiver for the ISI case is obtained. To boost receiving performance, high autocorrelation training sequence is employed. The performance loss of the proposed receiver is analyzed, based on the typical Saleh-Valenzuela (S-V) model of indoor channels. The simulation and analysis results show that the proposed monobit receiver has only about 1dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) loss compared with the one without ISI, when the data rate is up to 250Mbps.", "paper_title": "Performance of Monobit Digital Receivers with Inter-Symbol Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100017"}
