Recently, to achieve the better reliability and performance, the cloud systems have been largely depending on the geographically distributed data centers. Nevertheless, the dollar cost of service placement by service providers (SP) differ from the multiple regions. Accordingly, it is crucial to design a request dispatching and resource allocation algorithm to maximize net profit. The existing algorithms are either built upon energy-efficient schemes alone, or multi-type requests and customer satisfaction oblivious. They cannot be applied to multi-type requests and customer satisfaction-aware algorithm design with the objective of maximizing net profit. This paper proposes an ant-colony optimization-based algorithm for maximizing SP's net profit (AMP) on geographically distributed data centers with the consideration of customer satisfaction. First, using model of customer satisfaction, we formulate the utility (or net profit) maximization issue as an optimization problem under the constraints of customer satisfaction and data centers. Second, we analyze the complexity of the optimal requests dispatchment problem and rigidly prove that it is an NP-complete problem. Third, to evaluate the proposed algorithm, we have conducted the comprehensive simulation and compared with the other state-of-the-art algorithms. Also, we extend our work to consider the data center's power usage effectiveness. It has been shown that AMP maximizes SP net profit by dispatching service requests to the proper data centers and generating the appropriate amount of virtual machines to meet customer satisfaction. Moreover, we also demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach when it accommodates the impacts of dynamically arrived heavy workload, various evaporation rate and consideration of power usage effectiveness.
