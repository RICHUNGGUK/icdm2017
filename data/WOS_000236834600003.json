The performance of hardware has made great progress year by year. Hence, it is important to change the architecture of cryptosystem and complicate the computation of cryptography algorithm to catch the trend of modern hardware. If the system is built with software then it is not difficult to change the architecture and complicate the computation. However, in this way, the main disadvantage is poor performance. Using hardware to design a cryptosystem is a good choice because it is highly more secure and efficient than software, but it is a fixed system that cannot be changed. So, it is an important topic to implement a flexible, secure, and efficient cryptosystem which can coordinate with novel hardware. In this article, a new method to implement cryptosystems based on hardware design is proposed. It can fast implement a new cryptosystem because it separates system into two levels: one is system architecture and the other is system algorithm. To combine different architectures and algorithms can implement varied cryptosystems. Otherwise, to split architectures and algorithms will lead to improve the security of system. An application of data transfer between stream cipher and block cipher is also implemented in this system and successfully verified the flexibility, security, and efficiency of this proposed method.
