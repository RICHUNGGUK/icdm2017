In MCC, the data processing and storage for mobile devices (MDs) is provided on the remote cloud. However, MCC faces the problem of energy efficiency caused by randomly varying channels. In this paper, by introducing the Lyapunov optimization method, we propose a combined service subscription and delivery (CSSD) algorithm that can guide the users to subscribe to services reasonably. This algorithm can also determine whether to deliver the data and to whom data is sent in the current time unit based on the queue backlog and the channel state. Numerical results validate the correctness and effectiveness of our proposed CSSD algorithm.", "paper_title": "Combined Service Subscription and Delivery Energy-Efficient Scheduling in Mobile Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900002"}
