An upper bound of pi/3-root 3/4 = 0.614... and a lower bound of root 10+2 root 5/8 = 0.475... are known for convex cases. We generalize the problem to simple nonconvex cases: in this setting we improve the upper bound to 0.583 and establish the first lower bound of 0.073. A variation is to consider rulers with at most k links. The current best convex upper bounds are (about) 0.486 for k= 3, 4 and pi/6 = 0.523... for k = 5, 6. These bounds also apply to nonconvex cases. We derive a better nonconvex upper bound of 0.296 for k= 3, 4. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
