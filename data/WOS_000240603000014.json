The method uses techniques of program slicing to examine syntax of a system modeled as a set of timed automata with discrete data, a common input formalism of model checkers dealing with time. The method is property driven. The abstraction is exact with respect to all properties expressed in the temporal logic CTL-X*.", "paper_title": "Slicing of timed automata with discrete data", "paper_id": "WOS:000240603000014"}
