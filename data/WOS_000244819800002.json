The Calculus of Fair Ambient is designed to meet these fairness principles. A labeled transition semantics for the calculus is defined to support structural investigation. The bisimulation theory of the fair ambients is studied and two coincidence results are established. An expressiveness result of the calculus is formally established by proving that it contains the pi calculus as a sub-calculus.", "paper_title": "Fair ambients", "paper_id": "WOS:000244819800002"}
