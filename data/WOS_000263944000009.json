The key features of the approach include the introduction of uncorrelated augmented matrix items into the Lyapunov functional and the use of a tighter bounding technology. In fact, these techniques lead to more general and less conservative stability conditions that guarantee a wide stability region. Our delay-dependent stability conditions thus obtained are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, some examples are included to show that the proposed criteria improve the existing results significantly.
