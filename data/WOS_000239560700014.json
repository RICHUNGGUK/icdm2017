It combines an \"easy-to-use\" free-form deformation with a Loop subdivision algorithm. The deformation method processes only on vertices of an object and permits the satisfaction of geometrical constraints given by the user. The method controls the resulting shape, defining the range (i.e. the impact) of the deformation on an object before applying it. The deformation takes into account the Loop properties to follow the subdivision scheme, allowing the user to fix some constraints at the subdivision-level he works on and to render the final object at the level he wants to. We also propose an adaptive subdivision of the object driven by the deformation influence.", "paper_title": "Generalized SCODEF deformations on subdivision surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700014"}
