Three cases, each with a different teacher role (executor-only, re-designer, co-designer) were examined. In the executor-only role, teachers implemented ready-made activities. In the re-designer role teachers collaboratively re-designed existing activities, and in the co-designer role, teachers collaboratively designed new activities. In each role, teachers implemented the learning activities. Ten teachers and ten classes participated in the three cases. Teacher perspectives about their assigned role, the practicality of the technology-rich learning activities, and co-ownership were measured using interviews. Technology integration was observed during curriculum implementation. Pupil early literacy learning outcomes were measured using a pre-test post-test quasi experimental design. Positive perspectives about the assigned role, curriculum practicality and a sense of co-ownership were found in the co-designer case. Concerns about practicality of technology activities were raised in the executor-only and re-designer cases. Teachers in the re-designer case were reserved about the role assigned to them. The extent of integration of technology-rich activities was highest in the co-designer case and lowest in the executor-only case. Significant learning gains were found for each teacher role. This study concludes that involving teachers in design of technology-rich activities positively affected teacher's perceptions and implementation, and that each teacher role (executor-only, re-designer, co-designer) contributed to the effectiveness of technology-rich activities.
