Digital content can play a crucial role in identifying the source device, such as serve as evidence in court. To achieve this goal, we use different texture feature extraction methods such as graylevel co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT), to analyze the Chinese printed source in order to find the impact of different output devices. Furthermore, we also explore the optimum feature subset by using feature selection techniques and use support vector machine (SVM) to identify the source model of the documents. The average experimental results attain a 98.64 % identification rate which is significantly superior to the existing known method of GLCM by 1.27 %. The superior testing performance demonstrates that the proposed identification method is very useful for source laser printer identification.", "paper_title": "Digital forensics of printed source identification for Chinese characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200046"}
