We distinguish this research by focusing on the interactions between local and architectural impulses in the form of designer mistakes and dissolution, division, and combination impulses, respectively, for a distributed design case study. We provide statistical support for the \"parallel character hypothesis,\"which asserts that parallel arrangements generally best mitigate dissolution and division impulses. We find that local impulses tend to slow convergence, but systems also subjected to dissolution or division impulses still favor parallel arrangements. We statistically uphold the conclusion that the strategy to mitigate combination impulses is unaffected by the presence of local impulses.", "paper_title": "Exploring the effectiveness of parallel systems in distributed design processes subjected to stochastic disruptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000346331800008"}
