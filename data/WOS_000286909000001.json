Accuracy and consistency of information exchanged through coupling interface between the independent CFD and CSD solvers plays a central role in the simulation and prediction of FSI phenomenon, like flutter. In this paper validation of an implemented coupling interface methodology is presented for subsonic, transonic and near supersonic mach regime. The test case chosen for this purpose is the flutter of AGARD445.6 standard I-wing weakened model configuration for subsonic to near transonic flow regime. Gambit (R) and Fluent (R) are used for CFD grid generation and solution of fluid dynamic equations, respectively. CSD modeling and simulation are provided by numerical time integration of modal dynamic equations derived through the finite element modeling in ANSYS (R) environment.
