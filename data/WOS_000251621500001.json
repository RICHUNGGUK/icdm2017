The technique, providing a new interpretation for prioritized logic programs, is inspired by the semantics of Prioritized Logic Programming and enriched with the use of structural information of preference of Answer Set Optimization Programming. Specifically, the analysis of the logic program is carried out together with the analysis of preferences in order to determine the choice order and the sets of comparable models. The new semantics is compared models. The new semantics is compared with order approaches known in the literature and complexity analysis is also performed, showing that, with respect to other similar approaches previously proposed, the complexity of computing preferred stable models does not increase.", "paper_title": "On the semantics of logic programs with preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000251621500001"}
