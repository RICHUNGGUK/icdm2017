The test-retest reliability was good to excellent in both groups, with higher level of test-retest reliability in more demanding conditions. The most reliable time-domain variables for standing on firm surface with eyes open were: sway area from principal components (ICC = 0.77) for young and mean velocity, medio-lateral and total path lengths (ICC = 0.91) for elderly. For eyes closed, the most reliable variables were antero-posterior path length and sway area calculated by Fourier coefficients (ICC = 0.85) for young and medio-lateral path length (ICC = 0.93) for elderly. For compliant surface with open eyes, the most reliable variable was medio-lateral variability (ICC = 0.83) for young and total path length and mean velocity (ICC = 0.92) for elderly participants, whereas for eyes closed the most reliable variables were mean velocity, total and medio-lateral path lengths for young, and mean velocity for elderly group, all with ICC = 0.90. Modified sensory interaction test is therefore a reliable measure for balance and could be recommended as an outcome measure for balance retraining programmes.", "paper_title": "Reliability of modified sensory interaction test as measured with force platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000354638300005"}
