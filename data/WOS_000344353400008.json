In order to facilitate component development and system integration of the mobile service robots, a middleware-based simulation and control framework for system integration and application development, as well as the robotic functional component (RFC) framework with a simplified structure and an efficient transmission scheme, is proposed for mobile service robot systems. Designed to implement a distributed modular mechanism for a mobile service robot, the middleware-based framework for simulation and control is comprised of four layers: low-level abstraction layer, communication layer, high-level abstraction layer, and application layer. Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) and Robot Technology Middleware (RTM) are employed as middleware for the development of RFCs and for system integration. Communication between the components and the graphical programming tool is done by the communication layer (CORBA ORB). The conducted experiments validated the proposed framework in terms of ideal performance of reusability, interoperability, and extensibility, as well as indicated that the proposed RFC framework is simplified and easy enough to perform well in data transmission, which will reduce the costs and the threshold of robot development.", "paper_title": "A Middleware-Based Simulation and Control Framework for Mobile Service Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000344353400008"}
