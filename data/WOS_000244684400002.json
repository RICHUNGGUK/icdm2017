In the 80ies the first construction robots appeared on sites and in the 90ies integrated automated building construction sites had been developped and implemented about 20 times. Furthermore maintenance robots for cleaning and inspection of buildings, infrastructure and real estate and safety robots guarding buildings had been developped. In the first decade of this century humanoid construction robots had been tested. In the future service robots will be a big market in the built envrironment.", "paper_title": "Construction robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000244684400002"}
