First, we extend some particular types of filters and fuzzy filters in BL-algebras and MTL-algebras naturally to general residuated lattices, and further enumerate some relative results obtained in BL-algebras or MTL-algebras, which still hold in general residuated lattices. Next, we introduce the concepts of regular filters and fuzzy regular filters to general residuated lattices, which are two new types of filters and fuzzy filters, and derive some of their characterizations. Finally, we discuss the relations between (fuzzy) regular filters and several other special (fuzzy) filters, and also characterize some special classes of residuated lattices by filters or fuzzy filters.
