Among measurement-based quantum computation methods the recently introduced one-way quantum computer [RB01] stands out as basic and fundamental. In this work we a concrete syntax and an algebra of these patterns derived from a formal semantics. We developed a rewrite theory and proved a general standardization theorem which allows all patterns to be put in a semantically equivalent standard form.", "paper_title": "The one way to quantum computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900002"}
