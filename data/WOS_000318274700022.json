The detailed spatial configurations are proposed for the three inclusion complexes based on 2D NMR method. ROESY experiments confirm the inclusion of guest molecules inside the alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CD) cavity. On the other hand, the host-guest ratio observed was 2:1 for three complexes. The detailed spatial configuration proposed based on 2D NMR methods were further interpreted using molecular modeling studies. The theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data.", "paper_title": "Structural elucidation of supramolecular alpha-cyclodextrin dimer/aliphatic monofunctional molecules complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000318274700022"}
