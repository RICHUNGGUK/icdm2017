In particular, a game theory based on quality of service (QoS) for multimedia users is introduced to deal with the fairness of network resource allocation in wireless networks. Moreover, the channel states of wireless users are additionally regarded under the cross-layer design in WiMAX environment. In details, the bargaining solution is adopted to discover the efficient and fair resource allocation strategy for multimedia service in considering QoS in the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the channel states in the carrier-to-interface ratio (CINR). The proposed mechanism is illustrated and evaluated by simulation results of transmitting video sequences in WiMAX environment.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Approach to Fair Resource Allocation for Multimedia Service in WiMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000285646500002"}
