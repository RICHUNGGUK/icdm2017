Moreover, the current technology of System-on-Chip makes great demands on the accurate testing of internal timing parameters as access to internal nodes through input/output pins becomes more difficult. This work presents two high-resolution time measurement schemes for digital Built-in Self-Test (BIST) applications, namely: Two-Delay Interpolation Method and the Time Amplifier. The two schemes are subsequently combined to produce a novel design for BIST time measurement which offers two main advantages: a small time interval measurement capability which advances the state of the art and a small footprint, occupying 0.2 mm(2) or equivalent to 3020 transistors, compared with a recent design which has the equivalent of 4800 transistors.", "paper_title": "Embedded high-resolution delay measurement system using time amplification", "paper_id": "WOS:000246462300003"}
