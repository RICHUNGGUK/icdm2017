Grounded in early explorations of organic user interfaces (OUIs), this paper examines the evolving relationship between industrial and interaction designs and examines how not only what we design is changing, but how we design too. First, we discuss how (and why) to better support the design of OUIs: how supporting sketching, a fundamental activity of many design fields, is increasingly critical and why a 'hypercontextualized' approach to their design can reduce the drawbacks met when everyday objects become interactive. Finally, underlying both these points is the maturation of technology to that of a computational material; when interactive hardware is seamlessly melded into an object's shape, the 'computer' disappears and is better seen as a basic design material that, incidentally, happens to have interactive behavior.", "paper_title": "The Design of Organic User interfaces: Shape, Sketching and Hypercontext", "paper_id": "WOS:000316035800003"}
