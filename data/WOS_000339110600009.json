Motivated by the relatively high percentage of occurrence of base consonants in the script, a reevaluation technique has been proposed to correct any ambiguities arising in the base consonants. Secondly, a dynamic time-warping method is proposed to automatically extract the discriminative regions for each set of confused characters. Class-specific features derived from these regions aid in reducing the degree of confusion. Thirdly, statistics of specific features are proposed for resolving any confusions in vowel modifiers. The reevaluation approaches are tested on two databases (a) the isolated Tamil symbols in the IWFHR test set, and (b) the symbols segmented from a set of 10,000 Tamil words. The recognition rate of the isolated test symbols of the IWFHR database improves by 1.9 %. For the word database, the incorporation of the reevaluation step improves the symbol recognition rate by 3.5 % (from 88.4 to 91.9 %). This, in turn, boosts the word recognition rate by 11.9 % (from 65.0 to 76.9 %). The reduction in the word error rate has been achieved using a generic approach, without the incorporation of language models.", "paper_title": "Performance enhancement of online handwritten Tamil symbol recognition with reevaluation techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000339110600009"}
