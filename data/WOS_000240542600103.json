In this paper, we study the economy-based approach, i.e., portfolio selection, to realize the dynamic allocation of distributed and heterogeneous resources. The portfolio selection method emphasizes the mean-variance model, which can evaluate the final return and help the scheduler to adjust the allocation policy. We present the practical algorithms for network nodes and Bloom filter-based surveillance, which can support the efficient adjustment of a scheduler.", "paper_title": "Scalable resources portfolio selection with fairness based on economical methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600103"}
