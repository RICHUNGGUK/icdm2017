Our method is based on dynamic relocation of module positions during runtime, with only very little reconfiguration overhead; the objective is to maximize the length of contiguous free space that is available for new modules. We describe a number of algorithmic aspects of good defragmentation, and present an optimization method based on tabu search. Experimental results indicate that we can improve the quality of module layout by roughly 50% over the static layout. Among other benefits, this improvement avoids unnecessary rejections of modules.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Defragmentation of Reconfigurable Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000305864100002"}
