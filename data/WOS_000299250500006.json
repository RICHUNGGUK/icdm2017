Reconvergent fan-out nodes (RFONs) within combinational subcircuits are a major source of topological correlation. We identify two more sources of topological correlation in clocked sequential circuit: sequential RFONs, which are nodes within a clock network where the clock paths to more than one flip-flop branch out; and sequential branch-points, which are nodes within a combinational block where combinational paths to more than one capturing flip-flop branch out. Dealing with all sources of correlation is unacceptably complicated, and we therefore show how to sample a handful of correlation sources without sacrificing significant accuracy in the yield. A further reduction in computation time can be obtained by sampling only those nodes that are likely to affect the yield. These techniques are applied to yield analysis using statistical static timing analysis based on discrete random variables and also to yield analysis based on Monte Carlo simulation; the accuracy and efficiency of both methods are assessed using example circuits. The sequential RFONs suggest that timing yield may be improved by optimizing the clock network, and we address this possibility.", "paper_title": "SAMPLING CORRELATION SOURCES FOR TIMING YIELD ANALYSIS OF SEQUENTIAL CIRCUITS WITH CLOCK NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000299250500006"}
