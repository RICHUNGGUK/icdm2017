Cloud services provide great conveniences for the users to enjoy the on-demand cloud applications without considering the local infrastructure limitations. During the data accessing, different users may be in a collaborative relationship, and thus data sharing becomes significant to achieve productive benefits. The existing security solutions mainly focus on the authentication to realize that a user's privative data cannot be illegally accessed, but neglect a subtle privacy issue during a user challenging the cloud server to request other users for data sharing. The challenged access request itself may reveal the user's privacy no matter whether or not it can obtain the data access permissions. In this paper, we propose a shared authority based privacy-preserving authentication protocol (SAPA) to address above privacy issue for cloud storage. In the SAPA, 1) shared access authority is achieved by anonymous access request matching mechanism with security and privacy considerations (e.g., authentication, data anonymity, user privacy, and forward security); 2) attribute based access control is adopted to realize that the user can only access its own data fields; 3) proxy re-encryption is applied to provide data sharing among the multiple users. Meanwhile, universal composability (UC) model is established to prove that the SAPA theoretically has the design correctness. It indicates that the proposed protocol is attractive for multi-user collaborative cloud applications.", "paper_title": "Shared Authority Based Privacy-Preserving Authentication Protocol in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206700023"}
