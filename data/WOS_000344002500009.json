Backup resources, however, can remain unused most of the time while the network is not in failure condition, inducing high power consumption wastage, if fully powered on. In this paper, we highlight the power consumption wastage of the additional resources for survivability in IP/multi-protocol label switching (MPLS) over dense wavelength division multiplexing multi-layer optical networks. We assume MPLS protection switching as the failure recovery mechanism in the network, a solution interesting for current network operators to ensure fast recovery as well as fine-grained recovery treatment per label switched path. Next, we quantitatively show how elastic optical technologies can effectively reduce such a power consumption by dynamically adjusting the data rate of the transponders to the carried amount of traffic.", "paper_title": "Power consumption reduction through elastic data rate adaptation in survivable multi-layer optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000344002500009"}
