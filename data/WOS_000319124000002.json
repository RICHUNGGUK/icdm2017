The number of nodes that can be vaccinated at a single time-step is typically one, or more generally O(1). In a nonstandard model, the so called spreading model, the vaccinations also spread in contrast to the standard model. Our main results are concerned with general graphs in the spreading model. We provide a very simple exact 2(O(root n log n))-time algorithm. In the special case of trees, where the standard and spreading model are equivalent, our algorithm is substantially simpler than that exact subexponential algorithm for trees presented in Ref. 2. On the other hand, we show that the firefighter problem on weighted directed graphs in the spreading model cannot be approximated within a constant factor better than 1 - 1/e unless NP subset of DTIME (n(O(log log n))) We also present several results in the standard model. We provide approximation algorithms for planar graphs in case when at least two vaccinations can be performed at a time-step. We also derive trade-offs between approximation factors for polynomial-time solutions and the time complexity of exact or nearly exact solutions for instances of the fireifighter problem for the so called directed layered graphs.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS MORE EFFICIENT INFECTION AND FIRE FIGHTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000319124000002"}
