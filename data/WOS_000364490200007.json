This paper considers the allocation of network error correction flow on a network that consists of disjoint paths from the source node to the destination node. Specifically, we propose an algorithm of allocating the path-flows to support the given rate with minimum cost. Our analysis shows that the asymptotic time complexity of this algorithm is linearithmic, and this algorithm is optimal in general.", "paper_title": "Allocation of Network Error Correction Flow on Disjoint Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000364490200007"}
