Thus, a novel cognitive radio resource management (RRM) is proposed to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency. An optimization framework for RRM is developed that makes the following contributions: (i) considering heterogeneous primary users (PUs) with multiple features stored in a radio environment map database, (ii) allowing variable CR demands, (iii) assuring interference protection towards PUs. After showing that the optimal solution is computationally infeasible, a suboptimal solution is consequently proposed. Performance evaluation is conducted in terms of total achieved data rate and satisfaction of CR requirements.", "paper_title": "Cognitive radio resource management exploiting heterogeneous primary users and a radio environment map database", "paper_id": "WOS:000321974700012"}
