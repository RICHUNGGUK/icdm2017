Results: We show how to correct for this bias almost entirely by means of a 'consolidation' algorithm for detecting and suitably transforming identifiable regions of fractionation. We characterize the process of fractionation and the performance of the algorithm through realistic simulations. We apply our method to a number of core eudicot genomes, we and by studying the fractionation regions detected, are able to address topical issues in polyploid evolution.", "paper_title": "Fractionation, rearrangement and subgenome dominance", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532300015"}
