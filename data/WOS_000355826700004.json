In the present study, we used virtual reality to enhance the effects of covert sensitization. The aim was to verify the effectiveness of virtual covert sensitization treatment in reducing heavy social drinkers' alcohol craving. The explicit and implicit measurements included a self-report questionnaire, alcohol-Implicit Association Test, eye-tracking test, and alcohol-Stroop test. To determine the baseline, we measured the alcohol craving in heavy social drinkers (N = 20) and light drinkers (N = 20). Furthermore, virtual covert sensitization treatment was administered to each participant for 10 min. Afterward, the same measurements as at baseline were repeated. Despite the one-time nature of the administered treatment, our results confirm the effectiveness of virtual covert sensitization based on the participants' changed implicit craving and explicit, self-reported craving. Therefore, virtual covert sensitization may be an effective intervention technique for alcohol addiction treatment.", "paper_title": "The effect of virtual covert sensitization on reducing alcohol craving in heavy social drinkers", "paper_id": "WOS:000355826700004"}
