This work focuses on codes carved from binary product lattices. Defined as such, an intriguing problem is that of effectively mapping independent data sequences onto a selected subset of lattice points. A novel approach is disclosed yielding an explicit connection between source bits and lattice points. Decoding methods typically used for binary product codes do not apply for product lattices. Several alternative decoding approaches are discussed. In particular, a provably bounded-distance decoder is presented. It relies on the fact that a product lattice code point may be regarded as a two-dimensional array whose rows and columns are points in the component lattices. The obtained results are compared with classical lattices known in the art.", "paper_title": "Encoding and decoding binary product lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000242503300021"}
