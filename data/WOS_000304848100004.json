The lack of a scalable matching algorithm operating on detailed execution paths motivates the search for an alternative solution. This paper proposes the use of word entropies for the classification of software traces. Using a well-studied defective software as an example, we investigate the application of both Shannon and extended entropies (Landsberg-Vedral, Renyi and Tsallis) to the classification of traces related to various software defects. Our study shows that using entropy measures for comparisons gives an efficient and scalable method for comparing traces. The three extended entropies, with parameters chosen to emphasize rare events, all perform similarly and are superior to the Shannon entropy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
