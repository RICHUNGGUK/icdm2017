Using synthetically generated data sets with randomly distributed line segments and hard test cases with highly symmetric line patterns, as well as real remote sensing images, the developed algorithm is shown to be computationally fast, highly robust, capable of handling severely corrupted data sets with considerable line segment position errors as well as significant fragmented and spurious line segments in the images to be matched.
