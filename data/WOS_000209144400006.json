It can support a Client/Server based local network and serial communications. It can also integrate tube design, process planning, virtual and physical manufacturing around the core of engineering databases with different formats. This system solves three problems in integrated tube design and bending: (1) automatic process planning, (2) estimation of the feasibility of bending and (3) the impact of springback and extension. The industrial applications of this system show that it can decrease the cost of bending and increase the bending efficiency.", "paper_title": "Computer-integrated manufacturing system for tube bending", "paper_id": "WOS:000209144400006"}
