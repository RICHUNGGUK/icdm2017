In this paper, we study the problem on unit disk graph. A polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for MWCVC is presented under the condition that the graph is c-local.", "paper_title": "PTAS for minimum weighted connected vertex cover problem with c-local condition in unit disk graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000296520200014"}
