All these languages - matrix descriptions, stochastic Petri nets, stoichiometric equations, stochastic process algebras, and guarded command models - describe continuous-time Markov chains, but they differ according to important properties, such as compositionality, expressiveness and succinctness, executability, and ease of use. Moreover, they provide different support for checking the well-formedness of a model and for analyzing a model.", "paper_title": "FORMALISMS FOR SPECIFYING MARKOVIAN POPULATION MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000291552600005"}
