This study presents a resistant learning procedure for coping with outliers via single-hidden layer feed-forward neural network (SLFN). The smallest trimmed sum of squared residuals principle is adopted as the guidance of the proposed procedure, and key mechanisms are: an analysis mechanism that excludes any potential outliers at early stages of the process, a modeling mechanism that deduces enough hidden nodes for fitting the reference observations, an estimating mechanism that tunes the associated weights of SLFN, and a deletion diagnostics mechanism that checks to see if the resulted SLFN is stable. The lake data set is used to demonstrate the resistant-learning performance of the proposed procedure.", "paper_title": "A resistant learning procedure for coping with outliers", "paper_id": "WOS:000278087300003"}
