The framework also provides support to carry out full experimental studies, which can be configured and executed by using jMetal's graphical interface. Other features include the automatic generation of statistical information of the obtained results, and taking advantage of the current availability of multi-core processors to speed-up the running time of the experiments. In this work, we include two case studies to illustrate the use of jMetal in both solving a problem with a metaheuristic and designing and performing an experimental study. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
