Such storage servers are used as web servers or multimedia servers, for handling high demand for data. As the system is running, to exhibit good performance, it needs to respond dynamically to changes in demand for different data items. There are known algorithms for mapping demand to a layout. When the demand changes, a new layout can be computed. In this work we study the data migration problem, which arises when we need to change one layout to another quickly. This problem has been studied earlier where for each disk a new layout has been prescribed. However, to apply these algorithms effectively, we identify another problem that we refer to as the correspondence problem, whose solution has a significant impact on the overall solution for the data migration problem. We study algorithms for the data migration problem in more detail and identify variations of the basic algorithm that seem to improve performance in practice, even though some of the variations have poor worst-case behavior.", "paper_title": "Data migration on parallel disks: Algorithms and evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237119800009"}
