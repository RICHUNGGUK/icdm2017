In an attempt to reduce developing times and costs, conventional design and manufacturing procedures are being changed. Finite element simulations have proved to be a good help in the design and analysis of these processes. The main problem of these simulations is that they are quite difficult to perform and that there are several non-trivial questions that the user has to answer before achieving a good model. In this work, a new application has been designed. It combines the usability of a custom application with the power of such a tool as the finite element method. To design this application, a lot of questions regarding FEM simulation of stamping processes have been analyzed. The result is a methodology to automate simulations of stamping processes where the user does not need to have deep knowledge of the finite element software. Such methodology has been successfully employed in a Spanish manufacturing industry of automotive components.", "paper_title": "Expert system for simulation of metal sheet stamping", "paper_id": "WOS:000271397800008"}
