The local mean is calculated by using the data points near the margin with different weights. The more contributions to the margin information, the larger weights the data points have. By making use of the weighting strategy and local mean, WMDA simultaneously utilizes the marginal information and local structure which are important for discriminative feature extraction. Experiments on the artificial and real database show that the proposed WMDA is superior to other related methods.", "paper_title": "Weighted marginal discriminant analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400002"}
