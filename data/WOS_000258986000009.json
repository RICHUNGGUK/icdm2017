In this paper, we note that certain GP networks are isomorphic to suitably constructed PRC rings, while other varieties correspond to PRC rings that closely approximate their topological and performance attributes. In the absence of equivalence and similarity proofs in the opposite direction, our results indicate that PRC rings may be preferable to GP networks in the sense of covering a broader family of networks and offering greater flexibility in cost-performance tradeoffs.
