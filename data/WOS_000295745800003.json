We modify two speech coding standards by replacing their original quantizers for line spectral frequencies (LSF's) and/or Fourier magnitudes quantization with TSVQ-based quantizers. The modified coders are fine-granular bit-rate scalable with gradual change in quality for the synthetic speech. A fast search encoding algorithm using multistage tree-structured vector quantization (MTVQ) is proposed for quantization of LSF's. The proposed method is compared to the multipath sequential tree-assisted search (MSTS) and to the well known multipath sequential search (MSS) or M-L search algorithms. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
