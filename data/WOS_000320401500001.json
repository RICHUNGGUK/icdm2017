As a Hirsch-type index, phi was expected to be consistent with Schubert-Glanzel's model of h-index. Schubert demonstrated this relationship with the 34 awardees of the Hevesy medal in the field of nuclear and radiochemistry (r (2) = 0.8484). In this paper, we upscale this study by testing the phi-index on a million researchers in computer science. We found that the Schubert-Glanzel's model correlates with the million empirical phi values (r (2) = 0.8695). In addition, machine learning through symbolic regression produces models whose accuracy does not exceed a 6.1 % gain (r (2) = 0.9227). These results suggest that the Schubert-Glanzel's model of phi-index is accurate and robust on the domain-wide bibliographic dataset of computer science.", "paper_title": "Experimenting with the partnership ability phi-index on a million computer scientists", "paper_id": "WOS:000320401500001"}
