This article introduces an elastoplastic spring-mass model for the analysis of multi-barge flotillas colliding with bridge piers at zero angle of attack. The model accounts for the essential factors pertaining to barge/flotilla impacts, such as pier geometry and stiffness, and dynamic interaction between barges. A method to identify the elastoplastic behavior of barge crushing is also presented. The proposed method generates impact force time-histories for a multitude of flotilla configurations in a matter of minutes, which is especially valuable in probabilistic analysis requiring many collision simulations. The results from this study are compatible with the respective impact time-histories produced by exhaustive finite element simulations. A bridge pier impacted by a three-barge and a 15-barge flotilla is studied.", "paper_title": "One-dimensional model for multi-barge flotillas impacting bridge piers", "paper_id": "WOS:000256718900003"}
