For MOEA, Robust Multi-Objective Optimisation Platform (RMOP) developed at CIMNE is used. For the active shock control bump design, two different optimisation methods are considered; the first method is a Pareto-Game based Genetic Algorithm in RMOP (denoted as RMOGA). The second method uses a Hybridised RMOGA with Game-Strategies and a parallel computation for high performance computation. Numerical results show not only how the concept of Shock Control Bump (SCB) coupled to CFD can improve aerodynamic performance of classic transonic aerofoil at the variability of flight conditions but also how high performance (parallel/distributed) computation with applying Hybrid-Game increases the efficiency of optimisation in terms of computational cost and results accuracy.
