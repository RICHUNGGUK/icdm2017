The package has been rewritten in C language, the algorithm has been parallelized and implemented using OpenCL. This makes the program convenient to run on platforms with Graphical Processing Units (GPUs). Improvements include also some modifications/optimizations of the original algorithm. A considerable improvement in the performance of the code has been achieved. A new tool called input_structure has been added which helps the user to make the data input and conversion more easier and universal.", "paper_title": "CAVE-CL: An OpenCL version of the package for detection and quantitative analysis of internal cavities in a system of overlapping balls: Application to proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000351645900017"}
