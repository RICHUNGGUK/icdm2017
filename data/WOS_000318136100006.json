Waste EEE (WEEE) has an adverse impact on the environment. Therefore, it is important to reduce the quantity of WEEE through recycling. While attempting to improve the recycling rate of WEEE by enhancing the disassembly processes, two issues must be considered simultaneously-economy and safety. In this paper, a Petri Net (PN) based analysis approach is proposed to deal with the disassembly and recycling problems in End-Of-Life (EOL) WEEE. By using the PN analysis, the optimal tradeoff between the cost and environmental effectiveness of the disassembly processes is determined. A case study is used to illustrate the proposed analysis method. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
