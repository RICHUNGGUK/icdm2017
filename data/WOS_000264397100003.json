Unlike existing objective no-reference image sharpness/blurriness metrics, the proposed metric is able to predict the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content. Results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed perceptual-based sharpness metric. These results show that the proposed sharpness metric correlates well with the perceived sharpness being able to predict with high accuracy the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content.", "paper_title": "A No-Reference Objective Image Sharpness Metric Based on the Notion of Just Noticeable Blur (JNB)", "paper_id": "WOS:000264397100003"}
