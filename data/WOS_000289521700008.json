The curve is given by a polynomial equation f(X,Y)=0. Two algorithms in this area are from Snyder (1992) SIGGRAPH Comput. Graphics, 26(2), 121 and Plantinga and Vegter (2004) In Proc. Eurographics Symposium on Geometry Processing, pp. 245-254. We introduce a new algorithm that combines the advantages of these two algorithms: like Snyder, we use the parameterizability criterion for subdivision, and like Plantinga and Vegter, we exploit nonlocal isotopy. We further extend our algorithm in two important and practical directions: first, we allow subdivision cells to be rectangles with arbitrary but bounded aspect ratios. Second, we extend the input domains to be regions R (0) with arbitrary geometry and which might not be simply connected. Our algorithm halts as long as the curve has no singularities in the region, and intersects the boundary of R (0) transversally. Our algorithm is practical and easy to implement exactly. We report some very encouraging experimental results, showing that our algorithms can be much more efficient than the algorithms of Plantinga-Vegter and Snyder.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Isotopic Approximation of Nonsingular Curves: the Parameterizability and Nonlocal Isotopy Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000289521700008"}
