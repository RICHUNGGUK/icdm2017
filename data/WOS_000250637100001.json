We first describe a framework for distributed job workflow execution over the Grid: the Mobile Code Collaboration Framework (MCCF). Based on the study of agent communications during a job workflow execution on MCCF, we identify the unnecessary agent communications that degrade the system performance. Then, we design a novel subjob grouping algorithm for preprocessing the job workflow's static specification in MCCF. The obtained information is used in both static and dynamic algorithms to identify partners for agent communication. The mobile agent dynamic location and communication based on this approach is expected to reduce the agent communication overhead by removing unnecessary communication partners during the dynamic job workflow execution. The proof of the dynamic algorithm's correctness and effectiveness are elaborated. Finally, the algorithms are evaluated through a comparison study using simulated job workflows executed on a prototype implementation of the MCCF on a LAN environment and an emulated WAN setup. The results show the scalability and efficiency of the algorithms as well as the advantages of the dynamic algorithm over the static one. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
