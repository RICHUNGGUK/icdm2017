Focusing on the notion of 'observability', this paper aims to entrust the complex space with physical and computational meaning. In the light of quaternions, the efficiency of the Grover search algorithm finds its source in that \"paradoxical situation\".", "paper_title": "Through the Looking Glass: What Computation Found There", "paper_id": "WOS:000299026600005"}
