This study investigates several issues, associated with the assessment of bridge flutter. These include: influence of turbulence modeling, simulated by random perturbation to the span-wise correlation length of buffeting loads; effects of errors in the motion-induced or aeroelastic loads. The study makes use of random differential equations and numerically evaluates two-mode flutter by means of stochastic stability beyond mean squares through Moment Lyapunov Exponents. The development and implementation of a numerical algorithm are presented. Results, obtained for two simplified bridge examples, are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
