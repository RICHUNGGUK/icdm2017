Our solution consists of two phases. First, we propose three algorithms embedded in the system to arrange the travel routes and accommodations for customers. Second, we use mining techniques to extract the most interesting knowledge contained in the database. This implementation provides more convenient services and more useful information than other traditional travel agencies.", "paper_title": "Implementation for the arrangement and mining analysis of travel schedules", "paper_id": "WOS:000234908900007"}
