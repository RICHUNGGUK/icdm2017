Queries submitted to search engines are by nature ambiguous and constitute a significant proportion of the instances given to web search engines. Ambiguous queries pose real challenges for the web search engines due to versatility of information. Temporal based approaches whereas somehow reduce the uncertainty in queries but still lack to provide results according to users aspirations. Web search science has created an interest for the researchers to incorporate contextual information for resolving the uncertainty in search results. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Disambiguation Approach (ADA) of hybrid nature that makes use of both the temporal and contextual information to improve user experience. The proposed hybrid approach presents the search results to the users based on their location and temporal information. A Java based prototype of the systems is developed and evaluated using standard dataset to determine its efficacy in terms of precision, accuracy, recall, and F1-measure. Supported by experimental results, ADA demonstrates better results along all the axes as compared to temporal based approaches.", "paper_title": "A Hybrid Query Disambiguation Adaptive Approach for Web Information Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000358997000008"}
