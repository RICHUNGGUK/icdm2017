A novel two-step algorithm based on integrated product information model is put forward to analyze the reusability of design resources. First, the global shape ignoring the interior details is compared with check if they belong to the same category. Then, the detailed feature shape is compared with catch, the exact reusable design resources. Finally, a case study proves that the proposed method has higher accuracy.
