A novel fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities (criteria weights and scores of alternatives) from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is also proposed. The applicability of the proposed model is demonstrated in a government purchase digital video recorder (DVR) system project study. The stability tests indicate the advantages of the proposal model in determining the value of model. Importantly, the proposed model can provide decision makers a reference material, making it highly applicable for academic and commercial purposes. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
