In our experimentation by fMRI, we specially refer to two goals. The first goal was to show the difference between the activation areas related to several kinds of ambiguities. The second goal was to reveal the difference of the activation areas related to ambiguity resolution. In result, there are activations in not only the left temporal lobe but also right hemisphere, more particularly the right frontal lobe and the right temporal lobe.", "paper_title": "Semantic activation and cortical areas related to the lexical ambiguity and idiomatic ambiguity", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100033"}
