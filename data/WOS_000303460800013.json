This raises the demand for methods to adapt the system design to application-specific needs. Our approach considers (1) trade-offs regarding the hardware infrastructure and (2) trade-offs in the software design. For the underlying model we categorize events along the dimensions of temporal complexity and physical distribution. This yields a categorization of events that drives trade-offs in the infrastructure design. The presented model supports design decisions in dependence on application-specific event properties and design goals.", "paper_title": "Modeling trade-offs in the design of sensor-based event processing infrastructures", "paper_id": "WOS:000303460800013"}
