Previous work has been mostly limited to higher-dimensional rasters and hierarchies of trees, which grow exponentially with the dimension. As representations with limited topological relationships quickly become intractable in higher dimensions, a topological vector approach seems most suitable for this purpose, requiring the use of higher-dimensional topological data structures. We therefore present in this paper an evaluation and classification of the possible data structures for an nD GIS, including how they can be implemented to support real-world data aspects, such as holes, disconnected components and attributes, as well as practical issues that affect their feasibility, like the availability of algorithms, libraries and software.", "paper_title": "An evaluation and classification of nD topological data structures for the representation of objects in a higher-dimensional GIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000355680500007"}
