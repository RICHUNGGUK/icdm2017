Comparing with conventional genetic algorithm, the proposed method is able to realize three goals simultaneously, i.e., maximizing the alignment recall, the alignment precision and the F-measure and find the optimal solutions which could avoid bias to recall or precision value. Experiment results show that the proposed approach is effective.", "paper_title": "Optimizing Ontology Alignments by using NSGA-II", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567700009"}
