The numerical model is combined with a wave propagation model, a multiple wave-breaking model, a wave-induced current model and a pollutant convection-dispersion model. The wave propagation model is based on the higher-order approximation of parabolic mild-slope equation which can be used to simulate the wave refraction, diffraction and breaking in a large area of near-shore zone combined with the wave-breaking model. The wave-induced current model is established using the concept of the radiation stress and considering the effect of bottom resistance caused by waves. The numerical model is verified by laboratory experiment results of regular and irregular waves over two mild beaches with different slopes. The numerical results agree well with experimental results. The numerical model has been applied in the near-shore zone of Bohai bay in China. It is concluded that pollutant transport parallel to the shoreline due to the action of waves, which will induce serious pollution on the beach.
