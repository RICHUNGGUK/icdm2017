In the LDE framework, the neighbor and class of data points are used to construct the graph embedding for classification problems. From a high dimensional to a low dimensional subspace, data points of the same class maintain their intrinsic neighbor relations, whereas neighboring data points of different classes no longer stick to one another. But, neighboring data points of different classes are not deemphasized efficiently by LDE and it may degrade the performance of classification. In this paper, we investigate its extension, called class mean embedding (CME), using class mean of data points to enhance its discriminant power in their mapping into a low dimensional space. After joined class mean data points, (1) CME may cause each class of data points to be more compact in the high dimension space; (2) CME may increase the quantity of data points, and solves the small sample size (SSS) problem; (3) CME may preserve well the local geometry of the data manifolds in the embedding space. Experimental results on ORL, Yale, AR, and FERET face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Class mean embedding for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000298332400003"}
