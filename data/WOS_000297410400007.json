Let G be a directed graph, and let k be a positive integer. Associate with each vertex v of G an independent, uniformly random k-dimensional complex vector x(v) of unit length. We define q(G; k) to be the expected value of the product, over all edges (u, v), of the inner product < x(u), x(v)>. We show that q(G; k) is proportional to G's cycle partition polynomial, and therefore that computing q(G; k) is #P-complete for any k > 1. We also study the natural variants that arise when the xv are real or drawn from the Gaussian distribution.", "paper_title": "A Graph Integral Formulation of the Circuit Partition Polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000297410400007"}
