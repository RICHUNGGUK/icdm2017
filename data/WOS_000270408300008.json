This is achieved by the application of dynamic coarse-fine grooming to route multiple reflective optical network units of either time-or wavelength-multiplexed PONs collectively through coarse passbands of an arrayed waveguide grating (AWG). To evaluate experimentally the contribution of the excessive properties of wider-than-dense-passband AWGs to network performance, a readily available 2.7 nm device is utilized to substitute for 7 nm coarse-AWG prototypes. Experimental results have confirmed 10(-9) bidirectional transmission of data and continuous waves over 2.7-nm-wide passband windows of the AWG in the presence of 0.35 nm polarization-dependent wavelength shift and 1.5 dB polarization-dependent loss. In addition, Rayleigh backscattering is reported to be incapable of limiting the network performance.", "paper_title": "Demonstration of Coarse-Fine Grooming in Coarse-WDM-Routed PONs", "paper_id": "WOS:000270408300008"}
