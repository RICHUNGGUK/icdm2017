Articles accrue information through the asynchronous editing of users who arrive both seeking information and possibly able to contribute information. Most articles stabilize to high-quality, trusted sources of information representing the collective wisdom of all the users who edited the article. We propose a model for information growth which relies on two main observations: (i) as an article's quality improves, it attracts visitors at a faster rate (a rich-get-richer phenomenon); and, simultaneously, (ii) the chances that a new visitor will improve the article drops (there is only so much that can be said about a particular topic). Our model is able to reproduce many features of the edit dynamics observed on Wikipedia; in particular, it captures the observed rise in the edit rate, followed by 1/t decay. Despite differences in the media, we also document similar features in the comment rates for a segment of the LiveJournal blogosphere.", "paper_title": "A Model for Information Growth in Collective Wisdom Processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307540800002"}
