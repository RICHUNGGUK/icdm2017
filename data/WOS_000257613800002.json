However, management is reluctant to initiate them due to their enterprise-wide impact and costs that are higher than those of traditional system development projects. Thus, there is a need to assess the value of the redesigned process of a successfully implemented organizational change projects. The purpose of this study was therefore to assess process improvement from organizational change in the areas of resource utilization and allocation and cycle time and cost reduction. The candidate process and design alternatives were identified from organizational requirements analysis. The variables and their relations were defined to perform task activity analysis, bottleneck analysis, cycle cost analysis, and resource utilization analysis. A case study of a manufacturing company indicated that the assessment method was a promising approach for identifying alternative processes that leads to better organizational performance.
