Especially for high Reynolds number flows, nonlinear multigrid, which is commonly used to solve the nonlinear systems of equations, converges slowly. The stiffness induced by the high-aspect ratio cells and turbulence is not tackled well by this solution method. In this paper, it is investigated if a Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solution method can speed up unsteady flow computations at high Reynolds numbers. Preconditioning of the linear systems that arise after Newton linearization is commonly performed with matrix-free preconditioners or approximate factorizations based on crude approximations of the Jacobian. Approximate factorizations based on a Jacobian that matches the target residual operator are unpopular because these preconditioners consume a large amount of memory and can suffer from robustness issues. However, these preconditioners remain appealing because they closely resemble A(-1). In this paper, it is shown that a JFNK solution method with an approximate factorization preconditioner based on a Jacobian that approximately matches the target residual operator enables a speed up of a factor 2.5-12 over nonlinear multigrid for two-dimensional high Reynolds number flows. The solution method performs equally well as nonlinear multigrid for three-dimensional laminar problems. A modest memory consumption is achieved with partly lumping the Jacobian before constructing the approximate factorization preconditioner, whereas robustness is ensured with enhanced diagonal dominance.
