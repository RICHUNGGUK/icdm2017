This is in addition, to a new training algorithm, called the push-pull learning algorithm. The proposed GFTART model has two purposes: First, to reduce the proliferation of incrementally generated nodes in the F2 layer by the conventional fuzzy ART model based on replacing each F2 node with a GCS. Second, to enhance the class-dependent clustering representation ability of the GCS model by including the categorization property of the conventional fuzzy ART model. In addition, the proposed push-pull training algorithm enhances the cluster discriminating property and partially improves the forgetting problem of the training algorithm in the GCS model.
