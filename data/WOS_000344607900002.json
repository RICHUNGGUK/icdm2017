There are many well-designed scheduling algorithms proposed for heterogeneous computing systems. However, the availability variation is seldom considered in developing scheduling ongoing applications on a grid. In this paper, two scheduling algorithms called AMOF and AMOSF are proposed. Both of them consider availability variation as well as resource heterogeneity while scheduling an ongoing workflow application on the grid. An experiment has been conducted to demonstrate that AMOF and AMOSF algorithms outperform the well-known scheduling algorithms: GS and HEFT in most of the cases.", "paper_title": "Adaptable Scheduling Algorithm for Grids with Resource Redeployment Capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000344607900002"}
