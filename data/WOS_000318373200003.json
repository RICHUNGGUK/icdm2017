In order to realize low offset, both offset cancellation techniques and kickback noise reduction techniques are adopted. Based on TSMC 0.18 mu m 3.3V CMOS process, Monte Carlo simulation shows that the comparator has a low offset voltage 1.1806mV at 1 sigma at 125 MHz, with a power dissipation of 413.48 mu W.", "paper_title": "A LOW OFFSET HIGH SPEED COMPARATOR FOR PIPELINE ADC", "paper_id": "WOS:000318373200003"}
