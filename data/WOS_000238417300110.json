In the previous work [11], [12], [13], the Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm (QPSO) is proposed. This novel algorithm is a global-convergence-guaranteed and has a better search ability than the original PSO. But like other evolutionary optimization technique, premature in the QPSO is also inevitable. In this paper, we propose a method of controlling the diversity to enable particles to escape the sub-optima more easily. Before describing the new method, we first introduce the origin and development of the PSO and QPSO. The Diversity-Controlled QPSO, along with the PSO and QPSO is tested on several benchmark functions for performance comparison. The experiment results testify that the DCQPSO outperforms the PSO and QPSO.", "paper_title": "Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm with controlled diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300110"}
