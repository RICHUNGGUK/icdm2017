No a priori information about the functional form is available, therefore the problems may be treated as function estimation which is difficult to estimate using traditional gradient-based methods. Measurements on the boundary are used in the least square modelling. Tikhonov regularization technique is used to stabilize the ill-posed problem. The numerical benchmark and experiment results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed method to solve inverse problems of estimating nonlinear parameters in parabolic PDEs.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous estimation of nonlinear parameters in parabolic partial differential equation using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization with Gaussian mutation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351310600010"}
