The new technologies are especially useful for the Special Educational Needs (SEN) group. In this paper we introduce APADYT Professional (Aplicacin Psicopedaggica para Apoyo en Diagnstico Y Tratamiento-Psychopedagogical APplicAtion for supporting Diagnosis & Education), an application developed in collaboration with SEN teachers, children with SEN and parents. This multimedia application supports SEN treatment and it exploits multi-touch interfaces to offer SEN learners multimedia learning activities. The main advantage of APADYT Professional is that it helps teachers' work by providing them with a single application that supports multiple tasks. In this way APADYT fills the gap in the existing applications, by supporting pupil management, computer-assisted learning process, report generation, planning, communication between parents and specialists, authoring tools and others interesting facilities in an integrated way. User-centered techniques have been successfully used for the development of APADYT, as the results of the User eXperience (UX) assessment reported in this paper shows, These results also shows that the approach followed to design this multimedia application is extremely appreciated by SEN teachers and specialists.", "paper_title": "APADYT: a multimedia application for SEN learners", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000036"}
