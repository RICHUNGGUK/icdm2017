Several methods, including frequent itemset mining and co-clustering, have been proposed to analyze transactional databases. In this work, we propose a new research problem to succinctly summarize transactional databases. Solving this problem requires linking the high level structure of the database to a potentially huge number of frequent itemsets. We formulate this problem as a set covering problem using overlapped hyperrectangles (a concept generally regarded as tile according to some existing papers); we then prove that this problem and its several variations are NP-hard, and we further reveal its relationship with the compact representation of a directed bipartite graph. We develop an approximation algorithm Hyper which can achieve a logarithmic approximation ratio in polynomial time. We propose a pruning strategy that can significantly speed up the processing of our algorithm, and we also propose an efficient algorithm Hyper+ to further summarize the set of hyperrectangles by allowing false positive conditions. Additionally, we show that hyperrectangles generated by our algorithms can be properly visualized. A detailed study using both real and synthetic datasets shows the effectiveness and efficiency of our approaches in summarizing transactional databases.", "paper_title": "Summarizing transactional databases with overlapped hyperrectangles", "paper_id": "WOS:000289685300001"}
