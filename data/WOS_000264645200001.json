The system performs an analysis of the inference rules in the input schemata in order to determine the best data structures and indexes to use, and to ensure that the generated implementations are efficient. The system described is general enough to he able to handle all kinds of schemata for different grammar formalisms, such as context-free grammars and tree-adjoining grammars, and it provides an extensibility mechanism allowing the user to define custom notational elements. This compiler has proven very useful for analyzing, prototyping and comparing natural-language parsers in real domains, as can be seen in the empirical examples provided at the end of the paper.
