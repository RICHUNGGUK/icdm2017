The algorithm uses a multipopulation method where the entire population is partitioned into several clusters according to the spatial locations of the trial solutions. The clusters are evolved separately using a standard differential evolution algorithm. The number of clusters is an adaptive parameter, and its value is updated after a certain number of iterations. Accordingly, the total population is redistributed into a new number of clusters. In this way, a certain sharing of information occurs periodically during the optimization process. The performance of CDDE_Ar is compared with six state-of-the-art dynamic optimizers over the moving peaks benchmark problems and dynamic optimization problem (DOP) benchmarks generated with the generalized-dynamic-benchmark-generator system for the competition and special session on dynamic optimization held under the 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation. Experimental results indicate that CDDE_Ar can enjoy a statistically superior performance on a wide range of DOPs in comparison to some of the best known dynamic evolutionary optimizers.", "paper_title": "A Cluster-Based Differential Evolution Algorithm With External Archive for Optimization in Dynamic Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000319010000007"}
