This paper proposes matrix-based complex PCA (MCPCA), a feature level fusion method for bimodal biometrics that uses a complex matrix to denote two biometric traits from one subject. The method respectively takes the two images from two biometric traits of a subject as the real part and imaginary part of a complex matrix. MCPCA applies a novel and mathematically tractable algorithm for extracting features directly from complex matrices. We also show that MCPCA has a sound theoretical foundation and the previous matrix-based PCA technique, two-dimensional PCA (2DPCA), is only one special form of the proposed method. On the other hand, the features extracted by the developed method may have a large number of data items (each real number in the obtained features is called one data item). In order to obtain features with a small number of data items, we have devised a two-step feature extraction scheme. Our experiments show that the proposed two-step feature extraction scheme can achieve a higher classification accuracy than the 2DPCA and PCA techniques. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
