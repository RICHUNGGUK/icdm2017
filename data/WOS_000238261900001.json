The purpose of the present study is to identify and discuss the patterns of such cooperation, along with the trends in scientific research conducted in that context at Puerto Rican institutions. The methodology includes an analysis of the main areas of research addressed, defined as the area of specialization of the journals publishing papers indexed in the Science Citation Index (CD-ROM version) from 1980 to 1999. A total of 7271 studies, appearing ill 1240 scientific journals, were selected to study the co-operation established between Puerto Rican institutions and organizations in other countries. The findings showed a high rate of international co-operation: 46.07% of the papers published were co-authored by researchers from other countries. The country accounting for the highest percentage of joint research was the USA, followed by Germany, United Kingdom, Canada and Italy. The close relationship between the Puerto Rican and US scientific systems is not unusual, inasmuch as the economic and sociopolitical bonds between them play an essential role in Puerto Rican scientific activity. The results also revealed substantial differences between the nineteen eighties and the nineties in terms, of the nature of the links established, as well as growing internationalization of scientific research conducted on the island over the twenty-year period studied.", "paper_title": "Patterns of international scientific co-operation in Puerto Rico", "paper_id": "WOS:000238261900001"}
