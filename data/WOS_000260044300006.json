Design/methodology/approach - Underlying judgment set of a multi-attribute decision problem is modeled with employing grey numbers. Fundamental principles for comparing a set of grey numbers are established. A procedure for evaluating the decision alternatives is explained in detail and referred to as \"The grey extent analysis\". Findings - It is shown that the proposed procedure can be used as a decision-making tool where the judgments of the decision maker are not exact (i.e. in terms of grey system terminology they are not \"white\"). Research limitations/implications - The grey numbers utilized are assumed to be asynchronous and uniformly distributed over their domain. Originality/value - The extent analysis is well studied as an evaluation tool under a fuzzy system. This study is set apart from the previous extent analysis research for two reasons: this paper provides basic guidelines for applying the extent analysis procedure within a grey system; the (grey) number comparison principles are totally different.", "paper_title": "The grey extent analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000260044300006"}
