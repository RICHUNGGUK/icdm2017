In this paper we focus on two general LASSO models: Sparse Group LASSO and Fused LASSO, and apply the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers (LADMM for short) to solve them. The LADMM approach is shown to be a very simple and efficient approach to numerically solve these general LASSO models. We compare it with some benchmark approaches on both synthetic and real datasets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
