Several traction force microscopy methods have been developed to determine cell traction forces based on the Boussinesq solution. This approach, however, is rooted in a half-space assumption. The purpose of this study was to determine the error induced in the half-space assumption using a finite element method (FEM). It demonstrates that displacement error between the FEM and the Boussinesq equation can be used to measure the accuracy of the Boussinesq equation, although singularity exists in the loading point. For one concentrated force, significant difference between the FEM and the Boussinesq equation occurs in the whole field; this difference decreases with an increase in the plate thickness. However, in the case of the balanced forces, the offset of the balanced forces decreases the errors in the middle area. Overall, this study demonstrates that increasing the thickness of the polyacrylamide gel is important for reducing the error of the Boussinesq equation when determining the displacement field of the gel under loads.", "paper_title": "Validation of the Boussinesq equation for use in traction field determination", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434500006"}
