Based on the (k-1)th fault estimation information, a novel k-step fault-estimation observer is proposed to construct the kth fault error dynamics. The obtained fault estimates via k-step fault-estimation can practically better depict the size and shape of the faults. Then, based on the information of online k-step fault-estimation, a dynamic output feedback fault tolerant controller is designed to compensate the fault effects on the closed-loop fuzzy system. Furthermore, some less conservative delay dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of fault estimation observers and fault tolerant controllers are given in terms of solution to a set of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, simulation results of two numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Fault Tolerant Controller Design for T-S Fuzzy Systems With Time-Varying Delay and Actuator Faults: A K-Step Fault-Estimation Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000345857000012"}
