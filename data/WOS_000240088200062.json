It uses averaged global accuracy as the measurement of goodness in the induction process of the tree structure, and chooses the local classifier that is most specific for the target instance to make the decision. This paper mainly introduces a pruning strategy based on local accuracy estimation. Instead of directly using the most specific local classifier (mostly the classifier in a leaf node) to making classification in NBTree, our pruning strategy uses the measurement of local accuracy to guide the selection of local classifier for decision. Experimental results manifest that this pruning strategy is effective, especially for the NBTree with relatively more nodes.", "paper_title": "Naive Bayesian tree pruning by local accuracy estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200062"}
