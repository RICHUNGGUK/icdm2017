Firstly, under consideration of both network-induced delay and the data packet dropout in the transmission, a state feedback controller is constructed without considering the state quantization. Then, based on the unified framework of networked and quantized state feedback control systems, a quantized asymptotically stabilizing sufficient condition is proposed for the obtained controller. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "QUANTIZED FEEDBACK STABILIZATION FOR NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEMS WITH NONLINEAR PERTURBATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700009"}
