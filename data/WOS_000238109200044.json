Since such database have been useful for evaluating performance of a group of machine learning algorithms, a series of experiments have been carried out for three algorithms using the cross validation method. Results suggest that SVM outperforms the others and the Neuro-Fuzzy network is better than the BP algorithm for this data set.", "paper_title": "Performance comparison between backpropagation, neuro-fuzzy network, and SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200044"}
