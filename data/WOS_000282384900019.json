Obtained chain codes are compressed by Huffman coding algorithm. The results show that the new method requires least memory space to store the raster fonts among the known methods. Moreover, the font size has almost no impact on the coder efficiency. Due to the low complexity of the decoder that occupies only 2.7 kB of memory space, this method is ideal for use in embedded systems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
