However, a dynamic order admission policy by utilizing the concept of revenue management may Dynamic and Stochastic Knapsack Problem find a good way to solve the problem. Unfortunately, the expected profit under different dynamic order Estimation error admission policies is sensitive to the estimation error of order forecasts. In this paper, the impact of estimation error is investigated under various order structures. The post analysis is performed and shows significant statistical difference among the optimal unbiased DSKP policy, biased DSKP policy, and FCFS policy. The results reveal the robustness and superiority of DSKP policy in most scenarios. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
