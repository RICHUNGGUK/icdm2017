Under brute-force searching techniques, the formula about the average searching time is derived. The bit-correct-interception possibilities for tapping individual and multiple users' signals are calculated, respectively. By analysis, it is shown that the security performance of an OCDMA system can be enhanced by employing M-code keying.", "paper_title": "Security performance analysis of an M-code keying OCDMA system", "paper_id": "WOS:000252640700003"}
