The purpose of this paper is to study the role of spatial mnemonics in Hellenistic libraries, including the one in Alexandria. Design/methodology/approach - Since library- and information science has not explored this subject in depth, philology, rhetoric, book-history and archeology constitute the core literature. From this literature, the role of mnemonics in the libraries is discussed. Findings - A new description of the practice of classification and retrieval in Hellenistic libraries, based on spatial mnemonics. Originality/value - This paper is a new analysis of spatial mnemonics in the Hellenistic libraries. As will become clear, they blend easily and logically with each other.", "paper_title": "Mnemonics in the Mouseion Considerations on spatial mnemonics as a tool for classification and retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000352716700006"}
