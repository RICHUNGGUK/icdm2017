To improve the computational efficiency of these simulations, this paper proposes a framework with a series of optimizations, including an I/O optimization, several implementation improvements, and two parallelizing schemes. To demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed framework, a Zebiak-Cane (ZC) case model is studied and presented in this paper. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can greatly improve the computational efficiency of climate simulations.", "paper_title": "An optimization framework for adjoint-based climate simulations: A case study of the Zebiak-Cane model", "paper_id": "WOS:000336222700002"}
