We thus will not present experimental results but theoretical bases for forthcoming experimentations. 'Educative effects' are defined as comprehension of narrative related-world. This framework is based on mental model theory and classic structural narratology, mixed with Herman's cognitive narratology. The concepts of 'storyworld' and,shadow narrative' are used to define operational hypotheses for an empiric inquiry into the effects of narratives in two directions : construction of an integrative mental model, and effect of hypertext consciousness on the so-built representation.", "paper_title": "Theoretical framework for construction of representation through interactive narrative", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300045"}
