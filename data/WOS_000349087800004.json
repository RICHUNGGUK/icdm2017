By providing these frequently important but always challenging capabilities as a service, accessible over the network, Globus platform-as-a-service streamlines Web application development and makes it easy for individuals, teams, and institutions to create collaborative applications such as science gateways for science communities. We introduce the capabilities of this platform and review representative applications.
