For the reduction of overhead, the massive MIMO system generally uses TDD as duplexing scheme. Therefore, the massive MIMO system is sensitive to rapidly changing fast fading in according to time. For the improvement of reduced SINR by fast fading, the adaptive power control is proposed. Unlike the conventional scheme, the proposed scheme considers mobility of device for adaptive power control. The simulation of the proposed scheme is performed with consideration for mobility of device. The result of the simulation shows that the proposed scheme improves SINR. Since SINR is decreased in according to the number of device in the network by unit of cell, each base station can accommodate more devices by the proposed scheme. Also, because the massive MIMO system with high SINR can use high order modulation scheme, it can support higher throughput.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Power Control Using Large Scale Antenna of the Massive MIMO System in the Mobile Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000364202200018"}
