In most cases, the data volume and deadline are known in advance, allowing for both network planning and connection admission control (textrmCAC). We formally define the problem and, based on this formalization, describe the operation of a feasible procedure for network reservations of deadline-constrained bulk data transfer requests. The procedure guarantees a minimum bandwidth to meet the deadlines and allows for opportunistic utilization of residual network capacity. We propose a novel analytical model based on the solution of an M/M(nc)/1/k(s)-RPS queue. The analytical model is validated against ns-2 simulations taking into account network level details (IP and TCP protocols), showing remarkably good coherence even under heavy loads. The model is orders of magnitude faster than simulation, which enables its application to plan the capacity of Grid networks, and to enforce CAC under the hypothesis of a dominating bottleneck on the transfer route.
