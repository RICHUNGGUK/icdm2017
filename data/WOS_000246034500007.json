This paper presents a methodology for online tracking and diagnosis of hybrid systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with experiments conducted on the fuel-transfer system of fighter aircraft.", "paper_title": "Model-based diagnosis of hybrid systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034500007"}
