It is assumed that the user will evaluate both and readily, instead of the evaluations of only when solving the HFDE. We present a method that requires only three evaluations of . Moreover, we consider the characterization theorem of Bede to solve the HFDE numerically. The convergence of the method will be proven and numerical examples are shown with a comparison to the conventional solutions.", "paper_title": "A Runge-Kutta method with reduced number of function evaluations to solve hybrid fuzzy differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000351408300022"}
