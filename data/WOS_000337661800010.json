Elman network is employed in the method to process word sequences from literary works. The trained codes possess reduced entropy and are used in ranking, indexing, and categorizing literary works. A modification of the method to train the multi-vector for each polysemous word is also presented where each vector represents a different meaning of its word. These multiple vectors can accommodate several different meanings of their word. This method is applied to the stylish analyses of two Chinese novels, Dream of the Red Chamber and Romance of the Three Kingdoms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
