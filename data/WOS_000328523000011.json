Both intention preservation and consistency maintenance should be satisfied when applying group Undo/Redo. Besides, fast local responsiveness and timely group awareness are accepted performance metrics in interactive systems. In this paper, we contribute a novel group Undo/Redo mechanism for 3D collaborative modeling systems to support the \"any time, any where\" Undo/Redo. Response time will be shortened noticeably with a Model State Stream kept on each collaborative site. In the case of concurrent Undo/Redo, an Undo State Vector is proposed to ensure the Undo/Redo intention preservation and model consistency maintenance. Furthermore, the paper studies the performance of the algorithm including the worst, best and average cases with theoretical analyses. Our experiments show that responsive time is actually depending on a number of factors such as size of the history buffer, execution time for a single modeling operation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
