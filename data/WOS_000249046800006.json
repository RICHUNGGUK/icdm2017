So far, this technique has been applied principally to the in-plane behaviour of masonry. This paper focuses on the generalization of the homogenisation procedure to the out-of-plane behaviour of masonry, in such a way that the in-plane (membrane) and out-of-plane (bending) characteristics of the homogeneous equivalent plate can be derived in one step. In particular, the presented procedure makes it possible to investigate the behaviour of a portion of a masonry wall under any load path combining in-plane and out-of-plane actions.
