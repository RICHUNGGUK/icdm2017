Analytical relationships between Lyapunov functions of the original interconnect network and those of the reduced system generated by the global Arnoldi algorithm will be developed. Under this framework, a new moment matching reduced network is proposed. Also, we will show that the reduced system can be expressed as the original network with some additive perturbations.", "paper_title": "Lyapunov-based error estimations of MIMO interconnect reductions by using the global Arnoldi algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000017"}
