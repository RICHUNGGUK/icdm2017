This approach could be used in applications that need real-time capabilities for retraining RBF neural networks. The proposed method is a Three-Phase Learning Algorithm that optimizes the functionality of the Optimum Steepest Decent (OSD) learning method. This methodology focuses to attain greater precision in initializing the center and width of RBF units. An RBF neural network with well-adjusted RBF units in the train process will result in better performance in network response. This method is proposed to reach better performance for RBF neural networks in fewer train iterations, which is the critical issue in real-time applications. Comparing results employing different learning strategies shows interesting outcomes as have come out in this paper. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
