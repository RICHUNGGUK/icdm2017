Design/methodology/approach - The optimization is based on the phase field method using an Allen-Cahn equation. This approach is a numerical technique for tracking diffuse interfaces like the level set method based on the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. Findings - The optimization results of IPM motor designs are highly dependent on the initial flux barrier shapes. The authors solve the optimization problem using two different initial shapes, and the optimized models show considerable reductions in torque pulsation and the higher harmonics of back-electromotive force. Originality/value - This paper presents the optimization method based on the phase field for the design of rotor flux barriers, and proposes a novel interpolation scheme of the magnetic reluctivity.", "paper_title": "Optimal shape design of flux barriers in IPM synchronous motors using the phase field method", "paper_id": "WOS:000339620000023"}
