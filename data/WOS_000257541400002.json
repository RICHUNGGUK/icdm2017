These practices inspired The Designers' Outpost. With Outpost, users collaboratively author Web site information architectures on an electronic whiteboard using physical media (sticky notes and images), structuring and annotating that information with electronic pens. This interaction is enabled by a touch-sensitive electronic whiteboard augmented with a computer vision system. The Designers' Outpost integrates wall-communicate quickly with people all over the world. However, we lose some of the advantages of meeting face to face. The Designers' Outpost begins to bridge the gap between the virtual and physical worlds and help both collocated and remote teams work more comfortably and effectively.", "paper_title": "Integrating physical and digital interactions on walls for fluid design collaboration", "paper_id": "WOS:000257541400002"}
