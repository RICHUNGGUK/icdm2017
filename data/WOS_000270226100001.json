It causes artifacts such as blur, streaks, and bands, in particular when using slow-rotating scanners mounted on the gantry of linear accelerators. In this paper, we compare two approaches for motion-compensated CBCT reconstruction of the thorax. The first one is analytic; it is heuristically adapted from the method of Feldkamp, Davis, and Kress (FDK). The second one is algebraic: the system of linear equations is generated using a new algorithm for the projection of deformable volumes and solved using the Simultaneous Algebraic Reconstruction Technique (SART). For both methods, we propose to estimate the motion on patient data using a previously acquired 4-D CT image. The methods were tested on two digital and one mechanical motion-controlled phantoms and on a patient dataset. Our results indicate that the two methods correct most motion artifacts. However, the analytic method does not fully correct streaks and bands even if the motion is perfectly estimated due to the underlying approximation. In contrast, the algebraic method allows us full correction of respiratory-induced artifacts.", "paper_title": "Comparison of Analytic and Algebraic Methods for Motion-Compensated Cone-Beam CT Reconstruction of the Thorax", "paper_id": "WOS:000270226100001"}
