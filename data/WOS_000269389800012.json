The tool has been especially designed for handling EEG files. As a consequence, tables with more than 65,536 rows and 256 columns, which is a limitation found in Microsoft's Excel, can be loaded, visualized and processed with no more restrictions than the ones imposed by the memory of the operating system. Beyond tabular visualization, additional tools are available for chart customization and spreadsheet like cell processing commands. Additionally, commands are included for signal processing, cluster analysis and computationally taxing matrix algebra operations. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
