At a mechanical level, the use of engineering allowed investigating injury mechanisms developing numerical models of adult head. For children, the problem is more difficult and evaluating child injury mechanisms using data obtained from scaling adult injury criteria does not account for differences in morphology and structure between adults and children. During growth, child head undergoes different modifications in morphology and structure. The present paper compares the anthropometry and numerical simulations of a child head model based on medical CT scans to a child head model developed by scaling an adult head model using the method proposed by Mertz [H.J. Mertz, A procedure for normalizing impact response data, SAE paper 840884, 1984]. These analysis point out significant differences showing that scaling down an adult head to obtain a child head does not appear relevant. Biofidelic and specific child geometry is needed to investigate child injury mechanisms. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
