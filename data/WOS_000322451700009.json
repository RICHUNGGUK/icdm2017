The proposed filter contains only single VDIBA, two capacitors, and one nMOS transistor, operated in triode region, and is used for resonance angular frequency tuning. Since in the structure no resistors are needed the filter can be classified as resistorless. The VM MISO filter compared with other active building block- based counterparts is very simple, it contains only few transistors, and has the smallest size area. Moreover, no component matching is required and it shows low sensitivity performance. The theoretical results are verified by SPICE simulations using TSMC 0.18 lm level- 7 SCN018 CMOS process parameters with +/- 0.9 V supply voltages. In addition, the behavior of the proposed VM filter was also experimentally verified using commercially available integrated circuits OPA660 and AD830.", "paper_title": "New resistorless tunable voltage-mode universal filter using single VDIBA", "paper_id": "WOS:000322451700009"}
