Set partitioning of the Golden code is designed specifically to increase the minimum determinant. The branches of the outer trellis code are labeled with these partitions and Viterbi algorithm is applied for trellis decoding. In order to compute the branch metrics, a sphere decoder is used. The general framework for code design and optimization is given. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated by simulation and it is shown that it achieves significant performance gains over the uncoded Golden code.", "paper_title": "Golden space-time trellis coded modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600005"}
