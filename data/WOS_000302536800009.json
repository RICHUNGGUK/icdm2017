A fuzzy control design methodology is developed for these systems by combining the PDE theory and the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-model-based control technique. Initially, a T-S fuzzy parabolic PDE model is proposed to accurately represent a semilinear parabolic PDE system. Then, based on the T-S fuzzy model, a Lyapunov technique is used to design a continuous fuzzy state feedback controller such that the closed-loop PDE system is exponentially stable with a given decay rate. The stabilization condition is presented in terms of a set of spatial differential linear matrix inequalities (SDLMIs). Furthermore, a recursive algorithm is presented to solve the SDLMIs via the existing linear matrix inequality optimization techniques. Finally, numerical simulations on the temperature profile control of a catalytic rod are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "paper_title": "Exponential Stabilization for a Class of Nonlinear Parabolic PDE Systems via Fuzzy Control Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000302536800009"}
