We show that the expected residual minimization (ERM) formulation of this problem has a nonempty and bounded solution set if the expected value (EV) formulation, which reduces to the LCP with the positive semi-definite expectation matrix, has a nonempty and bounded solution set. We give a new error bound for the monotone LCP and use it to show that solutions of the ERM formulation are robust in the sense that they may have a minimum sensitivity with respect to random parameter variations in SLCP. Numerical examples including a stochastic traffic equilibrium problem are given to illustrate the characteristics of the solutions.", "paper_title": "Robust solution of monotone stochastic linear complementarity problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381200004"}
