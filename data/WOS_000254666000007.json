The proposed system constitutes a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system that employs campus network of National Cheng Kung University integrated with a programmable logic controller (PLC) and digital power meters. The proposed system is capable of performing real-time measurement of electrical data that can be effectively transferred to a remote monitoring center using intranet. The studied simulated wind-PV-battery system consists of two wind induction generators (IGs), an AC-to-DC converter, a DC-to-AC inverter, a PV module, and a battery unit. A novel fuzzy controller of the PLC is also designed to switch excitation capacitors of the IGs to control the performance of output voltage and power factor of the IGs. It can be concluded from the simulated and experimental results that the proposed monitoring and control system can achieve real-time supervisory control and data acquisition of remote various forms of renewable energy system.", "paper_title": "Implementation of a web-based real-time monitoring and control system for a hybrid wind-PV-battery renewable energy system", "paper_id": "WOS:000254666000007"}
