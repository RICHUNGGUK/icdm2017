In this letter, we study the noncooperative channel assignment problem in competitive multi-radio multi-channel wireless networks, with a focus on fairness issues. We propose a Nash equilibrium solution with stronger guarantee on fairness among players than existing works, by requiring a payment from each player. We show that, in our scheme, when system converges to a stable status achieving Nash equilibrium, all players obtain the same throughput. Simulation results verify that our scheme achieves perfect fairness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
