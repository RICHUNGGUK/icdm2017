Traditionally, AMC has been used to improve MAC-layer performance in terms of coded bit error rate, packet error rate, and throughput. The modulation and coding scheme is switched according to signal-to-noise ratio thresholds at the PHY layer. We extend the approach, proposing a framework for energy-efficient cross-layer AMC that captures the impact of both MAC layer and PHY layer parameters on the AMC switching criteria. Cross-layer designs are naturally suited to software defined radio applications. Not only are they readily implemented in software, but also they are integral to the radio components. They can optimize performance of the radio either for a given configuration or adaptively. Through examples of WLAN physical layer and Frequency Domain Equalized systems, we demonstrate our AMC scheme and verify its effectiveness by simulation.", "paper_title": "A Cross-Layer Adaptive Modulation and Coding Scheme for Energy Efficient Software Defined Radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000304706300004"}
