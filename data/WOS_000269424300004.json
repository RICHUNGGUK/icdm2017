The estimated number of respiratory segments in a TBS signal is firstly obtained based on noise estimation and nonlinear mapping. Respiratory phase boundaries are then located through the generations of multi-population genetic algorithm by introducing a new evaluation function based on sample entropy (SampEn) and a heterogeneity measure. The performance of the proposed method is analyzed for single channel TBS recordings of various types. An overall respiratory phase segmentation accuracy is found to be 12 +/- A 5 ms for normal TBS and 21 +/- A 9 ms for adventitious sounds. The results show the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed segmentation method. The proposed method has been a successful attempt to solve the clinical application challenge faced by the existing phase segmentation methods in terms of respiratory dysfunctions.", "paper_title": "An acoustical respiratory phase segmentation algorithm using genetic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000269424300004"}
