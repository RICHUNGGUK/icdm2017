Instead of starting from scratch, users tend to make new presentation slides by reusing existing ones. A primary challenge in slide reuse is to select desired materials from a collection of existing slides. The state-of-the-art solution utilizes texts and images in slides as well as file names to help users to retrieve the materials they want. However, it only allows users to choose an entire slide as a query but does not support the search for a single element such as a few keywords, a sentence, an image, or a diagram. In this paper, we investigate content-based search for a variety of elements in presentation slides. Users may freely choose a slide element as a query. We propose different query processing methods to deal with various types of queries and improve the search efficiency. A system with a user-friendly interface is designed, based on which experiments are performed to evaluate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Content-Based Element Search for Presentation Slide Reuse", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141100015"}
