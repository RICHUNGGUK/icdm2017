It characterizes the shape of an object by the intercepted lengths obtained by intercepting the object perimeter by eight lines with different orientations passing through the object center. The experimental results show that CSBM provides a better performance than fuzzy color histogram (FCH) and conventional color histogram (CCH). Besides, it is insensitive to translation, rotation, distortion, scaling, and hue variations, but impressionable to contrast and noise variations.", "paper_title": "An image retrieval system based on colors and shapes of objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500140"}
