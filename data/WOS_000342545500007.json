To improve simulation performance, an un-identical federate replication structure is proposed in this article. For the same federate, multiple replicas are developed in software diversity manner by employing different synchronization approaches. The simulation performance is improved by always choosing the fastest replica to represent the federate in the federation. The replication structure is implemented in a transparent manner without increasing federation scale. Message exchange and time management mechanisms are developed to handle the different behaviors of those un-identical replicas. Correctness of the replication structure is proved in theory and verified by experiments. The experimental results have also shown that the un-identical federate replication structure achieves significant performance enhancement with good scalability and marginal overhead.
