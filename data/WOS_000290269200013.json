In addition, the data stability against high temperature and cycling wear is very robust, allowing new NVM applications in a variety of markets (automotive, embedded, storage, RAM). Based on sudden conduction through oxide insulators, the characteristics of RRAM technology have still yet to be fully described. In this paper, we present our current understanding of this very promising technology.", "paper_title": "Resistance switching for RRAM applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000290269200013"}
