To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach to satellite image retrieval, an interactive region-based image query system is designed and developed. A database comprising 400 multispectral satellite images is used to evaluate the performance of the system. The results are analyzed and discussed, and a performance comparison with other methods is included. The outcomes reveal that the proposed approach is able to improve the quality of the segmentation results as well as the retrieval performance.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy clustering of color and texture features for image segmentation: A study on satellite image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239481700010"}
