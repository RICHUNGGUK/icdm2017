A corollary is that every 3-homogenous latin bitrade may be partitioned into three disjoint transversals. Using a permutation representation for latin bitrades developed by Drapal, we provide a shorter proof of these results, and then give a construction for a family of separated 4-homogeneous latin bitrades.", "paper_title": "Permutation representation of 3 and 4-homogenous latin bitrades", "paper_id": "WOS:000257115400008"}
