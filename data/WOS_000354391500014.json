This paper proposes a new MOcGA, namely cosine multiobjective cellular genetic algorithm (C-MCGA), for continuous multiobjective optimization. The CMCGA introduces two new components: a 3D grid structure and a cosine crowding measurement. The first component is used to organize the population. Compared with a 2D grid, the 3D grid offers a vertical expansion of cells. The second one simultaneously considers the crowding distances and location distributions for measuring the crowding degree values for the solutions. The simulation results show that C-MCGA outperforms two typical MOcGAs and two state-of-the-art algorithms, NSGA-II and SPEA2, on a given set of test instances. Furthermore, the proposed measurement metric is compared with that in NSGA-II, which is demonstrated to yield a more diverse population on most of the test instances.", "paper_title": "A multiobjective cellular genetic algorithm based on 3D structure and cosine crowding measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000354391500014"}
