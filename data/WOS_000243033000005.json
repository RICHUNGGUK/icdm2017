Yet, challenges such as bandwidth restriction or dynamic changes require considerations that need to be reflected in the distribution of context. In this paper, we present a novel technique to share and control access to context. In structuring context information according to levels of granularity, we achieve context propagation at the relevant levels of detail while protecting the privacy of the user. Introducing the Context Access control, Subscription and Query Language (CASQL), we enable fine-grained subscriptions and control over context in our proposed Context Sharing Architecture (CoSAr). A collaborative work scenario accompanies our approach for a unified way of accessing context information.", "paper_title": "Sharing hierarchical context for mobile web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000243033000005"}
