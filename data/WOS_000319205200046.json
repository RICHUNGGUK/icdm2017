Based on signed distances, we develop a new linear assignment method to produce an optimal preference ranking of the alternatives in accordance with a set of criterion-wise rankings and a set of criterion importance within the context of interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Applying the proposed method to a case involving the selection of a landfill site, we demonstrate that the proposed method is easy to employ and that it produces actionable results that aid the decision-making process. The proposed interval type-2 fuzzy linear assignment method utilizes signed distances, does not require a complicated computation procedure and will be beneficial to decision analysis.
