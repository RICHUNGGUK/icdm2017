We have measured strain from two sets of 3D micro-CT images of a breast-mimicking phantom; one obtained without compressing the phantom and the other with compressing it. To measure strain, we first calculated compression-induced displacements of high-intensity feature patterns in the image. In measuring displacement of a pixel of interest, we searched the pixel in the compressed-phantom image, whose surrounding resembles the uncompressed-phantom image most closely, using the image correlation technique. From the displacement data, we calculated average strain at a region of interest. With the calculated average strains, we could distinguish the hard inclusion in the phantom which was not distinguishable from the background body of the phantom in the ordinary micro-CT images. The calculated strains account for stiffness of the tissue of interest, one of the important parameters for diagnosing malignant tissues. We present experimental results of the displacement and strain measurement along with FEM analysis results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
