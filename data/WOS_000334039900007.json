In this article, an expert-based approach for recommendation is proposed. We extend the spamming-resistant expertise analysis and ranking (SPEAR) algorithm to determine a set of experts from a set of attributes and values, calling the modification the <A,V > -SPEAR algorithm. This system can recommend a set of items to users using expert opinions. In this approach, we use ontology to build profiles of users. The experimental results are implemented in the movie domain as a case study. Our data set was collected from IMDB and MovieLens data sets.", "paper_title": "< A,V >-Spear: A New Method for Expert Based Recommendation Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000334039900007"}
