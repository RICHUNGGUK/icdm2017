In the proposed model, we introduce the concepts of secure permissions, secure objects (secure sub object hierarchy), and secure operations, and propose the method of decomposing a multilevel-security object into a number of sub objects and organizing them into a tree structure. With the embedded security criterion expressions in the secure sub objects and the embedded security criterion subset in the relevant secure operations, the model achieves the multilevel security access control by evaluating these security criterion expressions using the relevant security criterion subset. In addition to presenting the methods of generating new components, we also analyze the relationships among the new components, and discuss the rationale of the proposed model.", "paper_title": "A role-based multilevel security access control model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237466700001"}
