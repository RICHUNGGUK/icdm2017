We have developed Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M), the first fully open-source and collaborative online platform for computational metabolomics. W4M is a virtual research environment built upon the Galaxy web-based platform technology. It enables ergonomic integration, exchange and running of individual modules and workflows. Alternatively, the whole W4M framework and computational tools can be downloaded as a virtual machine for local installation.", "paper_title": "Workflow4Metabolomics: a collaborative research infrastructure for computational metabolomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000355665800027"}
