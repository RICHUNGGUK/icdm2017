In this paper, we propose an approach for constructing a virtual subnet whose nodes are logically related. The virtual subnet can be spread upon clusters of a MANET. An intelligent agent with a routing filtering table is proposed to assist the best known clustering algorithms, the original Least ID algorithm and the original Highest Connection Cluster (HCC) algorithm, to improve group communication efficiency. Our simulation covers the network factors of hop count, deprave rate, and delay time. The simulation results show that when the proposed intelligent agent is used with the HCC algorithm, the delay time was reduced by 81.84% as compared with flooding, and by 49.25% as compared with the Ad Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) routing algorithm. The delay time for the Least ID algorithm assisted by the proposed agents reduced by 81.84% compared to that of flooding and by 50% compared to that of AODV. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
