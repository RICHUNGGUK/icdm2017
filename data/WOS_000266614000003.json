This paper defines an efficient algorithm that composes a set of cooperative services with their dependencies into a structured process. The algorithm takes as input a dependency graph and returns a structured process model that orchestrates the services while respecting their dependencies. The algorithm is embedded in a lightweight, semi-automated service composition approach, in which first dependencies between services are derived in a semi-automated way and next the algorithm is used to construct a structured composition. The approach has been implemented in a prototype that supports the dynamic formation and collaboration of dynamic virtual enterprises using cross-organizational service-oriented technology.", "paper_title": "COMPOSING SERVICES INTO STRUCTURED PROCESSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000266614000003"}
