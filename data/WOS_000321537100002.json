Conventional FCM algorithm is sensitive to noise especially in the presence of intensity inhomogeneity in MRI. Main reason is that a single fuzzifier in FCM cannot properly represent pattern memberships for all clusters. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for fuzzy segmentation of MRI data. The algorithm utilizes two fuzzifiers used in interval type-2 FCM and a spatial constraint on the membership functions. Also, in our investigation, validity functions are extended to generalized form for interval type-2 fuzzy clustering. The experimental results on both synthetic and MR images show that the proposed algorithm has better performance on image segmentation than conventional FCM based algorithms. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
