We attempt to further explore the interaction effects between paired dimensions of social capital. In the context of information system development (ISD) projects, we propose direct and interaction effects of different dimensions of social capital on process and product performance. A survey of system developers indicates that all three proposed interaction effects on process performance are significant but with different patterns. Only one (structural and relational) interaction effect is found to have an effect on product performance. Academic and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
