Energy constraints make optimizing query processing particularly important. This article addresses multiroot, multiquery optimization for region queries. The work focuses on application-layer issues exploiting query semantics. The article formulates three algorithms: a naive algorithm, without data sharing, and a static and heuristic data-sharing algorithm. The heuristic algorithm allows sharing of partially aggregated results of preconfigured geographic regions and exploits the location attribute of sensor nodes as a grouping criterion. Simulation studies indicate the potential for significant energy savings with the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Multiroot, Multiquery Processing Based on Data Sharing In Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279366900007"}
