The authors propose different sets of moduli that can be used in elliptic curve crytographic applications and pairing-based cryptography. Moreover, this method also leads to efficient implementations for the elliptic curve parameters given in standards. It is shown that one can obtain efficient Montgomery modular multiplication architecture in view of the number of AND gates and XOR gates by choosing proposed sets of moduli. The authors eliminate final substraction step with proposed sets of moduli. These methods are easy to implement for hardware.", "paper_title": "On the generalisation of special moduli for faster interleaved montgomery modular multiplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000326462600001"}
