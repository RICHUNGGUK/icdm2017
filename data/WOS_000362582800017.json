These problems are generally more difficult than their binary counterparts. In this scenario, decomposition strategies usually improve the performance of classifiers. Hence, in this paper, we aim to improve the behavior of fuzzy association rule-based classification model for high-dimensional problems (FARC-HD) fuzzy classifier in multiclass classification problems using decomposition strategies, and more specifically One-versus-One (OVO) and One-versus-All (OVA) strategies. However, when these strategies are applied on FARC-HD, a problem emerges due to the low-confidence values provided by the fuzzy reasoning method. This undesirable condition comes from the application of the product t-norm when computing the matching and association degrees, obtaining low values, which are also dependent on the number of antecedents of the fuzzy rules. As a result, robust aggregation strategies in OVO, such as the weighted voting obtain poor results with this fuzzy classifier. In order to solve these problems, we propose to adapt the inference system of FARC-HD replacing the product t-norm with overlap functions. To do so, we define n-dimensional overlap functions. The usage of these new functions allows one to obtain more adequate outputs from the base classifiers for the subsequent aggregation in OVO and OVA schemes. Furthermore, we propose a new aggregation strategy for OVO to deal with the problem of the weighted voting derived from the inappropriate confidences provided by FARC-HD for this aggregation method. The quality of our new approach is analyzed using 20 datasets and the conclusions are supported by a proper statistical analysis. In order to check the usefulness of our proposal, we carry out a comparison against some of the state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers. Experimental results show the competitiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Multiclass Classification in FARC-HD Fuzzy Classifier: On the Synergy Between n-Dimensional Overlap Functions and Decomposition Strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000362582800017"}
