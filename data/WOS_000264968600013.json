Large power transfer through long transmission line between different electrical areas, stressed system and adverse interaction between local controllers, may give rise to slow frequency inter-area oscillations. The inter-area modes may not be visible from local measurements and hence it is useful to use remote measurement based centralized supplementary control. Wide area control systems (WACSs) using wide-area or global signals can provide remote auxiliary control to local controllers such as automatic voltage regulators, power system stabilizers, etc. to damp out inter-area oscillations. This paper presents a design and real time implementation of a nonlinear neural network based optimal wide area controller using adaptive critic design (ACD). The real time implementation of a power system model is carried out on a real time digital simulator (RTDS). The performance of the WACS as a power system stability agent is studied using a two-area power system under different operating conditions and contingencies. The WACS shows improvement in the damping of inter-area mode with the use of supplementary excitation control. in addition, results show that the designed controller can provide robust performance under small communication delay in remote signal transmission.
