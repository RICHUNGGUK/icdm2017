Using as a framework the history of this discipline, we discuss some of the most respresentative algorithms that have been developed so far, as well as some of their applications. Also, we discuss some of the methodological issues related to the use of multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, as well as some of the current and future research trends in the area.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary multi-objective optimization: A historical view of the field", "paper_id": "WOS:000246523300005"}
