We present a combined smoothing implicit programming and penalty method for the problems with a finite sample space. Then, we suggest a quasi-Monte Carlo approximation method for solving a problem with continuous random variables. A comprehensive convergence theory is included as well. We further report numerical results with the so-called picnic vender decision problem.", "paper_title": "Solving stochastic mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints via approximation and smoothing implicit programming with penalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000256964400017"}
