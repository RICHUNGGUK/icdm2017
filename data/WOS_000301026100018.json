V2V and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication are developed based on the IEEE 802.11p technology, ad hoc principles, and wireless multi-hop techniques using geographical positions. Cognitive radio (CR) system can dynamically access any available resources in radio spectrum in an opportunistic fashion, which not only significantly improved the spectrum utilization, but also better satisfied the user service requirements. In this paper, the simulation results indicate that, when vehicles are unable to communicate directly with other available network nodes, infrastructure or vehicles, relaying information is crucial in such perceiving environment.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE VEHICLE TO VEHICLE HETEROGENEOUS TRANSMISSION IN COOPERATIVE COGNITIVE NETWORK VANETS", "paper_id": "WOS:000301026100018"}
