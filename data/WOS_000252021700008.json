The different arrangement in the high-frequency loop, in contrast to previous reported series-connected dual-loop topologies, offers various advantages, such as improved phase noise, finer resolution, and lower spurious levels. Discrete elements are used to implement a prototype system for testing. This adds to the flexibility of the design and allows for experimental optimization of the loop trade-offs. The synthesizer generates signals in the 4850 MHz to 5050 MHz range with a 10 MHz resolution and can match the specifications for wireless LANs operating at 5 GHz. The design resulted in a prototype with very good characteristics suitable for future integration.", "paper_title": "Theoretical and experimental evaluation of the phase noise behavior of a dual-loop frequency synthesizer for 5-GHz WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000252021700008"}
