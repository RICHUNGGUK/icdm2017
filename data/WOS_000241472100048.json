Here, we propose a new parameter in the learning rule so neurons are not only affected by BMU as a function of distance, but as a function of the frequency of activation from both, the BMU and input vectors, to the affected neurons. This frequency parameter allows non radial neighborhoods and the quality of the formed maps is improved with respect to those formed by traditional SOM, as we show by comparing several error measures and five data sets.", "paper_title": "A parameter in the learning rule of SOM that incorporates activation frequency", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100048"}
