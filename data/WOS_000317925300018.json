Although swarming scales well to tolerate flash crowds for popular content, it is less useful for unpopular content as peers arriving after the initial rush find it unavailable. In this paper, we present a model to quantify content availability in swarming systems. We use the model to analyze the availability and the performance implications of bundling, a strategy commonly adopted by many BitTorrent publishers today. We find that even a limited amount of bundling exponentially reduces content unavailability. For swarms with highly unavailable publishers, the availability gain of bundling can result in a net decrease in average download time. We empirically confirm the model's conclusions through experiments on PlanetLab using the Mainline BitTorrent client.", "paper_title": "Content Availability and Bundling in Swarming Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317925300018"}
