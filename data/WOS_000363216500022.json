Such a delicate skill has rendered the creation of circular scribble art a tedious and time-consuming task even for gifted artists. In this work, we present a novel method for automatic synthesis of circular scribble art. The synthesis problem is modeled as tracing along a virtual path using a parametric circular curve. To reproduce the tone and important edge structure of input grayscale images, the system adaptively adjusts the density and structure of virtual path, and dynamically controls the size, drawing speed and orientation of parametric circular curve during the synthesis. We demonstrate the potential of our system using several circular scribble images synthesized from a wide variety of grayscale images. A preliminary experimental studying is conducted to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate our method. Results report that our method is efficient and generates convincing results comparable to artistic artworks.", "paper_title": "Tone- and Feature-Aware Circular Scribble Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500022"}
