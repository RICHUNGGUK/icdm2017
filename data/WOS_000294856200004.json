If the disks do not overlap, it is also a unit coin graph or penny graph. It is known that finding a maximum independent set in a unit disk graph is a NP-hard problem. In this work we extend this result to penny graphs. Furthermore, we prove that finding a minimum clique partition in a penny graph is also NP-hard, and present two linear-time approximation algorithms for the computation of clique partitions: a 3-approximation algorithm for unit disk graphs and a 2-approximation algorithm for penny graphs.", "paper_title": "A NOTE ON MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SETS AND MINIMUM CLIQUE PARTITIONS IN UNIT DISK GRAPHS AND PENNY GRAPHS: COMPLEXITY AND APPROXIMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000294856200004"}
