First, extension courses were classified into five broad groups. Records of enrollees in extension courses from 2000-5 were then analyzed by three data mining algorithms: Decision Tree, Link Analysis, and Decision Forest. Decision tree was used to find enrollee course preferences, Link Analysis found the correlation between course category and enrollee profession, and Decision Forest found the probability of enrollees completing preferred courses. Results will be used as a reference for curriculum development in the extension program. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
