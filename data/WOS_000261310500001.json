To solve this problem, this paper develops two model selection criteria by combining or redefining the radius-margin bound used in binary SVMs. The combination is justified by linking the test error rate of a multiclass SVM with that of a set of binary SVMs. The redefinition, which is relatively heuristic, is inspired by the conceptual relationship between the radius-margin bound and the class separability measure. Hence, the two criteria are developed from the perspective of model selection rather than a generalization of the radius-margin bound for multiclass SVMS. As demonstrated by extensive experimental study, the minimization of these two criteria achieves good model selection on most data sets. Compared with the k-fold cross validation which is often regarded as a benchmark, these two criteria give rise to comparable performance with much less computational overhead, particularly when a large number of model parameters are to be optimized.", "paper_title": "Two Criteria for Model Selection in Multiclass Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000261310500001"}
