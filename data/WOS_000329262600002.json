But the rotor dynamic character will influence the performance (efficiency, noise, vibration, etc.), life-span and even the safety of the turbine. The method for analyzing the rotor stability of hydraulic turbine has been studied in this paper. Stability of the rotor system of a real turbine was studied with the theory of rotor dynamics in this paper. The way how each factor affects the dynamic character of labyrinth system was also investigated. It can be concluded that the research methods can be widely used in the dynamic analysis of the rotor system with gap flow. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
