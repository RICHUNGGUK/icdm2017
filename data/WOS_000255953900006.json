It consists of a differential inclusion for the velocity of the piston and an equation for the system temperature. The fluid viscosity and friction bound are assumed to be general functions of the electric current and temperature. The existence of the solution for the quasistatic problem is established, and numerical simulations of the system's behavior presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
