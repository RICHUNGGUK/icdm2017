This problem has been extensively studied in graph theory and combinatorial optimization. We show that the problem has a kernel of at most (k - 2)(k + 1) vertices that is constructable in time O(m root n), where n and m are the number of vertices and edges, respectively, in the graph, and k is the parameter. This directly implies that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. We also study generalizations of the problem and show that they are parameterized intractable. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
