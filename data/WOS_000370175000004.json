Using simple constructions, an interpreter for the full Combinatory Logic, CL, is formally defined in aTAM. It provides an approach for sequential programming in aTAM, and produces a DNA molecular machine. This machine lives in a suitable solution and when receives a seed that linearly encodes a CL program and an input for the program, produces a grid which encodes a computation of the program on its input. The paper considers the construction cost and some alternative approaches. Finally, as a case study in distributed programming in aTAM, the paper considers the consensus problem and shows how an aTAM program for it can be formally derived by using pi-calculus.", "paper_title": "Programming Self-Assembly of DNA Tiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000370175000004"}
