At each stage of the process an edge is chosen at random from the tree and cut, separating the tree into two components. In the one-sided variant of the process the component not containing the root is discarded, whereas in the two-sided variant both components are kept. The process ends when no edges remain for cutting. The cost of cutting an edge from a tree of size n is assumed to be n(alpha). Using singularity analysis and the method of moments, we derive the limiting distribution of the total cost accrued in both variants of this process. A salient feature of the limiting distributions obtained (after normalizing in a family-specific manner) is that they only depend on alpha.", "paper_title": "Destruction of very simple trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000243383500006"}
