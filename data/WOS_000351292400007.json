The pipeline of computing, data movement, and data management plays a key role for current distributed data computing systems. In this paper, we first analyze the overhead of shuffle operation in Hadoop and Spark when running PageRank workload, and then propose an event-driven pipeline and in-memory shuffle design with better overlapping of computation and communication as DataMPI-Iteration, an MPI-based library, for iterative big data computing. Our performance evaluation shows DataMPI-Iteration can achieve 9X similar to 21X speedup over Apache Hadoop, and 2X similar to 3X speedup over Apache Spark for PageRank nd K-means.", "paper_title": "Accelerating Iterative Big Data Computing Through MPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000351292400007"}
