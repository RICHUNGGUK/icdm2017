The watermark is embedded in the time domain of an audio signal by the normally used spread spectrum technique. The scheme of detection is an improvement of the conventional correlation detector. A high-pass filter is applied along with the linear prediction error filter for whitening the audio signal and an adaptive threshold is chosen for decision comparing. Experimental results show that our detection algorithm outperforms the conventional one not only because it improves the robustness to normal attacks but also because it can provide the robustness to time-invariant pitch-scale modification.", "paper_title": "Robust Detection Algorithm for Spread Spectrum Audio Watermarking", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078600038"}
