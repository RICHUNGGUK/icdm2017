These problems arise naturally in the DNA clone classification. We investigate the hardness of finding such partitions and provide approximation algorithms. Further, we show that greedy strategies yield constant factor approximations for graph classes for which maximum cliques can be found efficiently.", "paper_title": "On the approximability of maximum and minimum edge clique partition problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250926300003"}
