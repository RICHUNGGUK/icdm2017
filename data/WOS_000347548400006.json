A kind of psi - function is introduced and some criteria on the attractor for the product of the psi - function are obtained. By the new criteria, the almost sure stability with the general decay rate of NSDDEs-MS could be examined, including the exponential stability and the polynomial stability. Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the applications of our results clearly.", "paper_title": "A note on attraction and stability of neutral stochastic delay differential equations with Markovian switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000347548400006"}
