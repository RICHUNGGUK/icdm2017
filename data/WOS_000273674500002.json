In particular, we study the case where structure learning is performed by a simple FOIL-like algorithm, and propose alternative scoring functions for guiding the search process. We present an empirical evaluation on several data sets in the single-task as well as in the multi-task setting.", "paper_title": "Fast learning of relational kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000273674500002"}
