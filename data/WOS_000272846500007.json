This paper studies the natural gas industry planning where natural gas is used to produce chemical products in the upper course of the Yangtze River in China. We identify the main uncertainty factors that affecting planning, and then model and analyze them using rough set, dynamic system and multiple objective programming theories. Thus, we develop system dynamic-rough multiple objective programming (SD-RMOP) models to plan and develop natural gas industry operations in this region. We then carry out a simulation experiment using optimized parameters from SD-RMOP. We compare performance from different models and show how decision-making is improved by the insight the model provides.
