In its adjacent only version (AQMSTP), interaction costs only apply for edges that share an endpoint. Motivated by the weak lower bounds provided by formulations in the literature, we present a new linear integer programming formulation for AQMSTP. In addition to decision variables assigned to the edges, it also makes use of variables assigned to the stars of G. In doing so, the model is naturally linear (integer), without the need of implementing usual linearization steps, and its linear programming relaxation better estimates the interaction costs between edges. We also study a reformulation derived from the new model, obtained by projecting out the decision variables associated with the stars. Two exact solution approaches are presented: a branch-and-cut-and-price algorithm, based on the first formulation, and a branch-and-cut algorithm, based on its projection. Our computational results indicate that the lower bounds introduced here are much stronger than previous bounds in the literature. Being designed for the adjacent only case, our duality gaps are one order of magnitude smaller than the Gilmore-Lawler lower bounds for AQMSTP. As a result, the two exact algorithms introduced here outperform the previous exact solution approaches in the literature. In particular, the branch-and-cut method we propose managed to solve AQMSTP instances with as many as 50 vertices to proven optimality. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
