An improved varactor tuning technique is proposed to decrease low frequency noise up-conversion and AM-FM phase noise of VCO, also it can increase Q of LC tank and reduce power consumption of VCO. For coarse tuning of VCO, it can increase the varactor control voltage variation range. For fine tuning of VCO, it can reduce the varactor nonlinearity. The measured tuning range is 4.58-5.26 GHz and power consumption is 2.2 mW. The measured phase noise is -114 dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset from a 4.8 GHz carrier.", "paper_title": "A 0.5 V LC-VCO with improved varactor tuning technique for WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000331201500026"}
