With respect to the monotonic switching method, the input common-mode voltage variation reduces which improves the dynamic offset and the parasitic capacitance variation of the comparator. The proposed switchback switching method does not consume any power at the first digital-to-analog converter switching, which can reduce the power consumption and design effort of the reference buffer. The prototype was fabricated in a 90-nm 1P9M CMOS technology. At 1-V supply and 30 MS/s, the ADC achieves an sequenced neighbor double reservation of 56.89 dB and consumes 0.98 mW, resulting in a figure-of-merit (FOM) of 57 fJ/conversion-step. The ADC core occupies an active area of only 190 x 525 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "10-bit 30-MS/s SAR ADC Using a Switchback Switching Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900020"}
