It involves two steps: the first is finding the evidence ( e. g., predicting splice sites) and the second is interpreting the evidence, that is, trying to determine the whole gene structure by assembling its pieces. In this paper, we suggest a combinatorial solution to the second step, which is also referred to as the \"Exon Assembly Problem.\" We use a similarity-based approach that aims to produce a single gene structure based on similarities to a known homologous sequence. We target the sparse case, where filtering has been applied to the data, resulting in a set of O(n) candidate exon blocks. Our algorithm yields an O(n(2)root n) solution.", "paper_title": "On the complexity of sparse exon assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000238488100002"}
