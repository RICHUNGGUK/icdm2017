This paper presents an exploratory case study of VV&UQ techniques applied on models integrated in aircraft system simulators at Saab Aeronautics and in driving simulators at the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI). Results show that a large number of Verification and Validation (V&V) techniques are applied, some of which are promising for further development and use in simulator credibility assessment. Regarding the application of UQ, a large gap between academia and this part of industry has been identified, and simplified methods are needed. The applicability of the NASA Credibility Assessment Scale (CAS) at the studied organizations is also evaluated and it can be concluded that the CAS is considered to be a usable tool for achieving a uniform level of V&V for all models included in a simulator, although its implementation at the studied organizations requires tailoring and coordination.", "paper_title": "Study of industrially applied methods for verification, validation and uncertainty quantification of simulator models", "paper_id": "WOS:000365772300005"}
