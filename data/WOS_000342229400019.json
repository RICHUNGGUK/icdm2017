Furthermore, quality-of-service (QoS) support can be achieved by some distinguished ways in WMN. In this paper, QoS requirements are recorded by traffic profile, QoS constraints are formulated as delay time of transmitting all the requested data flows in the network. Multi-commodity flow technologies are applied for handling this issue. After minimizing the delay of the network by the assistance of multi-commodity-flow techniques and resource contention graph, we use effective channel assignment algorithm to schedule the data flows under the QoS constraints. Our evaluation indicates that our technologies successfully route flows under their special QoS requirements with different priority.", "paper_title": "Delay minimization and priority scheduling in wireless mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342229400019"}
