This causes that the complexity of SOC testing is much higher than that of conventional VLSI chip testing. One of the SOC test challenges is the test data reduction. This paper presents a multi-code compression (MCC) technique to reduce the volume of test data and the test application time. A multi-code decompressor for recovering the compressed test data is also proposed. Experimental results show that the MCC scheme can achieve higher compression ratio than single-code compression schemes. The area cost of the proposed multi-code decompressor is small-only about 3498 mu m(2) hased on TSMC 0.18 mu m standard cell technology.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Code Compression Scheme for Test Time Reduction of System-on-Chip Designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400400006"}
