This definition, however, does not sufficiently describe what an action is. What is the unit of selection in the first place? We maintain that the artificial intelligence (AI) accounts of AS typically mix and merge two AS situations that indeed are qualitatively different. Most of the accounts actually deal only with one type of AS but purport to cover both types of AS. We propose three dimensions along which the commonalities and the differences between various AS accounts can be analyzed, and use these for a preliminary conceptualization of what we call a two-system action selection account. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different AS situations whose architectures, we suggest, can be designed inspired by neuroscience models of the basal ganglia (BG) and the cerebellum, respectively.", "paper_title": "Levels and Types of Action Selection: The Action Selection Soup", "paper_id": "WOS:000271946800005"}
