The stiffness matrix for such regular structures can easily be inverted using their eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Many non-regular structures can be converted to regular forms. Here the presented method solves not only all the regular forms but also non-regular forms convertible to regular ones. The efficiency of the method is more significant when it is used in reanalyzing and rehabilitating structures where the stiffness matrix should be inverted in each step. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
