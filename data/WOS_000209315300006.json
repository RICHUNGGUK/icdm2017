Within the architecture each cluster is composed of general purpose processors or digital signal processors, along with a memory. To maintain the coherence of the memory a hardware memory management unit is added in the cluster to increase the performance and support an on-chip message passing communication. The hardware memory management unit has the capacity to allocate, control and limit the access to the memory. In order to show the benefit of our architecture a performance comparison over a classical flat architecture and against a state of the art architecture is driven. The results show an improvement that ranges from 1.2 to 21.77% over these two architectural models. Finally the hardware cost overhead is studied.", "paper_title": "Cluster based MPSoC architecture: an on-chip message passing implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000209315300006"}
