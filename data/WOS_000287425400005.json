Such node sets provide both geometric flexibility and opportunities for local node refinement. In spite of requiring a somewhat larger total number of nodes for the same accuracy, RBF-generated finite difference (RBF-FD) methods can offer significant savings in computer resources (time and memory). This study presents a new filter mechanism, allowing such gains to be realized also for purely convective PDEs that do not naturally feature any stabilizing dissipation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
