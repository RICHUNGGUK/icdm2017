This paper shows the fact that the rank reversal phenomenon occurs not only in the AHP but also in many other decision making approaches such as the Borda-Kendall (BK) method for aggregating ordinal preferences, the simple additive weighting (SAW) method, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method, and the cross-efficiency evaluation method in data envelopment analysis (DEA). Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the rank reversal phenomenon in these popular decision making approaches. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
