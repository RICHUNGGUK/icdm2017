In this environment, processing in real-time is required for mobile application. For colored paper mosaic application on mobile devices, the problem regarding speed must be solved while maintaining high-quality. In this paper, we propose an accelerated method that generates tiles based on their position. We locate tiles by considering the edges of the image and the shapes of neighbor tiles. The shape of the tiles is determined based on the position of each tile. In addition, we display the generation process of a result for our method be seemed real-time method. In here, we propose an ordering method that is similar to the ordering method of humans by considering color, edge, distance and direction.", "paper_title": "Efficient paper mosaic rendering on mobile devices based on position-based tiling", "paper_id": "WOS:000340600300014"}
