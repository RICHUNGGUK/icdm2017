We also discuss the fuzzy additivity of the Sugeno, integral for real functions. For these two kinds of additivity, we obtain two necessary and sufficient conditions, a sufficient condition, a necessary condition and several counter examples.", "paper_title": "The absolute additivity and fuzzy additivity of Sugeno integral", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100038"}
