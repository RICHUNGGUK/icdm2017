Recently, results for evolutionary algorithms, reinforcement learning and neural networks have been reported which indicate that the simultaneous consideration of randomness and opposition is more advantageous than pure randomness. This new scheme, called opposition-based learning, has the apparent effect of accelerating soft computing algorithms. This paper mathematically and also experimentally proves this advantage and, as an application, applies that to accelerate differential evolution ( DE). By taking advantage of random numbers and their opposites, the optimization, search or learning process in many soft computing techniques can be accelerated when there is no a priori knowledge about the solution. The mathematical proofs and the results of conducted experiments confirm each other. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
