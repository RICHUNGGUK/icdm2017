Inspired by the human memory and its natural recall characteristics, we build a personal photo revisitation tool, PhotoPrev, to facilitate users to revisit previous photos through associated memory cues. To mimic users' episodic memory recall, we present a way to automatically generate an abundance of related contextual metadata (e.g., weather, temperature) and organize them as context lattices for each photo in a life cycle. Meanwhile, photo content (e.g., object, text) is extracted and managed in a weighted term list, which corresponds to semantic memory. A threshold algorithm based photo revisitation framework for context- and content-based keyword search on a personal photo collection, together with a user feedback mechanism, is also given. We evaluate the scalability on a large synthetic dataset by crawling users' photos from Flickr, and a 12-week user study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of our photo revisitation strategies.", "paper_title": "PhotoPrev: Unifying Context and Content Cues to Enhance Personal Photo Revisitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000354101800003"}
