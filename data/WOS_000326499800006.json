A DM's attitudes are expressed in her or his consideration of her own preferences, as well as those of her opponents. Understanding these attitudes is essential to having a grasp on the possible outcomes of a given conflict. However, these attitudes are often difficult to represent and even more difficult to encode effectively within a decision support system. Therefore, a matrix representation, which constitutes a more efficient way of expressing attitudes in a programming environment, is developed in this research.", "paper_title": "A Matrix Representation of Attitudes in Conflicts", "paper_id": "WOS:000326499800006"}
