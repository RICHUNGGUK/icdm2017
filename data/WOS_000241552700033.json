It shows that both problems can be solved by the Sylvester/Lyapunov algebraic equation. The Sylvester/Lyapunov equation has been extensively studied in Control Theory and it can be efficiently solved by well known numeric algorithms. This paper proposes the use of these equations in image processing and describes simple and fast algorithms for image denoising and reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Image denoising using the Lyapunov equation from non-uniform samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700033"}
