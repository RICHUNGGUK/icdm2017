In singular learning machines, the Bayesian learning provides the better generalization performance than the maximum likelihood estimation. However, it needs huge computational cost to realize the Bayesian posterior distribution by the conventional Monte Carlo method. In this paper, we propose that the exchange Monte Carlo method is appropriate for the Bayesian learning in singular learning machines, and experimentally show that it provides better generalization performance in the Bayesian learning of a normal mixture model than the conventional Monte Carlo method.", "paper_title": "Generalization performance of exchange Monte Carlo method for normal mixture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900015"}
