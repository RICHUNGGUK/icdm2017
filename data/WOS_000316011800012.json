CAA poses significant challenges for researchers because the computational schemes used in the CFD tools should have high accuracy, good spectral resolution, and low dispersion and diffusion errors. A high-order compact finite difference scheme, which is implicit in space, can be used for such simulations because it fulfills the requirements for CAA. Usually, this method is parallelized using a transposition scheme; however, that approach has a high communication overhead. In this paper, we discuss the use of a parallel tridiagonal linear system solver based on the truncated SPIKE algorithm for reducing the communication overhead in our large eddy simulations. We present theoretical performance analysis and report experimental results collected on two parallel computing platforms.", "paper_title": "A communication-efficient linear system solver for large eddy simulation of jet engine noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000316011800012"}
