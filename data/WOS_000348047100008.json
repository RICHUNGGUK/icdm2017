A wearable sensor device is a computer that is subsumed into the personal space of the user, and is always on, and always accessible. Therefore, among the most salient aspects of a wearable sensor device should be a small form factor, long battery lifetime, and real-time characteristics. Thereby, sophisticated applications of a wearable sensor device use real-time operating systems to guarantee real-time deadlines. The deterministic multi-dimensional task scheduling algorithms are implemented on ARC (Actual Remote Control) with relatively limited hardware resources. ARC is a wearable wristwatch-type remote controller; it can also serve as a universal remote control, for various wearable sensor devices. In the proposed algorithms, there is no limit on the maximum number of task priorities, and the memory requirement can be dramatically reduced. Furthermore, regardless of the number of tasks, the complexity of the time and space of the proposed algorithms is O(1). A valuable contribution of this work is to guarantee real-time deadlines for wearable sensor devices.", "paper_title": "Deterministic Multi-dimensional Task Scheduling Algorithms for Wearable Sensor Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047100008"}
