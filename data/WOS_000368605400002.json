The purpose of the application is to provide information to enable consumers to consider emissions as they schedule their energy use. This tool provides one mechanism for demand-side optimization through optimal timing of energy use for environmental benefit. The application relies on a model that estimates air emission rates of user-selected pollutants based on real-time spatially accurate information on the electric grid. The development of this smartphone application, its potential use, and opportunities for future improvement are presented. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
