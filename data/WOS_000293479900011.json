In this paper, we propose an identity-based (ID-based) digital watermarking protocol and point out several previously unpublished flaws in Hwang et al. (2005)'s scheme. We hope that by identifying the design flaws, similar structural mistakes can be avoided in future designs. We also claim that our proposed digital watermarking scheme can effectively solve the problem of multiple claims of ownership, and is suitable for any practical and secure watermarking algorithm.
