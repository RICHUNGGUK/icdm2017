The best previously known algorithm, due to Bergkvist and Damaschke, runs in O(nl + k(2)l(2)) time. In this paper, we propose an O(n + k(2)l log l)-time algorithm for it. We also give an optimal algorithm for a related problem raised by Lin et al. in 2003, where the goal is to locate k disjoint maximum-density segments in a given sequence.", "paper_title": "On Locating Disjoint Segments with Maximum Sum of Densities", "paper_id": "WOS:000265144400006"}
