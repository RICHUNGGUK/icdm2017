To this end, the respective model is defined in an easy and straightforward way using the Mathematica package SARAH. SARAH then generates model files for CalcHep which can be used with micrOMEGAs as well as model files for WHIZARD and O' mega. In addition, Fortran source code for SPheno is created which facilitates the determination of the particle spectrum using two-loop renormalization group equations and one-loop corrections to the masses. As an additional feature, the generated SPheno code can write out input files suitable for use with HiggsBounds to apply bounds coming from the Higgs searches to the model. Combining all programs provides a closed chain from model building to phenomenology. Program summary Program title: SUSY Phenomenology toolbox. Catalog identifier: AEMN_v 1_0.

No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 1319681. Distribution format: tar.gz. Programming language: Autoconf, Mathematica. Computer: PC running Linux, Mac. Operating system: Linux, Mac OS. Classification: 11.6. Nature of problem: Comprehensive studies of supersymmetric models beyond the MSSM is considerably complicated by the number of different tasks that have to be accomplished, including the calculation of the mass spectrum and the implementation of the model into tools for performing collider studies, calculating the dark matter density and checking the compatibility with existing collider bounds (in particular, from the Higgs searches). Solution method: The presented scripts create a framework for the study of SUSY models using the public codes SARAH, SPheno, WHIZARD, CalcHep, MicrOmegas, HiggsBounds and SSP. This includes the download, the configuration and the installation of different tools as well as a script to automatically implement new models into these codes. Unusual features: The study of extended SUSY models is considerably simplified, with the precision of the spectrum calculation matching the precision usually achieved for the MSSM. Running time: Tested on Lenovo X220: The download, configuration and building the tools take 7 min and 40s. The time needed for the implementation of new models depends on the model under consideration: It takes 42 min for the MSSM including the compilation of all parts. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
