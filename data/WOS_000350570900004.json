In particular these authors compute the purity or grade filtration of a f.g. module by homological means and discuss its significance for the associated behavior. Pommaret and Quadrat noted this significance already in 1999. In this note it is shown that over an arbitrary commutative noetherian ring of operators the purity filtration of a finitely generated module can be easily computed by means of the the primary decomposition of its zero submodule and indeed, with smaller complexity, by inductively computing equidimensional parts. In most books on Constructive Commutative Algebra the connection between this primary decomposition, the equidimensional parts and the purity filtration is implicitly stated for cyclic modules. For many commutative rings of operators the standard signal modules are injective cogenerators. In this case the purity filtration of the module gives rise to a corresponding filtration of the dual behavior, and the primary decomposition induces additional sum representations of the pure dimensional factors of this filtration. For non-commutative rings of operators the standard signal modules are in general neither injective nor cogenerators, and for such signal modules the usefulness of the purity filtration of the module for the determination of the behavior and its structural properties is not obvious. It is also shown by a counter-example that dimensional purity of the module or behavior does not imply dimensional purity of the initial conditions according to Riquier of the associated homogeneous Cauchy problem.", "paper_title": "The computation of purity filtrations over commutative noetherian rings of operators and their application to behaviors", "paper_id": "WOS:000350570900004"}
