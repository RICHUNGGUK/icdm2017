It offers an array of immunoinformatics tools covering MHC genotyping, epitope and neoepitope prediction, epitope selection for vaccine design, and epitope assembly. In its recently re-implemented version 2.0, EpiToolKit provides a range of new functionality and for the first time allows combining tools into complex workflows. For inexperienced users it offers simplified interfaces to guide the users through the analysis of complex immunological data sets.", "paper_title": "EpiToolKit-a web-based workbench for vaccine design", "paper_id": "WOS:000357425800022"}
