The new schemes are compared to those already in the literature and results demonstrating the advantage of our best scheme are given for CH5+. We find that the best scheme parallelizes over a single quadrature index. This enables one to exploit the favorable scaling product basis matrix-vector products. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
