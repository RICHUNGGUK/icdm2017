The basis of our proposed algorithm is none other than the necessary and sufficient conditions that one deals within a discrete constrained local optimum in the context of the discrete Lagrange multipliers theory. We adopt a revised particle swarm optimization algorithm and extend it toward solving nonlinear programming problems with continuous decision variables. To measure the merits of our algorithm, we provide numerical experiments for several renowned benchmark problems and compare the outcome against the best results reported in the literature. The empirical assessments demonstrate that our algorithm is efficient and robust. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
