Good documentation is required to permit people to understand ontologies and thus employ them correctly, but this is costly to create by tradition authorship methods, and is thus inefficient to create in this way until an ontology has matured into a stable structure. The authors describe three tools, LODE, Parrot and the OWLDoc-based Ontology Browser, that can be used automatically to create documentation from a well-formed OWL ontology at any stage of its development. They contrast their properties and then report on the authors' evaluation of their effectiveness and usability, determined by two task-based user testing sessions.", "paper_title": "Tools for the Automatic Generation of Ontology Documentation: A Task-Based Evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000323380800002"}
