There are two categories of recommender systems; memory-based and model-based systems. In this paper we propose a personalized recommender system for the next page prediction that is based on a hybrid model from both categories. The generalized patterns generated by a model based techniques are tailored to specific users by integrating user profiles generated from the traditional memory-based system's user-item matrix. The suggested system offered a significant improvement in prediction speed over traditional model-based usage mining systems, while also offering an average improvement in the system accuracy and system precision by 0.27% and 2.35%, respectively.", "paper_title": "A Personalized Recommender System Based on a Hybrid Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000329491500005"}
