SNNs offer the possibility to implement embedded neuromorphic circuits, with high parallelism and low power consumption compared to the traditional von Neumann computer paradigms. Nevertheless, the lack of modularity and poor connectivity shown by traditional neuron interconnect implementations based on shared bus topologies is prohibiting scalable hardware implementations of SNNs. This paper presents a novel hierarchical network-on-chip (H-NoC) architecture for SNN hardware, which aims to address the scalability issue by creating a modular array of clusters of neurons using a hierarchical structure of low and high-level routers. The proposed H-NoC architecture incorporates a spike traffic compression technique to exploit SNN traffic patterns and locality between neurons, thus reducing traffic overhead and improving throughput on the network. In addition, adaptive routing capabilities between clusters balance local and global traffic loads to sustain throughput under bursting activity. Analytical results show the scalability of the proposed H-NoC approach under different scenarios, while simulation and synthesis analysis using 65-nm CMOS technology demonstrate high-throughput, low-cost area, and power consumption per cluster, respectively.", "paper_title": "Scalable Hierarchical Network-on-Chip Architecture for Spiking Neural Network Hardware Implementations", "paper_id": "WOS:000326501400014"}
