First of all, this method partitions a 360A degrees omni-image into eight 45A degrees omni-image sectors. Then, we partition the pano-mapping table into eight regions accordingly, with each pano-mapping table region corresponding to exactly one omni-image sector. We analyze the geometric symmetry relationship among these omni-image sectors and pano-mapping table regions. We find that if we know the mapping data in any one pano-mapping table region, it is easy to calculate the mapping data of the other seven pano-mapping table regions. Thus, in the final step, we perform omni-image unwarping based on only one pano-mapping table region, which reduces pano-mapping table size by seven-eighths. Reducing the pano-mapping size is very useful for implementing omni-image unwarping in embedded systems. Experiments on TI DSP-based embedded systems indicate that the proposed method reduces seven-eighths of pano-mapping table size, and improves the unwarping speed by a factor of 2.74.", "paper_title": "Efficient omni-image unwarping using geometric symmetry", "paper_id": "WOS:000305220500009"}
