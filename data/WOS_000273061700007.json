We examine random subgraphs of H(2, n) in percolation with edge probability p, in such a way that the average degree satisfies 2(n - 1)p = 1 + epsilon. Previous work [8] has shown that in the barely supercritical region n(-2/3) In(1/3) n << epsilon << 1, the largest component satisfies a law of large numbers with mean 2 epsilon n. Here we show that the second largest component has, with high probability, size bounded by 2(8)epsilon(-2) log(n(2)epsilon(3)), so that the dominant component has emerged. This result also suggests that a discrete duality principle holds, where, after removing the largest connected component in the supercritical regime, the remaining random subgraphs behave as in the subcritical regime.
