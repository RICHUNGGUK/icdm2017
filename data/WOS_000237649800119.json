Disorders such as Primary Raynaud's phenomenon, progressive systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis were detected in more than 80% of adult patients, by analyzing such high resolution images. Internet computing and grid technologies promise to change the way we tackle complex problems. Grid computing environments are characterized by interconnecting a number of heterogeneous hosts in geographically distributed domains. They enable large-scale aggregation and sharing of computational, data and other resources across institutional boundaries. In this paper, we discuss and develop a framework for nailfold capillary microscope image acquisition and analysis, using computational power provided by grid platforms. In this way, not only useful medical information can be extracted from large amount of history anamneses in an efficient way, with the use of a number of adequate techniques and methods in high performance computing, but also to diagnose abnormal nailfold capillary in far shorter time, to diagnose patient's disease in real-time basis. Based on the results of the classification, analysis of history anamneses are done to discover updated health information possibly hidden in patients' medical records.", "paper_title": "Nailfold capillary Microscopy high-resolution image analysis framework for connective tissue disease diagnosis using grid computing technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000237649800119"}
