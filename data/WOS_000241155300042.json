For recommending restaurants, Personal Digital Assistants or cellular phones only consider the location of restaurants. However, a user's background and environment information is assumed to be directly related to recommendation quality. In this paper, therefore, a recommender system using context information and a decision tree model for efficient recommendation is presented. This system considers location context, personal context, environment context, and user preference. Restaurant lists are obtained from location context, personal context, and environment context using the decision tree model. In addition, a weight value is used for reflecting user preferences. Finally, the system recommends appropriate restaurants to the mobile user. For this experiment, performance was verified using measurements such as k-fold cross-validation and Mean Absolute Error. As a result, the proposed system obtained an improvement in recommendation performance.", "paper_title": "Location-based service with context data for a restaurant recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300042"}
