The efficiency of the solution is measured by a number of criteria: total energy consumption, total transport capacity, latency and quality of the transmissions. We present a number of different constructions with various tradeoffs between aforementioned parameters. We provide theoretical performance analysis for our approaches, present their distributed implementation and discuss the different aspects of using each. We show that in many cases our output-sensitive approximation solution performs better than the currently known best results for sensor networks. We also consider our problem under the mobile sensor nodes environment, when the sensors have no information about each other. The only information a single sensor holds is its current location and future mobility plan. Our simulation results validate the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "Improved structures for data collection in static and mobile wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351523100005"}
