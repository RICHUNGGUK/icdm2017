Each causal poset describes a unique concurrent history, i.e., a set of executions, expressed as sequences or step sequences, that are consistent with it. Moreover, a poset captures all precedence-based invariant relationships between the events in the executions belonging to its concurrent history. However, concurrent histories in general may be too intricate to be described solely in terms of causal posets. In this paper, we introduce and investigate generalised mutex order structures which can capture the invariant causal relationships in any concurrent history consisting of step sequence executions. Each such structure comprises two relations, viz. interleaving/mutex and weak causality. As our main result we prove that each generalised mutex order structure is the intersection of the step sequence executions which are consistent with it.", "paper_title": "Characterising Concurrent Histories", "paper_id": "WOS:000358734200002"}
