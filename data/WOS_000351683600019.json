We discuss and evaluate four algorithms that are non-clairvoyant, that is, they do not know in advance the computation and communication costs. On the one hand, Binomial-stat and Fibonacci-stat are static algorithms that decide in advance which operations will be reduced, without adapting to the environment; they were originally defined for homogeneous settings. On the other hand, Tree-dyn and Non-Commut-Tree-dyn are fully dynamic algorithms, for commutative or non-commutative reductions. We show that these algorithms are approximation algorithms with constant or asymptotic ratios. We assess the relative performance of all four non-clairvoyant algorithms with heterogeneous costs through a set of simulations. Our conclusions hold for a variety of distributions.
