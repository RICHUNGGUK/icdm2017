Based on self-citation data of some journals in JCR and the observed relation between journal impact factor and the self-cited rate, we analyze the possibility that journal editors manipulate impact factors of their journals by raising the self-cited rate. Finally, we make some suggestions for supervising this crude way of active manipulating the impact factor.", "paper_title": "The self-cited rate of scientific journals and the manipulation of their impact factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000251368500006"}
