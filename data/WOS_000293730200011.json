Identity-based key-insulated signature can successfully reduce the damage caused by key-exposure, and thus attracts the researchers' great interest. In this paper, we study the problem of how to generically construct identity-based strong key-insulated signature, and proposed a generic construction of identity-based strong key-insulated signature schemes from two-level hierarchical identity-based signature.", "paper_title": "Generic Construction of Identity-Based Strong Key-Insulated Signature", "paper_id": "WOS:000293730200011"}
