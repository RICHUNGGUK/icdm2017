Three probe designs with 8, 9, and 17 electrodes, respectively, were analyzed through finite element method based simulations. One mm diameter spherical inclusions (sigma(inclusion) = 1 S/m) are positioned at various locations within a hemispherical background (sigma(inclusion) = 0.1 S/m) of radius 5 mm. An 8-electrode configuration is not able to localize the inclusion at these positions while 9 and 17-electrode configurations are able to accurately reconstruct the inclusion at maximum depth of 1 mm and 3 mm, respectively. All three probe designs were constructed and evaluated using saline phantoms and ex vivo porcine and human prostate tissues. The 17-electrode probe performed best in saline phantom studies, accurately reconstructing high contrast, 1-mm-diameter metal cylindrical inclusions in a saline bath (sigma(saline) = 0.1 S/m) with a position and area error of 0.46 mm and 0.84 mm(2), respectively. Additionally, the 17-electrode probe was able to adequately distinguish cancerous from benign tissues in three ex vivo human prostates. Simulations, bench-top saline experiments, and ex vivo tissue sampling suggest that for intraoperative surgical margin assessment during RALP, the 17-electrode probe (as compared to an 8 and 9 electrode probe) will be necessary to provide sufficient accuracy and sensitivity.", "paper_title": "3D Microendoscopic Electrical Impedance Tomography for Margin Assessment During Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Prostatectomy", "paper_id": "WOS:000357614300015"}
