Based on two-dimensional spectrochromatograms obtained from HPLC-DAD-MS, multicomponent spectral correlative chromatography (MSCC) algorithm was used to detect the common components in chromatographic fingerprints from A. sinensis and rabbit plasma samples after AS administration. This procedure was introduced particularly to detect whether two overlapping peaks were spectrally correlated with each other. The results have shown that the proposed method makes the common components found in different chromatographic fingerprints more efficient and reliable, especially for the cocluted or unknown compounds within some chromatographic peak clusters. With the help of MSCC algorithm upon the chromatographic fingerprints of both AS and rabbit plasma samples after AS administration, it was found that over 40 chemical ingredients in AS were absorbed into rabbit body after AS administration.
