The smoothness refers to two aspects: the contour fairness of CL trajectory and the machining stability of the machine tool. To obtain contour fairness, the optimised knots combination strategy (OKCS) is proposed in least square NURBS fitting from short linear segments, which generates NURBS curve for the next interpolating process. Sequentially, an axis-based look-ahead NURBS interpolator (ALANI) is designed for NURBS interpolation in order to improve the machining stability according to the kinematic limit. Both OKCS and ALANI are simulated and compared with congener algorithms, respectively. Furthermore, algorithms are implemented on digital signal processor (DSP) platform, and actual machining examples are presented at last.", "paper_title": "Smooth non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) machining with kinematic limit for short linear segments", "paper_id": "WOS:000299881400003"}
