Some recommendation systems have been developed in attempt to relieve these problems. However, all these systems lack information pertaining to real-time traffic as well as the ability of personalization. In this research, we have developed a novel route recommendation system to provide self-drive tourists with real-time personalized route recommendations. This will help to reduce the traffic jams and queuing time in tourist hot spots. It will also help to personalize visiting routes based on the user's specific preferences. Ultimately, based on the evaluation results given by experienced self-drive tourists, we have shown that the proposed system not only saves total visiting time, but also meets their specific visiting preferences.
