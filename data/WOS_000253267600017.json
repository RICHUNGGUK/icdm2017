Under natural assumptions, it is shown that solutions possess as much differentiability with respect to the data as do the terms appearing in the equation. The derivatives are shown to satisfy the appropriate sensitivity equations. The theoretical results are illustrated with an example. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
