We have implemented this attack using Python. We use an easily computable statistical function to find the period of the cipher, and then the key-table is generated in a fairly efficient way. The process is directed in a way that strongly narrows the search space of possible solutions. This results in a feasible attack to a Bifid cryptogram, provided that its length is sufficient for accurate statistical analysis.", "paper_title": "Automated ciphertext-only cryptanalysis of the Bifid cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000245931200003"}
