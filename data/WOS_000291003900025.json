When the number of keyholes or/and the number of Tx/Rx antennas is large, there is an equivalent Rayleigh-fading channel such that the outage capacities of both channels are asymptotically equal. In the case of a large number of antennas and for a broad class of fading distributions, the instantaneous capacity is shown to be asymptotically Gaussian in distribution, and compact, closed-form expressions for the mean and variance are given. Motivated by the asymptotic analysis, a simple, full-ordering scalar measure of spatial correlation and power imbalance in MIMO channels is introduced, which quantifies the negative impact of these two factors on the outage capacity in a simple and well-tractable way. It does not require the eigenvalue decomposition, and has the full-ordering property. The size-asymptotic results are used to prove Telatar's conjecture for semi-correlated multi-keyhole and Rayleigh channels. Since the keyhole channel model approximates well the relay channel in the amplify-and-forward mode in certain scenarios, these results also apply to the latter.", "paper_title": "From Multi-Keyholes to Measure of Correlation and Power Imbalance in MIMO Channels: Outage Capacity Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000291003900025"}
