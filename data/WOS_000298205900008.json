The main contribution of this paper is an effective data association approach, the Line-segment Relation Matching (LRM) technique, which is based on a generation and exploration of an Interpretation Tree (IT). A new representation of geometric patterns of line-segments is proposed for the first time, which is called as Relation Table. It contains relative geometric positions of every line-segment respect to the others (or itself) in a coordinate-frame independent sense. Based on that, a Relation-Table-constraint is applied to minimize the searching space of IT therefore greatly reducing the processing time of LRM. The Least Square algorithm is further applied to estimate the robot pose using matched line-segment pairs. Then a global localization system can be realized based on our LRM technique integrated with a hypothesis tracking framework which is able to handle pose ambiguity. Sufficient simulations were specially designed and carried out indicating both pluses and minuses of our system compared with former methods. We also presented the practical experiments illustrating that our approach has a high robustness against uncertainties from sensor occlusions and extraneous observation in a highly dynamic environment. Additionally our system was demonstrated to easily deal with initialization and have the ability of quick recovery from a localization failure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
