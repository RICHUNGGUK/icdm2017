These completely regular codes are extensions of linear completely regular codes with covering radius 1, which we also classify. For rho = 2, we give a list of all such codes known to us. This also gives the characterization of two weight linear antipodal codes. Finally, for a class of completely regular codes with covering radius rho = 2 and antipodal dual, some interesting properties on self-duality and lifted codes are pointed out.", "paper_title": "ON q-ARY LINEAR COMPLETELY REGULAR CODES WITH rho=2 AND ANTIPODAL DUAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000283841300007"}
