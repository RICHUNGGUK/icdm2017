This method is based on Rothe's approximation in time discretisation and on the wavelet-Galerkin in the spatial discretisation. For comparison of wavelets, we use sin-cos, Legendre and Daubechies wavelets as basis in projection methods. For showing efficiency of method, a numerical experiment, for which the exact solution is known, is considered.", "paper_title": "New Rothe-wavelet method for solving telegraph equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000302231300014"}
