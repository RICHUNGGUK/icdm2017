To speed up the development process and make it as transparent as possible to the programmer, parallelism is exploited through the use of Application Programming Interfaces (API). However, each one of these API implements different ways to exchange data using shared memory regions, and by consequence, they have different levels of energy consumption. In this paper, considering general purpose and embedded systems, we show how each API influences the performance, energy consumption and Energy-Delay Product. For example, Pthreads consumes 12 % less energy on average than OpenMP and MPI considering all benchmarks. We also demonstrate that the difference in Energy-Delay Product (EDP) among the APIs can be of up to 81 %, while the level of efficiency (e.g.: performance or energy consumption per core) changes as the number of threads increases, depending on whether the system is embedded or general purpose.", "paper_title": "Performance and Energy Evaluation of Different Multi-Threading Interfaces in Embedded and General Purpose Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353048300005"}
