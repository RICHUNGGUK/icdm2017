It is described as a two-stage model. In the first stage, we extract the multi-scale gist features that represent the structural information of the building images. Since the MS-gist features are extrinsically high dimensional and intrinsically low dimensional, in the second stage, an enhanced fuzzy local maximal marginal embedding (EFLMME) algorithm is proposed to project MS-gist feature manifold to low-dimensional subspace. EFLMME aims to preserve local intra-class geometry and maximize local interclass margin separability of MS-gist feature manifold of different classes at the same time. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, experiments were carried out on the Sheffield buildings database, compared with the existing works: (a) the visual gist based building recognition model (VGBR) and (b) the hierarchical building recognition model (HBR). Moreover, EFLMME is evaluated on Sheffield buildings database compared with some linear dimensionality reduction methods. The results show that the proposed model is superior to other models in practice of building recognition and can handle the building recognition problem caused by rotations, variant lighting conditions and occlusions very well.
