Assuming only the standard transversality condition (or a weaker version thereof), we prove local linear convergence. When the two sets are semi-algebraic and bounded, but not necessarily transversal, we nonetheless prove subsequence convergence.", "paper_title": "Transversality and Alternating Projections for Nonconvex Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000363243400007"}
