By using only such short-term information, schedulers ignore the users' service history in previous cells and, thus, cannot guarantee long-term quality of service (QoS) when users traverse multiple cells with varying load and capacity. In this paper, we propose a new long-term lookback scheduling (LLS) framework, which extends conventional short-term scheduling with long-term (QoS) information from previously traversed cells. We demonstrate the application of (LLS) for common channel aware, as well as channel and queue-aware schedulers. The developed long-term schedulers also provide a controllable trade-off between emphasizing the immediate user (QoS) or the long-term measures. Our simulation results show high gains in long-term (QoS) without sacrificing short-term user requirements. Therefore, the proposed scheduling approach improves subscriber satisfaction and increases operational efficiency.
