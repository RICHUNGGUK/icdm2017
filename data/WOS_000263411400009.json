In this paper, we propose a new method to create urban pedestrian flows (UPF) mobility scenarios, which reproduce the walking behavior of pedestrians in urban areas. From given densities of pedestrians observed at several points, our method derives a UPF mobility scenario that reproduces the walking behavior of pedestrians consistent with the observed densities, using linear programming techniques. We have developed a network simulator Mobi-REAL to design and evaluate MANET protocols and applications with this realistic mobility model. MobiREAL provides various functions and tools including a mobility model to describe the behavior of individual nodes, a GUI to assist with automatic generation of UPF mobility scenarios and a visualization tool. We have conducted sonic experiments using the MobiREAL simulator. Through the experiments, we have investigated the influence of node mobility oil the performance of MANET protocols and have shown the usefulness of our method and the MobiREAL simulator.
