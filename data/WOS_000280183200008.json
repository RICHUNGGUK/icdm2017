Analysis of the principal components exposed the structural characteristics of solutes and solvents that codify interactions which determine the behavior of a chemical in the surrounding media. The pattern revealed by PCA analysis distinguishes solutes according to the molecular size, functional groups, and electrostatic interactions, such as polarity and hydrogen-bonding donor and acceptor properties.", "paper_title": "A General Treatment of Solubility 4.
