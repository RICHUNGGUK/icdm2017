To obtain CP radiation with broad 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth that can cover the WiMAX 2.3 GHz (2305-2320 MHz, 2345-2360 MHz) and WLAN 2.4 GHz (2400-2480 MHz) bands, a novel technique of extending an inverted L-shaped slot from the bottom section of the annular-ring is proposed. To suppress the harmonic modes induced by the CP ARSA, the technique of integrating a defected ground structure into the annular-ring slot is further introduced. From the measured results, 10-dB impedance bandwidth and 3-dB AR bandwidth of 44.86 and 9.68% were achieved by the proposed harmonic suppressed CP ARSA. Furthermore, average gain and radiation efficiency of approximate to 4.7 dBic and 71%, respectively, were also exhibited across the bands of interest. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
