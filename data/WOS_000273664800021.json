First we introduce some hypotheses on phi, under which we prove that there is a unique solution of (*) when G is a single function. Based on this result,we obtain an existence theorem for G being a u.s.c. or l.s.c multifunction. Then the existence of an extremal solution of (*) and the relaxation theorem are studied. In the end,we present two examples of PDE to illustrate the application of our results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
