However, mobile devices have a major drawback of limited computing power and resources such as main memory and battery life. Service-based mobile applications are emerged as an efficient solution to overcome this limitation of mobile devices. On the other hand, with the advent of more powerful mobile devices, mobile devices are actively participating as computer nodes and performing enterprise functionality. In this paper, we present a practical framework for dynamically deploying services. With the ever increasing computing power of mobile devices, we project that mobile devices can also be used as computer nodes deploying services. A number of benefits for deploying services on mobile devices existed. In this paper, we define an ecosystem for service-based mobile computing, and present techniques for dynamically deploying services on station nodes and mobile nodes, which are challenging problems. By applying dynamical deployment of services on both station and mobile nodes, the overall quality of the ecosystem can be consistently maintained.", "paper_title": "A Practical Framework for Self-Stabilization in Service-based Mobile Ecosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000327280200008"}
