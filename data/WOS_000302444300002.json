Within the Thomas Fermi approximation, we derive an exact first-order system of differential equations that describes the parameters of the BEC wave function. Using perturbation theory arguments, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the phase, density and width of the condensate. Furthermore, it is found that the observed oscillatory dynamics of the BEC density can even reach a quasi-resonance state when the trap strength varies according to a time-periodic driving term. Finally, the dynamics of a dark soliton on top of a breathing BEC are also briefly discussed. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
