Solving this problem requires the construction of a control strategy that will determine the actions for the AUV based on the current state, as measured by on-board sensors and the historic trajectory (including sensed data) of the AUV. We approach this task by applying plan-based policy-learning, in which a large set of sampled problems are solved using planning and then, from the resulting plans a decision-tree is learned, using an established machine-learning algorithm, which forms the resulting policy. We evaluate our approach in simulation and report on sea trials of a prototype of a learned policy. We indicate some of the lessons learned from this deployed system and further evaluate an extended policy in simulation.", "paper_title": "Policy learning for autonomous feature tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000334407100003"}
