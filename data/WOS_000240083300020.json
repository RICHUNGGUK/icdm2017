The uncertain T-S fuzzy model is converted into uncertain T-S fuzzy region model. A relaxed sufficient condition is derived for robust stabilization by using Lyapunov function approach in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Comparing with other similar conditions, the difficulty of solving LMIs is greatly reduced in this method. The efficiency of the method is illustrated through the simulation of a numerical uncertain fuzzy system.", "paper_title": "Robust stabilization of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems with parametric uncertainties using fuzzy region concept", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300020"}
