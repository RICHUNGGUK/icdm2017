In order to select the superior stocks (alternatives) for investment, a finite number of alternatives have to be ranked considering several and sometimes conflicting criteria that often are vague and have uncertainty conditions. Therefore, we are faced with a special Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) problem. The purpose of this paper is to develop a fuzzy expert system for selecting superior stocks in order to encounter the uncertainty of stock portfolio recommendation and model the recommendation rules which experts at Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE) use for portfolio recommendation. The results of implementing the designed fuzzy expert system at TSE were affirmative. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
