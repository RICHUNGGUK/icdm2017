Successful drug candidates necessarily represent a compromise between the numerous, sometimes competing objectives so that the benefits to patients outweigh potential drawbacks and risks. De novo drug design involves searching an immense space of feasible, druglike molecules to select those with the highest chances of becoming drugs using computational technology. Traditionally, de novo design has focused on designing molecules satisfying a single objective, such as similarity to a known ligand or an interaction score, and ignored the presence of the multiple objectives required for druglike behavior. Recently, methods have appeared in the literature that attempt to design molecules satisfying multiple predefined objectives and thereby produce candidate solutions with a higher chance of serving as viable drug leads. This paper describes the Multiobjective Evolutionary Graph Algorithm (MEGA), a new multiobjective optimization de novo design algorithmic framework that can be used to design structurally diverse molecules satisfying one or more objectives. The algorithm combines evolutionary techniques with graph-theory to directly manipulate graphs and perform an efficient global search for promising solutions. In the Experimental Section we present results from the application of MEGA for designing molecules that selectively bind to a known pharmaceutical target using the ChillScore interaction score family. The primary constraints applied to the design are based on the identified structure of the protein target and a known ligand currently marketed as a drug. A detailed explanation of the key elements of the specific implementation of the algorithm is given, including the methods for obtaining molecular building blocks, evolving the chemical graphs, and scoring the designed molecules. Our findings demonstrate that MEGA can produce structurally diverse candidate molecules representing a wide range of compromises of the supplied constraints and thus can be used as an \"idea generator\" to support expert chemists assigned with the task of molecular design.", "paper_title": "De Novo Drug Design Using Multiobjective Evolutionary Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263658200013"}
