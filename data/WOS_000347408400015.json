In this paper, four balanced accuracy-complexity identification model families are proposed. These models are derived, by selecting different combinations of activation functions in a dedicated neural network design presented in our previous work (Romero-Ugalde et al. in Neurocomputing 101: 170-180. doi: 10.1016/j.neucom.2012.08.013, 2013). The neural network, based on a recurrent three-layer architecture, helps to reduce the number of parameters of the model after the training phase without any loss of estimation accuracy. Even if this reduction is achieved by a convenient choice of the activation functions and the initial conditions of the synaptic weights, it nevertheless leads to a wide range of models among the most encountered in the literature. To validate the proposed approach, three different systems are identified: The first one corresponds to the unavoidable Wiener-Hammerstein system proposed in SYSID2009 as a benchmark; the second system is a flexible robot arm; and the third system corresponds to an acoustic duct.", "paper_title": "Balanced simplicity-accuracy neural network model families for system identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000347408400015"}
