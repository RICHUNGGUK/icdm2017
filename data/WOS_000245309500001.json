In this paper, we propose a wireless XML streaming method designed to provide energy-efficient access to a wireless stream. We construct two hierarchical structures to represent the XML data and their index information, called the XML data tree and XML index tree, respectively. The wireless XML stream is generated by traversing these two structures with some replications. We design three data/index replication strategies (PP, TT, and TP) in the streaming method. We compare the proposed streaming method with a naive method called the (1, X) method both analytically and experimentally. Also, based on our analysis results, we determine the optimal method of replication. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
