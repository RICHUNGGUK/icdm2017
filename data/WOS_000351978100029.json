Neural networks are used to approximate the nonlinearities and indirect adaptive backstepping technique is employed to construct controllers. The designed indirect adaptive neural controllers can suppress chaos in the permanent magnet synchronous motor and guarantee that the position tracking error converges to a small neighborhood of the origin. Compared with the classical backstepping method, the proposed neural controllers' structure is very simple. Simulation results illustrate its effectiveness. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
