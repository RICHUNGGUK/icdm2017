Results reveal that computation savings are a monotonically increasing function of QP and that computation can be significantly reduced for large QPs. This study investigates and compares the computation cost in several mode decision algorithms with asymptotic computation. Experimental results reveal that most of investigated algorithms are only suitable for high bit-rate coding, except for the recently proposed zero-block decision algorithm that is similar to asymptotic computation.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Computation in Mode Decision for H.264/AVC Inter Frame Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000299531400006"}
