The distances in the underlying network form a metric. This result improves the previous bound of O(log |R|), where R is the set of sources. We also present a better constant approximation to the related Access Network Design problem. Our algorithms are randomized and combinatorial. As a subroutine in our algorithm, we use an interesting variant of facility location with lower bounds on the amount of demand an open facility needs to serve. We call this variant load balanced facility location and present a constant factor approximation for it, while relaxing the lower bounds by a constant factor.", "paper_title": "A CONSTANT FACTOR APPROXIMATION FOR THE SINGLE SINK EDGE INSTALLATION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000266018400013"}
