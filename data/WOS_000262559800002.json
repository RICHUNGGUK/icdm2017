The deterministic version of the problem, which assumes that customer locations and demands are known with certainty. is a nonconvex optimization problem. In this work, we focus on a probabilistic extension referred to as the probabilistic CMWP (PCMWP). and consider the situation in which customer locations are randomly distributed according to a bivariate probability distribution. We first formulate the discrete approximation of the problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model in which facilities can be located on a set of candidate points. Then we present three heuristics to solve the problem. Since optimal Solutions cannot be found, we assess the performance of the heuristics using the results obtained by an alternate location-allocation heuristic that is originally developed for the deterministic version of the problem and tailored by us for the PCMWP. The new heuristics depend on the evaluation of the expected distances between facilities and customers, which is possible only for a few number of distance function and probability distribution combinations. We therefore propose approximation methods which make the heuristics applicable for any distance function and probability distribution of customer coordinates. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
