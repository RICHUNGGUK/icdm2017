Theoretical study of the problem has made significant progress recently, which, however, seems not to imply practical algorithms for the problem, yet. Practical algorithms have been developed only for systems with three processors and the techniques seem difficult to extend to systems with more than three processors. This paper offers new observations and introduces new techniques for the multiprocessor job scheduling problem on systems with four processors. A very simple and practical linear time approximation algorithm of ratio bounded by 1.5 is developed for the multi-processor job scheduling problem P (4)|fix|C (max), which significantly improves previous results. Our techniques are also useful for multiprocessor job scheduling problems on systems with more than four processors.", "paper_title": "A simple linear time approximation algorithm for multi-processor job scheduling on four processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000242131200003"}
