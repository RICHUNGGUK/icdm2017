In real life, the facility location-allocation problem often comes with uncertainty for lack of the information about the customers' demands. Within the framework of uncertainty theory, this paper proposes an uncertain facility location-allocation model by means of chance-constraints, in which the customers' demands are assumed to be uncertain variables. An equivalent crisp model is obtained via the -optimistic criterion of the total transportation cost. Besides, a hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed to solve the uncertain facility location-allocation problem, and its viability and effectiveness are illustrated by a numerical example.", "paper_title": "The alpha-cost minimization model for capacitated facility location-allocation problem with uncertain demands", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889600006"}
