Our development relies on the so-called 2-regularity concept, and unifies and extends the previous studies based on this concept. Specifically, in our setting constraints are given by an inclusion, with an arbitrary closed convex set on the right-hand side. Thus, for the second-order analysis, some curvature characterizations of this set near the reference point must be taken into account.", "paper_title": "Necessary optimality conditions for constrained optimization problems under relaxed constraint qualifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000254203500002"}
