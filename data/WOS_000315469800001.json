In predicate encryption, secret keys correspond to predicates and ciphertexts are associated with attributes; the secret key SK (f) corresponding to a predicate f can be used to decrypt a ciphertext associated with attribute I if and only if f(I)=1. Constructions of such schemes are currently known only for certain classes of predicates. We construct a scheme for predicates corresponding to the evaluation of inner products over a\"currency sign (N) (for some large integer N). This, in turn, enables constructions in which predicates correspond to the evaluation of disjunctions, polynomials, CNF/DNF formulas, thresholds, and more. Besides serving as a significant step forward in the theory of predicate encryption, our results lead to a number of applications that are interesting in their own right.", "paper_title": "Predicate Encryption Supporting Disjunctions, Polynomial Equations, and Inner Products", "paper_id": "WOS:000315469800001"}
