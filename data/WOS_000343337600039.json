Unlike other kernel feature extraction methods, this method chooses the best principal component vectors according to the maximal Renyi entropy rather than judging by the top eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the kernel matrix simply. Besides, it can denoise and anti-disturb due to the application of wavelet transform. The proposed method is applied to process monitoring in the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process and the fault identification is realized. The simulation results indicate that the proposed method is more feasible and efficient in comparing to KPCA method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
