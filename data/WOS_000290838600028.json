By applying Lyapunov functional and free-weighting matrix, delay-dependent/independent passivity criteria are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities. The results herein include existing ones for neural networks without Markovian switching as special cases. An example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed criteria.
