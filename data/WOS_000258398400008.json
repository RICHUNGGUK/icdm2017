Such mechanism is due to a net flow of information from the input system (measurement object), through the physical apparatus interacting with the object (measurement probe), into some environment, the latter representing all those degrees of freedom which are not directly accessible by the experimenter. For this reason, the phenomenon of state reduction induced by the measurement process generally entails an irreversible state change. The aim of our contribution is to answer the following questions(a): how much information a measurement is able to extract? \"How much\" irreversible is the state reduction due to a particular measurement process? In which way information gain and irreversibility are related?.", "paper_title": "Information extraction versus irreversibility in quantum measurement processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400008"}
