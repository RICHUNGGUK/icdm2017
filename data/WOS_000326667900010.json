The mapping techniques proposed in this paper take into account both inter-application and intra-application parallelism in order to fully utilize the potential parallelism of the many-core architecture. Two approaches are proposed for static mapping: one approach is based on integer linear programming and the other is based on a greedy algorithm. Experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Static Mapping of Multiple Data-Parallel Applications on Embedded Many-Core SoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000326667900010"}
