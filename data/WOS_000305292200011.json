This paper discusses a suitable graph formalism followed by proving a number of results that yield a considerable search space reduction for both problems. An algorithmic link between numerical analysis and theoretical computer science is established. Although both problems are believed to be NP-hard in general, a linear-time algorithm is presented solving the MEC problem for a specified subclass of l-DAGs.", "paper_title": "On optimality preserving eliminations for the minimum edge count and optimal Jacobian accumulation problems in linearized DAGs", "paper_id": "WOS:000305292200011"}
