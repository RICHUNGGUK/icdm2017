However, for high dimensional datasets, the result of traditional clustering methods can be meaningless as clusters may only be depicted with respect to a small part of features. Taking customer datasets as an example, certain customers may correlate with their salary and education, and the others may correlate with their job and house location. If one uses all the features of a customer for clustering, these local-correlated clusters may not be revealed. In addition, processing high dimensions and large datasets is a challenging problem in decision making. Searching all the combinations of every feature with every record to extract local-correlated clusters is infeasible, which is in exponential scale in terms of data dimensionality and cardinality. In this paper, we propose a scalable 2-Leveled Approximated Hyper-Image-based Clustering framework, referred as 2L-HIC-A, for mining local-correlated clusters, where each level clustering process requires only one scan of the original dataset. Moreover, the data-processing time of 2L-HIC-A can be independent of the input data size. In 2L-HIC-A, various well-developed image processing techniques can be exploited for mining clusters. In stead of proposing a new clustering algorithm, our framework can accommodate other clustering methods for mining local-corrected clusters, and to shed new light on the existing clustering techniques.", "paper_title": "Scalable Clustering for Mining Local-Correlated Clusters in High Dimensions and Large Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000276350100003"}
