In this paper, we present a new generic framework for transforming any ID-based message recovery signature to a secret handshake scheme, whose provability can be determined by the security of underlying signature. Based on our new generic framework, two concrete secret handshake schemes are elaborated, which originate from two different ID-based message recovery signatures and are provably secure against the chosen-message attack in the random oracle model.
