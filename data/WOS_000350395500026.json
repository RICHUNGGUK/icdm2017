As such, convergence is emerging as a hot issue within IT industries nowadays. Particularly, digital convergence is creating yet another distinct blue ocean, as computers are evolving from their combination with communications to their combination with broadcasting and communications involving media contents. The objective of this study is to examine the differentiated characteristics of IT convergence service vis-A -vis the exiting IT service from the viewpoint of service providers and service users, and to define the cultural difference between the two nations (South Korea and Japan) based on Hofstede's cultural model (2001, 2005). Thus, using (1989) TAM (Technology Acceptance Model) theory, represented by IS adaption and use, and (2003) IS success model, this study developed a research model in the form of a structural equation. This model is based conceptually on the viewpoint of (1992, 2003) acceptance and diffusion, and on the viewpoint of (2002) use and diffusion, and was designed based on theory of reasoned action and theory of planned behavior considering the service user's personal attitude and behavior elements. In order to perform a statistical verification of this research model, the representative analysis tool for a structural equation, the partial least squares method, was used. As a result of such statistical analysis, it was confirmed that that there was a significant change in consumers' perception and behaviors regarding the acceptance and diffusion of innovations according to cultural difference between the two nations. In addition, subsequent diverse implications were derived, and as such, this study made a significant contribution to the development of future research on convergence innovation services.", "paper_title": "Digital convergence service from the viewpoint of provider and user factors using technology acceptance and diffusion model", "paper_id": "WOS:000350395500026"}
