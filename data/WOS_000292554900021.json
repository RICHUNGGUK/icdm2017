A full-sib family, produced by crossing two heterozygous parents, is characteristic of uncertainties about cross-type at a locus and linkage phase between different loci. Integrating functional mapping into a full-sib family requires a model selection procedure capable of addressing these uncertainties. 3FunMap, written in VC++ 6.0, provides a flexible and extensible platform to perform full-sib functional mapping of dynamic traits. Functions in the package encompass linkage phase determination, marker map construction and the pattern identification of QTL segregation, dynamic tests of QTL effects, permutation tests and numerical simulation. We demonstrate the features of 3FunMap through real data analysis and computer simulation.", "paper_title": "3FunMap: full-sib family functional mapping of dynamic traits", "paper_id": "WOS:000292554900021"}
