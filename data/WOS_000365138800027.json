Two equivalent descriptions of the fuzzy augmentation property are given and fuzzy submatroids are introduced. Moreover, the existence of fuzzy bases for Hsueh fuzzy matroids is proved. Based on the properties of fuzzy bases, fuzzy base axioms for Hsueh fuzzy matroids are obtained. Additionally, an application of fuzzy base axioms is presented.", "paper_title": "Axioms for fuzzy bases of Hsueh fuzzy matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000365138800027"}
