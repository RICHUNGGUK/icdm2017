In this paper we proposed an effective spatial error concealment method with low complexity. Among the information included in an H.264-coded bitstream, we use prediction modes of intra-blocks for recovering a damaged block. This is because a prediction direction in each prediction mode is highly correlated to the edge direction. We first estimate the edge direction of a damaged block using prediction modes of intra-blocks adjacent to a damaged block and classify the area inside a damaged block into the edge and the flat area. And then our method recovers pixel values in the edge area using edge-directed interpolation, and recovers pixel values in the flat area using weighted interpolation. Simulation results show the proposed method yields better video quality than conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "Spatial error concealment with low complexity in the H.264 standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100039"}
