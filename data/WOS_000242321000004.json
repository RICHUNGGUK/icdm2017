Capacity restrictions of the machine are considered and the main objective is to find an assignment of jobs to achieve the minimal processing time of all batches, given these capacities. A polynomial algorithm is proposed for solving the case in which the jobs are non-preemptive, non-identical, and are known before the realization of the schedule. The proposed algorithm is implemented and shown to yield better results than alternatives from the literature.", "paper_title": "Using heuristic search for solving single machine batch processing problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242321000004"}
