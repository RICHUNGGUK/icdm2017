This system helps in collecting statistical data and thereafter analyzes the enormous volume of data and aids in making quality related decisions. In contrary to conventional SPC applications where the analyzed results have to be interpreted by quality control specialists, MES based unmanned manufacturing environments require automation of the interpretation process. The developed advisory system helps in selecting and designing control charts based on various cost, rule or heuristics models. The system also provides interpretation expertise by configuring and applying various rule sets. On violation of these rules, signals are generated by the system and the expert system advices for appropriate remedial actions. Thus the system acts as an advisory support system.
