It is natural to consider classes of codes that retain the identification property under various conditions, e.g., when the sets I(v) are possibly slightly corrupted. We consider two such classes of robust codes. We also consider dynamic identifying codes, i.e., walks in G whose vertices form an identifying code in G.", "paper_title": "On robust and dynamic identifying codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000234944700015"}
