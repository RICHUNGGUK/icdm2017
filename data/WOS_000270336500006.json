Assessment and preparation of decisions for the introduction need to take the costs, benefits, and the organizational settings into consideration. A variety of methods for the evaluation and decision support of new IT (e. g. EIdMS) are discussed in the literature - however, these are typically based on single dimensions (e. g. financial or technology aspects). This paper proposes a multidimensional decision support framework, based on the Balanced Scorecard concept. The presented approach introduces four perspectives and a related set of initial decision parameters to support decision making. The perspectives are (a) financial/monetary, (b) business processes, (c) supporting processes and (ICT) infrastructure and (d) information security, risks and compliance. Perspectives and adaptable sets of decision parameters also may serve as foundation for software-based decision support instruments.", "paper_title": "Enterprise Identity Management - Towards a Decision Support Framework Based on the Balanced Scorecard Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000270336500006"}
