The system's performance and the contribution of each knowledge source depends upon the type of lexical ambiguity 87 9% of the ambiguous terms are correctly disambiguated using a combination of linguistic features and MeSH terms. 99% of abbreviations are disambiguated by combining all knowledge sources, while 97 2% of ambiguous gene names are disambiguated using the MeSH terms alone Analysis reveals that these differences are caused by the nature of each ambiguity type These results should be taken into account when deciding which information to use for WSD and the level of performance that can be expected (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved", "paper_title": "Disambiguation in the biomedical domain: The role of ambiguity type", "paper_id": "WOS:000285036700013"}
