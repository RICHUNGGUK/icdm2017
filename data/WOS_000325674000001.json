One of the key directions is to model and study the behaviors of social agents. In this paper, we propose a new computational model which can serve as a powerful tool for the analysis of SN. Specifically, we add to the traditional sociometric methods a novel analytical method in order to deal with social behaviors more effectively, and then present a new bio-inspired model, the coordination generalized molecule model (CGMM). The proposed analytical method for social behaviors and CGMM are combined to give an algorithm that can be used to solve complex problems in SN. Traditionally, SN models were mainly descriptive and were built at a very coarse level, typically with only a few global parameters, and turned out to be not sufficiently useful for analyzing social behaviors. In this work, we explore bio-inspired analytical models for analyzing social behaviors of intelligent agents. Our objective is to propose an effective and practical method to model intelligent systems and their behaviors in an open and complex unpredictable world. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
