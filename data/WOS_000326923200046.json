The most practical way to do this is to capture alternating exposures for every LDR frame and then use an alignment method based on optical flow to register the exposures together. However, this results in objectionable artifacts whenever there is complex motion and optical flow fails. To address this problem, we propose a new approach for HDR reconstruction from alternating exposure video sequences that combines the advantages of optical flow and recently introduced patch-based synthesis for HDR images. We use patch-based synthesis to enforce similarity between adjacent frames, increasing temporal continuity. To synthesize visually plausible solutions, we enforce constraints from motion estimation coupled with a search window map that guides the patch-based synthesis. This results in a novel reconstruction algorithm that can produce high-quality HDR videos with a standard camera. Furthermore, our method is able to synthesize plausible texture and motion in fast-moving regions, where either patch-based synthesis or optical flow alone would exhibit artifacts. We present results of our reconstructed HDR video sequences that are superior to those produced by current approaches.", "paper_title": "Patch-Based High Dynamic Range Video", "paper_id": "WOS:000326923200046"}
