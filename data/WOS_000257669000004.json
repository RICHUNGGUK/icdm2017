This technique quantifies the myocardial contraction forces developed within the ventricular myofibers in response to electrophysiological stimuli. We provide a 3D finite element formulation of a contraction force reconstruction algorithm, along with its implementation using magnetic resonance (MR) data. Our algorithm is based on an inverse problem solution governed by the fundamental continuum mechanics principle of conservation of linear momentum, under a first-order approximation of elastic and isotropic material conditions. We implemented our technique using a subject-specific ventricle model obtained by extracting the left ventricular anatomical features from a set of high-resolution cardiac MR images acquired throughout the cardiac cycle using prospective electrocardiographic gating. Cardiac motion information was extracted by non-rigid registration of the mid-diastole reference image to the remaining images of a 4D dataset. Using our technique, we reconstructed dynamic maps that show the contraction force distribution superimposed onto the deformed ventricle model at each acquired frame in the cardiac cycle. Our next objective will consist of validating this technique by showing the correlation between the presence of low contraction force patterns and poor myocardial functionality.", "paper_title": "Towards a biomechanics-based technique for assessing myocardial contractility: an inverse problem approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000257669000004"}
