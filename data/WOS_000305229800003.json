We furthermore extend that procedure to allow for generalisations of concrete matrices to an abstract form that enables us to determine the generic type of a given matrix. The presented algorithms employ artificial intelligence techniques such as pattern recognition and constraint solving.", "paper_title": "Abstracting symbolic matrices Special issue on artificial intelligence and symbolic computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000305229800003"}
