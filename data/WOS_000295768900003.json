The mathematical model assumes a single-component fluid. The model accounts for both the phase change phenomenon and the non-Darcian behavior of the flow. The contemporaneous presence of both effects has to the authors' knowledge never been fully taken into account. Provided that the numerical solution is based on a finite differences or finite volumes method, the numerical code we developed (called DNDmultiphase) can be plugged as an additional module into existing codes devoted to simulations of a whole reservoir (such as TOUGH2 or HYDROTHERM).
