Program for evaluating of value of function is by automatic differentiation modified to program, which also evaluates values of derivatives. Computed values axe exact up to computer precision and their evaluation is very quick. In this article, we describe a program realization of automatic differentiation. This implementation is prepared in the system UFO, but its principles can be applied in other systems. We describe, how the operations axe stored in the first part of the derivative computation and how the obtained records axe effectively used in the second part of the computation.", "paper_title": "AUTOMATIC DIFFERENTIATION AND ITS PROGRAM REALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000273488700012"}
