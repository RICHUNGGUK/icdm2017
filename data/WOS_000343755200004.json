It turns out that the fluctuations of the external branch length follow those of tau(2-alpha)(n) n over the entire parameter regime, where tau(n) denotes the random number of coalescences that bring the n lineages down to one. This is in contrast to the fluctuation behaviour of the total branch length, which exhibits a transition at alpha(0) = (1+root 5)/2 ([18]).", "paper_title": "The Total External Branch Length of Beta-Coalescents", "paper_id": "WOS:000343755200004"}
