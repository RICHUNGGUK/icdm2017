In this study, we apply sensor sensitivity analysis on a structure damage identifier, which integrates independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector machine (SVM) together. The approach is evaluated on a benchmark data from University of British Columbia. Experimental results show sensitivity analysis not only helps domain experts understand the mapping from different location and type of sensors to a damage class, but also significantly reduce noise and improve the accuracy of different level damages identification.", "paper_title": "Applying sensitivity analysis in structure damage identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000164"}
