Its inter-actions with other reflexes, mainly cardiopulmonary reflexes, are of paramount importance in controlling heart rate. Objectives: This study assesses the coupling between baroreflex and respiration during a progressive bicycle mild dynamical exercise. Methods: The coupling was assessed by symbolic analysis and conditional entropy. Results: Findings suggested the close relationship between the baroreflex sequences and the phase of respiratory signal and, thus, the interference between baroreflex and cardiopulmonary reflexes. Conclusions: Indexes describing baroreflex based on spontaneous variability are strongly affected by cardiopulmonary influences.", "paper_title": "Interferences between Baroreflex and Respiration Evaluation by Symbolic Analysis and Conditional Entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000283707500017"}
