An exact algorithm for solving this NP-complete problem is proposed, based on a condition which guarantees that the optimal path pair cost has been obtained. This optimality condition is based on the calculation of upper and lower bounds on the optimal cost. A formal proof of the correctness of the algorithm is described. Extensive experimentation is presented to show the effectiveness of the algorithm, including a comparison with an integer linear programming formulation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
