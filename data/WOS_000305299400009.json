Design/methodology/approach - In order to deal with inaccuracy due to inevitable numerical errors in the objective function calculation (the power losses of the power MOSFET) and in the constraint computation, the paper proposes to use the progressive quadratic response surface method (PQRSM). Findings - The paper focuses on four aspects: the inevitable numerical errors in the power loss and the integration constraint computation; the response surface approximation (RSA) method; the PQRSM principle; and finally the comparisons of several optimization methods applied on this application problem. Originality/value - An original optimization method, PQRSM, is proposed for reducing the oscillation problem of a semi-analytical model. The optimization results of PQRSM have been compared with the evolution strategy (ES) algorithm, with similar results but faster computation.", "paper_title": "Application of progressive quadratic response surface method for an oscillation problem optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000305299400009"}
