In this paper it is shown that every n-vertex graph contains a sparse backbone, i.e., a spanning subgraph with O(n log n) edges whose reliability is at least (1 - n(-Omega(1))) times that of G. Moreover, for any pair of vertices s, t in G, the (s, t)-reliability of the backbone, namely, the probability that s and t remain connected, is also at least (1 - n(-Omega(1)))times that of G. Our proof is based on a polynomial time randomized algorithm for constructing the backbone. In addition, it is shown that the constructed backbone has nearly the same Tutte polynomial as the original graph (in the quarter-plane x >= 1, y > 1), and hence the graph and its backbone share many additional features encoded by the Tutte polynomial.
