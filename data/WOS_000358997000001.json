Besides, a suboptimal algorithm with less complexity is also proposed. In order to deal with more practical situations, we further assume that only the channel distribution information (CDI) of the interference links is available and propose heuristic power allocation algorithms based on bisection search method to minimize the aggregate BER under the interference outage constraint and the transmit power constraint. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "Minimum BER Power Allocation for OFDM-based Cognitive Radio Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000358997000001"}
