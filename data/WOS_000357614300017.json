SEAD segmentation plays an important role in the treatment of neovascular AMD, but accurate segmentation is challenging because of the large diversity of SEAD size, location, and shape. Here a novel voxel classification based approach using a layer-dependent stratified sampling strategy was developed to address the class imbalance problem in SEAD detection. The method was validated on a set of 30 longitudinal 3D OCT scans from 10 patients who underwent anti-VEGF treatment. Two retinal specialists manually delineated all intraretinal and subretinal fluid. Leave-one-patient-out evaluation resulted in a true positive rate and true negative rate of 96% and 0.16% respectively. This method showed promise for image guided therapy of neovascular AMD treatment.", "paper_title": "Stratified Sampling Voxel Classification for Segmentation of Intraretinal and Subretinal Fluid in Longitudinal Clinical OCT Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000357614300017"}
