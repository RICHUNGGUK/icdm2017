Similar to its predecessor rEvoluzer I the new algorithm can preserve conserved intervals but it has the additional property that it is suitable for parallelization. For the parallel version of rEvoluzer II a master-slave parallelization scheme is used and several methods for reducing parallelization overheads have been incorporated. We show experimentally that rEvoluzer II achieves very good results compared to other methods for the RMP. It is also shown that the parallel version has good scaling behavior for a not too large number of processors.", "paper_title": "A parallel algorithm for solving the reversal median problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100132"}
