Therefore, old tree protection and maintenance can not only show our attention to local culture and environment protection. It is also an important segment of ecology protection. To pass this kind of beautiful memory to our later generations, we have to give these old trees more attention and care. This paper develops an APP which is easy to use and able to position old trees based on Android. Through the geographic positioning of the precious old trees and database information service provided by this APP, we wish to draw attention of people towards old tree protection and make them see the value and time significance of old trees.", "paper_title": "Old Tree Pilgrimage -- A Mobile Application Combined with Cultural Landscape", "paper_id": "WOS:000349067000002"}
