For large N(p) and N(c), a traditional search algorithm such as the LBG method can hardly find the global optimal classification and needs a great deal of calculation. In this paper, a novel VQ codebook generation method based on Otsu histogram threshold is proposed. The computational complexity of squared Euclidean distance can be reduced to O (N(p) log(2) N(c)) for a codebook with gray levels. Our method provides better image quality than recent proposed schemes in high compression ratio. The experimental results and the comparisons show that this method can not only reduce the computational complexity of squared Euclidean distance but also find better codewords to improve the quality of the resulted VQ codebook.", "paper_title": "A Fast VQ Codebook Generation Algorithm Based on Otsu Histogram Threshold", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583700008"}
