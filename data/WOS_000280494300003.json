INT has two subtasks: gene normalization (GN) and interactor ranking. The main difficulties of INT GN are identifying genes across species and using full papers instead of abstracts. To tackle these problems, we developed a multistage GN algorithm and a ranking method, which exploit information in different parts of a paper. Our system achieved a promising AUC of 0.43471. Using the multistage GN algorithm, we have been able to improve system performance ( AUC) by 1.719 percent compared to a one-stage GN algorithm. Our experimental results also show that with full text, versus abstract only, INT AUC performance was 22.6 percent higher.", "paper_title": "Multistage Gene Normalization and SVM-Based Ranking for Protein Interactor Extraction in Full-Text Articles", "paper_id": "WOS:000280494300003"}
