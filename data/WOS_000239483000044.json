The algorithm processes multiresolution images of calling cards hierarchically to firstly extract individual characters and then to recognize the characters by using an enhanced neural network method. The horizontal smearing is applied to a 1/3 resolution image in order to extract the areas. The second vertical smearing and contour tracking masking is applied to a 1/2 resolution image to extract individual characters. And lastly, the original image is used in the recognition step because the image accurately includes the morphological information of the characters precisely. The enhanced RBF network is also proposed to recognize characters with diverse font types and sizes, by using the enhanced ART1 network adjusting the vigilance parameter dynamically according to the similarity between patterns. The results of experiments show that the proposed algorithm greatly improves the character extraction and recognition compared with traditional recognition algorithms.", "paper_title": "Recognition of English calling card by using multiresolution images and enhanced ART1-based RBF neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000044"}
