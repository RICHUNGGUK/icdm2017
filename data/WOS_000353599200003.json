We investigate the adoption of new communication media (social media, mobile apps, email alerts, etc.) by companies to disclose company news to consumers and investors. Using a cluster analysis, we group companies either into a cluster with high adoption of new media or into one with low adoption, based on their use of new media for disclosure. We find that a company's voluntary information disclosure on social media is positively related to its adoption level of new media. Our findings suggest that the engagement of information disclosure on new media increases a company's influence and reach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
