In this proposed method, we suppose that there exists at least one structural change in the time series. Structural changes are defined to represent the observations moving from \"low\" to \"high\" or moving from \"high\" to low\". The Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index is used as the target. The empirical results, based on the proposed method, are validated against historical events as well as the results in previous studies. In addition to the empirical results, this study also demonstrates the advantages of applying a clustering technique to determine structural changes.", "paper_title": "Analyzing structural changes using clustering techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000255957800019"}
