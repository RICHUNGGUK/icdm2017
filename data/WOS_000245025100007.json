The visual perception is mathematically modelled as a probabilistic process obtaining and interpreting visual information from an environment. By means of this model some other vision related concepts, such as visual attention and visual openness, are also mathematically defined. The theoretical considerations are implemented in three applications, namely scene description by perception, visual openness measurement for design, and perceptual robotics.", "paper_title": "Visual perception in design and robotics", "paper_id": "WOS:000245025100007"}
