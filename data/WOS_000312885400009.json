The survey emphasizes on state-of-the-art mobile technologies that have been developed for crime-fighting robots, capable of crafting critical situations with confrontation strategies. Throughout this investigation, 60 projects are being examined with respect to faculties and sensor apparatus being used. A statistical analysis, which is carried on the historical developments of the most attractive frameworks, reveals the popularity of the four security robot categories and their chronological progress over the past 30 years. The categories being evaluated regard teleoperated, distributed, surveillance, and law-enforcement robot architectures. In the survey, an attempt is made to explain the importance of intelligent methodologies, and their emergent effects in security tasks. The major findings of this analysis illustrate the minor contribution of intelligent architectures in crime-fighting robots, and what constitutes an intelligent security robot.", "paper_title": "Toward Intelligent Security Robots: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000312885400009"}
