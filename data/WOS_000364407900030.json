Firstly, the definitions of the multi-ary alpha-semantic resolution and multi-ary alpha-semantic resolution deduction in LF(X) are given, respectively, the soundness and completeness of this ground case are gotten. Secondly, the validity of multi-ary alpha-semantic resolution method is analyzed. Thirdly, the algorithm for multi-ary alpha-semantic resolution methods based on lattice-valued first-order logic LF(X) is constructed. This work will provide a theoretical foundation for the more efficient resolution based automated reasoning in lattice-valued logic.", "paper_title": "Multi-ary alpha-semantic resolution automated reasoning based on lattice-valued first-order logic LF(X)", "paper_id": "WOS:000364407900030"}
