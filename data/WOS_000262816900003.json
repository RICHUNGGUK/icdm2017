To the CMP quality, dummy-feature filling is typically by foundries after the routing stage. However, filling features may greatly degrade the interconnect and significantly increase the input data in the following consuming reticle enhancement techniques. It is, thus, to consider wire-density uniformity during routing to the side effects from aggressive post-layout dummy filling. this paper, we present a new full-chip grid-based routing considering wire density for reticle planarization To fully consider a wire distribution, the router applies novel two-pass top-down planarity-driven routing which employs new density critical area analysis based Voronoi diagrams and incorporates an intermediate stage a density-driven layer/track assignment based on Delaunay triangulation. Experimental results show that methods can achieve a more balanced wire distribution state-of-the-art works.", "paper_title": "A Novel Wire-Density-Driven Full-Chip Routing System for CMP Variation.
