Our current research aims at a high fidelity hysteroscopy simulator which challenges the trainee with a new surgical scene in every training session. We previously reported on methods able to generate a broad range of pathologies within an existing healthy organ model. This paper presents the methods necessary to produce variable models of the healthy organ. In order to build a database of uteri, a volunteer study was conducted. The segmentation was carried out interactively, also covering the establishment of an anatomically meaningful correspondence between the individual organs. The variability of the shape parameters has been characterized by principal component analysis. A new method has been developed and tested, allowing the derivation of realistic new instances based on the stochastic model and complying with nonlinear shape constraints which are defined and interactively controlled by medical experts.
