However, its detection is challenging due to varying backgrounds, low contrast between text and non-text regions, perspective distortion and other disturbing factors. In this paper, we propose a novel text line detection method which can detect text line aligned with a straight line in any direction. It is mainly composed of three steps. In the first step, we use the maximal stable extremal region detector with dam line constraint to detect candidate text regions, we then define a similarity measurement between two regions which combines sizes, absolute distance, relative distance, contextual information and color histograms. In the second step, we propose a text line identification algorithm based on the defined similarity measurement. The algorithm firstly searches three regions as the seeds of a line, and then expands to obtain all regions in the line. In the last step, we develop a filter to remove non-text lines. The filter uses a sparse classifier based on two dictionaries which are learned from feature vectors extracted from morphological skeletons of those candidate text lines. A comparative study using two datasets shows the excellent performance of the proposed method for accurate text line detection with horizontal or arbitrary consistent orientation.", "paper_title": "A method for text line detection in natural images", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400010"}
