Usually, a multi-class problem is decomposed into simple sub-problems solved independently using similar single neural networks. For the reason that these sub-problems are not equivalent in their complexity, we propose a system that includes reinforced networks destined to solve complicated parts of the entire problem. Our approach is inspired from principles of the multi-classifiers systems and the labeled classification, which aims to improve performances of the networks trained by the Back-Propagation algorithm. We propose two implementation schemes based on both OAO (one-against-all) and OAA (one-against-one). The proposed models are evaluated using iris and human thigh databases.", "paper_title": "The labeled systems of multiple neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258879800005"}
