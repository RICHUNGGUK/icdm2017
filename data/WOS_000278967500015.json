They perform frequently-used tree operations without requiring user interaction. They also allow tree drawing as scalable vector graphics (SVG), suitable for high-quality presentations and further editing, and as ASCII graphics for command-line inspection. As an example we include an implementation of bootscanning, a procedure for finding recombination breakpoints in viral genomes.", "paper_title": "The Newick utilities: high-throughput phylogenetic tree processing in the Unix shell", "paper_id": "WOS:000278967500015"}
