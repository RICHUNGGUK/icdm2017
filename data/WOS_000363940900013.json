Based on literature research, analysis and simulations, the proposed classification shows the impact of architectural choices on the output spectral purity. To concretize the classification and validate the analysis, a number of specific Mixing-DAC architectures are synthesized, discussed and simulated. Given the proposed classification, a set of optimal architectural choices lead to a strong architecture candidate for achieving high spectral purity at high signal frequencies, i.e. SFDR > 80 dBc at f(OUT) = 4 GHz for current and future multicarrier GSM applications. The main characteristics of this architecture are: Cartesian signaling, local Gilbert-cell mixing and a fully differential implementation.", "paper_title": "Classification for synthesis of high spectral purity current-steering mixing-DAC architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000363940900013"}
