The effect of the second-order coefficient in the slip boundary condition becomes significant as the Knudsen number increases. Most slip models are limited to slip regime or marginally transition regime and break down around Kn = 0:1 while Sreekanth's model, followed by Mitsuya's model, gives a good agreement with the linearized Boltzmann solutions from slip regime up to Kn = 2 for flow rate and friction factor predictions. These two models should be of great use for slip flow analysis in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) and, in particular, in situations where the flow rate and flow resistance are of interest.", "paper_title": "Comparison of gas slip models with solutions of linearized Boltzmann equation and direct simulation of Monte Carlo method", "paper_id": "WOS:000250954800006"}
