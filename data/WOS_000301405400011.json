A Wenz model is also improved so as to approach the noise model of underwater acoustic channel better. Furthermore, OPNET platform built-in propagation delay stage, a receiver power stage, background noise stage are improved in order to fit underwater acoustic channel, and then basically realize an approximate simulation of the real channel. Mobile network model is designed and simulated with the simulative underwater acoustic channel added, and then the network performance influence of underwater acoustic channel characteristics is analyzed.", "paper_title": "MODELING AND SIMULATION OF CHANNEL FOR UNDERWATER COMMUNICATION NETWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405400011"}
