Our security model takes into account the super adversary in certificateless signature. Furthermore, we present a construction of forward secure certificateless proxy signature scheme with bilinear maps. Based on the difficulty of computational Diffie-Hellman problem, we prove the scheme is secure against chosen message attack in the random oracle model. Finally, we analyze efficiency of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Provably Secure Forward Secure Certificateless Proxy Signature Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000326457100013"}
