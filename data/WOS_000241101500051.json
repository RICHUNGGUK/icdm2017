We propose the demonstration of a visual interface to ETANA-DL, a growing union archaeological DL. Our interface EtanaCMV is based on a uniform multiple view design and facilitates browsing of DL records that are multidimensional, hierarchical, and categorical in nature. We use distinct panels to allow flexible browsing across multiple dimensions. Bars in each panel denote the various categories in each dimension. EtanaCMV will give the users a quick overview of the collections in the DL during browsing in addition to showing relationships in the harvested collections. Coordination between multiple views is used to present more insights into the data.", "paper_title": "EtanaCMV: A visual browsing interface for ETANA-DL based on coordinated multiple views", "paper_id": "WOS:000241101500051"}
