Such applications have become increasingly effective due to the rapid development of computer graphics. This situation has generated a greater need for multidimensional input devices. It is conjectured that an ideal universal multidimensional input device should allow for 2D pointing as well as precise manipulation and navigation within 3D environments. Accordingly, the device should offer (a) six degrees of freedom, (b) a range of motion adapted to finger manipulation, (c) elastic suspension providing rich sensory feedback, and (d) position and rate control. The input device, SpaceCat, was designed to offer all these properties. Although such devices are known to benefit 3D navigation, this work demonstrates that they also benefit 3D object manipulation.", "paper_title": "Softly Elastic 6 DOF Input", "paper_id": "WOS:000272798400002"}
