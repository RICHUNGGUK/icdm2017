Design/methodology/approach - The governing equations are transformed into dimensionless nonlinear ordinary differential equations by similarity transformation. Analytical technique, namely the homotopy perturbation method (HPM) combining with Pade approximants and finite difference method, are used to solve dimensionless non-linear ordinary differential equations. The skin friction coefficient and local Nusselt numbers are also calculated. Beside this, the comparison of the analytical solution with numerical solution is illustrated by the graphs for different values of dimensionless pertinent parameters. Findings - The authors have studied laminar magneto-micropolar flow in the presence of radiation by using HPM-Pade and finite difference methods. Results obtained by HPM-Pade are in excellent agreement with the results of numerical solution. Originality/value - The HPM-Pade is used in a direct way without using linearization, discritization or restrictive assumption. The authors have attempted to show the capabilities and wide-range applications of the HPM-Pade in comparison with the finite difference solution of magneto-micropolar flow in the presence of radiation problem.", "paper_title": "Application of homotopy perturbation and numerical methods to the magneto-micropolar fluid flow in the presence of radiation", "paper_id": "WOS:000306204200003"}
