A set of two-dimensional, axisymmetric, time-dependent Computational Fluid Dynamics analyses are performed. Grid independence is achieved via successive levels of adaptive refinement using a novel methodology. The method employs adaptive remeshing, performed in an automated fashion. Adaptation criteria are based upon the undivided differences in select field variables. Sensors are placed at strategic locations within the flow field, which are used to aid in judging grid independence. The resulting analytical predictions are compared to an experimental dataset. The automated methodology yields both a verified and validated set of analysis results for the synthetic jet.
