Subsequently, passivity-based controllers are synthesized. Local asymptotic stability is ensured as well. In addition, a power management system is designed to manage power flow between components. Modeling and simulation of the proposed hybrid power source is accomplished using MATLAB/Simulink. Our interest is focused on the comparison of the two passivity-based control methods and their use in hybrid power systems.", "paper_title": "Interconnection and damping assignment and Euler-Lagrange passivity-based control of photovoltaic/battery hybrid power source for stand-alone applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000294803700007"}
