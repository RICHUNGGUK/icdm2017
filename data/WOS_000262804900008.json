A smaller value of the Smagorinsky constant than the usually used one in plain channel flow simulations is used. Results for the mean flow and turbulent fluctuations are compared to experimental data obtained in an open duct of similar dimensions. It is found that the LBM simulation results are in good qualitative agreement with the experiments. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
