CHMM was applied in one of the best eukaryotic gene prediction systems: HMMgene. The conditional Maximum Likelihood estimation (CMLE) algorithm was educed to estimate the interpolation parameters. The resulting gene prediction program improves exon level sensitivity by 3% and specificity by about 1% compared to HMMgene as trained and tested on some standard human DNA sequence dataset.", "paper_title": "Interpolated hidden Markov models estimated using conditional ML for eukaryotic gene annotation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400029"}
