Image matching is one of the key technologies for many vision-based applications, including template matching, block motion estimation, video compression, stereo vision, image/video near-duplicate detection, similarity join for image/video database, and so on. Normalized cross correlation (NCC) is one of widely used method for image matching with preferable characteristics such as robustness to intensity offsets and contrast changes, but it is computationally expensive. The proposed features, derived by the method of Lagrange multipliers, can provide upper-bounds of NCC as a simple dot product between two low-dimensional feature vectors. By using the proposed features, NCC-based image matching can be effectively accelerated. The matching performance with the proposed features is demonstrated using an image database obtained from actual broadcast videos. The new features are shown to outperform other methods: multilevel successive elimination algorithm (MSEA), discrete cosine transform (DCT) coefficients, and histograms, achieving very high precision while only slightly sacrificing recall.
