There are three major stages in this task; first, the object is thrown, then it has a free flight, and finally it is caught by a second manipulator. We present a new method to meet the environmental uncertainties existing in the problem that can affect the trajectory of the object and the subsequent impact force generated between the manipulator and the object at the catching instant. To reduce the impact force at this very instant, a reinforcement learning method is applied to the second manipulator to find the best time and velocity for receiving the flying object. To verify the proposed methodology, a set of simulations is carried out within SIMULINK-MATLAB linked to ADAMS for mechanical modeling of the system. An acceptable robustness is obtained for the second manipulator in catching the thrown object despite the noisiness of initial velocities of the object at throwing time.", "paper_title": "A REINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPROACH TO DYNAMIC OBJECT MANIPULATION IN NOISY ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000006"}
