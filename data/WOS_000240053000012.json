Our approach is direct and no special restriction on occurrences of square(i) and lozenge(i) is required. We apply our framework for a large class of basic serial multimodal logics, which are parameterized by an arbitrary combination of generalized versions of axioms T, B, 4, 5 (in the form, e.g. 4 : square(i) phi -> square(j)square(k)phi) and I : square(i) phi -> square(j)phi. Another part of the work is devoted to programming in multimodal logics intended for reasoning about multidegree belief, for use in distributed systems of belief, or for reasoning about epistemic states of agents in multiagent systems. For that we also use the framework, and although these latter logics belong to the mentioned class of basic serial multimodal logics, the special SLD-resolution calculi proposed for them are more efficient.
