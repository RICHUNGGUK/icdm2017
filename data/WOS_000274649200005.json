The general algorithm employs a special method to compute the automorphism group of a finite simple semigroup. As applications of the algorithm all the automorphism groups of semigroups of order at most 7 and of the multiplicative semigroups of some group rings are found. We also consider which groups occur as the automorphism groups of semigroups of several distinguished types. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
