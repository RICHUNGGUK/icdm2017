However, current microblogging systems severely suffer from performance bottlenecks and malicious attacks due to the centralized architecture. As a result, centralized microblogging systems may threaten the scalability, reliability as well as availability of the offered services, not to mention the high operational and maintenance cost. This demo presents a decentralized, socio-aware microblogging system named Cuckoo. The key aspects of Cuckoo's design is to take advantage of the inherent social relations while leveraging peer-to-peer (P2P) techniques in order to provide scalable, reliable microblogging services. The demo will show these aspects of Cuckoo and provide insights on the performance gain that decentralization and socio-awareness can bring for microblogging systems.", "paper_title": "Twittering by Cuckoo - Decentralized and Socio-Aware Online Microblogging Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800072"}
