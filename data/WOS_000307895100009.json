We consider a system consisting of two parallel queues, served by a single server. One of the queues receives heavy-tailed traffic, and the other receives light-tailed traffic. We study the class of throughput-optimal max-weight-alpha scheduling policies and derive an exact asymptotic characterization of the steady-state queue-length distributions. In particular, we show that the tail of the light queue distribution is at least as heavy as a power-law curve, whose tail coefficient we obtain explicitly. Our asymptotic characterization also shows that the celebrated max-weight scheduling policy leads to the worst possible tail coefficient of the light queue distribution, among all nonidling policies. Motivated by the above negative result regarding the max-weight-alpha policy, we analyze a log-max-weight (LMW) scheduling policy. We show that the LMW policy guarantees an exponentially decaying light queue tail while still being throughput-optimal.", "paper_title": "Queue-Length Asymptotics for Generalized Max-Weight Scheduling in the Presence of Heavy-Tailed Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000307895100009"}
