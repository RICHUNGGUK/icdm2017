Blinding is not generally seen or exploited as a structural element even though it clearly provides some temporary lateral support to the retaining walls of cut-and-cover excavations. The authors have previously shown that the axial resistance of blinding struts is typically governed by upheaval buckling as well as concrete crushing. This paper aims at quantifying the load likely to be transferred into blinding struts from the deflecting retaining walls in addition to the amount of heave to be expected after excavation. Numerical analyses are undertaken to assess the effect of blinding struts on a propped and cantilever retaining wall for various excavation sequences and excavation geometries. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
