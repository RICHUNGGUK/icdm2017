Kernel samples were analysed in reflectance in the VIS and NIR regions (400-2500 nm) at 2 nm intervals using a scanning monochromator. Samples were scanned in a circular cell cup and reflectance data were stored as logarithm of the reciprocal reflectance (log 1/R). Samples were not rotated when spectra collection was made. The coefficients of determination (R-2) and the standard error of cross validation (SECV) obtained for the prediction of oil content in the calibration set were 0.90% and 0.17%, respectively. The residual predictive deviation (RPD = SD/SECV) value obtained was 2.3, indicating that these calibrations can be used for qualitative determination of oil content (e.g. low, medium and high) or preliminary screening in whole corn.
