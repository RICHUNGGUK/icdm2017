We introduce the concept of the conversation quantization, a technique of approximating a continuous flow of conversation by a series of conversation quanta that represent points of the discourse. To investigate what the nature of conversation quanta is, we attempt to extract conversation quanta from two types of the meeting videos by hand. As a result, we have obtained some profitable suggestions about conversation quanta.", "paper_title": "Analysis of conversation quanta for conversational knowledge circulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246814000005"}
