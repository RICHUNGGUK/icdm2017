This has taken to the growing demand of Quality of Service (QoS) support. However, the QoS issue on Grid is quite difficult, as Grid has been originally designed without any QoS support, and it is a complex system. During the previous years some solutions have been proposed to supply QoS for specific classes of applications. This results in a focused and a heterogeneous approach, so that it is hard to evaluate its sufficiency and its robustness with respect to the large spectrum of possible Grid applications. In this context, our contribution concerns three points: first, we analyze the current approach to QoS on Grid as a relationship among QoS features, applications, and architectures; second, we evaluate the QoS requirements of two recent QoS-demanding applications on Grid, namely Massive Multiplayer Online Games and Urgent Computing, comparing these requirements with the support provided by current QoS architectures; and third, we propose an alternative approach to QoS provision on Grid based on the definition of a dedicated QoS-management layer to overcome the limitations of the current methodologies.
