Several examples are demonstrated in such diverse fields as social sciences, physiology, population dynamics, ecology and economics. For instance, the so-called resilience property, which has received much interest from specialists of complex systems (see [3]), has some connection with such repetitive crisis. In this article, we address the question to describe and explain this type of behaviour for a tritrophic slow-fast system. Of course, such a system should incorporate two different time scales: one for the normal periodic state and another for the periodic crisis. The crucial point consists in understanding the \"matching\" between slow and fast motions. Thus, we focus on the analysis of bifurcations of the fast dynamics. The first part of this article introduces the system which extends Lotka-Volterra dynamics (see [6]) by adding a superpredator. Second part shows the analysis of singular points and bifurcations undergone by fast dynamics. Third part is devoted to the analysis of the various behaviours of the full system depending on the parameters. Fourth part is concerned with the main results relating to the existence and unicity of periodic bursting orbit in those different cases.", "paper_title": "Stable periodic orbits associated with bursting oscillations in population dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400056"}
