Based on the rapid development of wireless and mobile technologies, researchers have proposed several group key protocols for mobile environments. In these protocols, the computational cost of each mobile device is fixed, but each mobile user must hold the public keys of all other users. This study proposes an identity-based authenticated group key agreement protocol for mobile environments based on bilinear pairings. In the proposed scheme, the public key of the user can be easily derived from the user's identity. Therefore, each user is not required to hold the public keys of the other entities. In this approach, the computational cost of each mobile user is independent of the number of mobile users; that is, the computational cost of each mobile user is fixed. The proposed protocol meets the usual security requirements and resists well-known attacks.", "paper_title": "ID-Based Authenticated Group Key Agreement Protocol from Bilinear Pairings for Wireless Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000316368400003"}
