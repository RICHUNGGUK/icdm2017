The areas concern, respectively, the heavy traffic and the large deviations limiting regimes for the stationary distribution of a flow model, where the flow model is a stochastic process representing the randomly varying number of document transfers present in a network sharing capacity according to the proportional fairness criterion. In these two regimes we postulate the limiting form of the stationary distribution, by comparison with several variants of the fairness criterion. We outline how product form results can help provide insight into the performance consequences of resource pooling.", "paper_title": "Resource pooling in congested networks: proportional fairness and product form", "paper_id": "WOS:000272576200008"}
