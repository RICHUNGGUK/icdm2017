Specifically, we present a comparison between results obtained for a controlled layout simulated both by physical and computational models. This particular experience is based on a Venturi tube. In the laboratory of the Multidisciplinary Center for Fluid Modeling (CMMF), we have implemented a suitable assembly to simulate different Venturi-related phenomena and to take measurements in an intrusion flow forced by the pressure held into the perforated Venturi tube. The same geometry has been reproduced using a CFD code, and both pressure and velocity values have been compared. By doing this comparison, we first provide awareness to our students about the importance of calibration, then show them the agreement between measured and computed values, and finally design a methodology for students to visualize pressure and velocity fields by means of a number of graphical displays of the results. This approach has revealed itself to be a powerful tool for them to understand the intricacies of hydraulic topics. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.
