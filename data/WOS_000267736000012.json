In this paper, we propose a novel credit-based cooperation mechanism that utilizes hash chains on messages to defend against cheating by the nodes. We show that it imposes a low workload on the nodes in comparison with the mechanisms that deploy digital signature schemes. Moreover, through a game-theoretic analysis, it is shown that any level of cooperation by a node will be attainable if the mechanism makes appropriate payments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
