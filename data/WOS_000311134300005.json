The residual RHA, generated when burning rice husk pellets at temperatures varying from 600 to 800 degrees C, was collected at steam boilers in Vietnam. The properties of fresh and hardened concrete are reviewed. It is possible to obtain the RHA concrete with comparable or better properties than those of the specimen without RHA with lower cement consumption. High flowing concrete designed by the proposed method was obtained without bleeding or segregation. The application of the proposed method for HPC can save over 50% of the consumption of cement and limit the use of water. Its strength efficiency of cement in HPC is 1.4-1.9 times higher than that of the traditional method. Local standards of durability were satisfied at the age of 91 days both by concrete resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity.", "paper_title": "Application of Fuller's ideal curve and error function to making high performance concrete using rice husk ash", "paper_id": "WOS:000311134300005"}
