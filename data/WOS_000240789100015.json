In this new protocol, fluorous alcohols 1, which are used as fluorous tags, are acetylated to yield acetates 2, which in turn are treated with a base to form their enolates. These are then reacted with fluorinated nitriles to furnish tagged beta-enamino esters 3. Although this condensation step had been performed easily in previous solution and solid-phase syntheses, it proved to be very elusive in the fluorous version. Meticulous control of the reaction conditions was thus essential in order to achieve satisfactory yields of beta-enamino esters 3. The final treatment of compounds 3 with isocyanates or isothiocyanates efficiently afforded uracils 4 with concomitant elimination of the fluorous tag, thereby facilitating the preparation of a small library of these derivatives.", "paper_title": "First fluorous synthesis of fluorinated uracils", "paper_id": "WOS:000240789100015"}
