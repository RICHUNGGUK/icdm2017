Our method defines a set of standard behaviours obtained by the recursive calculation of a parameterized formula, and these behaviours are used to match the electrocardiogram (ECG) recording. The advantage of this proposal is the capability to extract from the huge set of numerical values of the ECGs a characteristic reduced pattern with behavioural meaning which allows more accurate and easy matching with unknown ECGs in order to diagnose the patients.
