It offers easy-to-use techniques for assessing a counterfactual's model dependence without having to conduct sensitivity testing over specified classes of models. These same methods can be used to approximate the common support of the treatment and control groups in causal inference.", "paper_title": "WhatIf: R software for evaluating counterfactuals", "paper_id": "WOS:000235181000001"}
