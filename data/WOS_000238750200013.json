In this paper, the algorithmic lateral inhibition (ALI) method is now applied in the generic dynamic and selective visual attention (DSVA) task with the objective of moving objects detection, labelling and further tracking. The four basic subtasks, namely feature extraction, feature integration, attention building and attention reinforcement in our proposal of DSVA are described in detail by inferential CommonKADS schemes. It is shown that the ALI method, in its various forms, that is to say, recurrent and non-recurrent, temporal, spatial and spatial-temporal, may perfectly be used as a problem-solving-method in most of the subtasks involved in the DSVA task.
