Overlapped graph clustering algorithms try to find subsets of nodes that can belong to different clusters. In social network-based applications it is quite usual for a node of the network to belong to different groups, or communities, in the graph. Therefore, algorithms trying to discover, or analyze, the behavior of these networks needed to handle this feature, detecting and identifying the overlapped nodes. This paper shows a soft clustering approach based on a genetic algorithm where a new encoding is designed to achieve two main goals: first, the automatic adaptation of the number of communities that can be detected and second, the definition of several fitness functions that guide the searching process using some measures extracted from graph theory. Finally, our approach has been experimentally tested using the Eurovision contest dataset, a well-known social-based data network, to show how overlapped communities can be found using our method.", "paper_title": "ADAPTIVE K-MEANS ALGORITHM FOR OVERLAPPED GRAPH CLUSTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000309359900002"}
