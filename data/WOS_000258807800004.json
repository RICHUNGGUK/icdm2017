The proposed system, as indicated from the experimental results, can classify bilingual (English and Chinese) web pages at an average precision rate of 97.11 %; while maintaining a favorably low false positive rate. Such satisfactory performance was obtained under a cost-effective parameter configuration used in inverse chi-square calculations. The proposed incremental update mechanism operates on the linking structure of pornographic hubs to locate newly added pornographic sites. The resulting blacklist has been empirically verified to be comparatively responsive to the growth dynamics of pornography sites than three public domain blacklists. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
