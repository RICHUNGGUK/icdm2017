It can assess changes in total project benefits using different project implementation options under budget uncertainty and identify the best option to achieve maximized total benefits. The proposed approach consists of a stochastic model formulated as the zero/one integer doubly constrained multidimensional knapsack problem and an efficient heuristic solution algorithm developed using the Lagrange relaxation technique. A method is also introduced to improve the upper bound for the objective function by simultaneously changing multiple Lagrange multipliers. The approach is applied in a computational study to obtain a comprehensive highway investment plan for a State-maintained highway system in the United States.", "paper_title": "A Heuristic Approach for Selecting Highway Investment Alternatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000278933600004"}
