Based on the Gronwall-Bellman inequality, we present the norm equivalent conditions of robust exponential stability for such systems. Namely, if the delay terms and the nonlinear terms can be controlled by the norm of system states, then the robust exponential stability can be achieved. Finally, an example is provided to verify technical feasibility and operability of the developed results.", "paper_title": "Robust exponential stability of T-S fuzzy delayed systems with nonlinear perturbations", "paper_id": "WOS:000309964000007"}
