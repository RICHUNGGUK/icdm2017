The end-to-end file transfer delay depends on both logical and physical topologies resulting from overlay routing. In this paper, we focus on six types of four-terminal four-router physical networks, and investigate the impact of topology inconsistency on the file transfer delay. The analysis model is based on a two-layer queueing network, taking into account both logical and physical topologies. The model is validated in comparison with ns-2 simulation. Numerical examples show that the end-to-end file transfer delay is small when both logical and physical topologies are the same. It is also observed that the end-to-end delay significantly depends on the traffic intensity for some logical topologies, regardless of physical topology. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
