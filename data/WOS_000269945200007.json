According to the KWP2000, special communication module was devised, which implemented the physical connection and level translation between personal computer (PC) and electronic control unit (ECU). Software design includes guidance service suggestion (GSS) function module and fundamental function module. GSS function module scheduled six intelligent tests: compressing test, fuel shut-off test, run up test, fuel leakage test, electrical system test and high pressure test, and received the test results and supported the search for the cause of errors in the injection system or in the engine, provided diagnosis guidance and played an important role for the service engineer in the after-sale service market. Fundamental function module implemented the following functions: communication, diagnostic trouble code (DTC) management, measuring and programming data. All those modules were designed with Visual C++ and LabVIEW languages, which provided friendly and compatible interface. This diagnostic tool has been used successfully in first generation green diesel (GD-1) high pressure common rail diesel engine, all tests showed it could realize accurate and quick data communication, online diagnostic management, real-time and dynamic measuring data refreshment, online programming data and practical GSS. It significantly improved the efficiency and convenience in after sales service aftermarket. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
