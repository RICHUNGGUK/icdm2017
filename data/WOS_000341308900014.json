The MRT-TLBE consists of two sets of distribution functions, i.e., a D2Q9 model for the mass-momentum equations and a D2Q5 model for the temperature equation. The dimensionless flow parameters are the following: the Prandtl number Pr = 0.71 and the Rayleigh number Ra = 10(6), 10(7), and 10(8). The D2Q9 + D2Q5 MRT-TLBE is shown to be second-order accurate and to be capable of yielding results of benchmark quality, including various Nusselt numbers and local hydrodynamic intensities. Our results also agree well with existing benchmark data obtained by other methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
