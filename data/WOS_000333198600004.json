Despite a number of challenges, we argue that SMA can provide other disciplines - including IS - with methodological foundations for research that focuses on social media. Furthermore, we believe that SMA can help IS research to develop decision-making or decision-aiding frameworks by tackling the issue of social media-related performance measurement, which has been challenging until now. Moreover, SMA can provide architectural designs and solution frameworks for new social media-based applications and information systems. Finally, we call for an interdisciplinary SMA research agenda as well as a significantly increased level of interdisciplinary research co-operation, which must aim to generate significant advancements in scientific methods for analyzing social media, as well as to answer research questions from across different disciplines.", "paper_title": "Social Media Analytics An Interdisciplinary Approach and Its Implications for Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333198600004"}
