Unfortunately, at this moment there is no complete and procedural specification on how to build it. This paper presents a complete and generic knowledge representation scheme that makes it possible to conceptualise/represent the knowledge of any domain in a systematic way, guiding the definition of a corporate memory and allowing us to reach a more procedural level in knowledge management discipline. The conclusions of our study, which follows the generic and formal definition of any conceptualisation, are illustrated by a real project. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
