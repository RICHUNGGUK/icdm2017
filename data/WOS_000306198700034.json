The proposed algorithm selects either an LP or WLP filter on a per-frame basis. To provide a smooth transitions between LP and WLP frames, a window switching scheme is developed using sine and rectangular windows. In addition, a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based classification module is used to determine the prediction mode. Through a subjective listening test it was confirmed that the proposed LP/WLP switching scheme offers improved sound quality.", "paper_title": "LP/WLP Hybrid Scheme for Quality Improvement of TCX Coders Operating at Low Bit Rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000306198700034"}
