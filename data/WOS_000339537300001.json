A set of nonlinear equations are solved simultaneously to determine the plate responses to a thickness-dependent temperature field and/or a transverse mechanical loading. The plate is assumed to be unrestrained or restrained against lateral translation (in the plane of the plate) at all boundaries and free to rotate about the axes coincident with each boundary. It is shown that even without involving complex terms in the governing equations, the performance of the proposed method is very good. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
