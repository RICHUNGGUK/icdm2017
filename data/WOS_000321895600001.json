This study analyses the quality of OO models from two types of novice modellers based on the course projects from the authors 4 years teaching practice. In this study, the authors summarise a set of quality defect types and the typical design activities, quantify the level of occurrence for the defect types and lack of the activities, explore the causes for the defects to occur in OO models in the aspects of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in the phases of OO analysis and design, and conclude preventive measures. These findings can be used for improving the novice modellers' skills for building OO models with good quality.", "paper_title": "Analysing the quality of object-oriented models from novice modellers", "paper_id": "WOS:000321895600001"}
