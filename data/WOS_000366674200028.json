Based on the complexity and uncertainty in the node energy consumption and communication path in wireless sensor networks, this paper proposes a low energy adaptive clustering multi-hop routing protocol based on fuzzy decision (FD-LEACH). In order to constitute a dynamic network routing structure, the protocol introduces the concept of fuzzy set and uses the theory of fuzzy decision to select excellent communication relay nodes. Analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed protocol is more effectively adapted to large-scale wireless networks, which can provide a better balance in energy consumption and significantly prolong network lifetime.", "paper_title": "A low energy adaptive clustering multi-hop routing protocol based on fuzzy decision", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200028"}
