To the best of our knowledge, all these models fail to address the accurate end-to-end delay analysis of multi-hop wireless networks under unsaturated traffic condition considering the hidden and exposed terminal situation. In an effort to gain deep understanding of delay, this paper firstly proposes a new analytical model to predict accurate media access delay by obtaining its distribution function in a single wireless node. The interesting point of having the media access delay distribution is its generality that not only enables us to derive the average delay which has been reported in almost most of the previous studies as a special case but also facilitates obtaining higher moments of delay such as variance and skewness to capture the QoS parameters such as jitters in recently popular multimedia applications. Secondly, using the obtained single node media access delay distribution, we extend our modeling approach to investigate the delay in multi-hop networks. Moreover, probabilities of collisions in both hidden and exposed terminal conditions have been calculated. The validity of the model is demonstrated by comparing results predicted by the analytical model against those obtained through simulation experiments.", "paper_title": "An analytical model of delay in multi-hop wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000295684000008"}
