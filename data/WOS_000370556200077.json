Our evaluation shows that Monocle is capable of fine-grained per-rule monitoring for the majority of rules. In addition, it can help controllers to cope with switches that exhibit transient inconsistencies between their control plane and data plane states.", "paper_title": "Rule-Level Data Plane Monitoring With Monocle", "paper_id": "WOS:000370556200077"}
