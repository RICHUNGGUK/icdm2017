A total of 876 models have been constructed based on physicochemical descriptors and fingerprints. The overall predictive accuracies of the best models exceeded 80% for both training and test sets. The best model was employed for the virtual screening of anti-MRSA compounds, which were then validated by a cell-based assay using the broth microdilution method with three types of highly resistant MRSA strains (ST239, ST5, and 252). A total of 12 new anti-MRSA agents were confirmed, which had MIC values ranging from 4 to 64 mg/L. This work proves the capacity of combined multiple ligand-based approaches for the discovery of new agents active against MRSA with cell-based assays. We think this work may inspire other lead identification processes when cell-based assay data are available.", "paper_title": "Discovering New Agents Active against Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus with Ligand-Based Approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000345551000015"}
