In this paper, a secure multimedia distribution scheme is presented for a ubiquitous mobile content service, i.e., the Mobile TV based on the converged DVB-H (Digital Video Broadcasting - Handheld) and GPRS/GSM. At the server side, the Joint Compression and Encryption method is proposed to encrypt video contents. At the mobile terminal side, the Joint Decryption and Fingerprinting method is proposed to decrypt video contents and simultaneously embed the mobile terminal's identification information. When the media content is illegally redistributed to public networks, such as Internet or public TV, the proposed Fingerprint Detection and Traitor Tracing method will be used to identify the illegal redistributor. To show the proposed scheme's prior performances, the existing secure media distribution schemes are reviewed, and the comparative evaluations are done. The analysis and experimental results show that the proposed scheme is more suitable for secure mobile multimedia distribution. The work is expected to attract more researchers. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.
