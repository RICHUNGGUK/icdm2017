In this paper, we study embedding of meshes into TN(n). We prove three major results in this paper: (1) For any integer n >= 1, a 2 x 2(n-1) mesh can be embedded into TN(n) with dilation 1 and expansion 1. (2) For any integer n >= 4, an m x k(m >= 3, k >= 3) mesh cannot be embedded into TN(n) with dilation 1. (3) For any integer n >= 4, two node-disjoint 4 x 2(n-3) meshes can be embedded into TN(n) with dilation 2 and expansion 1. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
