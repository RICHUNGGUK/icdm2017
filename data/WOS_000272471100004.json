Initiatives and activities, such as the one described in this article, support the implementation of the Technology Informatics Guiding Educational Reform strategic agenda related to the transformation of nursing education through evidence and informatics. Descriptive reports of clinical database management are useful to conceptualize the evaluation of teaching and learning experiences as well as document the significance to students, faculty, future employers, and administration. The use of a database system for documentation of clinical experiences allows the student to practice and master informatics capabilities. Through data analysis, faculty can coordinate and assess students in the clinical environment and tailor learning experiences based on aggregated sets of patient encounters. Examination of the nature of patient encounters and clinical activities experienced permits an evidenced informed approach to student progress, curriculum development, and formative and summative evaluations.", "paper_title": "A Database for Nurse Practitioner Clinical Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000272471100004"}
