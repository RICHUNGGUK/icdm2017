This method enforces global constraints using integer programming, and it guarantees that no decipherment key is overlooked. We carry out extensive empirical experiments showing how decipherment accuracy varies as a function of cipher length and n-gram order. We also make an empirical investigation of Shannon's [12] theory of uncertainty in decipherment.", "paper_title": "Attacking Letter Substitution Ciphers with Integer Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000269808600004"}
