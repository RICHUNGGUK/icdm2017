Design/methodology/approach - A case study approach is adopted, and a research framework comprising human-, technological-, and organizational-dimensions is developed to analyze the evidence database which includes business flows, system design documents, archival records, post-system assessment, participant-observation and semi-structured interviews. Findings - The findings indicate that real-world production planning problems are ill-defined, complex and dynamic. A post-implementation evaluation reveals major pitfalls in the technology-dominant approach, whose negative ramifications are usually overlooked. Besides, these APS implementation pitfalls are found to be attributable to the real-world context, human factors and organizational aspects. Research limitations/implications - Despite advances in information technology (IT) and computer modeling techniques, humans still play critical roles in the production-planning processes especially in a complex and dynamic manufacturing environment where incomplete, ambiguous, inconsistent and untimely data make automatic planning unrealistic. A rational human-computer collaboration scheme under an effective organizational structure would be in a better position to take advantage of the IT. Originality/value - This paper presents a humans-technology-organization-framework of real planning systems, which is employed to analyze a case of APS implementation. Practical insights are extracted as a result of this field research, and a realist approach is proposed to cope with the problems and pitfalls of APS implementation in industrial settings.", "paper_title": "A reappraisal on advanced planning and scheduling systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250283000007"}
