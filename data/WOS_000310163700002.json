Given a graph H, and a set G subset of E( K-n) of initially 'infected' edges, we infect, at each time step, a new edge e if there is a copy of H in Kn such that e is the only not- yet infected edge of H. We say that G percolates in the H- bootstrap process if eventually every edge of Kn is infected. The extremal questions for this model, when H is the complete graph Kr, were solved ( independently) by Alon, Kalai and Frankl almost thirty years ago. In this paper we study the random questions, and determine the critical probability pc( n, K-r) for the K-r- process up to a poly- logarithmic factor. In the case r = 4 we prove a stronger result, and determine the threshold for pc( n, K-4). c 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
