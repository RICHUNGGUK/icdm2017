In this research, the authors study how disposition styles influence users' search patterns in product comparison services of e-commerce Web sites. The results show that people use relatively more feature paths and less product paths in vertical disposition style than horizontal disposition style. The findings also indicate that there are relatively more feature paths and less product paths in the first half than second half of the information search paths. This is consistent with Gensch's two-stage choice model which suggests that people use attribute processing to derive a consideration set before they apply alternative processing to arrive at a final choice in product comparison services.", "paper_title": "Information Search Patterns in E-Commerce Product Comparison Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000277146100002"}
