We developed a dialog modeling technique using an example-based approach to implement multiple applications such as car navigation, weather information, TV program guidance, and chatbot. Example-based dialog modeling (EBDM) is a simple and effective method for prototyping and deploying of various dialog systems. This paper also introduces the system architecture of multi-domain dialog systems using the EBDM framework and the domain spotting technique. In our experiments, we evaluate our system using both simulated and real users. We expect that our approach can support flexible management of multi-domain dialogs on the same framework.
