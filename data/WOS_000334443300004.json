Several cache strategies have been proposed for ECPs to manage data access and distributions while maintaining the service availability. In our earlier research, we have demonstrated that there is no \"one-fits-all\" strategy for heterogeneous scenarios and the selection of the optimal strategy is related with workload patterns, cluster size and the number of concurrent users. In this paper, we present a new reconfiguration framework named PRESC . It applies machine learning approaches to determine an optimal cache strategy and supports online optimization of performance model through trace-driven simulation or semi-supervised classification. Besides, the authors also propose a robust cache entries synchronization algorithm and a new optimization mechanism to further lower the adaptation costs. In our experiments, we find that PRESC improves the elasticity of ECPs and brings big performance gains when compared with static configurations.", "paper_title": "PRESC2: efficient self-reconfiguration of cache strategies for elastic caching platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000334443300004"}
