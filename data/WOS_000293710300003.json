This paper proposes a practical full-reference metric with consideration of the texture masking effect and contrast sensitivity function. The metric is capable of evaluating typical image impairments in real-world applications and can achieve the comparable performance as the state-of-the-art metrics on the publicly available subjectively-rated image databases. Due to its simplicity, the metric is embedded into JPEG image coding to ensure a better perceptual rate-distortion performance.", "paper_title": "Practical Image Quality Metric Applied to Image Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000293710300003"}
