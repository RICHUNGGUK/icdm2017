This data model is called STEP-NC. The purpose of this research is to investigate an intelligent STEP-NC controller, which involves a STEP-NC Parser and a motion controller. The STEP-NC Purser is programmed in VC++ in conjunction with the STIX library. All STEP-NC entities such as Workplan, Workingsteps, machining features, operations and machining strategy, can be extracted by the Purser. The motion controller consists of a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) and a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD). The DSP is responsible for tool path programming and servo controls whereas CPLD controls the position of an axis as well as other interfaced devices. This STEP-NC controller has the advantages of being modular, open, simple in structure, bi-directional in data flow and feature-based.", "paper_title": "Development of an NC controller for next generation CNCS", "paper_id": "WOS:000254028000009"}
