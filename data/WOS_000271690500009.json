In this study, we proposed an algorithm named SplitSSI-SVM that works with the following steps. First. the training and testing datasets are generated to test the SplitSSI-SVM. Second, the protein sequence is split into subsequence based on order and disorder regions. The protein sequence that is more than 600 residues is split into subsequences to investigate the effectiveness of the protein domain prediction based on subsequence. Third, multiple sequence alignment is performed to predict the secondary structure using bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) where BRNN considers the interaction between amino acids. The information of about protein secondary structure is used to increase the protein domain boundaries signal. Lastly, support vector machines (SVM) are used to classify the protein domain into single-domain, two-domain and multiple-domain. The SplitSSI-SVM is developed to reduce misleading signal, lower protein domain signal caused by primary structure of protein sequence and to provide accurate classification of the protein domain. The performance of SplitSSI-SVM is evaluated using sensitivity and specificity on single-domain, two-domain and multiple-domain. The evaluation shows that the SplitSSI-SVM achieved better results compared with other protein domain predictors such as DOMpro, GlobPlot, Dompred-DPS, Mateo, Biozon, Armadillo, KemaDom, SBASE, HMMPfam and HMMSMART especially in two-domain and multiple-domain.
