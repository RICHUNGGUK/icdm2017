A simulation study reveals that this hybrid methodology outperforms some commonly used bandwidth selection rules. It is shown that the proposed approach can also be readily employed in the context of variable kernel density estimation. We conclude with two illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "A hybrid bandwidth selection methodology for kernel density estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000327422900011"}
