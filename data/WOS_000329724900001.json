Smartphones periodically transmit Wi-Fi messages, even when not connected to a network. In this paper, we describe the Mo-Fi system which monitors and aggregates large numbers of continuous Wi-Fi message transmissions from nearby smartphones in the area of interest using nonintrusive Wi-Fi sniffer sensors. In this paper, we propose an optimized Wi-Fi channel detection and selection method to switch the best channels automatically to aggregate the Wi-Fi messages based on channel data transmission weights and human presence activity classification method based on the features of human dwell duration sequences in order to evaluate the user engagement index. By deploying in the real-world office environment, we found that the performance of Wi-Fi messages aggregation of CAOCA and CACFA algorithms is over 3.8 times higher than the worst channel of FCA algorithms and about 76% of the best channel of FCA algorithms, and the human presence detection rate reached 87.4%.", "paper_title": "Discovering Human Presence Activities with Smartphones Using Nonintrusive Wi-Fi Sniffer Sensors: The Big Data Prospective", "paper_id": "WOS:000329724900001"}
