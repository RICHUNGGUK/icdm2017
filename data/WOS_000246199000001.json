Seven molecular descriptors selected by the HM in CODESSA were used as inputs for SVM. The prediction results are in good agreement with the experimental values. The correlation coefficients R 2 of the nonlinear SVM model were 0.93 and 0.96 for the training and testing sets, respectively. This paper proposes a new and effective method to design new ligands of BzR based on QSAR study.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship study on a series of novel ligands binding to central benzodiazepine receptor by using the combination of Heuristic Method and Support Vector Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000246199000001"}
