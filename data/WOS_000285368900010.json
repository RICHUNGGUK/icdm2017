Because of some unidirectional devices (diode bridge and anti-run-back diodes), the system is not totally reversible. Some storage and dissipation systems are necessary to store or/and dissipate the returned energy to maintain the DC bus voltage and to increase the energy efficiency. This paper introduces four supervision strategies in two levels to maintain the DC bus voltage and compares these strategies with the help of two criteria: the voltage performance and efficiency.
