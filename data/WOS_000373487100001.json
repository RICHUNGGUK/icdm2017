To organize the points in a multidimensional space, we build a kd-tree space-partitioning data structure, which is used to efficiently apply a partition of unity interpolant. This global scheme is combined with local radial basis function (RBF) approximants and compactly supported weight functions. A detailed description of the algorithm for convex domains and a complexity analysis of the computational procedures are also considered. Several numerical experiments show the performances of the interpolation algorithm on various sets of Halton data points contained in O, where O can be any convex domain, like a 2D polygon or a 3D polyhedron. Finally, an application to topographical data contained in a pentagonal domain is presented.", "paper_title": "Partition of unity interpolation on multivariate convex domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000373487100001"}
