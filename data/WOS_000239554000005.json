We suggest that students use PLDs when constructing a central processing unit (CPU) with their own configured functions that are directly implemented in the logic. Such an approach could greatly increase the understanding of the architectural concept of the CPU, (C) 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "paper_title": "Learning computer architecture concepts with the FPGA-based \"move\" microprocessor", "paper_id": "WOS:000239554000005"}
