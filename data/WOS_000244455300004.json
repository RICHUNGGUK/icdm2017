The structure of the RBF network controller is derived using a filtered error approach. The proposed method in this paper begins with a relatively large network, and certain neural units of the RBF network are dropped by examining the estimation error increment. A complete convergence proof is provided in the presence of disturbance.", "paper_title": "Pruning based robust backpropagation training algorithm for RBF network tracking controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000244455300004"}
