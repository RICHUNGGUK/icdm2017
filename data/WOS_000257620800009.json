These surface representations of river systems are also required in mapping flood inundation extents. Creating surface representations of river systems is a challenging task because of issues associated with interpolating river bathymetry, and then integrating this bathymetry with surrounding topography. The objectives of this paper are to highlight key issues associated with creating an integrated river terrain, and propose GIS techniques to overcome these issues. The following techniques are presented in this paper: mapping and analyzing river channel data in a channel fitted coordinate system; interpolation of river cross-sections to create a 3D mesh for main channel; and integration of interpolated 3D mesh with surrounding topography. These techniques are applied and cross-validated by using datasets from Brazos River in Texas, Kootenai River in Montana, and Strouds Creek in North Carolina. Creation of a 3D mesh for the main channel using a channel-fitted coordinate system and subsequent integration with surrounding topography produces a coherent river terrain model, which can be used for 2D/3D hydrodynamic modeling and flood inundation mapping. Although techniques presented in this paper produce better results compared to existing GIS methods, the linear approach has some limitations which can be overcome by accounting for channel meanders, sinuosity and thalweg location.
