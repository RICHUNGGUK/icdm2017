In the customer analysis domain, identifying calling communities can be used for determining a particular customer's value according to the general pattern behavior of the community that the customer belongs to; this helps the effective targeted marketing design, which is Significantly important for increasing profitability. In telecommunication industry, machine learning techniques have been applied to the Call Detail Record (CDR) for predicting customer behavior such as churn prediction. In this paper, we pursue identifying the calling communities and demonstrate how cluster analysis can be used to effectively identify communities using information derived from the CDR data. We use the information extracted from the cluster analysis to identify customer calling patterns. Customers calling patterns are then given to a classification algorithm to generate a classifier model for predicting the calling communities of a customer. We apply different machine learning techniques to build classifier models and compare them in terms of classification accuracy and computational performance. The reported test results demonstrate the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
