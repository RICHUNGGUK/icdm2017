The proposed model results in a very complicated likelihood. Two variants of Monte Carlo EM algorithms are developed to carry out maximum likelihood estimation of mixture parameters. In addition, we offer a general information-based method for obtaining the asymptotic covariance matrix of maximum likelihood estimates. Some practical issues including the selection of starting values as well as the stopping criterion are also discussed. The proposed methodology is applied to a subset of the Australian Institute of Sport data for illustration.", "paper_title": "Robust mixture modeling using multivariate skew t distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000278472800007"}
