In this paper, we present a new algorithm called locality preserving and global discriminant projection with prior information (LPGDP) for dimensionality reduction and classification, by considering both the manifold structure and the prior information, where the prior information includes not only the class label but also the misclassification of marginal samples. In the LPGDP algorithm, the overlap among the class-specific manifolds is discriminated by a global class graph, and a locality preserving criterion is employed to obtain the projections that best preserve the within-class local structures. The feasibility of the LPGDP algorithm has been evaluated in face recognition, object categorization and handwritten Chinese character recognition experiments. Experiment results show the superior performance of data modeling and classification to other techniques, such as linear discriminant analysis, locality preserving projection, discriminant locality preserving projection and marginal Fisher analysis.", "paper_title": "Locality preserving and global discriminant projection with prior information", "paper_id": "WOS:000277415700012"}
