Various methods have been proposed in the literature which most of them are not capable of both preventing visual degradation and providing a large embedding capacity. In this paper, we propose a tunable visual image quality and data lossless method in spatial domain based on a genetic algorithm (GA). The main idea of the proposed technique is modeling the steganography problem as a search and optimization problem. Experimental results, in comparison with other currently popular steganography techniques, demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only achieves high embedding capacity but also enhances the PSNR of the stego image.
