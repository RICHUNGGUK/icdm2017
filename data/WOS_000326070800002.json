Previous work has quantified an empirical co-activation relationship in the elbow musculature, demonstrating that implementing this relationship as a constraint in an elbow muscle force prediction model improves muscle force predictions. The current study evaluated this modified model by extrapolating the co-activation relationship to 36 novel isometric unilateral, right-handed exertions, including those requiring greater intensity of effort and performed in different postures. Surface electromyography was recorded from the elbow flexors and extensors. Novel extrapolative co-activation relationships were developed and used as constraints in a muscle force prediction model. Model predictions using both constraints were compared with empirical biophysical data. Predictions by the modified model were more consistent with biophysical data than those by the original model for the novel exertions. Novel co-activation relationships did not further enhance predictions when compared with the previous relationship, suggesting that extrapolation of the previous relationship is feasible.", "paper_title": "Extrapolation of an empirical elbow muscle co-activation relationship to a novel task set: implications for predictions of individual muscle demands", "paper_id": "WOS:000326070800002"}
