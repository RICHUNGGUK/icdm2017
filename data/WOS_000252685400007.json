Starting from a model of complex cells in visual area V1, we propose a biologically plausible algorithm for frequency analysis applied to the shape from texture problem. First, specific log-normal filters are designed in replacement of the classical Gabor filters because of their theoretical properties and of their biological plausibility. These filters are separable in frequency and orientation and they better sample the image spectrum which makes them appropriate for any pattern analysis technique. A method to estimate the local frequency in the image, which discards the need to choose the best local scale, is designed. Based on this frequency analysis model, a local decomposition of the image into patches leads to the estimation of the local frequency variation which is used to solve the problem of recovering the shape from the texture. From the analytical relation between the local frequency and the geometrical parameters, under perspective projection, it is possible to recover the orientation and the shape of the original image. The accuracy of the method is evaluated and discussed on different kind of textures, both regular and irregular, with planar and curved surfaces and also on natural scenes and psychophysical stimuli. It compares favorably to the best existing methods, with in addition, a low computational cost. The biological plausibility of the model is finally discussed.", "paper_title": "Model of frequency analysis in the visual cortex and the shape from texture problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000252685400007"}
