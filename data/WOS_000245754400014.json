In this paper, we show that these models can also be adapted to the problem of classifying misspelled words by identifying its primary structure through statistical tools. This process leads to a new learning algorithm which is based in the parametrization of the set of recognizable words in order to detect any misspelled form of these words. As an application, a method to classify spam mails by means of the detection of the adulterated words, from a blacklist of words frequently used by spammers, is described. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
