It starts from an over-segmentation of the input image, exploiting color and spatial information among regions to propagate the labels from the regions marked by the user-provided seeds to the entire image. The region merging procedure is performed by matching two graphs: the input graph, representing the entire image; and the model graph, representing only the marked regions. The optimization is based on discrete search using deformed graphs to efficiently evaluate the spatial information. Note that by using a model-based approach, different interactive segmentation problems can be tackled: binary and multi-label segmentation of single images as well as of multiple similar images. Successful results for all these cases are presented, in addition to a comparison between our binary segmentation results and those obtained with state-of-the-art approaches.
