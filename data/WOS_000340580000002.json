We develop \"Repeat-Until-Success\" (RUS) circuits and characterize unitaries that can be exactly represented as an RUS circuit. Our RUS circuits operate by conditioning on a given measurement outcome and using only a small number of non-Clifford gates and ancilla qubits. We construct an algorithm based on RUS circuits that approximates an arbitrary single-qubit Z-axis rotation to within distance e, where the number of T gates scales as 1.26 log(2)(1/is an element of) - 3.53, an improvement of roughly three-fold over state-of-the-art techniques. We then extend our algorithm and show that a scaling of 2.4 log(2)(1/is an element of) - 3.28 can be achieved for arbitrary unitaries and a small range of is an element of, which is roughly twice as good as optimal deterministic decomposition methods.", "paper_title": "REPEAT-UNTIL-SUCCESS: NON-DETERMINISTIC DECOMPOSITION OF SINGLE-QUBIT UNITARIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000340580000002"}
