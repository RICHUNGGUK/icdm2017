Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a coupling between two integrals methods: the magnetic moment method (MMM) and the partial element equivalent circuit (PEEC) method. The modeling of conductor system is achieved thanks to PEEC method while the MMM method is considered for the magnetic material. Findings - The paper shows how to use the MMM/PEEC coupled method to model a problem comprising conductors and ferromagnetic materials and compare its results with the FEM and the FEM/PEEC coupling. Originality/value - The two methods PEEC and MMM are well-known. The innovation here is coupling these methods in order to take advantages from both methods. Moreover, the performances of this coupling are studied in comparison with others (FEM, FEM/PEEC coupling).", "paper_title": "Coupling between PEEC and magnetic moment method", "paper_id": "WOS:000314484400023"}
