The fact that the shape vectors in the different views are related only by rotation can be formulated as a rank = 3 constraint. This constraint is implemented in an algorithm which solves 3D motion and structure estimation as a practical constrained minimization. Experiments demonstrate its usefulness as a tool in structure from motion providing very accurate estimates of 3D motion.", "paper_title": "A 3D shape constraint on video", "paper_id": "WOS:000236734400016"}
