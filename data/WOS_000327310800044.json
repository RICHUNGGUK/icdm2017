Then we present a novel shadow removal algorithm by performing illumination transfer on the matched subregion pairs between the shadow regions and non-shadow regions, and this method can process complex images with different kinds of shadowed texture regions and illumination conditions. In addition, we develop an efficient shadow boundary processing method by using alpha matte interpolation, which produces seamless transition between the shadow and non-shadow regions. Experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of our algorithm in both the shadow removal quality and performance.", "paper_title": "Efficient Shadow Removal Using Subregion Matching Illumination Transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000327310800044"}
