It was conducted on a corpus of 1h30 of spoken French, involving three pairs of speakers in dialogues. Results show that although the tendency is for marked constructions both in syntax and prosody not to be reinforced by gestures, there is still a higher proportion of gesture reinforcing with prosodic marking than with syntactic fronting. The paper describes which eyebrow and head movements as well as hand gestures are more liable to accompany the two operations. Beyond these findings, the study gives an insight into the current models proposed in the literature for gesture speech production. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
