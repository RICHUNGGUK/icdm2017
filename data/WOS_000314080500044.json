Under these rules, necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decentralized supervisor that achieves a given specification language are easily obtained from the result of literature. If a given specification language does not satisfy these existence conditions, we must compute its sublanguage satisfying them. The main contribution of this paper is proposing a method for computing such a sublanguage.", "paper_title": "Computation of Sublanguages for Synthesizing Decentralized Supervisors for Timed Discrete Event Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314080500044"}
