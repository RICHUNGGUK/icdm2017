AUC scores calculated from background values, or pseudo-absences, have been proposed as a method of model selection for species distribution models (SDMs) fitted to presence-only data. However, the utility of AUC as a measure of model performance when data on confirmed absence are unavailable has not been fully investigated. We fitted SDMs using informative climatic variables for 2000 species of Mesoamerican trees. As a reference, we also built 'pseudo-models' using Gaussian random fields with no biological meaning. AUC correctly selected SDMs fitted to single environmental variables over 'pseudo-models' fitted to single random fields in almost all cases. However, when all seven variables were included in the models, AUC erroneously selected complex pseudo-models over complex climate models in 17% of the cases. The spatial distribution patterns predicted by the pseudo-models differed from the results derived from climate-based models, even when overall AUC scores were similar. Both model and pseudo-model AUC values increased when presence points were few and spatially aggregated. The results show that AUC calculated from presence-only data can be an unreliable guide for model selection. Pseudo-absences have ill-defined properties that challenge the interpretation of AUC values. Inference on multidimensional niche spaces should not be supported by AUC values calculated using pseudo-absences.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-absences, pseudo-models and pseudo-niches: pitfalls of model selection based on the area under the curve", "paper_id": "WOS:000311086500003"}
