Any adaptation to speed up the solution procedure is, thus, desirable. The performance of the evolutionary technique, multi-objective simulated annealing (MOSA), is found to improve by the use of two adaptations, MOSA-JG and MOSA-aJG, inspired by the concept of jumping genes (JG) in biology. This is because of the increase in diversity. These adaptations are similar to those used with NSGA-II [Kasat, R. B., & Gupta, S. K. (2003). Multiobjective optimization of an industrial fluidized-bed catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) using genetic algorithm with the jumping genes operator. Computers & Chemical Engineering, 27, 1785]. Optimization of three benchmark problems and two computationally intensive, real-life, two- and three-objective problems [Kasat, R. B., Kunzru, D., Saraf, D. N., & Gupta, S. K. (2002). Multiobjective optimization of industrial FCC units using elitist nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. Industrial & Engineering Chemistry Research, 41, 4765] for an industrial FCCU, are studied. The aJG adaptation of MOSA leads to non-dominated optimal solutions having a good spacing and reasonable maximum spread of the non-dominated solutions. These adaptations can prove to be of considerable value for solving other computationally intensive problems in chemical engineering. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
