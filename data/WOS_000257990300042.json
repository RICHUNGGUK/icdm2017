As the channel model considers the log-normal fading, the resultant signal to noise ratio (SNR) follows a chi-squared log-normal distribution. Based on this, the bit error probability is derived. Furthermore, simulation verifies this theoretical result.", "paper_title": "Bit error performance of STBC MB-OFDM UWB", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300042"}
