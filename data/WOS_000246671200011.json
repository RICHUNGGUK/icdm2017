Available bandwidth enables the sending rate to adapt to network conditions, so that packet loss, caused by congestion, can be significantly reduced before error control mechanisms are finally employed. To this end, we propose a probing noise resilient available bandwidth estimation scheme, called JitterPath, which is adaptive to both the fluid and bursty traffic models. Two key factors, one-way delay jitter and accumulated queuing delay, are both exploited to predict the type of queuing region for each packet pair. Then, the bottleneck utilization information included in the joint queuing regions is estimated and used to quantify the captured traffic ratio, which indicates the relationship between the probing rate and available bandwidth. The contributions of our method are as follows: 1) JitterPath can work without being restricted to fluid traffic models; 2) since JitterPath does not directly use the bottleneck link capacity to calculate the available bandwidth, it is feasible for use in a multihop environment with a single bottleneck; and 3) JitterPath inherently reduces the impact of probing noises under the bursty cross traffic model. Extensive simulations, Internet experiments, and comparisons with other methods were conducted to verify the effectiveness of our method under both single-hop and multihop environments.", "paper_title": "JitterPath: Probing noise resilient one-way delay jitter-based available bandwidth estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000246671200011"}
