In this article, we discuss the concept of resilience and resilience engineering in light of its distinct identity. We propose the principle of design of resilient systems. Then, we outline how these design principles can be applied to the enterprise information system to make it more resilient. This leads to a proposed architecture of resilient enterprise information systems.", "paper_title": "On the principle of design of resilient systems - application to enterprise information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000278636100002"}
