Computational simulation results are provided for a range of grid resolutions. The results for simple means, turbulent kinetic energy, and fourth-order velocity correlations are compared with the experimental data and with a reference LES-Smagorinsky calculation from the literature. Far-field-noise predictions are obtained based on several integral control surfaces, which are used for consistency of the model. The far-field noise spectra are also compared with the experiment. The directivity of the far field noise predicted is analysed with the Azimuthal Decomposition Technique and compared with jet noise data from the TsAGI experimental database. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
