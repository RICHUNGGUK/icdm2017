Ants move according to a deterministic algorithm designed to explore all corridors. Each ant remembers the shape of corridors which it has visited. Once two ants meet, they share the information acquired. We evaluate how the time of getting a complete information by an ant depends on the number of ants, and how the length known by an ant depends on time. Numerical results are presented in the form of scaling relations.", "paper_title": "DETERMINISTIC ANTS IN LABYRINTH - INFORMATION GAINED BY MAP SHARING", "paper_id": "WOS:000318526700003"}
