As the number of competing flows becomes large, the asymptotic queue behavior (normalized by the number of flows) at the gateway can be described by a simple recursion and the throughput behavior of individual TCP flows becomes asymptotically independent. A Central Limit Theorem complement is also presented, yielding a more accurate characterization of the asymptotic queue size. These results suggest a scalable yet accurate model of this complex large-scale stochastic feedback system, and crisply reveal the sources of queue fluctuations.", "paper_title": "On the behavior of ECN/RED gateways under a large number of TCP flows: Limit theorems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237341900005"}
