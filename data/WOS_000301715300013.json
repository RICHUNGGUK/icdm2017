To achieve good CP radiation at 1575 MHz, two circular slots of dissimilar sizes are embedded separately into the radiating element and the ground plane. This CP design possesses the advantages such as simple in structure, uncomplicated fine-tuning technique, and ease in manufacturing tolerances. Parametric studies via simulation are carried out to comprehend the vital parameters that will affect the impedance matching and frequency of the CP radiation. Prototypes of the proposed antenna have been constructed and experimentally studied. The measured results show a 10-dB bandwidth and 3-dB axial ratio bandwidth of 2.28 and 0.89%, respectively. Furthermore, stable gain variation at around 3.6 dBic is also observed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
