These invariants represent selected properties of mathematical objects, such as matrices, that one can associate with biological sequences. In this article, we are exploring properties of recently introduced Line Distance matrices, and in particular we consider properties of their eigen-values. We prove that Line Distance matrices of size n have one positive and n-1 negative eigen-values. Visual representation of Cauchy's interlacing property for Line Distance matrices is considered.
