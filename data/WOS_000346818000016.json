They reduce the number of expensive calculations required to determine whether or not two geometrical entities collide by using inexpensive calculations to rule out parts of the objects that could not possibly intersect. Quickly producing a high quality BVH is an important aspect of three-dimensional multimedia analysis. As such a powerful optimization, efficient and high quality BVHs are still an active area of research. Herein, the authors present a novel BVH representation that reduces the redundancy in the tree structure by allowing a node to contain an arbitrary number of children, as well as compressing non-unique nodes and combining their children. A new partitioning scheme using a graphical representation of the object is also presented to improve the quality of the generated BVH. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
