This task is computationally very hard, and there are programs for which computing cautious consequences is not viable in reasonable time. However, current ASP solvers produce the (whole) set of cautious consequences only at the end of their computation. This paper reports on strategies for computing cautious consequences, also introducing anytime algorithms able to produce sound answers during the computation.", "paper_title": "Anytime Computation of Cautious Consequences in Answer Set Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000343203200024"}
