The major technical challenge is to identify effective anti-monotonic properties for pruning the search space of skyline groups. To this end, we first show that the anti-monotonic property in the well-known Apriori algorithm does not hold for skyline group pruning. Then, we identify two anti-monotonic properties with varying degrees of applicability: order-specific property which applies to SUM, MIN, and MAX as well as weak candidate-generation property which applies to MIN and MAX only. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data sets verify that the proposed algorithms achieve orders of magnitude performance gain over the baseline method.", "paper_title": "On Skyline Groups", "paper_id": "WOS:000333532800013"}
