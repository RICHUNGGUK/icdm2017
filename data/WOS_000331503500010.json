In order to select the subset of best actions, the pairwise comparisons between the actions on each criterion are modeled by basic belief assignments (BBAs). Dempster's rule of combination is used for the aggregation of the BBAs of each pair of alternatives in order to express a global comparison between them on all the criteria. A model inspired by ELECTRE I is also proposed and illustrated by a pedagogical example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
