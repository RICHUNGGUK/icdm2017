The main purpose is to embed an annealed cooling schedule into the rough neural network to construct a segmentation system named annealed rough neural net (ARNN). The classification system is a paradigm for the implementation of annealed reasoning and rough systems in neural network architecture. Instead of all the information in the image are fed into the neural network, the upper-and lower-bound gray level, captured from a training vector in a multispectral image, were fed into a rough neuron in the ARNN. Therefore, only 2-channel images are selected as the training samples if an N-dimensional multispectral image was used. In the simulation results, the proposed network not only reduces the consuming time but also reserves the classification performance.", "paper_title": "Segmentation of multispectral MR images through an annealed rough neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552000010"}
