In this paper we prove that the Clar covering polynomial of a hexagonal system H coincides with the cube polynomial of its resonance graph R(H) by establishing a bijection between the Clar covers of H and the hypercubes in R(H). Moreover, some important applications of this relation are presented.", "paper_title": "A Relation between Clar Covering Polynomial and Cube Polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000328007000002"}
