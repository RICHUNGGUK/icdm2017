{"auto_keywords": [], "paper_keywords": ["Optimal optical orthogonal code", " Difference family", " Difference matrix"], "paper_abstract": "The size of a (v, 5, 2, 1) optical orthogonal code (OOC) is shown to be at most equal to when v a parts per thousand 11 (mod 132) or v a parts per thousand 154 (mod 924), and at most equal to in all the other cases. Thus a (v, 5, 2, 1)-OOC is naturally said to be optimal when its size reaches the above bound. Many direct and recursive constructions for infinite classes of optimal (v, 5, 2, 1)-OOCs are presented giving, in particular, a very strong indication about the existence of an optimal (p, 5, 2, 1)-OOC for every prime p a parts per thousand 1 (mod 12).", "paper_title": "On optimal (v, 5, 2, 1) optical orthogonal codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000318173000024"}
