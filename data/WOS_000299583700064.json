It significantly influences the overall analysis accuracy and processing speed of the whole breast mass analysis. In this paper, a novel edge map adjusting gradient vector flow snake (EMA GVF snake) algorithm for extrapolation of breast region from mammograms is proposed. In the proposed algorithm, the median filter is used to filter out the noise in a mammogram, the scale down stage is used to resize down the mammogram size (hence speeding up the extrapolation). The binarization processing stage and the morphological erosion processing stage are used to find a rough breast border. Then a novel gradient adjusting stage is applied to get a modified edge map and the gradient vector flow snake (GVF snake) is used to get the accurate breast border from the rough breast border. The proposed algorithm is tested on 322 digital mammograms from the Mammogram Image Analysis Society database. The mean error function, misclassification error function and the relative foreground area error function are conducted to evaluate the results of the detected breast border and the extracted breast region. Experimental results show that the breast border extrapolated by the proposed algorithm approximately follows the breast border extrapolated by an expert radiologist. Experimental results also show that the proposed algorithm is more robust and precise than the traditional GVF snake scheme for the breast extrapolation on mammograms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
