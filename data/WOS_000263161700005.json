This paper describes the application of a hierarchical coevolutionary fuzzy system called HiCEFS for predicting financial time series. A novel financial trading system using HiCEFS as a predictive model and employing a prudent trading strategy based on the price percentage oscillator (PPO) is proposed. In order to construct an accurate predictive model, a form of generic membership function named Irregular Shaped Membership Function (ISMF) is employed and a hierarchical coevolutionary genetic algorithm (HCGA) is adopted to automatically derive the ISMFs for each input feature in HiCEFS. With the accurate prediction from HiCEFS and the prudent trading strategy, the proposed system outperforms the simple buy-and-hold strategy, the trading system without prediction and the trading system with other predictive models (EFuNN, DENFIS and RSPOP) on real-world financial data.", "paper_title": "Financial Market Trading System With a Hierarchical Coevolutionary Fuzzy Predictive Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000263161700005"}
