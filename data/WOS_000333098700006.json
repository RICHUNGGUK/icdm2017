Using the implicit function theorem and back-stepping technique, a practical robust adaptive neural control scheme is proposed to guarantee that the tracking error converges to an adjusted neighborhood of the origin by choosing appropriate design parameters. In contrast to conventional Lyapunov-based design techniques, an alternative Lyapunov function is constructed for the development of control law and learning algorithms. Differing from the existing results in the literature, the control scheme does not need to compute the derivatives of virtual control signals at each step in backstepping design procedures. Furthermore, the scheme requires the desired trajectory and its first derivative rather than its first n derivatives. In addition, the useful property of the basis function of the radial basis function, which will be used in control design, is explored. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Novel Neural Control for a Class of Uncertain Pure-Feedback Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333098700006"}
