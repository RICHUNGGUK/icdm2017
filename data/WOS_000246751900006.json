General problems and prevalent solutions to the modeling of heterogeneous objects are investigated. Vigorous heterogeneous object representations are roughly classified into three major categories: evaluated models, unevaluated models and composite models. We reveal their similarities and study their strengths and weaknesses in terms of the representational capacities, intuitiveness, exactness, compactness, efficiency and other criteria. Different design paradigms are briefly reviewed to provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in heterogeneous object design. Finally, open problems and possible future directions are discussed.
