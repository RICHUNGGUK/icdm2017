Both the embedding and the extraction of watermarks are done in the compressed domain, so the computational cost is low. Moreover, the watermark extraction is blind, i.e., no original unwatermarked MPEG-2 video is needed for watermark extraction. The presented technique is applicable not only to MPEG-2 video, but also to other DCT-based coding videos. Selected experimental results validate our techniques.", "paper_title": "Blind MPEG-2 video watermarking robust against geometric attacks: A set of approaches in DCT domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000237850600019"}
