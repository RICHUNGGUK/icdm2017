If a job is subcontracted, its processing cost is different from the in-house cost and its delivery lead time is a stepwise function of the total processing time of outsourced jobs. Two objective functions are studied (1) to minimize the weighted sum of the maximal completion time and the total processing cost and (2) to minimize the weighted sum of the number of tardy jobs and the total processing cost. For the first problem, we prove that it is NP-hard and get a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm. For the second problem, we prove that it is NP-hard and get a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm for a special case.", "paper_title": "Single machine scheduling problems with subcontracting options", "paper_id": "WOS:000324135100008"}
