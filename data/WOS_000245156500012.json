The core idea behind our proposed technique is to use geometric insight in helping construct an efficient and fast 3-D mesh smoothing strategy to fully preserve the geometric structure of the data. Illustrating experimental results demonstrate a much improved performance of the proposed approach in comparison with existing methods currently used in 3-D mesh smoothing.", "paper_title": "Vertex-based diffusion for 3-D mesh denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000245156500012"}
