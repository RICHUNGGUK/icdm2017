Virtual reality (VR) simulations can immerse students totally in educational experiences in a way that is not possible using other methods. Learning in a VR environment can also be more effective and motivating than usual classroom practices. Traditionally, immersion has been considered central to the quality of a VR system; immersive VR is considered a special and unique experience that cannot achieved by three-dimensional (3D) interactions on desktop PCs. However, some authors have suggested that if the content design is emotionally engaging, immersive systems are not always necessary. The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and usability of two low-cost VR systems, offering different levels of immersion, in order to develop the ability to perform diagnostic interviews in eating disorders by means of simulations of psychopathological explorations.", "paper_title": "Virtual Reality to Train Diagnostic Skills in Eating Disorders.
