This new approach can enable more secure multi-party communication since, if the wireless packets are forged by another wireless communication party, the interval fingerprint can provide another way to detect the spoofing packet. Moreover, the random evolutionary algorithms, both genetic and memetic, are also proposed as a means to generate the random interval fingerprint. Compared to the conventional random generator, our approach is flexible in generating uniform random and long cycle numbers, and more robust for the anti-cracking. It is difficult for the forged party to produce the fake random intervals. Finally, we provide an application example, a completed work survey, pseudo-code and analysis result to prove that our concept is feasible for the Wireless communication.", "paper_title": "The evolutionary random interval fingerprint for a more secure wireless communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000331088300001"}
