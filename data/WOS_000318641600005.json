In this paper, we propose a unified approach for computing the (t,k)-diagnosability of numerous multiprocessor systems (graphs) under the Preparata, Metze, and Chien's model, including hypercubes, crossed cubes, twisted cubes, locally twisted cubes, multiply-twisted cubes, generalized twisted cubes, recursive circulants, Mobius cubes, Mcubes, star graphs, bubble-sort graphs, pancake graphs, and burnt pancake graphs. Our approach first sketches the common properties of the above classes of graphs, and defines a superclass of graphs, called m-dimensional component-composition graphs, to cover them. We then show that the m-dimensional component-composition graph G for m >= 4 is (Omega(h), kappa(G)-diagnosable, where h = {2(m) (2)xlg(m-1)/2(m-2m-1) (if vertical bar V(G)vertical bar) (>=) (m!),(if 2m-1) (<=) (vertical bar V(G)vertical bar) (<) (m!) and kappa(G) and vertical bar V(G)vertical bar denote the node connectivity and the number of nodes in G, respectively. Based on this result, the (t,k)-diagnosability of the above multiprocessor systems can be computed efficiently.", "paper_title": "Component-Composition Graphs: (t,k)-Diagnosability and Its Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000318641600005"}
