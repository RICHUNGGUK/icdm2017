This model is combined with a model of an additive increase, multiplicative decrease end-to-end controller to obtain a global description of a controlled packet switched network with buffering delays. The global stability of this general model is then analysed using singular perturbation analysis. It is shown that under sufficiently small propagation delays, this general model is globally and exponentially stable.", "paper_title": "Singular perturbation analysis of an additive increase multiplicative decrease control algorithm under time-varying buffering delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400041"}
