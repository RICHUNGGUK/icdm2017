Using the hydropathy characteristics, namely hydropathy blocks, the protein sequences are converted into fixed-dimensional feature vectors. Subsequently, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is utilized to identify the GPCR proteins belonging to the same families or subfamilies. The experimental results on GPCR datasets show that the proteins belonging to the same family or subfamily can be identified using features generated based on the hydropathy blocks.", "paper_title": "Classifying G-protein coupled receptors with hydropathy blocks and support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400063"}
