Therefore, rather than comparing entire survival curves, researchers may wish to focus the comparison on fixed time points with potential clinical utility. For two independent samples of right-censored data, Klein et al. (2007) compared survival probabilities at a fixed time point by studying a number of tests based on transformations of the Kaplan-Meier estimators of the survival function. To compare the survival probabilities at a fixed time point for paired right-censored data or clustered right-censored data, however, their approach requires modification. In this paper, we extend the statistics to accommodate possible within-pair and within-cluster correlation. We use simulation studies to present comparative results. Finally, we illustrate the implementation of these methods using two real data sets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
