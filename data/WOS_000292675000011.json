By establishing a new L-operator inequality and using the properties of M-matrix, under more relaxing condition of the diffusion coefficient matrix, we obtain the sufficient condition ensuring the exponential pth moment stability and almost sure exponential stability of stochastic fuzzy cellular neural networks with time-varying delays. One example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
