Our results demonstrate improved search results in the presence of varying levels of semantic evidence, and higher performance using retrieval functions that combine document, as well as sentence and passage level information. Experimental results are promising. When ranking documents based on the most relevant extracted passages, the results exceed the state-of-the-art by 15.28% as assessed by the TREC 2005 Genomics track collection of 4.5 million MEDLINE citations.
