The process is divided in two different stages: indexing and retrieval. Three information flows have been created with different kind of information each one: word forms, stems and stemmed bigrams. The final result combines the results obtained in the three streams. Knowledge is added to the system by means of an ontology created automatically from the St. Andrews Corpus. The system has been evaluated at CLEF05 image retrieval task.", "paper_title": "A probabilistic, text and knowledge-based image retrieval system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000063"}
