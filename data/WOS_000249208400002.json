The very different length scales in the geometry result in an anisotropy effect. Our study is motivated by a parabolic heat conduction problem in a thin foil leading to such anisotropic reaction-diffusion problems in each time step of an implicit time integration method [7]. The reaction-diffusion problem contains two important parameters, namely epsilon > 0 which parameterizes the thickness of the domain and mu > 0 denoting the measure for the size of the reaction term relative to that of the diffusion term. In this paper we analyze the convergence of a multigrid method with a robust (line) smoother. Both, for the W- and the V-cycle method we derive contraction number bounds smaller than one uniform with respect to the mesh size and the parameters epsilon and mu.", "paper_title": "On the robustness of a multigrid method for anisotropic reaction-diffusion problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249208400002"}
