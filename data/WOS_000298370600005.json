Using as weights particular background solutions constructed by the geometrical control method, we recover classical imaging algorithms by appropriately averaging limited-view data. We show both analytically and numerically that if one can accurately construct the geometric control, then one can perform imaging with the same resolution when using limited-view data as when using full-view data.", "paper_title": "Transient Wave Imaging with Limited-View Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000298370600005"}
