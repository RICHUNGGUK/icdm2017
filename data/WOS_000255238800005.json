In this paper we analyze the basic relations between the wiring pattern and characteristics of the spike-train. Based on the relations, we present a learning algorithm which utilizes successive changes of the wiring pattern. It is shown that the neuron can reproduce spike-trains of another neuron which has an unknown wiring pattern. It is also shown that the neuron can approximate various spike-trains of a chaotic analog spiking neuron. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
