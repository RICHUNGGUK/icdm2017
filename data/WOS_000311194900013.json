In particular, it is shown that when the L-relation is reflexive, the upper (resp. lower) set is equivalent to the lower (resp. upper) L-fuzzy approximation set. Then by the upper (resp. lower) set, it is indicated that an L-preorder is the equivalence condition under which the set of all the lower (resp. upper) L-fuzzy approximation sets and the Alexandrov L-topology are identical. However, associating with an L-preorder, the equivalence condition that L-interior (resp. closure) operator accords with the lower (resp. upper) L-fuzzy approximation operator is investigated. At last, it is proven that the set of all the lower (resp. upper) L-fuzzy approximation sets forms a complete lattice when the L-relation is reflexive.
