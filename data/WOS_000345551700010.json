On the assumption that mobile CSD's are randomly distributed by a Poisson point process (PPP), an optimization problem is formulated to determine the probability of storing the individual content in each server in a manner that minimizes the average caching failure rate. Further, we present a low-complexity search algorithm, optimum dual-solution searching algorithm (ODSA), for solving this optimization problem. We demonstrate that the proposed ODSA takes fewer iterations, on the order of O(log N) searches, for caching N contents in the system to find the optimal solution, as compared to the number of iterations in the conventional subgradient method, with an acceptable accuracy in practice. Furthermore, we identify the important characteristics of the optimal caching policies in the mobile environment that would serve as a useful aid in designing the mCDN.", "paper_title": "Mobile Device-to-Device (D2D) Content Delivery Networking: A Design and Optimization Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000345551700010"}
