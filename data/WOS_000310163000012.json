This approach identifies all robustly testable paths in a circuit and the corresponding complete set of test vectors. We address the problem of finding a minimal set of test vectors that covers all robustly testable paths. We propose greedy and simulated-annealing-based algorithms to find the same. Results on ISCAS89 benchmark circuits show a considerable reduction in test vectors for covering all robustly testable paths.", "paper_title": "Symbolic-Event-Propagation-Based Minimal Test Set Generation for Robust Path Delay Faults", "paper_id": "WOS:000310163000012"}
