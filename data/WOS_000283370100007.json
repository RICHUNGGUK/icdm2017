The nonlinear plant is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) uncertain fuzzy model, and the communication links between the plant and controller are assumed to be imperfect, i.e., data-packet dropouts occur intermittently, which is often the case in a network environment. Stochastic variables that satisfy the Bernoulli random-binary distribution are adopted to characterize the data-missing phenomenon, and the attention is focused on the design of a piecewise static-output-feedback (SOF) controller such that the closed-loop system is stochastically stable with a guaranteed H-infinity performance. Based on a piecewise Lyapunov function combined with some novel convexifying techniques, the solutions to the problem are formulated in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, simulation examples are also provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Model-Based Piecewise H-infinity Static-Output-Feedback Controller Design for Networked Nonlinear Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283370100007"}
