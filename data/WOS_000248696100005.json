This work investigates the effect of using a subset of the original data set as the reference set of the classifier. With this aim, the concept of a reference-consistent subset is introduced and it is shown that finding the minimum-cardinality reference-consistent subset is intractable. Then, the Condensed Nearest Neighbor Domain Description (CNNDD) algorithm is described, which computes a reference-consistent subset with only two reference set passes. Experimental results revealed the advantages of condensing the data set and confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed approach. A thorough comparison with related methods was accomplished, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of one-class nearest-neighbor-based training-set-consistent condensation.", "paper_title": "Condensed nearest neighbor data domain description", "paper_id": "WOS:000248696100005"}
