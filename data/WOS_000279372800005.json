As a part of meeting this challenge, the flow of information between decisions processes defined as realizing a decision must be analyzed and modelled as a prerequisite for the subsequent design, construction and implementation of information systems. This paper defines the actors, their role and communication specifics associated with the various decision and control processes in farmers' information management. Core-task analysis and core task demands from earlier research are utilised as premises for the modelling of information flow from the farmers' point of view. A user-friendly generic FM IS design reference model is the primary objective for the study in which planning, execution and evaluation measures have been incorporated. A user-centric approach to model the information flows for targeted field operations is presented. The information models are centred around the farmer as the principal decision maker and involves external entities as well as mobile unit entities as the main information producers. This is a detailed approach to information modelling that will enable the generation of a Farm Management Information System in crop production. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
