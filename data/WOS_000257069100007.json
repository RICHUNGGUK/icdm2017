The simulation language RAO (resource-action-operation) is used to implement the proposed approach. Numerical examples are carried out to validate the approach flexibility and efficiency. RAO is a discrete events simulator. This tool proposes a great flexibility of modeling, that allows one to keep track of each resource's evolution and even offers animation possibilities. By exploiting the characteristic of RAO, a new simulation and optimization platform of maintenance policies is presented.", "paper_title": "Development of simulation and optimization platform to analyse maintenance policies performances for manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257069100007"}
