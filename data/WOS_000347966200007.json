Moreover, the unsatisfactory results of several recent arc segmentation contests indicate that conventional methods are inadequate. This paper proposes a new arc segmentation algorithm called SymCAve (an acronym for Symmetry axis, Circle fitting and Average distribution points). First, we locate several seed points and adopt three strategies to ensure that the seed points are proper; then we calculate the center and radius utilizing the seed points. Second, the coordinates of the center and radius are adjusted by employing symmetry axes. Third, the average distribution points method is used to verify whether the points on the circumference are all black pixels. It is a complete circle if all of the points are black pixels. Otherwise, it is a partial circle if some of the points are black pixels and are continuous. Based on this information, the start and end angles of the partial circle can be determined. Finally, these arcs are verified to ensure that the results are accurate. Images and the evaluation tool were obtained from the GREC Workshop's Arc Segmentation contests, to test the systematic performance of the SymCAve algorithm. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can provide promising results. However, the algorithm has some drawbacks: it cannot detect a line with width of one pixel, small angles, and any large radius arcs. It is suited for segmenting images with appropriate symmetry axes.", "paper_title": "A Novel Arc Segmentation Approach for Document Image Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000347966200007"}
