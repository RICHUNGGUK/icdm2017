The problem has several conflicting objectives, such as cost, reliability, network delay, and number of hops between source and destination. These objectives can conveniently be expressed in linguistic terms - a key component of fuzzy logic. This paper presents an approach based on fuzzy logic that combines the conflicting objectives into a single optimization function. A new fuzzy operator, namely, the unified AND-OR (UAO) operator is also proposed, and a decision-making approach based on fuzzy rules and preference rules is introduced. The UAO operator is empirically compared with the well-known ordered weighted averaging (OWA) operator through application to an evolutionary algorithm. Results show that the UAO operator exhibits comparatively better performance than the OWA operator. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
