The system allows the users to interact with computer-generated virtual objects using their hands directly. With an efficient color segmentation algorithm, the system is adaptable to different light conditions and backgrounds. It is also suitable for real-time applications. The dominant features on the palm are detected and tracked to estimate the camera pose. After the camera pose relative to the user's hand has been reconstructed, 3D virtual objects can be augmented naturally onto the palm for the user to inspect and manipulate. With off-the-shelf web camera and computer, natural bare-hand based interactions with 2D and 3D virtual objects can be achieved with low cost.", "paper_title": "Vision-Based Hand Interaction in Augmented Reality Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000290407700003"}
