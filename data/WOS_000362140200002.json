A combined Houbolt, central finite-difference (FD) and forward FD method is proposed for time discretization of acceleration and velocity to reduce time-step lengths. Compared to existing methods, the developed approach has advantages that it: (1) captures the coupled effects of material viscoelasticity, dynamics and system damping, which fosters understanding structural responses and material deformations: (2) is able to model temperature and space-dependent material properties. The model is implemented and validated for a multilayer pavement-soil structure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
