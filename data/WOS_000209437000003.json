BibBase uses a powerful yet light-weight approach to transform BiBTeX files into rich Linked Data as well as custom HTML code and RSS feed that can readily be integrated within a user's website while the data can instantly be queried online on the system's SPARQL endpoint. In this paper, we present an overview of several features of our system. We outline several challenges involved in on-the-fly transformation of highly heterogeneous BiBTeX files into high-quality Linked Data, and present our solution to these challenges.", "paper_title": "Publishing bibliographic data on the Semantic Web using BibBase", "paper_id": "WOS:000209437000003"}
