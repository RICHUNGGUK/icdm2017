In B3G networks, SLA provides multiple service classes on access networks so that service classes should be managed to assure the service satisfaction for users. In this paper, we propose a dynamic QoS management scheme by IP traffic class controlling based on SLA in B3G networks. To manage dynamic traffic service, we consider Differentiated services (Diffserv) mechanism for the resource management by SLA. An IP service traffic class on SLA can be dynamically changed by Diffserv traffic management to support dynamic end-to-end QoS. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme has higher performance in comparison with non-dynamic management scheme.", "paper_title": "A dynamic QoS management scheme in B3G networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100109"}
