The algorithms are memetic Pareto particle swarm optimization based RBFN (MPPSON), Memetic Elitist Pareto non dominated sorting genetic algorithm based RBFN (MEPGAN) and Memetic Elitist Pareto non dominated sorting differential evolution based RBFN (MEPDEN). The proposed methods integrate accuracy and structure of RBFN simultaneously. These algorithms are implemented on two-class and multiclass pattern classification problems with one complex real problem. The results reveal that the proposed methods are viable, and provide an effective means to solve multi-objective RBFNs with good generalization ability and simple network structure. The accuracy and complexity of the network obtained by the proposed algorithms are compared through statistical tests. This study shows that the proposed methods obtain RBFNs with an appropriate balance between accuracy and simplicity. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
