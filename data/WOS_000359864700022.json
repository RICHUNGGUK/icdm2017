In order to perform a routing algorithm with minimum resource consumption, an ideal ad hoc routing protocol should be designed for low consumed resources such as low power consumption. In this paper focus on ad hoc routing protocols, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) and gossip-based routing protocols, based on selective forwarding node algorithms that reduce the control message overheads. Thus, we present performance analytical results to thoroughly evaluate the routing protocols and demonstrate our Adaptive-Gossiping method advantages over Static-Gossiping routing and OLSR protocols in densely deployed networks.
