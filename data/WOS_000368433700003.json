The goal of errorless hardness amplification is to show that if f has no size s errorless circuit that outputs \"don't know\" on at most a delta fraction of inputs, then some f' related to f has no size s' errorless circuit that outputs \"don't know\" on at most a 1 - epsilon fraction of inputs. Thus, the hardness is \"amplified\" from delta to 1 - epsilon. Unfortunately, this amplification comes at the cost of a loss in circuit size. If the reduction makes q queries to the hypothesized errorless circuit for f', then we obtain a result with s' = s/q. Hence, it is desirable to keep the query complexity to a minimum. The first results on errorless hardness amplification were obtained by Bogdanov and Safra. They achieved query complexity O ((1/delta log 1/epsilon)(2) center dot 1/epsilon log 1/delta) when f' is the XOR of several independent copies of f. We improve the query complexity (and hence the loss in circuit size) to O(1/epsilon log 1/delta), which is optimal up to constant factors for non-adaptive black-box errorless hardness amplification. Bogdanov and Safra also proved a result that allows for errorless hardness amplification within NP. They achieved query complexity O(k(3) center dot 1/epsilon(2) log 1/delta) when f' consists of any monotone function applied to the outputs of k independent copies of f, provided the monotone function satisfies a certain combinatorial property parameterized by delta and epsilon. We improve the query complexity to O(k/t center dot 1/epsilon log 1/delta), where t >= 1 is a certain parameter of the monotone function. Using the best applicable monotone functions (which were constructed by Bogdanov and Safra), our result yields a query complexity of (O) over tilde (1/epsilon(3) center dot 1/delta) for balanced functions f, improving on the (O) over tilde (1/epsilon(8) center dot 1/delta(6)) query complexity that follows from the Bogdanov-Safra result. As a side result, we prove a lower bound on the advice complexity of black-box reductions for errorless hardness amplification.", "paper_title": "QUERY COMPLEXITY IN ERRORLESS HARDNESS AMPLIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000368433700003"}
