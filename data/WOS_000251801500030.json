In this correspondence, we prove that in MIMO multiple-access systems (or MIMO point-to-point systems with V-BLAST transmission), lattice-reduction-aided decoding achieves the maximum receive diversity (which is equal to the number of receive antennas). Also, we prove that the naive lattice decoding (which discards the out-of-region decoded points) achieves the maximum diversity.", "paper_title": "LLL reduction achieves the receive diversity in MIMO decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000251801500030"}
