The proof generated by the full-angle method is organized hierarchically, thus it is particularly suitable for visual presentations. We also present the method for automated generation of visually dynamic presentation of proofs for the deductive database method with an additional new visual feature: given a geometrical configuration or a diagram, the final database (the fixpoint) in the deductive database method has numerous geometric properties organized into a few categories. By clicking each category, all properties of the configuration in this category are listed. And by clicking each of these properties, the corresponding geometry elements in the diagram blink or animate and, if needed, the proof of this property is generated.", "paper_title": "Visually Dynamic Presentation of Proofs in Plane Geometry Part 2.
