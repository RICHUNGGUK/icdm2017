A very good linear correlation (R-2=0.993) was obtained, between calculated ionization energies at the ZORA/BP86/TZP level, and the experimental half-wave oxidation potentials E-1/2. A similar linear correlation between the computed electron affinities and the electrochemical reduction U-IV/U-III potentials (R-2=0.996) is obtained. The importance of solvent effects and of spin-orbit coupling is definitively confirmed. The molecular orbital analysis underlines the crucial role played by the 5f orbitals of the central metal whereas the Nalewajski-Mrozek (N-M) bond indices explain well the bond distances variations following the redox processes. The IE variation of the complexes, i.e., IE(F)<IE(Cl)<IE(Br)<IE(I) is also well rationalized considering the frontier MO diagrams of these species. Finally, this work confirms the relevance of the Hirshfeld charges analysis which bring to light an excellent linear correlation (R-2=0.999) between the variations of the uranium charges and E-1/2 in the reduction process of the U-V species.", "paper_title": "Redox properties of biscyclopentadienyl uranium(V) imido-halide complexes: a relativistic DFT study", "paper_id": "WOS:000338632200012"}
