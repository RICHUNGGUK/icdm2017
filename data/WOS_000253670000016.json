The modified Eulerian two-fluid model is employed to predict the gas-particle flows. The computational results using both the methods are compared with the LDV results of Kliafas and Holt, wherein particles with corresponding diameter of 50 mu m are simulated with a flow Reynolds number of 3.47 x 10(5). RNG-based kappa-epsilon model is used as the turbulent closure, wherein additional transport equations are solved to account for the combined gas-particle interactions and turbulence kinetic energy of the particle phase turbulence. Moreover, using the current turbulence modelling formulation, a better understanding of the particle and the combined gas-particle turbulent interaction has been shown. The Eulerian-Eulerian model used in the current study was found to yield good agreement with the measured values. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
