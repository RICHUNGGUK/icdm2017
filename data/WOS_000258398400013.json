By properly choosing operating conditions, within the adiabatic framework the systems develops two decoupled subspaces. The subspace where a SWAP operation takes place turns out to be resilient to low frequency fluctuations. The possibility to encode a single qubit in a protected two-physical-qubit system subspace is briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "Protected computational subspaces of coupled superconducting qubits", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400013"}
