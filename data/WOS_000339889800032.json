Motion vectors derived from compressed video are preferred for video indexing because they can be accessed by partial decoding; thus, they are used extensively in various video analysis and indexing applications. In this study, we introduce an efficient compressed domain video indexing method and implement it on the H.264/AVC coded videos. The video retrieval experimental evaluations indicate that the video retrieval based on the proposed indexing method outperforms motion vector based video retrieval in 74 % of queries with little increase in computation time. Furthermore, we compared our method with a pixel level video indexing method which employs both temporal and spatial features. Experimental evaluation results indicate that our method outperforms the pixel level method both in performance and speed. Hence considering the speed and precision characteristics of indexing methods, the proposed method is an efficient indexing method which can be used in various video indexing and retrieval applications.", "paper_title": "An efficient compressed domain video indexing method", "paper_id": "WOS:000339889800032"}
