Then, the method is employed to study the Internet scalability problem in performance, scale and service scalability. Based on the examples, theoretical analysis and experimental simulation are conducted to address the scalability issue. The results show that the proposed definition and evaluation method of multi-dimensional Internet scalability can effectively evaluate the scalability of the Internet in every aspect, thus providing rational suggestions and methods for evaluation of the next generation Internet architecture.", "paper_title": "Analysis and case study on multi-dimensional scalability of the Internet architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000003"}
