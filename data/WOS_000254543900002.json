We show that bin packing with rejection can be reduced to n multiple knapsack problems and, based on techniques for the multiple knapsack problem, we give a fast asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme,\"Reject&Pack\", with time complexity O(n(O(epsilon-2))). This improves a recent approximation scheme given by Epstein, which has time complexity O(n(O((epsilon-4)epsilon-2))). We also show that Reject&Pack can be extended to variable-sized bin packing with rejection and give an asymptotic polynomial time approximation scheme. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
