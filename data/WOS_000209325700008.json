In this situation, a user can search the Web not only by himself, but together with his friends and families, which aims to find information that meets requirements from all of them. In such collaborative search, users first search the Web separately and collect contents of interest, and then, share the contents with others by showing a screen with each other. However, because mobile devices generally have a small screen, this process is burdensome for users. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose an interface to support users engaged in collaborative search to share and compare their collected contents. The proposed interface provides functionalities to effectively share contents collected by all members and to add reviews in order to make content search and comparison easier.", "paper_title": "Content comparison functions for mobile co-located collaborative web search", "paper_id": "WOS:000209325700008"}
