In this paper an MPEG-like descriptor is proposed that contains conventional contour and region shape features with a wide applicability from any arbitrary shape to document retrieval through word spotting. Its size and storage requirements are kept to minimum without limiting its discriminating ability. In addition to that, a relevance feedback technique based on Support Vector Machines is provided that employs the proposed descriptor with the purpose to measure how well it performs with it. In order to evaluate the proposed descriptor it is compared against different descriptors at the MPEG-7 CE1 Set B database. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
