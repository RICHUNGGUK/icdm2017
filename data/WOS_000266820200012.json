This is done by accounting each cycle to either a base, miss event or waiting cycle component during multi-threaded execution. Single-threaded alone execution time is then estimated as the sum of the base and miss event components; the waiting cycle component represents the lost cycle count due to SMT execution. The cycle accounting architecture incurs reasonable hardware cost (around 1KB of storage) and estimates single-threaded performance with average prediction errors around 7.2% for two-program workloads and 11.7% for four-program workloads. The cycle accounting architecture has several important applications to system software and its interaction with SMT hardware. For one, the estimated single-thread alone execution time provides an accurate picture to system software of the actually consumed processor cycles per thread. The alone execution time instead of the total execution time (timeslice) may make system software scheduling policies more effective. Second, a new class of thread-progress aware SMT fetch policies based on per-thread progress indicators enable system software level priorities to be enforced at the hardware level.", "paper_title": "Per-Thread Cycle Accounting in SMT Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000266820200012"}
