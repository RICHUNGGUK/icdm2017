The general properties of the process are discussed. In addition, the definition of a fuzzy random equilibrium renewal process, as a special case of the fuzzy random delayed renewal process, is also given. Finally, concerned with the fuzzy random equilibrium renewal process, the expected value of a fuzzy random equilibrium renewal variable and the mean chance of the remaining life are studied.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy random delayed renewal process and fuzzy random equilibrium renewal process", "paper_id": "WOS:000246132900004"}
