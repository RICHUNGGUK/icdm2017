Both private-key storage for one authorized user (only two, group elements) and communication transmission bandwidth (three group elements) in our scheme are of constant size regardless of the number of colluders. In terms of efficiency and security, our scheme is very efficient with lower encryption and decryption computational cost and more secure against k number of colluders by introducing self-enforcing protection strategy.", "paper_title": "A new ID-based broadcast encryption scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800047"}
