Two algorithms for high-speed system are evaluated under the same PC grid environment. Both methods are based on a computer-generated hologram algorithm. One method is a division algorithm based on time development for the measurements, while the other is a division algorithm based on spatial reconstruction for the measurement. In case of the former, the performance is increased by a factor of 3.3 by using 4 PCs. The present system can compute huge hologram images and output them \"on-site\" at an experimental facility.
