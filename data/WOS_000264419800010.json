Previously, numerous multicast protocols based on automatic repeat request (ARQ) have been proposed to improve the packet delivery ratio. However, these ARQ-based protocols can lead to excessive control overhead and drastically reduced throughput. In this paper, we present a comprehensive exploration of the design space for developing high-throughput, reliable multicast protocols that achieve 100% PDR. Motivated by the fact that 802.11 MAC layer broadcast, which is used by most wireless multicast protocols, offers no reliability, we first examine if better hop-by-hop reliability provided by unicasting the packets at the MAC layer can help to achieve end-to-end multicast reliability. We then turn to end-to-end Solutions at the transport layer. Previously. forward error correction (FEC) techniques have been proved effective for providing reliable multicast in tire Internet, by avoiding the control packet implosion and scalability problems of ARQ-based protocols. In this paper, we examine if FEC techniques can be equally effective to Support reliable multicast in wireless mesh networks. We integrate four representative reliable schemes (one ARQ, one FEC, and two hybrid) originally developed for the Internet with a representative multicase protocol ODMRP and evaluate their performance. Our experimental results via extensive simulations offer an in-depth understanding of the various Choices in the design space. First, compared to broadcast-based unreliable ODMRP, Using unicast for per-hop transmission only offers a very small improvement in reliability Under low load, but fails to improve the reliability under high load due to the significantly increased capacity requirement which leads to congestion and packet drop. Second, at the transport layer, the use Of pure FEC can significantly improve the reliability, increasing PDR Lip to 100% in many cases, but can be inefficient in terms of the number of redundant packets transmitted. In contrast, a carefully designed ARQ-FEC hybrid protocol, Such as RMDP, can also offer 100% reliability while improving the efficiency by up to 38% compared to a pure FEC scheme. To our best knowledge, this is the first in-depth study Of high-throughput, reliable multicast protocols that provide 100% PDR for wireless mesh networks. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
