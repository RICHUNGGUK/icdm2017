Thus, CAS should be designed to minimize the effects of updates, for which high reusability of the CAS components is desired. In this paper, we present our experience of re-engineering CAS based on a feature model for improved reusability of components, which alleviates the difficulty of system maintenance. The result of this project has been successfully transferred to the company.", "paper_title": "Re-engineering a credit card authorization system for maintainability and reusability of components - A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000238575400012"}
