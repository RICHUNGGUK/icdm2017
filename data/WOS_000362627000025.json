The contributions are as follows: (1) The stabilization conditions can be obtained by a new method which overcomes the drawbacks of the previous results; (2) A larger stabilization region can be found by solving an optimization problem. Two illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness of our contributions.", "paper_title": "Further study on local stabilization of continuous-time nonlinear systems presented as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627000025"}
