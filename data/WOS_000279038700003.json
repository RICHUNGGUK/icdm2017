We consider the set Sigma(R, C) of non-negative m x n integer matrices (contingency tables) with row sums R and column sums C as a finite probability space with the uniform measure. We prove that a random table D is an element of Sigma(R, C) is close with high probability to a particular matrix (*typical table') Z defined as follows. We let g(x) = (x + 1)ln(x + 1) - x ln x for x >= 0 and let g(X) = Sigma(i,j) g(x(ij)) for a non-negative matrix X = (x(ij)). Then g(X) is strictly concave and attains its maximum on the polytope of nonnegative m x n matrices X with row sums R and column sums C at a unique point, which we call the typical table Z.", "paper_title": "What Does a Random Contingency Table Look Like?", "paper_id": "WOS:000279038700003"}
