It aims to embed assembly tools into the planning process of assembly sequences in a dynamic shop-floor. The experimental results demonstrate that the developed approach is efficient and practical for a high Fidelity assembly sequence with alternatives of assembly-tool sets. The dynamic assembly planning can efficiently support product assembly by generating feasible assembly sequences. It provides an effective design-aiding tool to virtually deal with various what-if scenarios regarding product assembly. In particular, the Web-based application developed in this research can be incorporated into a high-performance design and manufacturing environment on the Web, forming a distributed, collaborative and globally networked tool for product assembly planning.
