To do so, the deadline driven scheduling algorithm is modeled by an MSVL (Modeling, Simulation and Verification Language) program and the feasibility theorem is formulated by PPTL formulas with two parts: a necessary part and a sufficient part. Then, several lemmas are abstracted and proved by means of the axiom system of PPTL. With the help of the lemmas, two parts of the theorem are deduced respectively. This case study convinces us that some real-time properties of systems can be formally verified by theorem proving using the axiom system of PPTL. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
