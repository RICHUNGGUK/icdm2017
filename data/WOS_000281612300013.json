Hence, the quality of the microarrays design which includes selecting short Oligonucleotide sequences (probes) to be affixed on the surface of the microarray becomes a major issue. A good design is the one that contains the minimum possible number of probes while having an acceptable ability in identifying the targets existing in the sample. This paper focuses on the problem of computing the minimal set of probes which is able to identify each target of a sample, referred to as non-unique oligonucleotide probe selection. We present the application of an estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) named Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA) to this problem, for the first time. The proposed approach considers integration of BOA and one simple heuristic introduced for the non-unique probe selection problem. The results provided by this approach compare favorably with the state-of-the-art methods in the single target case. While most of the recent research works on this problem has been focusing on the single target case only, we present the application of our method in integration with decoding approach in a multiobjective optimization framework for solving the problem in the case of multiple targets.
