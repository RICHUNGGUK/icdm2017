However, too small or distorted output ripple limits its performance. Consequently, a positive-sloped ramp wave injection method is used to overcome this problem and enhances its application capability significantly. First of all, the details of the positive-sloped ramp wave injection method are illustrated, and second some experimental results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Pulse-Frequency-Modulated Digital Control of Power Supply Without Analog-to-Digital Converter Using Positive-Sloped Ramp Wave Injection", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700017"}
