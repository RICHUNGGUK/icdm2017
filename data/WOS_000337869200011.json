Caused by the sink mobility, the paths between the sensor nodes and the sink change with time. It is necessary to find a protocol that can find efficient routings between the mobile sink and sensor nodes but do not consume too many network resources. In this paper, we propose an algorithm called virtual-node greedy embedding (VGE) to embed the topology of a WSN into hyperbolic plane without the physical geographic information. This algorithm gives each node a virtual coordinate that guarantees the greedy forwarding of the packets from sensor nodes to the sink when there is no failed node in WSN, even if some obstacles exist in the network. VGE keeps the greedy property when new nodes join the network after the initial embedding and does not change the node coordinates assigned previously. Based on the characteristic of embedding process, modified gravity-pressures (MGP) algorithm is proposed to find a routing path quickly when there are some failed nodes in WSN. Further-more, particular solutions of the parameters in VGE are presented with concise style, and the simulations show that our algorithm has an efficient performance.
