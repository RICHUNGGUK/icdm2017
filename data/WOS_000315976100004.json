Many researchers have developed different routing protocols at network layer which have considered transmission power, residual battery capacity and self-organization while routing data packets to the destination. Swarm intelligence such as ants can find a shortest path when they work collectively as a group. The main focus of this work is to develop an energy-efficient swarm routing algorithm called Energy-efficient Ant-colony-based Routing Algorithm (EARA) for the MANETs. We have compared traditional Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) with EARA in terms of the node lifetime and throughput. The simulation results show that EARA has around 7% increase in average packet delivery ratio than AODV under different mobility speed indicating that it explores other optimal routes to improve the total efficiency.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Ant-Colony-Based Routing Algorithm for the MANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000315976100004"}
