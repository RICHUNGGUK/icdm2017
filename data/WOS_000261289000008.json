It enables to set up hardware/software configurations, and to specify conditions and methods for dynamic reconfiguration. The reconfiguration pattern was inspired by the reconfiguration management solution of the Specification PEARL methodology, which is based on the standard for Multiprocessor PEARL whose original idea it was to extend the language to enable the programming of distributed real-time applications in PEARL. In Specification PEARL, the possibility for abstract descriptions of hardware and software architectures and for defining mappings from software to hardware components has been enhanced in correspondence with the standard. Here, a UML pattern for reconfiguration management in distributed embedded applications based on concepts from Specification PEARL is presented. Its behavioural, structural and functional aspects are outlined. It addresses stereotype entities from the Specification PEARL language, which were joined in a UML profile, and outlines the related reconfiguration management mechanisms, which were carried over to the mentioned UML pattern. The proposed reconfiguration pattern is to facilitate the development of distributed embedded application in UML with consistent and temporally predictable reconfiguration support. It should also support and enhance the applications' flexibility and portability.", "paper_title": "A reconfiguration pattern for distributed embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000261289000008"}
