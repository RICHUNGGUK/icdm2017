Examples of PMSs abound in many practical applications such as aerospace, nuclear power, and airborne weapon systems. Reliability analysis of a PMS must consider statistical dependence of component states across different phases, as well as dynamics in system structure functions and component behavior. In this paper, we propose a recursive method for exact reliability evaluation of a binary-state or multistate PMS consisting of nonidentical, binary, and nonrepairable elements. The system elements can fail individually or due to common-cause failures (CCFs) caused by some external factors. The proposed method is based on the branch-and-bound principle, and can be fully automated. The method is applicable to PMSs with nonoverlapping or overlapping sets of elements that can fail as a result of CCFs. The method is illustrated using both analytical and numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Reliability of Nonrepairable Phased-Mission Systems With Common Cause Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000323496700017"}
