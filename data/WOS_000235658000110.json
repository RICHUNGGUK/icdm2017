It is very important and difficult to store and access the distributed mass spatial data for GIS application. Integrated object storage technology, GIS has high scalability and availability. At the same time, with the higher abstract object interface, both the GIS and the storage device have higher intelligence which facilitate the management of mass spatial data and the various applications of GIS.", "paper_title": "Object storage system for mass geographic information", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000110"}
