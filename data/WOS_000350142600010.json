In such environments, both grid/service providers and consumers can be modelled as intelligent agents. These agents can leave and enter the environment freely at any time. Task allocation under time constraints becomes a challenging issue in such environments because it is difficult to apply a central controller during the allocation process due to the openness and dynamism of the environments. This paper proposes a negotiation-based method for task allocation under time constraints in an open, dynamic grid environment, where both consumer and provider agents can freely enter or leave the environment. In this method, there is no central controller available, and agents negotiate with each other for task allocation based only on local views. The experimental results show that the proposed method can outperform the current methods in terms of the success rate of task allocation and the total profit obtained from the allocated tasks by agents under different time constraints.
