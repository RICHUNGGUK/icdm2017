Detecting moving pedestrians is a challenging task, some of the detection methods are ineffective and slow. Occlusion, rotation, changes in object shapes, real time detection and illumination conditions are predominant obstacles. This paper is focus on the implementation of an efficient and speedy detector. A detection framework based on region of interest (ROI), full-body descriptor, body-part descriptors, and cascade classifier is proposed. ROI identifies, locates, and extracts candidate regions containing pedestrians, thus reducing the number of detection windows. In relation to human detection, independent information sources such as shapelet features and multi-block local binary pattern (MB-LBP) are used for features extraction. Experimental results showed that the proposed-model performs better than some state-of-the-art approaches, with suitable processing time for further operations such as tracking and imminent danger estimation.
