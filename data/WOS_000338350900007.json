This notion was introduced by Balister, Lehel and Schelp in [J. Graph Theory 51 (2006), pp. 22-32], where it is shown that cycles (except for C-4) are Ramsey-unsaturated, and conjectured that, moreover, one may add any chord without changing the Ramsey number of the cycle C-n, unless n is even and adding the chord creates an odd cycle. We prove this conjecture for large cycles by showing a stronger statement. If a graph H is obtained by adding a linear number of chords to a cycle C-n, then r(H) = r(C-n), as long as the maximum degree of H is bounded, H is either bipartite (for even n) or almost bipartite (for odd n), and n is large. This motivates us to call cycles strongly Ramsey-unsaturated. Our proof uses the regularity method.", "paper_title": "Cycles Are Strongly Ramsey-Unsaturated", "paper_id": "WOS:000338350900007"}
