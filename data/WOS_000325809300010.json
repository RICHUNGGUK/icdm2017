A literature review of the techniques used to extract the features of fingerprint as well as recognition techniques is given in this paper. Some of the reviewed research articles have used traditional methods such as recognition techniques, whereas the other articles have used neural networks methods. In addition, fingerprint techniques of enhancement are introduced.", "paper_title": "Fingerprint image enhancement and recognition algorithms: a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000325809300010"}
