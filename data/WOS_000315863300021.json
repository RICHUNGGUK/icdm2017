This paper deals with the mathematical modeling of divorce propagation allowing the estimation of the future divorced population. We use a coupled discrete linear-quadratic difference system model and data collected from the Spanish Statistics Institute (INE). A sensitivity analysis of the growth of the divorced population with respect to the contagion rate is included, and several different economic scenarios are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
