Based on this algorithm and a novel use of orientations, in graphs, we obtain a (3 beta/4 + 3 beta(2)/4)-approximation algorithm for TSP with beta-relaxed triangle inequality (beta-TSP), where beta >= 1. A graph G is an insfance of beta-TSP, if it is a complete graph with edge weights c: E(G) -> Q >= 0 that are restricted as follows. For each triple of vertices u, v, w is an element of V (G), c({u, v}) <= beta(c({u, w}) + c ({w, v})). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
