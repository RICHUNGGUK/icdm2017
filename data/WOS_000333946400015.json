In this respect, Email Based Identification and Authentication (EBIA) is an outstanding technique due to its usability. However, it does not handle properly some major issues which make it unsuitable for systems where security is of concern. In this work we modify EBIA to propose a protocol for users registration. Moreover, we assess the security properties of the protocol using the automatic protocol verifier ProVerif. Finally, we show that the modifications applied to EBIA are necessary to ensure security since, if they are removed, attacks on the protocol are enabled. Our proposal keeps the high usability features of EBIA, while reaching a reasonable security level for many applications. Additionally, it only requires minor modifications to current Internet infrastructures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
