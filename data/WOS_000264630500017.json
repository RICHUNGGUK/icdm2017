By employing the information of probability distribution of the time delay, the original system is transformed into a T-S fuzzy model with stochastic parameter matrices. Based on the new type of T-S fuzzy model, the delay-distribution-dependent criteria for the mean-square exponential stability of the considered systems are derived by using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, parallel distributed compensation approach, and the convexity of some matrix equations. The solvability of the derived criteria depends not only on the size of the delay but also on the probability distribution of the delay taking values in some intervals. The revisions of the main criteria in this paper can also be used to deal with the case when only the information of variation range of the delay is considered. It is shown by practical examples that our method can lead to very less conservative results than those by other existing methods.", "paper_title": "Delay-Distribution-Dependent Stability and Stabilization of T-S Fuzzy Systems With Probabilistic Interval Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500017"}
