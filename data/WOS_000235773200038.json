Automatic methods are able to segment ail image into coherent regions, but such regions generally do not correspond to complete meaningful parts. In this paper, we show that even a single training example can greatly facilitate the induction of a semantically meaningful segmentation on novel images within the same domain: images depicting the same, or similar, objects in a similar setting. Our approach constructs a non-parametric representation of the example segmentation by selecting patch-based representatives. This allows us to represent complex semantic regions containing a large variety of colors and textures. Given an input image, we first partition it into small homogeneous fragments, and the possible labelings of each fragment are assessed using a robust voting procedure. Graph-cuts optimization is then used to label each fragment in a globally optimal manner.", "paper_title": "Inducing semantic segmentation from an example", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773200038"}
