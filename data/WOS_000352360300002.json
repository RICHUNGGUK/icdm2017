Mobile devices are resource and energy limited; they can rely on cloud computing resource to perform computationally intensive operations such as data mining and multimedia processing. This paper presents the cost and energy aware service provisioning scheme for mobile client in mobile cloud, which includes two-stage optimization process. In the first-stage optimization process, the mobile cloud user gives the unique optimal payment to the cloud provider under the cost and energy constraint and optimizes its benefit. In the second-stage optimization process, mobile cloud provider runs multiple VMs to execute the jobs for mobile cloud users; the cloud providers also need to maximize the revenue. The cost and energy aware service provisioning algorithm in mobile cloud is proposed. The proposed algorithm is involved with the cloud datacenter provider's optimization and mobile cloud user's optimization, which are conducted by two routines. In the simulation, the proposed cost and energy aware mobile cloud service provisioning algorithm is compared with other related algorithm.", "paper_title": "Cost and energy aware service provisioning for mobile client in cloud computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000352360300002"}
