While the upper bound is deterministic, the lower bound holds for randomized adopt-commit objects as well. Our results are based on showing that adopt-commit objects are equivalent, up to small additive constants, to a simpler class of objects that we call conflict detectors. Our anonymous lower bound also applies to the individual step complexity of m-valued wait-free anonymous consensus, even for randomized algorithms with global coins against an oblivious adversary. The upper bound can be used to slightly improve the cost of randomized consensus against an oblivious adversary. For deterministic non-anonymous implementations of adopt-commit objects, we show a lower bound of and an upper bound of on the worst-case individual step complexity. For randomized non-anonymous implementations, we show that any execution contains at least one process whose steps exceed the deterministic lower bound.", "paper_title": "Tight Bounds for Adopt-Commit Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000341099100002"}
