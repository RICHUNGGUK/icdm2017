A motion vector recovery algorithm for temporal error concealment is proposed. The motion vectors field is modeled as Gauss-Markov Random Field (GMRF) and the motion vectors of the damaged image macroblocks can be recovered adaptively by Maximum a Posteriori (MAP). Simulation results show that the proposed method offers significant improvement on both objective PSNR measurement and subjective visual quality of restored video sequence.", "paper_title": "An adaptive MRF-MAP motion vector recovery algorithm for video error concealment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300076"}
