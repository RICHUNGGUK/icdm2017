We assume that a translation can introduce new variables and that the result of translating a theory can either be produced in time polynomial in the size of the theory or its output is of size polynomial in the size of the theory; we restrict to the case in which the original theory has extensions. This study fills a gap between two previous works, one studying bijective translations among restrictions of default logics and one studying non-bijective translations between default variants of default logic.", "paper_title": "Bijective faithful translations among default logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000339921000003"}
