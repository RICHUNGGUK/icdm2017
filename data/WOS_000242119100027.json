However, various results emphasize that the most remarkable contribution of perimeter search is that it is an efficient way for improving the original heuristic estimations. Henceforth, a natural question arises: whether it is feasible or not to increase even more the capabilities for improving h((.)) when using a perimeter-like approach. As it will be shown, the so-called \"heuristic perimeter\" idea can be widely considered as an alternative to the classical perimeter and as a baseline for the research in this area.", "paper_title": "Heuristic perimeter search: First results", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100027"}
