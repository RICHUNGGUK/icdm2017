An analysis, complemented by simulation experiments, of the local characteristics of the network's attractors with respect to a parameter controlling the intensity of the local competition is performed. We find that the attractors are hierarchically clustered when the parameter of the local competition is changed.", "paper_title": "Clustering of stored memories in an attractor network with local competition", "paper_id": "WOS:000243806000001"}
