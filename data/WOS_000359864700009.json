Firstly, the solution adopted AES encryption and decryption algorithm to package multimedia contents, and meanwhile bound digital license to the hardware of the terminal device, as achieved the usage control and secure playback for mobile multimedia contents. Secondly, the license was written with Extensible Markup Language (XML), and especially a digital rights sharing between terminal devices was supported in the scheme. Thirdly, the times of reading and writing were reduced in the process of encrypting and decrypting multimedia contents by the way of introducing the appropriate size of the buffer, which effectively improved the encryption and decryption speed, and shortened the response time of the system. Finally, a prototype indicated that the solution has significant features of high security and faster cryptographic computation speed meeting the practical requirements for digital rights management and sharing by Android platforms.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to rights sharing-enabling digital rights management for mobile multimedia", "paper_id": "WOS:000359864700009"}
