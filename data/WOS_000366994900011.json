This is understandable taking into account the high cost of equipment required for upgrading these laboratories. One solution to this problem may be the development of online remote laboratories that can be shared among universities. This will not only offer the reduction of cost but also the utilization of modern technology that meets expectations of the new generation of students. In this paper we present the development of one such laboratory that also aims to incorporate renewable generation technologies", "paper_title": "Development of Online Power Laboratory with Renewable Generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994900011"}
