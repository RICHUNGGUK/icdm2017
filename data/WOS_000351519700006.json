As a result, many of them are redundant to other rules, and they are practically useless. To overcome this issue, methods for mining non-redundant rules are essentially required. To address such problem, we initially propose a definition for redundancy in sense of minimal knowledge and then a compact representation of non-redundant association rules which we call as compact informative generic basis. We also provide an improved version of the existing DCI_CLOSED algorithm (DCI_PLUS) to find out the frequent closed itemsets (FCI) with their minimal representative generators in combination with BitTable which represents a compact database form in a single scan of the original database. We further introduce an algorithm for constructing the compact informative generic basis from the FCI and their generators in an efficient way. We finally present an inference mechanism in which all association rules can be generated without accessing the database. Experiments are performed on the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the other existing related methods.", "paper_title": "An effective association rule mining scheme using a new generic basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000351519700006"}
