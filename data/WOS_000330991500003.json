For such networks under repeated attack by an omniscient adversary, we propose a fully distributed algorithm, Xheal, that maintains good expansion and spectral properties of the network, while keeping the network connected. Moreover, Xheal does this while allowing only low stretch and degree increase per node. The algorithm heals global properties like expansion and stretch while only doing local changes and using only local information. We also provide bounds on the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian which captures key properties such as mixing time, conductance, congestion in routing etc. Xheal has low amortized latency and bandwidth requirements. Our work improves over the self-healing algorithms Forgiving tree [PODC 2008] and Forgiving graph [PODC 2009] in that we are able to give guarantees on degree and stretch, while at the same time preserving the expansion and spectral properties of the network.", "paper_title": "Xheal: a localized self-healing algorithm using expanders", "paper_id": "WOS:000330991500003"}
