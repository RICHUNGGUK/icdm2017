Utilizing a new capacitive load, the new DCO is capable of producing much higher output frequencies than existing DCOs. All other components are fully digital and modular, allowing portability to any CMOS process and customization for different applications. At the heart of the DCO is a digital ring oscillator (DRO) that utilizes the new shunt-capacitive loads. Unprecedented higher frequencies are obtained through a novel idea of electrically removing the effect of un-enabled loads. Simple design conditions for achieving proper operation of the DRO are provided and verified through simulations with several technologies. Spice simulations verified the correct and superior operation of the DCO even with device mismatch. A custom layout of the DRO was generated using LFoundry's 150 nm technology. The total DRO area was found to be 418 mu m(2). Comparison with other DCOs and VCO shows that the new DCO outperforms conventional DCOs in all aspects; maximum attainable frequency, power efficiency and required number of control bits to achieve a certain resolution.
