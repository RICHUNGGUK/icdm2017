We propose a hybrid quantum problem-solving model. Our approach is motivated by several important theories from the fields of physics, computer science and psychology. We demonstrate our approach through a model for a quantum production system, based on the n-puzzle. The developed model can be extended in order to tackle any N-level depth search required by other problems. No preliminary knowledge concerning quantum computation is required.", "paper_title": "Problem-solving and Quantum Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297726000002"}
