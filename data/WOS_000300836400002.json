We present a novel test for this, which is optimal in the sense that the region on the lens cannot be further reduced. Our test is based on removing half-space regions of the (u, v) -space on the lens, from where the triangle definitely cannot be seen through a tile of pixels. We find the intersection of all such regions exactly, and the resulting region can be used to reduce the number of sample-in-triangle tests that need to be performed. Our main contribution is that the theory we develop provides a limit for how efficient a practical tile versus defocused triangle test ever can become. To verify our work, we also develop a conceptual implementation for DOF rasterization based on our new theory. We show that the number of arithmetic operations involved in the rasterization process can be reduced. More importantly, with a tile test, multi-sampling anti-aliasing can be used which may reduce shader executions and the related memory bandwidth usage substantially. In general, this can be translated to a performance increase and/or power savings.", "paper_title": "Efficient Depth of Field Rasterization Using a Tile Test Based on Half-Space Culling", "paper_id": "WOS:000300836400002"}
