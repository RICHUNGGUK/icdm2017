The paper introduces a novel approach for integrated production planning and control, with the description of the mathematical models and solution algorithms. The deterministic optimization algorithms are complemented by a discrete-event simulation system to assess solution robustness in case of disturbances. The methods are illustrated by describing two prototype systems and by some experimental results obtained in an industry-initiated project.
