However, many applications need to re-project the features to the original space. Unfortunately, most DR algorithms cannot perform reconstruction. Based on the manifold assumption, this paper proposes a General Manifold Reconstruction Framework (GMRF) to perform the reconstruction of the original data from the low dimensional DR results. Comparing with the existing reconstruction algorithms, the framework has two significant advantages. First, the proposed framework is independent of DR algorithm. That is to say, no matter what DR algorithm is used, the framework can recover the structure of the original data from the DR results. Second, the framework is space saving, which means it does not need to store any training sample after training. The storage space GMRF needed for reconstruction is far less than that of the training samples. Experiments on different dataset demonstrate that the framework performs well in the reconstruction.", "paper_title": "A GENERAL FRAMEWORK FOR MANIFOLD RECONSTRUCTION FROM DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000337801600003"}
