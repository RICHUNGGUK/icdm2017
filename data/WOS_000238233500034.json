Moreover, gray scale CCT (correlated color temperature) reproductions in a typical mobile phone LCD depend on the input RGB levels. A simple LUT (Look-up table) method for constant gray scale CCT and gamma characteristic of mobile phone LCD is presented in this paper. We investigate the mobile phone LCD's characteristic of compensation of CCT with using the LUT. LCD's CCT is maintaining about 7500 K, which is the target CCT of mobile phone LCD in this paper. Also LCD's gamma is similar to target gamma.", "paper_title": "Improvement of gray scale CCT for mobile phone LCD", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500034"}
