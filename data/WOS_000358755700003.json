With the growing complexity and dimensions of current distribution networks, there is an increasing need for intelligent and scalable mechanisms to facilitate energy dispatch in these networks. To this end, in this paper, we propose a multi-agent coalition formation-based energy dispatch mechanism. This mechanism is decentralised without requiring a central controller or any global information. As this mechanism does not need a central controller, the single point of failure can be avoided and since this mechanism does not require any global information, good scalability can be expected. In addition, this mechanism enables each node in a distribution network to make decisions autonomously about energy dispatch through a negotiation protocol. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this mechanism in comparison with three recently developed representative mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
