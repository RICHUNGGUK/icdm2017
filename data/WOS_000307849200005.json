Generation of a at distribution in the sampling parameters energy and stiffness allows for efficient investigation of transitions between various conformational phases. Of particular importance is the ability to predict behavior for a given stiffness value, where three classes of minimum energy conformations are expected: Solid-globular, rod-like and toroidal. We present first results highlighting the behavior of a single N = 20 length chain.", "paper_title": "EFFECTS OF STIFFNESS ON SHORT, SEMIFLEXIBLE HOMOPOLYMER CHAINS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307849200005"}
