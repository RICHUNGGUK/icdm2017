The terms of the calculus are constructed by basic constituent elements and operators of sequencing, looping, containment and parallel composition. The looping operator allows tying up the ends of a sequence, thus creating a circular sequence which can represent a membrane. We show that a membrane calculus recently proposed can be encoded into CLS. We use our calculus to model interactions among bacteria and bacteriophage viruses, and to reason on their properties.", "paper_title": "A calculus of looping sequences for modelling microbiological systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240603000003"}
