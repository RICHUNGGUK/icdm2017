We recently proposed an extremely powerful method, the static dependency pair method, which is based on the notion of strong computability, in order to prove termination in STRSs. In this paper, we extend the method to HRSs. Since HRSs include lambda-abstraction but STRSs do not, we restructure the static dependency pair method to allow lambda-abstraction, and show that the static dependency pair method also works well on HRSs without new restrictions.", "paper_title": "Static Dependency Pair Method Based on Strong Computability for Higher-Order Rewrite Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700023"}
