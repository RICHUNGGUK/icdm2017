In 1978, Larman [5] disproved this conjecture, constructing a triangle-free graph for which the minimum length of an edge could not exceed root 8/3. In addition, he conjectured that the right answer would be root 2, which is not better than the class of all graphs. Larman's conjecture was independently proved by Rosenfeld [8] and Rodl [7]. In this last paper it was shown that no bound better than root 2 can be found for graphs with arbitrarily large odd girth. We prove in this paper that this is still true for arbitrarily large girth. We discuss then the case of triangle-free graphs with linear minimum degree.", "paper_title": "Graphs with large girth not embeddable in the sphere", "paper_id": "WOS:000251407800002"}
