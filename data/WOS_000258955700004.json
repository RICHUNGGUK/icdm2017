The protocol minimises the registration time through minimal usage of an efficient certificateless signature scheme between a foreign agent (FA) and a home agent (HA). Protocol parameters can be kept resynchronised by reusing the initial values in the MIP registration in case the synchronisation between a mobile node (MN) and HA is lost. User anonymity is achieved via a temporary identity transmitted by a mobile user, instead of its true identity. Additional replay protection from the FA is included in the registration messages to prevent a possible replay attack. Numerical results and performance analyses demonstrate that the proposed protocol outperforms the existing ones in terms of the registration time, registration signalling traffic and computational load on an MN while providing improved security. For example, the proposed protocol reduces the registration time up to similar to 83% compared with the protocol from Yang.", "paper_title": "Mobile IP registration in certificateless public key infrastructure", "paper_id": "WOS:000258955700004"}
