First, to control the growth in the size of the solution with noise and regularize the solution in iterations, two auxiliary constraints are added into NMF. Then we introduce the logarithmic barrier function to eliminate the nonnegative regularization, and obtain an equivalent quadratic trust region problem by some mathematical calculation. According to the necessary and sufficient conditions of the trust region problem, we obtain a solution of the original problem by solving a parameterized linear system. We apply this method into NMF with different cost functions, including alpha-divergence, beta-divergence, KL-divergence, dual KL(DKL)-divergence, where different cost functions are imposed on different types of data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
