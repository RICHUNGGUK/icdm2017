It is shown that every smooth TVN system can be expressed as a generalized Hamiltonian system if the origin is the equilibrium of the system. If the Jacobian matrix of a TVN system is nonsingular, the system has a generalized Hamiltonian realization whose structural matrix and Hamiltonian function are given explicitly. For the case that the Jacobian matrix is singular; this paper provides a constructive decomposition method, and then proves that a TVN system has a generalized Hamiltonian realization if its Jacobian matrix has a nonsingular main diagonal block. Furthermore, some sufficient (necessary and sufficient) conditions for dissipative Hamiltonian realization of TVN systems are also presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "On Hamiltonian realization of time-varying nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557500002"}
