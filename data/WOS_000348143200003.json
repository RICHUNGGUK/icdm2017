We show two constructions of n-evasive ABM-LTFs. The first one is based on the decisional composite residuosity (DCR) assumption, and the second one is from chameleon hash functions and ABN-LTFs. Both of the constructions are based on reasonable assumptions with tight security reductions. Similar to ABN-LTFs and ABM-LTFs, n-evasive ABM-LTFs can be employed to construct indistinguishability-based selective opening chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption (PKE) schemes and may have other applications in cryptography. The instantiation of n-evasive ABM-LTFs can be based on the well-known assumption, for example, DCR, and the security reduction is much tighter than that of ABM-LTFs. On the other hand, the black-box PKE construction from n-evasive ABM-LTFs is more general than that from ABN-LTFs.
