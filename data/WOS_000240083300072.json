The scheme designs an adaptive RBF model to built process model and uses extended Kalman filter (EKF) technique to online learn the fault dynamics. Then, a model inversion controller is designed to produce the fault tolerant control (FTC) actions. The proposed scheme is applied to a three-tank process to evaluate the performance of the scheme. The simulation results show that component fault can be quickly compensated so that the system performances are recovered well.", "paper_title": "Adaptive neural model based fault tolerant control for multi-variable process", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300072"}
