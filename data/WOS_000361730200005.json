In the considered technique, the background model is built by considering a running Gaussian average over few past frames. The change vector analysis (CVA) scheme is followed on the considered target frame and the constructed reference frame to generate a difference image. The moving objects in target frame are detected by segmenting the difference image into two classes: changed and unchanged, where the changed class represents moving object regions and the unchanged class the background regions. For segmentation, we have modeled the CVA generated difference image with GMRF and the segmentation problem is solved using the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation principle. The MAP estimator is found to be exponential in nature; and thus a modified HTNN is exploited for estimating the MAP. The parameters of the GMRF model are estimated using EM algorithm. Experiments are carried out on three video sequences. Results of the proposed change detection scheme are compared with those of the code book-based background subtraction and GMRF model with graph-cut schemes. It is found that the proposed technique provides better results.", "paper_title": "Application of Gibbs-Markov random field and Hopfield-type neural networks for detecting moving objects from video sequences captured by static camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000361730200005"}
