Given a low-resolution depth image from an active depth sensor and a potentially high-resolution color image from a passive RGB camera, we formulate it as an adaptive cost aggregation problem and solve it using the bilateral filter. The formulation synergistically combines the median and bilateral filters thus it better preserves the depth edges and is more robust to noise. Numerical and visual evaluations on a total of 37 Middlebury data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. A real-time high-resolution depth capturing system is also developed using commercial active depth sensor based on the proposed upsampling method.", "paper_title": "Fusion of Median and Bilateral Filtering for Range Image Upsampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000325223300022"}
