Two important decisions involved in hybrid MTS/MTO context are order partitioning and determining Order Penetration Point (OPP) location. In this paper, a model is developed to first decide on which product is manufactured upon MTS, which one upon MTO and which one upon hybrid strategy. Then, a fuzzy analytic network process (ANP) is utilized to locate the OPP for the products which are decided to be manufactured upon hybrid strategy. Finally, a real industrial case study is reported to show applicability of the proposed model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
