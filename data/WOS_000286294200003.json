The proposed algorithm is established on the basis of a mixed model which combines the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi (ROF) model with the Lysaker-Lundevold-Tai (LLT) model to reduce the staircase effect and blur phenomenons. The proof of the convergence of the proposed algorithm is provided. Moreover, we show that the dual methods based on convex analysis which have been proposed in some papers can be actually deduced from the augmented Lagrangian strategy. Some numerical examples are supplied to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
