An evaluative method based on a specific algorithm has been implemented to simulate the system behavior. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PTS a mixed integer linear programming-based simulation/optimization approach and several metaheuristics from the relevant literature have been implemented. Since most metaheuristics are sensitive to the parameter setting, a proper calibration analysis based on a non-parametric test has been performed. Then, a comprehensive comparison analysis, concerning with both quality of solutions and computational efficiency, has been carried out. Finally, through the numerical results obtained from PTS, a multi-factorial experimental analysis has been developed to analyze the influencing factors of the problem under investigation.
