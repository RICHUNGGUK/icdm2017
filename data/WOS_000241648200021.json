However, due to the existence of ineliminable timing differences between the model and its realization, real-time properties verified in the model often cannot be preserved in its realization. In this paper, we propose a branching representation (timed state tree) to specify the timing behavior of a system, based on which we prove that real-time properties represented by Timed CTL* (TCTL* in short) formulas can be preserved between two neighboring real-time systems. This paper extends the results in [1](2], such that a larger scope of real-time properties can be preserved between real-time systems.", "paper_title": "Branching-time property preservation between real-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241648200021"}
