In particular, it is proven that in any parallel concatenation scheme with k branches where all k encoders are recursive and the Bhattacharyya parameter of the channel is sufficiently small, the bit-error rate (BER) and the word-error rate go to 0 exactly like N(1-k) and N(2-k), respectively. Different types of ensembles by changing the subgroup of permutations used to interconnect the various encoders, are considered.", "paper_title": "Performance of parallel concatenated coding schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000254475300010"}
