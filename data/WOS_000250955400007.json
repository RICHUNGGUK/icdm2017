Yet, privacy requirements and mechanisms are usually retro-fitted into a pre-existing design which may not be able to accommodate them due to potential conflicts with functional requirements. We propose a procedure for automatically extracting privacy requirements from data bases supporting access control mechanisms for personal data (hereafter Hippoc ratic databases) and representing them in the Secure Tropos framework where tools are available for checking the correctness and consistency of privacy requirements. The procedure is illustrated with a case study.", "paper_title": "From Hippocratic databases to secure tropos: A computer-aided re-engineering approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955400007"}
