A synchronous e-training platform has been designed and implemented to explore the possibilities of synchronous e-training in a large corporation. The client tool is used by learners and instructors to collaborate in real-time during e-training activities. It is based on standard protocols also used in voice over IP, which makes it inter-operable with other software and hardware devices. The functionalities offered by the client tool have been chosen based on those provided by commercial tools, but focusing on the specific characteristics of users and network conditions of corporate environments. This facilitates highly interactive synchronous e-training activities. Multimedia configuration of activities is flexible, so participants with different network link capabilities can join activities. The e-training platform has been tested in real e-training activities in ArcelorMittal Spain. The opinions of the users reflect an enhanced learning experience when using the client tool.", "paper_title": "E-pSyLon: a synchronous e-learning platform for staff training in large corporations", "paper_id": "WOS:000321545300005"}
