The method uses first-order logic for model representation. This enables flexible sharing of learned knowledge at different levels of abstraction as well as seamless integration of models created by other agents. A market-inspired mechanism involving knowledge trading is used for inter-agent coordination. This allows for decentralized coordination of learning activity without the need for a central control element. In addition, agents can participate in collaborative learning while pursuing their individual goals and maintaining full control over the disclosure of their private information. Several different types of agents differing in the level and form of knowledge exchange are considered. The mechanism is evaluated using a set of performance criteria on several scenarios in a realistic logistic domain extended with adversary behavior. The results show that using the proposed method agents can collaboratively learn properties of their environment, and consequently significantly improve their operation.", "paper_title": "Market-inspired approach to collaborative learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240907300016"}
