At first, a decoded signal spectral resolution is enhanced by time domain linear predictive extrapolation and then the cut off frequency of each frame is estimated to avoid the spectrum gap between the end of original low frequency spectrum and the beginning of reconstructed high frequency spectrum. By utilizing a correlation between the high frequency spectrum and low frequency spectrum, the low frequency spectrum component is employed to reconstruct the high frequency spectrum component by frequency domain linear predictive extrapolation. Experimental results show an effective improvement of the proposed method in terms of SNR and human listening test results. The proposed method can be used to reconstruct the lost high frequency component to improve the perceptual quality of audio independent of the compression method.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth extension with hybrid signal extrapolation for audio coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934200010"}
