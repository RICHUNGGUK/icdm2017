Most ergonomically designed products depend on stable and accurate human body measurement data. Our research automatically identifies human facial features based on three-dimensional geometric relationships, revealing a total of 67 feature points and 24 feature lines - more than the definitions associated with MPEG-4. In this study, we also verify the replicability, robustness, and accuracy of this feature set. Even with a lower-density point cloud from a non-dedicated head scanner, this method can provide robust results, with 86.6% validity in the 5 mm range. We also analyze the main 31 feature points on the human face, with 96.7% validity of less than 5 mm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
