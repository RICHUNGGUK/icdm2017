However, the existing moment-based methods all resort to non-orthogonal moments invariants which have problem of information redundancy and are sensitive to noise. In this paper, we construct a new set of combined invariants of orthogonal Legendre moments which hold for blur and affine transformation together. The experimental results show that the proposed invariants have better discriminative power and robustness to noise with the comparison to other invariants.", "paper_title": "Legendre moment invariants to blur and affine transformation and their use in image recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000334523200006"}
