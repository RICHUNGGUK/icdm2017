Using these models as a platform for the analysis of high throughput transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data can provide valuable insight into conditional changes in the metabolic activity of an organism. While transcriptomics and proteomics provide important insights into the hierarchical regulation of metabolic flux, metabolomics shed light on the actual enzyme activity through metabolic regulation and mass action effects. Here we introduce a new method, termed integrative omics-metabolic analysis (IOMA) that quantitatively integrates proteomic and metabolomic data with genome-scale metabolic models, to more accurately predict metabolic flux distributions. The method is formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem that seeks a steady-state flux distribution in which flux through reactions with measured proteomic and metabolomic data, is as consistent as possible with kinetically derived flux estimations. Results: IOMA is shown to successfully predict the metabolic state of human erythrocytes (compared to kinetic model simulations), showing a significant advantage over the commonly used methods flux balance analysis and minimization of metabolic adjustment. Thereafter, IOMA is shown to correctly predict metabolic fluxes in Escherichia coli under different gene knockouts for which both metabolomic and proteomic data is available, achieving higher prediction accuracy over the extant methods. Considering the lack of high-throughput flux measurements, while high-throughput metabolomic and proteomic data are becoming readily available, we expect IOMA to significantly contribute to future research of cellular metabolism.
