In this paper, we study the codes constructed from self-orthogonal 5-designs with the same parameters as the above 5-designs. We give some parameters of a self-orthogonal 5-design whose existence is equivalent to that of an extremal doubly even self-dual code of length 24m for . If , and , then it is shown that an extremal doubly even self-dual code of length 24m is generated by codewords of weight .", "paper_title": "On a 5-design related to a putative extremal doubly even self-dual code of length a multiple of 24", "paper_id": "WOS:000358798400001"}
