DETPS uses a network membrane structure, evolution and communication rules like in a tissue P system to specify five widely used DE variants respectively put inside five cells of the tissue membrane system. Each DE variant independently evolves in a cell according to its own evolutionary mechanism and its parameters are dynamically adjusted in the process of evolution. DETPS applies the channels connecting the five cells of the tissue membrane system to implement communication in the process of evolution. Twenty-one benchmark problems taken from the specialized literature related to constrained manufacturing parameter optimization are used to test the DETPS performance. Experimental results show that DETPS is superior or competitive to twenty-two optimization algorithms recently reported in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
