Sufficient conditions for the local and global asymptotic stability of the network are proposed. Moreover, an efficient systematic procedure for designing asymmetric networks is proposed, and a given set of states can be assigned as locally asymptotically stable equilibrium points. Simulation examples show that the asymmetric network can act as an efficient associative memory, and it is almost free from spurious memory problem.", "paper_title": "Efficient Continuous-Time Asymmetric Hopfield Networks for Memory Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000277594200009"}
