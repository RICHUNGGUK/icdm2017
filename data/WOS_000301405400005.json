The aim of this tool is to serve as a gateway for independent, heterogeneous Learning Management Systems, thus achieving interoperability. The tool is designed to support all existing content packaging specifications, but in this paper we focus on two of the most important: IMS and SCORM. The paper also describes in detail the conversion process for these two specifications, by depicting all the aspects of the tool.", "paper_title": "E-LEARNING CONTENTS AUTOMATIC CONVERSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405400005"}
