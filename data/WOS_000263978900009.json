We formulate this cross-layer optimization problem as a non-cooperative game G (JRPA) in which each user has a coupled two-tuple strategy, i.e., simultaneous rate and multi-channel power allocations. A multi-objective cost function is proposed to represent user's awareness of both QoS provisioning and power saving. We analyze the properties of Nash equilibrium (N.E.) for our G (JRPA) , including its existence, and properties of QoS provisioning and power saving. Furthermore, we derive a layered structure by applying the Lagrangian dual decomposition to G (JRPA) and design a distributed algorithm to find the N.E.. Simulation results are presented to show the validity of our game theoretic formulation and the performance of our proposed algorithm. Detailed studies on the performance tradeoff between QoS provisioning and power saving are also carried out.", "paper_title": "Joint Rate-and-Power Allocation for Multi-channel Spectrum Sharing Networks with Balanced QoS Provisioning and Power Saving", "paper_id": "WOS:000263978900009"}
