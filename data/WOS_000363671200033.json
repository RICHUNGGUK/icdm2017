We describe a more general approach to temporal consistency. We propose a gradient-domain technique that is blind to the particular image processing algorithm. Our technique takes a series of processed frames that suffers from flickering and generates a temporally-consistent video sequence. The core of our solution is to infer the temporal regularity from the original unprocessed video, and use it as a temporal consistency guide to stabilize the processed sequence. We formally characterize the frequency properties of our technique, and demonstrate, in practice, its ability to stabilize a wide range of popular image processing techniques including enhancement and stylization of color and tone, intrinsic images, and depth estimation.", "paper_title": "Blind Video Temporal Consistency", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200033"}
