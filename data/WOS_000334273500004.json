In many of these applications, visualization and interaction is generally performed on cross-sectional two-dimensional (2D) views of three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities. Displaying 3D volumetric medical datasets on traditional 2D screens can present problems such as occlusion and information overload, especially when multiple data sources are present. Displaying desired information while showing the relationship to the rest of the dataset(s) can be challenging. In this paper, we present an interactive focus+context visualization approach that uses the volumetric Magic Lens interaction paradigm. We propose to use the Magic Lens as a volumetric brush to perform volume editing tasks, therefore combining data exploration with volumetric editing. Polygon-assisted ray casting methods are used for real-time rendering and editing frame rates, while providing compact storage of editing states for undo/redo operations. We discuss the application of our methods to radiation therapy, which is an important cancer treatment modality. We envision that this approach will improve the treatment planning process by improving the therapists' understanding of information from various sources and will help identify if the alignment of the patient in the treatment room coincides with the prepared treatment plan.
