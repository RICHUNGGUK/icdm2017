In this paper, we propose the elastic preserving projections (EPPs) which by incorporating the merits of the local geometry and the global information of the training set. EPP outputs a sample subspace which simultaneously preserves the local geometrical structure and exploits the global information of the training set. Different from some other linear dimensionality reduction methods, EPP can be deemed as learning both the coordinates and the affinities between sample points. Furthermore, the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is analyzed theoretically and confirmed by some experiments on several well-known face databases. The obtained results indicate that EPP significantly outperforms its other rival algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
