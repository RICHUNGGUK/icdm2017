The optimization based approach - denoted constructive nonlinear dynamics (CNLD) - is based on constraints that enforce a minimal distance in the space of the uncertain parameters between a stability boundary and the optimal solution. The results obtained with CNLD are compared to results recently presented by Chang and Sahinidis [Chang, Y. J., & Sahinidis, N. V. (2005). Optimization of metabolic pathways under stability considerations. Computers and Chemical Engineering, 29 (3), 467-479], where the optimization of the tryptophan biosynthesis model was addressed by a global optimization algorithm. CNLD takes the nonlinearities of the process exactly into account and satisfies the specified robustness criteria without being overly conservative. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
