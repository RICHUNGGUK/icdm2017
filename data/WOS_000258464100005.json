We propose an accurate and scalable Internet subspace geometry to embed the nodes onto a geometric plane by measuring delay latencies between some nodes and assign geometric coordinates to all nodes in such a way that the geometric distances between node coordinates closely approximate their delay latencies. We exploit this Internet subspace geometry to design a network-aware SuperPeers-Peers geometric overlay hierarchy. This is maintained locally in a distributed manner allowing lightweight self-organization. We then create shortest-path overlay multicast tree based on shortest geometric distances between SuperPeers at the SuperPeers layer for overlay multicasting. This low-latency and high-bandwidth multicast backbone infrastructure will serve the Peers in the lower layer. We evaluate our proposals on the 10 massive scale networks each consisting of 100,000 nodes and in the PlanetLab. Our performance evaluation results show high efficiency and good scalability.
