Then, the mathematical models of mature MoA (monitoring agent) and dynamic memory MoA survival are improved. Besides, effects of the important parameter P in the models of dynamic memory MoA survival on system performance are showed. Our theoretical analyses and the experiment results show the model that enhances detection efficiency and assures steady performance is a good solution to grid intrusion detection.", "paper_title": "An immune mobile agent based grid intrusion detection model", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300015"}
