Results: To improve the power of test statistics, a general statistical framework for construction of non-linear tests is presented, and two specific non-linear test statistics that use non-linear transformations of means are developed. Asymptotical distributions of the non-linear test statistics under the null and alternative hypothesis are derived. It has been proved that under some conditions the power of the non-linear test statistics is higher than that of the T-2 statistic. Besides theory, to evaluate in practice the performance of the non-linear test statistics, they are applied to two real datasets. The preliminary results demonstrate that the P-values of the non-linear statistics for testing differential expressions of the genetic networks are much smaller than those of the T-2 statistic. And furthermore simulations show the Type I errors of the non-linear statistics agree with the threshold used and the statistics fit the chi(2) distribution.", "paper_title": "Non-linear tests for identifying differentially expressed genes or genetic networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612900003"}
