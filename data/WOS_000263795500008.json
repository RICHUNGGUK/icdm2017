In the controller design, the robust control terms are used to compensate the approximation errors, which can improve robustness of the systems. The developed control algorithm overcomes the singularity problem of nonlinear MIMO systems. Using Lyapunov method, it is shown that the proposed algorithm ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are bounded. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "ROBUST ADAPTIVE FUZZY CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF NONLINEAR INTERCONNECTED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263795500008"}
