Suppose we are given a stream of 0's and 1's. We propose a differentially private continual counter that outputs at every time step the approximate number of 1's seen thus far. Our counter construction has error that is only poly-log in the number of time steps. We can extend the basic counter construction to allow Web sites to continually give top-k and hot items suggestions while preserving users' privacy.", "paper_title": "Private and Continual Release of Statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000297682600005"}
