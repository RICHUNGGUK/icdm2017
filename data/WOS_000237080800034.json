An ontology-based functional modeling framework is proposed as a prelude to a meaningful agent communication for collaborative functional modeling. Formal knowledge representation in OWL format extends traditional functional modeling with capabilities of knowledge sharing and distributed problem solving, and is used as a content language within the FIPA ACL (Agent Communication Language) messages in a proposed multi-agent architecture. The ontological enhancement to functional modeling facilitates the implementation of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) in functional design for Semantic Web applications.", "paper_title": "An ontology-based functional modeling approach for multi-agent distributed design on the semantic web", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800034"}
