Connected operators enable to filter and/or segment an image by preserving its contours. The proposed binarization method enables to extract relevant document objects by means of the component-tree structure. This strategy was compared to other binarization methods and showed good behavior in various contexts. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
