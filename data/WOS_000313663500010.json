We discuss how concurrency in hardware description languages (HDLs) presents opportunities for expression reuse across different threads. While accounting for discrete event simulation semantics, we extend the data flow analysis framework to concurrent threads. In this process, we introduce a rewriting scheme named partial derivative VF and a graph representation to model sensitivity relationships among threads. An algorithm for identifying common subexpressions as applied to HDLs is presented. Related issues, such as scheduling correctness, are also considered.", "paper_title": "Concurrency-Aware Compiler Optimizations for Hardware Description Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000313663500010"}
