This cdf is then utilized to obtain the outage probability at a specific threshold. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations verify that the proposed approach is an accurate and efficient method to evaluate the desired outage probability, which would greatly facilitate the design and analysis of such systems.", "paper_title": "Outage Probability of MRC Diversity over Correlated Shadowed Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300028"}
