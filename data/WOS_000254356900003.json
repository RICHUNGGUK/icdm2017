Special emphasis is put on discussing neural networks and genetic algorithms for such models described in the second Chapter. In the third Chapter, significant applications of neural networks and genetic algorithms in area of power consumption and train diagram are stated. A methodology of model development and assessment is presented in Chapter 4. In Chapter 5 there are up to now results of the author's traction power consumption prediction coming out from artificial neural network predictive models developed in Mathematical D SW environment. Finally, summary and further work are stated in the last Chapter.", "paper_title": "Artificial intelligence methods used for predicting traction power consumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000254356900003"}
