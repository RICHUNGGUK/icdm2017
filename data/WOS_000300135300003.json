This analysis reveals that, beyond some preconceptions, Ada Boost can be directly used as an asymmetric learning algorithm, preserving all its theoretical properties. A novel class-conditional description of AdaBoost, which models the actual asymmetric behavior of the algorithm, is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
