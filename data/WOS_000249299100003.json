In this paper, we mainly focus on large sets of v - 1{0, 1}-intersecting STS(v) and large sets of upsilon + 1{1}-intersecting STS(v). For this purpose, we introduce a concept of L-intersecting partitionable candelabra system (L-PCS) of order v with q(upsilon) subsystems and establish a relationship between L-PCS and large set of q(upsilon)L-intersecting STS(upsilon). Some constructions for L-PCSs are also presented by 3-wise balanced designs. These facilitate the production of some new infinite classes of these large sets.", "paper_title": "Constructions for large sets of L-intersecting Steiner triple systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249299100003"}
