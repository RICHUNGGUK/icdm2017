This is done by benchmarking their results with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a genetic programming algorithm (GP), an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) plus a naive strategy. We also examine if the introduction of a time-varying leverage strategy can improve the trading performance of our models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
