Based on the two-step MMSE optimization algorithm for relay precoding and receiver equalizing with full feedback under QoS requirements, we first propose a limited feedback two-step MMSE optimization scheme for relay precoding and receiver equalizing with quantization error compensation, and then we propose a limited feedback joint MMSE optimization scheme for relay precoding and receiver equalizing with quantization error compensation subject to a global power constraint at the output of relays. Simulation results show that the proposed joint MMSE optimization scheme with quantization error compensation has a much lower bit-error rate than the two-step MMSE optimization scheme with quantization error compensation and the joint MMSE optimization scheme without quantization error compensation.", "paper_title": "MMSE relay precoding schemes based on quantization error compensation for multi-relay system", "paper_id": "WOS:000284647500015"}
