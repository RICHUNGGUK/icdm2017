Furthermore, an adaptive amplitude RTRL algorithm is adopted to overcome the deteriorating effect introduced by the nesting process. Computer simulations illustrate that the proposed equalizer outperforms the pipelined recurrent neural network (PRNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) equalizers. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
