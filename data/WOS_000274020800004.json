More specifically, in addition to providing a classification framework for business rules and investigating the existing standards and languages for the formal specification of business rules, we propose a model-driven framework for the rule-based design of services. We provide an example to illustrate this framework and to demonstrate the role business rules can play in the context of model driven development (MDD) of service-oriented architectures (SOAs). Furthermore, we also explore, in terms of existing tool support, the extent to which the model-driven design process can be complemented and combined with business rules written in nearly natural language, which can become, at the platform-specific level, an executable way to specify business knowledge and decisions.", "paper_title": "A model-driven perspective on the rule-based specification and analysis of service-based applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000274020800004"}
