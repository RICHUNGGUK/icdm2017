The more services are available, the more difficult it becomes to find the most appropriate service for a specific application. As a nonfunctional requirement, quality of service (QoS) plays an important role in the selection of web services. However, the complex network environment and illegal operations generally influence the trustworthiness of web services QoS. This paper presents a novel prediction approach for trustworthy QoS of web services. Results of experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed prediction approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
