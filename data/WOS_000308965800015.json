Using a multilayer feedforward network of coupled double-well oscillators as well as Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillators, we here investigate the conditions under which a weak signal received by the first layer can be transmitted through the network with or without amplitude attenuation. We find that the coupling strength and the nodes' states of the first layer act as two-state switches, which determine whether the transmission is significantly enhanced or exponentially decreased. We hope this finding is useful for designing artificial signal amplifiers.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Weak Signal Transmission Through a Feedforward Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965800015"}
