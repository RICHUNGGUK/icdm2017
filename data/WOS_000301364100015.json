Based on the empirical results in Lariviere and Gingras (2011) we prove, under reasonable conditions, the following relations between AoR and RoA for a set of points: (i) The regression line of RoA in function of AoR is the first bisectrix. (ii) (AoR - RoA)/AoR in function of the number N of papers is a cloud of points comprised between a multiple of 1 root N and - 1 root N. (iii) (AoR - RoA)/AoR versus RoA has a decreasing regression line. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
