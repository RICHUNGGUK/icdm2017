Therefore we propose web service composition model at the business logic process level. Business logic process is a unit of web service. When the web service consumer requests to service to web service on the internet, business logic process in the service performs practically. To consider their interface for business logic process, the business logic process buffer was used. To get information of web service composition, transaction service in our model manages them to composition database. And we design this model specification by formal method, CSP, for practically and accurately interface behavior.", "paper_title": "CSP Based Web Service Composition Model with Buffer at the Business Logic Process Level", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900013"}
