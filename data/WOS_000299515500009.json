To this end, we adopt the model of graphical linear congestion games with weighted players, where the individual cost and the strategy selection of each player only depends on his neighboring players in the social graph. We show that such games admit a potential function, and thus a PNE. Next, we investigate the Price of Anarchy (PoA) and the Price of Stability (PoS) of graphical linear congestion games with respect to the players' total actual cost. Our main result is that the impact of social ignorance on the PoA and on the PoS is naturally quantified by the independence number alpha(G) of the social graph G. In particular, we show that the PoA grows roughly as alpha(G)(alpha(G)+2), which is essentially tight as long as alpha(G) does not exceed half the number of players, and that the PoS lies between alpha(G) and 2 alpha(G). Moreover, we show that the epsilon-Nash dynamics reaches an alpha(G)(alpha(G)+2)-approximate configuration in polynomial time that does not directly depend on the social graph. For unweighted graphical linear games with symmetric strategies, we show that the epsilon-Nash dynamics reaches an epsilon-approximate PNE in polynomial time that exceeds the corresponding time for symmetric linear games by a factor at most as large as the number of players.", "paper_title": "The Impact of Social Ignorance on Weighted Congestion Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000299515500009"}
