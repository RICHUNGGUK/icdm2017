Then we deduce some consequences: we show some relationships between the image of two fuzzy numbers and the images of their usual operations and it is proved that the continuity of some fuzzy numbers is preserved under the usual operations. As applications, we introduce a fuzzy regression model involving a parametric family of fuzzy semidistances between fuzzy numbers with finite image and an ordering process of fuzzy numbers with compact support that satisfies specificity-type properties.
