We propose to implement supervisory control by extending the plant's finite state machine with Boolean variables, guard formulas and updating functions. Boolean variables are used to encode the supervisor's states, event observation is captured by a set of Boolean functions that update the value of variables, and control is introduced by guarding events with Boolean formulas. The framework developed in this work is fundamental in our ongoing research on communication between supervisors in a distributed discrete-event system.", "paper_title": "Implementation of supervisory control using extended finite-state machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000262632000002"}
