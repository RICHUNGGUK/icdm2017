This paper presents four software components - InoculumPressure, DiseaseProgress, ImpactsOnPlants, AgromanagementDisease - which implement models to simulate the dynamics of generic polycyclic fungal epidemics and interactions with crop physiological processes. The software architecture adopted allows extending the components with alternate approaches to reproduce specific pathosystems or compare predictive capabilities. As proofs of concept, (i) the components are coupled with two crop simulators to reproduce wheat brown rust and rice blast epidemics and their impacts on leaf area and yield formation; (ii) spatially distributed sensitivity analyses are performed for rice in China and wheat in Europe to investigate model behaviour; (iii) a preliminary evaluation against observations of rice blast severity is performed in Northern Italy. The components are explicitly targeted to the modelling of cropepathogen interactions to perform scenario analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
