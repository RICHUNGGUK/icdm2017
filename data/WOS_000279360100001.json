Our techniques achieve compression ratios around 32% and require very little effort from the receiver. Furthermore, the receiver is not only lighter, but it can also search the compressed text with less work than that necessary to decompress it. This is a novelty in two senses: it breaks the usual compressor/decompressor symmetry typical of adaptive schemes, and it contradicts the long-standing assumption that only semistatic codes could be searched more efficiently than the uncompressed text. Our novel compression methods are preferable in several aspects over the existing adaptive and semistatic compressors for natural language texts.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Lightweight Text Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000279360100001"}
