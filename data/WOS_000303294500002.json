The major problem in such applications is to deal efficiently with the growing number of samples as well as local appearance variations caused by diverse environments for the millions of users over time. In this paper, we focus on developing an incremental face recognition method for Twitter application. Particularly, a data-independent feature extraction method is proposed via binarization of a Gabor filter. Subsequently, the dimension of our Gabor representation is reduced considering various orientations at different grid positions. Finally, an incremental neural network is applied to learn the reduced Gabor features. We apply our method to a novel application which notifies new photograph uploading to related users without having their ID being identified. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several incremental face recognition methods with a dramatic reduction in computational speed. This shows the suitability of the proposed method for a large-scale web service with millions of users. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
