Particularly, body area networks, as a typical computing environment application in healthcare, allow ubiquitous monitoring of patients, and more thorough patient diagnoses can be done with the help of multimedia service. In this work, we propose a novel media-aware flow scheduling architecture with the aims of improving the multimedia quality and increasing the network's lifetime. In order to avoid interfering with the multimedia applications' delay requirements, this work also proposes to analyze frames delay and jitter. The proposal has proven to improve the multimedia quality and decrease the transmission delay in a controllable manner, and thus the tradeoffs between QoS, lifetime, and delay requirements can be achieved according to the considered scenario. In addition, extensive simulation results validates the efficiency of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
