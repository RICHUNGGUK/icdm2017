According to the proposed approach, a method is first developed based on the defined fuzzy point estimation, which are then used to make a procedure for testing fuzzy hypotheses. This approach has been used to test simple, one-sided and two-sided fuzzy hypotheses. Two new criteria, called degree of acceptance (DA) and degree of rejection (DR), have been proposed to evaluate the test result. The application of the proposed method to lifetime testing is studied.", "paper_title": "A new approach for testing fuzzy hypotheses based on fuzzy data", "paper_id": "WOS:000315375000010"}
