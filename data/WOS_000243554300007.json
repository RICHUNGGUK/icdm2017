Circuit simulations using a sub-90-nm technology show that the presented designs achieve more than a 20-fold reduction in cell-level soft error rate (SER). Fault injection experiments conducted on a microprocessor model further demonstrate that chip-level SER improvement is tunable by selective placement of the presented error-correcting designs. When coupled with error correction code to protect in-pipeline memories, the BISER flip-flop design improves chip-level SER by 10 times over an unprotected pipeline with the flip-flops contributing an extra 7-10.5% in power. When only soft errors in flips-flops are considered, the BISER technique improves chip-level SER by 10 times with an increased power of 10.3%. The error correction mechanism is configurable (i.e., can be turned on or off) which enables the use of the presented techniques for designs that can target multiple applications with a wide range of reliability requirements.", "paper_title": "Sequential element design with built-in soft error resilience", "paper_id": "WOS:000243554300007"}
