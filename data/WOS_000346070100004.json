For the first time, the gas-solid flow field, the morphological and molecular properties of particles, as well as their dynamics can be simultaneously obtained by solving the unique model that couples a CFD model, a population balance model (PBM) and moment equations. The quantitative relationships between the operating conditions and the multi-scale particle properties have been further established. The results demonstrate that the product model can be used to guide a multi-scale generalization of the polymer product from chemical process to product engineering. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
