We demonstrate that careful logic optimization of the existing arithmetic units (to create hybrid units) indeed make them further amenable to supply voltage scaling. Such hybrid units result from mixing right amount of fast arithmetic into the slower ones. Simulations on different hybrid adder and multipliers in BPTM 70 nm technology show 18%-50% improvements in power compared to standard adders with only 2%-8% increase in die-area at iso-yield. These optimized datapath units can be used to construct voltage scalable robust ALUs that can operate at high clock frequency with minimal performance degradation due to occasional clock stretching.", "paper_title": "Voltage Scalable High-Speed Robust Hybrid Arithmetic Units Using Adaptive Clocking", "paper_id": "WOS:000281735900004"}
