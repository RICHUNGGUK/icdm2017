A combination model that merges support vector regression (SVR), radial basis function networks (RBFNs) and simplified fuzzy inference system is used. The SVR has the good performances to determine the number of rules in the simplified fuzzy inference system and initial weights for the fuzzy neural networks (FNNs). Based on these initial structures, and then annealing robust learning algorithm (ARLA) can be used effectively to overcome outliers and adjust the parameters of structures. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed method with different SVR for training and prediction of chaotic time series with outliers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
