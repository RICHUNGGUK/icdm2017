In particular, consecutive handover events are being used to estimate the traffic speed. During traffic congestion, consecutive handover events may be rare because vehicles move slowly, and thus very few or no speed reports would be generated from the congested area.However, the traffic speed report rate during traffic congestion has not been investigated in the literature. In this paper, we present an analytic model to estimate the speed report rate from cellular network signaling in steady traffic conditions, that is, the traffic speed and flow are assumed constant. Real field trial data were used to validate our analytic model. In addition, computer simulations were conducted to study how speed reports are generated in dynamic traffic conditions when traffic speed and flow change rapidly. Our study indicates that in a typical cell of length 1.5km with a typical expected call holding time of 1min, no speed report was generated from a congested three-lane highway. Our study demonstrates that the lack of speed reports from consecutive handover events during rush hours indicates severe traffic congestion, and new methods that can estimate traffic speed from cellular network data during severe traffic congestion need to be developed.
