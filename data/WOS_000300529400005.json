The problem is solved using the method of fundamental solution (MFS) in conjunction with the Tikhonov regularization method, whose side constraint is a Sobolev norm. A suitable regularization parameter is determined by the L-curve method. Numerical results are presented for problems with given noisy Cauchy data. Two error criteria are employed and we compare the numerical results with those from other methods for these problems.", "paper_title": "Method of Fundamental Solutions With an Optimal Regularization Technique for the Cauchy Problem of the Modified Helmholtz Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529400005"}
