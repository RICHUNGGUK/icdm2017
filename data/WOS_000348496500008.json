This paper describes a graph spectral approach to calculate the resilience of complex engineered systems. The resilience of the design architecture of complex engineered systems is deduced from graph spectra. This is calculated from adjacency matrix representations of the physical connections between components in complex engineered systems. Furthermore, we propose a new method to identify the most vulnerable components in the design and design architectures that are robust to transmission of failures. Nonlinear dynamical system and epidemic spreading models are used to compare the failure propagation mean time transformation. Using these metrics, we present a case study based on the Advanced Diagnostics and Prognostics Testbed, which is an electrical power system developed at NASA Ames as a subsystem for the ramp system of an infantry fighting vehicle.", "paper_title": "Resiliency analysis for complex engineered system design", "paper_id": "WOS:000348496500008"}
