In addition, when taking into account the effect of the quantisation, the designed filter not only guarantee admissibility but also satisfy a prescribed H-infinity filtering performance for the filter error system. By using Lyapunov method, a new bounded real lemma is proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) to ensure that the filtering error system has the mentioned properties. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for the existence of filter is obtained in terms of LMIs. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Mode-dependent quantised H-infinity filtering for Markovian jump singular system", "paper_id": "WOS:000353496700010"}
