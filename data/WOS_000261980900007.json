The radius of the elimination circle becomes smaller and smaller during the subdivision process. A simple condition for terminating the subdivision process is provided, which leads to very few subdivision steps in the new method. Examples are shown to illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the new method. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
