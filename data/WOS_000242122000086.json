In this paper, we propose two algorithms for finding these four kinds of mistaken data. SARS and coronary heart disease data sets experimental results show that the two algorithms are available, that is, using the two algorithms we find some mistakes in the SARS and coronary heart disease data sets, and the results correspond to that found manually by medical experts.", "paper_title": "Algorithms for finding and correcting four kinds of data mistakes in information table", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000086"}
