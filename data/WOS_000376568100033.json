The two-tier role architecture which is setted in the area of arrangement can better meet the practical needs of role establishment and management. Based on that, the proposed unidirectional role mapping for cross-domain authorization can avoid the role mapping rings. Besides, by introducing attribute and condition, dynamic adjustment of privileges is realized. The model is described formally in dynamic description logic, including concepts, relations and management operations. Finally, the security of the model is analyzed and an example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness and practicality.", "paper_title": "Cross-Domain Authorization Management Model for Multi-Levels Hybrid Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000376568100033"}
