It was found that such models tended to evolve toward socially optimal behavior. Here we apply a similar technique to a more tricky co-ordination game (the weakest link game) requiring interactions from several players (nodes) that may play several strategies. We define a variant of the game with several equilibria-each offering increasing social benefit. We found that the evolving network functions to select and spread more optimal equilibria while resisting invasion by lower ones. Hence the network acts as a kind of \"social ratchet\" selecting for increasing social benefit. Such networks have applications in peer-to-peer computing and may have implications for understanding social systems.", "paper_title": "Evolving networks for social optima in the \"weakest link game\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000264477400004"}
