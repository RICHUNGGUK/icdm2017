It introduces two combination rules for the situation in which no assumption is made about the dependence of the information sources. These two rules are based on cautious combinations of plausibility and commonality functions, respectively. The paper studies the properties of these rules and their connection with Dempster's rules of conditioning and combination and the minimum rule of possibility theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
