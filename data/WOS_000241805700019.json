However, receiver and transmitter channel state information is generally required. In this correspondence, a system where each receiver has perfect channel knowledge, but the transmitter only receive-s quantized information regarding the channel instantiation is analyzed. The well-known zero-forcing transmission technique is considered, and simple expressions for the throughput degradation due to finite-rate feedback are derived. A key finding is that the feedback rate per mobile must be increased linearly with the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (in decibels) in order to achieve the full multiplexing gain. This is in sharp contrast to point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which it is not necessary to increase the feedback rate as a function of the SNR.", "paper_title": "MIMO broadcast channels with finite-rate feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700019"}
