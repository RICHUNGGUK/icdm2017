It is assumed that damping matrix does not only depends on the frequency but also on a set of parameters that control the dissipative mechanisms. Eigenvalues are then functions of a multi-variable array formed by damping parameters. The key idea is to approximate the eigenvalues as solutions of a specially developed differential equation. Proportional and non-proportional damping are studied separately. In addition, the error order and the computational complexity are rigorously analyzed. Numerical examples show very good agreement between proposed and exact solutions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
