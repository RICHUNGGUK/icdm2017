One common assumption for most of these cell formation algorithms is that the product mix remains stable over a period of time. In today's world, the market demand is being shaped by consumers resulting in a highly volatile market. This has given rise to a new class of products characterized by low volume and high variety. To incorporate product mix changes into an existing cellular manufacturing system many important issues have to be tackled. In this paper, a methodology to incorporate new parts and machines into an existing cellular manufacturing system has been presented. The objective is to fit the new parts and machines into an existing cellular manufacturing system thereby increasing machine utilization and reducing investment in new equipment.", "paper_title": "A methodology to incorporate product mix variations in cellular manufacturing", "paper_id": "WOS:000253214400006"}
