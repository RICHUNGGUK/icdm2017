Pristine and the C-doped structures of two representative (6,0) zigzag and (4,4) armchair BPNTs have been investigated. At first, the geometries of the structures have been allowed to relax by optimization. Subsequently, NMR parameters have been calculated in the optimized structures. The results indicated that the influence of C-doping was more significant on the geometries of the zigzag model than the armchair one. The difference of band gap energies between the pristine and C-doped armchair BPNT was larger than the zigzag model. Significant differences of NMR parameters of those nuclei directly contributed to the C-doping atoms have been observed.", "paper_title": "Carbon doped boron phosphide nanotubes: A computational study", "paper_id": "WOS:000286482700010"}
