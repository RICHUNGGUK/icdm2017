The customers may not be aware of the underlying data and its structure, and might have never learned a query language that enables them to issue structured queries. Some of the business' employees who query the databases may also not be aware of the structure of the data, but they are likely to be aware of some labels of elements containing data. We propose in this article: (1) an XML Keyword-Based search engine for answering business' customers called BusSEngine-K, and (2) an XML loosely Structured-Based search engine for answering business' employees called BusSEngine-L. The two engines employ novel context-driven search techniques and are built on top of XQuery search engine. The two engines were evaluated experimentally and compared with three recently proposed XML search engines. The results showed marked improvement.", "paper_title": "BusSEngine: a business search engine", "paper_id": "WOS:000277203100002"}
