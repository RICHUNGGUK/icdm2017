Design/methodology/approach - Temperature and frequency dependent variations of stator (RJ and rotor (Rr) resistances are very effective on estimation performance in sensorless control over a wide speed range. To this aim, an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed, which estimates the stator resistance, R-s, load torque, tL, velocity and flux. To provide robustness against Rr' variations, the extended model is also continuously updated with R, values from a look-up table, built via EKF estimation. Findings - As demonstrated by the experimental results, the estimated states and parameters undergo a very short transient and attain their steady-state values accurately, with no need for signal injection due to the inherent noise introduced by EKF. Originality/value - Thevalueof thisstudyis in the development of an EKF-based scheme, whichsolves the RsYr estimation problem in IM sensorless control. The successful experimental results obtained with the combined EKF and look-up table approach also offer a solution to all EKF-based estimation schemes which involve a high number of estimated parameters, hence, compromising estimation accuracy.", "paper_title": "Sensorless-estimation of induction motors in wide speed range", "paper_id": "WOS:000251005900006"}
