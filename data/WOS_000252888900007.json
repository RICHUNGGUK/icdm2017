The presented algorithm is implemented by incorporating the local spatial information and a robust non-Euclidean distance measure into the formulation of the standard deterministic annealing (DA) algorithm. This implementation offers several improved features compared to existing image segmentation methods. First, it has less sensitivity to noise and other image artifacts due to the incorporation of spatial information. Second, it is independent of data initialization and has the ability to avoid many poor local optima due to the deterministic annealing process. Lastly, it possesses enhancing robustness and segmentation ability due to the injection of a robust non-Euclidean distance measure, which is obtained through a nonlinear mapping by using Gaussian radial basis function (GRBF). Experimental results on synthetic and real images are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the presented algorithm.", "paper_title": "A modified deterministic annealing algorithm for robust image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252888900007"}
