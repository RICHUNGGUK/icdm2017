Although they have obvious semantic and structural difference, many of them can be unwrapped into a one-dimensional parameter domain, e.g., time, one spatial dimension. Novel content can then be generated in this parameter domain by computing sequences of elements that are optimal according to an objective to be minimized and in addition satisfy a number of user-defined constraints. Examples for this type of content generation task are audio synthesis, human motion synthesis or architectural texture synthesis. In that work, we present a generalized algorithm for this type of content generation task. We demonstrate the potential of our technique on a selection of content creation tasks, namely the generation of extended animation sequences from motion capture libraries and the example-based synthesis of architectural geometry such as buildings and street blocks.", "paper_title": "Efficient multi-constrained optimization for example-based synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500015"}
