We suppose that the waiting space of the system is partitioned in compartments of fixed capacity for a customers. Before making his decision, a customer may or may not know the compartment in which he will enter and/or the position within the compartment in which he will enter. Thus, denoting by n the number of customers found by an arriving customer, he may or may not know left perpendicular n/a right perpendicular + 1 and/or (n mod a) + 1. We examine customers' behavior under the various levels of information regarding the system state and we identify equilibrium threshold strategies. We also study the corresponding social and profit maximization problems.", "paper_title": "Optimal balking strategies and pricing for the single server Markovian queue with compartmented waiting space", "paper_id": "WOS:000259483800003"}
