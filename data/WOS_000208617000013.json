The dangers of these sites have created a demand for safeguards that protect end-users from visiting them. This article explores how to detect malicious Web sites from the lexical and host-based features of their URLs. We show that this problem lends itself naturally to modern algorithms for online learning. Online algorithms not only process large numbers of URLs more efficiently than batch algorithms, they also adapt more quickly to new features in the continuously evolving distribution of malicious URLs. We develop a real-time system for gathering URL features and pair it with a real-time feed of labeled URLs from a large Web mail provider. From these features and labels, we are able to train an online classifier that detects malicious Web sites with 99% accuracy over a balanced dataset.", "paper_title": "Learning to Detect Malicious URLs", "paper_id": "WOS:000208617000013"}
