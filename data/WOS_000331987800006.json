The first one is assuming that no direct transmission paths exist between the source and destination nodes due to high shadow fading or large separation. The second one is assuming that either channel parameters are preestablished or perfect global channel state information (CSI) can be obtained by the relay nodes. In this paper, we get rid of these limitations and estimate channel gains for both analog network coding (ANC) and time division broadcasting (TDBC) schemes based on outage probability. As the channel gain of each link varies from time to time in wireless networks, we first estimate the channel gain according to outage probability, then propose an opportunistic scheduling scheme to optimize the sum rate values by maximizing the minimum link transmission rate. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our channel estimation scheme, and the performance of our proposed opportunistic scheduling scheme is compared with the round robin scheduling (RRS) scheme for both ANC and TDBC schemes. 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
