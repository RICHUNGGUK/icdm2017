The next set of challenges lie in realization of a large number of qubits and the. means to prepare, manipulate; and measure then, leading to error-protected qubits and fault tolerant architectures. The integration of qubits necessarily require integrated optical approach as most of these operations involve interaction with photon. In this paper, we discuss integrated optics technologies and concrete optical designs needed for the physical realization of scalable quantum computer.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATED OPTICAL APPROACH TO TRAPPED ION QUANTUM COMPUTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937400001"}
