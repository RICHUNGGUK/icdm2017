The underlying base awareness model features a \"virtual eye\" that can look out into a virtual world populated with objects to be recognised. The presented models take in to account location information sensed this virtual eye, as it roves across portions of the sensed world, to identify and represent position information regarding the sensed objects. We further discuss the addition of neural layer structures to the base awareness model to process output from the virtual eye and accordingly handle location and path identification and labelling is described. Planned applications and the context of the modelling of location and path recognition in the context of motion verb recognition are then considered. It is accordingly seen that this work enables a visual awareness model to identify and represent by purely neural means a trajectory for motion in its sensed world.", "paper_title": "A Position Identification and Path Labelling Mechanism for a Neural Model of Visual Awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000292777400014"}
