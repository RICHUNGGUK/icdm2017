Assuming that the transmitter employs a transmit antenna selection (TAS) scheme, we derive a tight closed-form expression for the secrecy outage probability and analytically evaluate the secrecy performance. An asymptotic outage expression is also derived, from which a diversity analysis is carried out. We prove that correlation between channels works in favor at medium to high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), however it degrades the performance at low SNR.", "paper_title": "Physical Layer Secrecy Performance of TAS Wiretap Channels with Correlated Main and Eavesdropper Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100022"}
