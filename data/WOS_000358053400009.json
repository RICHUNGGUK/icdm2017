Light fidelity (Li-Fi) is an optical networked communication in the subset of VLC to offload the mobile data traffics which offers many advantages at indoor scenario. In this article, we survey the key technologies for realizing Li-Fi and present the sate-of-the-art on each aspect, such as: indoor optical wireless channel model, the VLC modulation techniques with user satisfaction, OFDM in VLC, optical MIMO, optical spatial modulation, multiple user access, resource allocation, interference management and hybrid Li-Fi schemes. Some challenges and future work that need to be solved in the area are also described.", "paper_title": "Li-Fi: Light fidelity-a survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000358053400009"}
