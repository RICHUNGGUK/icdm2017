With the pervasive of the definition of the smart city, the surveillance system, huge number of video surveillance devices such as surveillance cameras has been built. The rapid increase in the available amount of surveillance video data has caused an urgent need to develop intelligent model to extract the video content.The surveillance video data has grown tremendously in recent years, but traffic violations still cause a lot of accidents and personal injury every year. There are the problems of \"cannot find\", \"difficult to understand\" for the mass surveillance video retrieval system. Knowledge map is a huge knowledge database, which can solve the above question. In this paper, the knowledge map in the traffic violations area is constructed. The Knowledge acquisition connection model is proposed. Then we study a knowledge management and rule system based on knowledge map which can detect traffic violations.", "paper_title": "The semantic analysis of knowledge map for the traffic violations from the surveillance video big data", "paper_id": "WOS:000368322300009"}
