The distinctive character of VH in DLB necessitates a new theory of visual cognition. We have conducted a series of studies with the aim to understand the mechanism of this dysfunction of the cognitive system. We have proposed that if we view the disease from the internal mechanism of neurocognitive processes, and if also take into consideration recent experimental data on conduction abnormality, at least some of the symptoms can be understood within the framework of network (or disconnection) syndromes. This paper describes the problem from a computational aspect and tries to determine whether conduction disturbances in a computational model can in fact produce a \"computational\" hallucination under appropriate assumptions.
