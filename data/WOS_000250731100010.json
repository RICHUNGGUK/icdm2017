A Bayesian optimization algorithm builds a Bayesian network from a selected sub-population of promising solutions, and this probabilistic model is employed to generate the offspring of the next generation. Our method assigns each solution a relative significance based on its fitness, and this information is used in building the Bayesian network model. These assignment functions can improve the quality of the model without performing an explicit selection on the population. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method compared to a conventional BOA. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
