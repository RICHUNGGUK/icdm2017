For the sensor network to operates successfully, the active nodes must maintain both sensing coverage and network connectivity. It has been proved before if the communication range of nodes is at least twice the sensing range, complete coverage of a convex area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes. In this paper first we consider a rectangular region A = a * b, such that R-s <= a, R-s <= b where R-s is the sensing range of node, and put a constraint on minimum allowed distance between nodes (R,). According to this constraint we present a new lower bound for communication range relative to sensing range of sensors (root 2+root 3*R-s) that complete coverage of considered area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes, after that we generalize our method and prove in a rectangular region A a * b such that root 2 * R-s <= a, root 2 * R-s <= b if minimum allowed distance between nodes is (d) then if root 2+2 root 1-d(2)/4R(s)(2) * R-s < R-c, then complete coverage of considered area implies connectivity among the working set of nodes. In addition, we prove a complete coverage is possible if d <= root 3 * R-s also a new deployment method that satisfies our constraint is presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
