The essence of rough set approach to feature selection is to find a subset of the original features. Since finding a minimal subset of the features is a NP-hard problem, it is necessary to investigate effective and efficient heuristic algorithms. Ant colony optimization (ACO) has been successfully applied to many difficult combinatorial problems like quadratic assignment, traveling salesman, scheduling, etc. It is particularly attractive for feature selection since there is no heuristic information that can guide search to the optimal minimal subset every time. However, ants can discover the best feature combinations as they traverse the graph. In this paper, we propose a new rough set approach to feature selection based on ACO, which adopts mutual information based feature significance as heuristic information. A novel feature selection algorithm is also given. Jensen and Shen proposed a ACO-based feature selection approach which starts from a random feature. Our approach starts from the feature core, which changes the complete graph to a smaller one. To verify the efficiency of our algorithm, experiments are carried out on some standard UCI datasets. The results demonstrate that our algorithm can provide efficient solution to find a minimal subset of the features. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
