This paper extends the classical VIKOR (vlsekriterijumska optimizacija i kompromisno resenje in serbian) method to accommodate hesitant fuzzy circumstances. Motivated by the hesitant normalized Manhattan distance, we develop the hesitant normalized Manhattan -metric, the hesitant fuzzy group utility measure, the hesitant fuzzy individual regret measure, and the hesitant fuzzy compromise measure. Based on these new measures, we propose a hesitant fuzzy VIKOR method, and a practical example is provided to show that our method is very effective in solving multi-criteria decision making problems with hesitant preference information.", "paper_title": "A VIKOR-based method for hesitant fuzzy multi-criteria decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000326691900002"}
