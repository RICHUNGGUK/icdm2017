The considered criteria correspond to the analysis error in certain Hessian-based metrics and to the error of some forecast aspect. Both criteria are obtained using adjoint problems that provide computation without the direct use of the Hessian. For a linear inverse heat conduction problem, these criteria are compared and demonstrated promising results when compared with a criterion based on the norm of the interpolation error of observation data. Approaches to sensor set modification using either redistribution of sensors' or refinement of the sensors grid (insertion of additional sensors) are also compared.
