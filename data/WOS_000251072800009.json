This is achieved by decomposing a symmetric weighted graph model into two submodels and using canonical forms in such a manner that the union of the eigenvalues of the submodels result in the eigenvalues of the entire model. Thus the critical load of the frame is obtained as the smallest eigenvalue obtained for the submodels. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
