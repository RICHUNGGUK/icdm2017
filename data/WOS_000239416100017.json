However, the success of this technology depends on the support from the vendors as well. Apart from practical aspects, such as usability, trustworthiness, and standardisation, economic aspects play a key role in this decision. This paper examines the cost-utility trade-off from a supply-side perspective with micro-economic models. Albeit still limited to the case of a monopolist supplier, we reflect the impact of different customer preferences towards privacy, and the possibility to implement price discrimination.", "paper_title": "Economics of identity management: A supply-side perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000239416100017"}
