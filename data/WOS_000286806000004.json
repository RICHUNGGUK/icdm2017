It has been known that the perfect matching problem for the classes of hypergraphs H with minimum ((k - 1)-wise)vertex degree delta(H) at least c vertical bar V(H)vertical bar is NP-complete for c < 1/k and trivial for c >= 1/2, leaving the status of the problem with c in the interval[1/k;12)widely open. In this paper we show, somehow surprisingly, that 1/2 is not the threshold for tractability of the perfect matching problem, and prove the existence of an is an element of > 0 such that the perfect matching problem for the class of hypergraphs H with delta(H) >= (1/2 - is an element of)vertical bar V(H)vertical bar is solvable in polynomial time. This seems to be the first polynomial time algorithm for the perfect matching problem on hypergraphs for which the existence problem is nontrivial. In addition, we consider parallel complexity of the problem, which could be also of independent interest.", "paper_title": "COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PERFECT MATCHING PROBLEM IN HYPERGRAPHS WITH SUBCRITICAL DENSITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000286806000004"}
