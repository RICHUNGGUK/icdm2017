In round zero, a set of vertices, called the seeds, are active. Thereafter, a vertex v epsilon V is activated in a round if it has at least phi(v) active in-neighbors in the previous round. Once a vertex is activated, it remains active. Sets of seeds activating all vertices after a finite number of rounds are known in the literature as irreversible dynamic monopolies (a.k.a. perfect target sets) corresponding to (G, phi). With phi(v) = inverted right perpendicular rho deg(-)(v)inverted left perpendicular for all v epsilon V, where deg(-) (v) denotes the indegree of v and p epsilon (0,1] this paper proves the existence of an irreversible dynamic monopoly of size no more than max{4.92 rho vertical bar V vertical bar,1}.
