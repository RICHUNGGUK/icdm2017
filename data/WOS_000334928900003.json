To achieve a learning aim, different programs can be chosen. Which is the adequate choice? Based on educational criteria, we implement a well-known selection method, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), to find a satisfactory solution. An example portrays the selection tool performance in the thermal engineering field. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
