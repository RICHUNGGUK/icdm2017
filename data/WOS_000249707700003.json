Edge computing is a new computing paradigm designed to allocate on-demand computing and storage resources. Those resources are Web cache servers scattered over the ISP backbones. We argue that this paradigm could be applied for on-demand full application hosting, helping to reduce costs. In this paper, we present a J2EE (Java Enterprise Edition) dynamic server able to deploy/host J2EE applications on demand and its autonomic manager. For this, we reengineer and experiment with JOnAS, an open-source J2EE static server. Two management policies of the autonomic manager were stressed by a simulation of a worldwide ISP network.
