We have proposed a new, simple and very accurate analytical model for deterministic routing in wormhole networks, which is general in terms of the network topology and traffic distribution. An accurate calculation of the variance of the service time has been developed, which overcomes the rough approximation used, as a rule, in the existing models. The model supports two-dimensional mesh topologies, widely used in network-on-chip architectures, and multidimensional topologies, popular in multicomputer architectures. It is applicable even for irregular topologies and arbitrary application-specific traffic. Results obtained through simulation show that the model achieves a high degree of accuracy.
