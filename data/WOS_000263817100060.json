In recent years, several methods have been presented for applying the fuzzy set theory in the educational grading systems. In this paper, we propose a method for the evaluation of students' answerscripts using a fuzzy system. The proposed system applies fuzzification, fuzzy inference, and defuzzification in considering the difficulty, the importance and the complexity of questions. The transparency, objectivity, and easy implementation of the proposed fuzzy system provide a useful way to automatically evaluate students' achievement in a more reasonable and fairer manner.
