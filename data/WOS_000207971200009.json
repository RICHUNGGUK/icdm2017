TBT can efficiently eliminate topology mismatching between overlay-and physical-networks during the load transfer process. As an implementation of TBT, a novel LB policy called (MON)-O-2 (Min-cost and Max-flow Channel based Overlay Network) is presented. In (MON)-O-2, the communication capability is denoted as (MC)-C-2 (Min-cost and Max-flow Channel) which is obtained using a Labeled Tree Probing (LTP) method. The computing capacity is denoted as the Idle Factor (IF) which is obtained from the semantic overlay. The higher-and lower-level characteristics are combined into an Integrated Impacting Factor (IIF) using a Double Linear Inserting (DLI) function. Based on IIF, optimal topology matching can be achieved in the LB process. Extensive experiments and simulations have been performed and will be discussed. The results show that (MON)-O-2 achieves more accurate topology matching with a minimum increment in the overall locating time yet achieving higher system performance as a whole.", "paper_title": "A bipartite model for load balancing in grid computing environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971200009"}
