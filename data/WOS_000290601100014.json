Food safety concerns have put tracking and tracing at the center point of discussion. However, in food Commodities, the establishment of tracking and tracing capability meets many barriers that have prevented their broad use. The prominent problem is to establish a feasible identification (ID) system capable of quick tracking animals from birth to slaughter, and tracing meat from consumer to farm. This paper introduces a tracking and traceability system for meat supply chain, using livestock iris code. In the tracking module, iris code is used to mark large animal, such as pig, cattle and sheep, which are the main source of meat. And in the traceability module, two-dimension iris code, generated from the iris code, is printed in product package to help consumers to trace the product from supermarket to plant. This paper takes cattle as an experimental object, and generates iris code by using suitable algorithms.", "paper_title": "TRACKING AND TRACEABILITY SYSTEM USING LIVESTOCK IRIS CODE IN MEAT SUPPLY CHAIN", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100014"}
