Evolving use of Knowledge Management plays an important role to enhance problem solving skills. Recently, innovative approaches for integrating Knowledge Management into practical teaching activities have been ignored. The knowledge is defined as combination and organization of data and information in given context, and Knowledge Management provides acquire, storage, sharing, application and creation of knowledge objects. A new Architecture for the development of adaptive and intelligent Web-Based Education systems is presented. This architecture is based on a Learning Model for Personalized Knowledge Management.", "paper_title": "PERSONALIZED KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT IN ENVIRONMENTS OF WEB-BASED EDUCATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000317850400005"}
