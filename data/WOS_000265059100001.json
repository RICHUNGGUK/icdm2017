A level set model is established to describe structural design boundary by embedding it into the zero level set of a higher-dimensional level set function. The compactly supported radial basis functions (CSRBF) are introduced to parameterize the implicit level set surface with a high level of accuracy and smoothness. The original more difficult shape and topology optimization driven by the Hamilton-Jacobi partial differential equation (PDE) is transferred into a relatively easier parametric (size) optimization, to which many well-founded optimization algorithms can be applied. Thus the structural optimization is transformed to a numerical process that describes the design as a sequence of motions of the design boundaries by updating the expansion coefficients of the size optimization. Two widely studied examples are chosen to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
