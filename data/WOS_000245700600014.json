In QHR, each connection request will be assigned to one primary path and multiple segment-backup paths to guarantee the recovery time in the worst case. Compared to previous algorithm, QHR can yield significant improvement in computation time and blocking probability. Simulations are shown to be promising. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
