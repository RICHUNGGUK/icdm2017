To calculate each sample reconstruction error, as the object template is represented by a set of contour points, the MML needs to inefficiently enumerate the distances between the sample and all the contour points. In this paper, we develop the line segment approximation (LSA) algorithm to calculate the reconstruction error, which is shown theoretically and experimentally to be more efficient than the enumeration method. It is also experimentally illustrated that the MML based algorithm has a better noise resistance ability than the generalized Hough transform (GHT) based counterpart.", "paper_title": "Investigation on multisets mixture learning based object detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000253298200008"}
