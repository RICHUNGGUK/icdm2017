At, equilibrium, the constitutive model reduces to a strongly coupled, overdetermined system of quasilinear elliptic partial differential equations with respect to the pressure and the volume fraction of the solid granular phase. First we carry a perturbation analysis based on standard hydrostatic-type scaling arguments which reduces the complexity of the coupling of the equations. The perturbed system is then supplemented by an appropriate compatibility condition which arises from the properties of the gradient operator. Further, based on the Helmholtz decomposition and Ladyzhenskaya's decomposition theorem, we develop a projection-type, Successive-Over-Relaxation numerical method. This method is general enough and can be applied to a variety of continuum models of complex mixtures and mixtures with micro-structure. We also prove that this method is both stable and consistent hence, under standard assumptions, convergent. The paper concludes with the presentation of representative numerical results.
