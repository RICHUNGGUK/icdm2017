In this paper, a hybrid modified elitist genetic algorithm-neural network (MEGA-NN) strategy is proposed for such optimization problems. The good approximation performance of neural network (NN) and the effective and robust evolutionary searching ability of modified elitist genetic algorithm (MEGA) are applied in hybrid sense, where NNs are employed in predicting the objective value, and MEGA is adopted in searching optimal designs based on the predicted fitness values. The proposed strategy (MEGA-NN) is used to estimate the temperature-dependent thermal conductivity and heat capacity using inverse heat transfer method. In order to demonstrate the accuracy and time efficiency of the proposed strategy, the results are compared to those of pre-selected parameters and MEGA. Finally, the results show that proposed MEGA-NN could save a great deal of time depending on the case. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
