The threshold regression methodology is well suited to applications involving survival and time-to-event data, and serves as an important alternative to the Cox proportional hazards model. This new package includes four functions: threg, and the methods hr, predict and plot for `threg' objects returned by threg. The threg function is the model-fitting function which is used to calculate regression coefficient estimates, asymptotic standard errors and p values. The hr method for `threg' objects is the hazard-ratio calculation function which provides the estimates of hazard ratios at selected time points for specified scenarios (based on given categories or value settings of covariates). The predict method for `threg objects is used for prediction. And the plot method for `threg' objects provides plots for curves of estimated hazard functions, survival functions and probability density functions of the first-hitting-time; function curves corresponding to different scenarios can be overlaid in the same plot for comparison to give additional research insights.", "paper_title": "The R Package threg to Implement Threshold Regression Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000365978600001"}
