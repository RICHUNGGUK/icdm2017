The LTV channel is modeled by truncated discrete Fourier bases. Based on this model, a two-step approach is adopted to estimate the LTV channel over multiple OFDM symbols. We also present performance analysis of the channel estimation and derive a closed-form expression for the channel estimation variances. It is shown that the estimation variances, unlike that of the conventional ST-based schemes, approach to a fixed lower-bound as the training length increases, which is directly proportional to information-pilot power ratios. For wireless communication systems with a limited transmission power, we optimize the ST power allocation by maximizing the lower bound of the average channel capacity. Simulation results show that the proposed approach outperforms the frequency-division multiplexed training schemes.", "paper_title": "Linearly time-varying channel estimation and training power allocation for OFDM/MIMO systems using superimposed training", "paper_id": "WOS:000292269700012"}
