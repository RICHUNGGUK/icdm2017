Design/methodology/approach - A novel magnetic gear was developed. Magnetic fields and torque of the gear were simulated based on IEMs. The fast multipole method was applied to compress the matrix of the belonging linear system of equations. A computer cluster was used to achieve numerical results within an acceptable time. A three-dimensional post-processing and visualization of magnetic fields enables a deep understanding of the gear. Findings - IEMs are very well suited for the numerical analysis of a magnetic gear. Especially, the treatment of the air gap between the rotating components, which move with significant varying velocities, is relatively easy. Furthermore, a correct computation and visualization of flux lines is possible. A magnetic gear is advantageous for high rotational velocities. Research limitations/implications - A quasi static numerical simulation has sufficed for an understanding of the principle of the magnetic gear and for the development of a prototype. Practical implications - IEMs are very suitable for the analysis of complex problems with moving parts. Nowadays, the efficiency is very good even for large problems, since matrix compression techniques are well-engineered. Originality/value - The design of a novel magnetic gear is discussed. Well-known techniques like IEMs, fast multipole method and parallel computing are combined to solve a very large and complex problem.", "paper_title": "Efficient design analysis of a novel magnetic gear on a high performance computer", "paper_id": "WOS:000248369400013"}
