Various resolution enhancement approaches have been successfully applied on natural images. Nevertheless, their direct application to textual images is not efficient enough due to the specificities that distinguish these particular images from natural images. The use of insufficient resolution introduces substantial loss of details which can make a text unreadable by humans and unrecognizable by OCR systems. To address these issues, a sparse coding-based approach is proposed to enhance the resolution of a textual image. Three major contributions are presented in this paper: (1) Multiple coupled dictionaries are learned from a clustered database and selected adaptively for a better reconstruction. (2) An automatic process is developed to collect the training database, which contains writing patterns extracted from high-quality character images. (3) A new local feature descriptor well suited for writing specificities is proposed for the clustering of the training database. The performance of these propositions is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on various types of low-resolution textual images. Significant improvements in visual quality and character recognition rates are achieved using the proposed approach, confirmed by a detailed comparative study with state-of-the-art upscaling approaches.", "paper_title": "Resolution enhancement of textual images via multiple coupled dictionaries and adaptive sparse representation selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000350208300007"}
