Our approach models a 2D illustration as a planar mesh and represents the shape styles with four components: the object contour, the context curves, user-specified features and local shape details. After the correspondence between the input model and the 2D illustration is established, shape stylization is formulated as a style-constrained differential mesh editing problem. A distinguishing feature of our approach is that it allows users to directly transfer styles from hand-drawn 2D illustrations with individual perception and cognition, which are difficult to identify and create with 3D modeling and editing approaches. We present a sequence of challenging examples including unrealistic and exaggerated paintings to illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "Image driven shape deformation using styles", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537700003"}
