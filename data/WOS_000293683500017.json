Statistical methods are widely used because they are portable and allow simple system building. However, pure statistical methods often incorrectly align functional words in the English-Korean language pair due to differences in the typology of the languages and a lack of knowledge. Knowledge is inevitably required to correct errors and to improve word alignment quality. In this paper, we introduce an effective method that uses an iterative process to incorporate knowledge into the word alignment system. The method achieved significant improvements in word alignment and its application: statistical machine translation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
