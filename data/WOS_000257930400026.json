Large tracking error causes many problems during AR applications. Tracking error estimation should be integrated with them to improve the reliability of tracking methods. Although some tracking error estimation methods have been developed, they are not feasible to be integrated because of computational speed and accuracy. For this study, a tracking error estimation algorithm with screen error estimation based on the characteristic of linecode marker was applied. It can rapidly estimate tracking error. An evaluation experiment was conducted to compare the estimated tracking error and the actual measured tracking error. Results show that the algorithm is reliable and sufficiently fast to be used for real-time tracking error warning or tracking accuracy improvement methods.", "paper_title": "Real-time tracking error estimation for augmented reality for registration with linecode markers", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400026"}
