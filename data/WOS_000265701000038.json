It is a critical factor for such IPs from the Quality-of-Service (QoS) perspective. Jitter of a real-time IP can be measured by how frequently it experiences the underflows and overflows from its data queue in read mode and write mode, respectively. Such failures critically depend on the bus arbitration scheme which determines the bus acquisition order of IPs. The proposed idea allows IPs to inform the bus arbiter of the status of their data buffers when they assert bus requests. Such information helps the bus arbiter to determine the bus acquisition order while greatly reducing the jitter. The experimental results show that our method effectively eliminates the overflows and underflows of real-time IPs by dynamically preempting the jitter-critical bus requests.", "paper_title": "Jitter-Conscious Bus Arbitration Scheme for Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701000038"}
