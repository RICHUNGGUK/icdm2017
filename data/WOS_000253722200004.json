The Principle of Least Effort (PLE) minimizes the effort provided that the entropy remains constant. The paper investigates the relation between these two principles. In some kinds of effort functions, called admissible, it is shown that these two principles are equivalent. The results are illustrated by the size-frequency statistical distribution met in infometry in Information Production Processes. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
