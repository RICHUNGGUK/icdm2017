A probe vehicle is equipped with onboard sensing devices that detect urban information as the probe vehicle drive across the road network. For example, GPS sensors can detect real-time vehicle status including instant speed and physical position. PUS can provide the general public valuable urban sensing information, such as frequently updated digital maps, and real-time traffic light states. In this paper, we first present the framework of Pervasive Urban Sensing with probe vehicles. Next, we present two cases of urban sensing with probe vehicles. As case one, we discuss the design of a sensing algorithm for detecting the instant state of traffic lights. As case two, we discuss the design of sensing algorithms for recognizing roads by using the vehicular footprints. Some preliminary results of these two cases of urban sensing are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Pervasive Urban Sensing with Large-Scale Mobile Probe Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000315231900001"}
