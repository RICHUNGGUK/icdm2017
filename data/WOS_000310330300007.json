Pad assignment, which assigns inter-die signals to die pads so as to facilitate wire bonding, is an important physical design problem for SiP design because the quality of a pad assignment solution affects both the cost and the performance of an SiP design. In this paper, we study a pad assignment problem, which prohibits the generation of illegal crossings and aims to minimize the total signal wirelength, for die-stacking SiP design. We first consider the two-die cases and die-stacks with a bridging die, and present a minimum-cost flow-based approach to optimally solve them in polynomial time. We then describe an approach, which uses a modified left-edge algorithm and an integer linear programming technique, for pyramid die-stacks with no bridging die. Finally, we discuss extensions of the two approaches to handle additional design constraints. Encouraging experimental results are shown to support our approaches.", "paper_title": "Pad Assignment for Die-Stacking System-in-Package Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000310330300007"}
