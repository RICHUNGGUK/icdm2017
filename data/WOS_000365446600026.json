The information layer that we call virtual forms presents dynamically generated visual information representing virtual objects and creatures that influence human attitude and behavior. The focus of our research is to develop intelligent artifacts enhanced with virtual forms that influence human attitude and behavior. To suggest some ways to develop such artifacts that harmoniously integrate virtual forms into them, based on our experience with three case studies presented in the paper, we propose a value-based analysis framework, which allows us to discuss and consider some good-design implications for the design of the enhanced intelligent artifacts. We also present design implications to apply the value-based analysis framework to analyze and enhance one of intelligent artifact. Finally, our experience suggests that incorporating fictionality is a promising direction for the designing of intelligent artifacts with ideological messages intended to influence people's attitude and behavior.", "paper_title": "Enhancing values through virtuality for intelligent artifacts that influence human attitude and behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000365446600026"}
