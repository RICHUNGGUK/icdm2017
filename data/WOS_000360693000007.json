To avoid subjectivity or the preference of decision makers in the assessment, catastrophe theory based evaluation method is proposed in this study which calculates the importance of one criterion over other by its inner mechanism and thus, avoid subjectivity. The proposed method is applied for the assessment of groundwater potential zones in the arid region of lower Balochistan province of Pakistan. The groundwater is considered as a system with five sub-systems namely, geology, soil, drainage density, slope and rainfall. Seventeen sub-system indicators of groundwater potential are selected for modeling groundwater potential zone. The catastrophe theory is applied to derive the relative weights of indicators in predicting groundwater potential. Thematic maps of sub-systems are integrated within a geographical information system and the groundwater potential zones of the integrated layer are calculated by using the weights of indicators. The results are verified by existing number of tube wells operating in the study area. It has been found that the number of tube wells is more in the area where the groundwater potential is high. The study reveals that catastrophe theory is suitable for assessing groundwater potential.", "paper_title": "Assessment of groundwater potential zones in an arid region based on catastrophe theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000360693000007"}
