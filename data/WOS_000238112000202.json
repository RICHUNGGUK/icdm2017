Two novel approaches for feature selection in order to select a subset with relevant features are proposed. These approaches can be considered as a direct extension of the ensemble feature selection approach. The first one deals with identifying relevant features by using a single feature selection method. While, the second one uses different feature selection methods in order to identify more correctly the relevant features. An illustration shows the effectiveness of the proposed methods on artificial databases where we have a priori the informations about the relevant features.", "paper_title": "Using ensemble feature selection approach in selecting subset with relevant features", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000202"}
