For this purpose, IT2F disjunctive normal forms and fuzzy conjunctive normal forms are utilized in the inference engine. The main contribution of this paper is to present the IT2F hybrid expert system, which is the combination of the Mamdani and Sugeno methods. In order to predict the future amount of tardiness for continuous casting operation in a steel company in Canada, an autoregressive moving average model is used in the consequents of the rules. Parameters of the system are tuned by applying Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System. This method is compared with IT2F Takagi-Sugeno-Kang method in MATLAB, multiple-regression, and two other Type-1 fuzzy methods in literature. The results of computing the mean square error of these methods show that our proposed method has less error and high accuracy in comparison with other methods.", "paper_title": "Type-2 fuzzy hybrid expert system for prediction of tardiness in scheduling of steel continuous casting process", "paper_id": "WOS:000306354600001"}
