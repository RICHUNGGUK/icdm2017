As improvements in processor performance continue to outpace improvements in memory performance, tools to understand memory access patterns are increasingly important for optimizing data intensive programs such as those found in scientific computing. Using visual representations of abstract data structures, a simulated cache, and animating memory operations, MTV can expose memory performance bottlenecks and guide programmers toward memory system optimization opportunities. Visualization of detailed memory operations provides a powerful and intuitive way to expose patterns and discover bottlenecks, and is an important addition to existing statistical performance measurements.", "paper_title": "Interactive visualization for memory reference traces", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000014"}
