We now proceed in Part II to address global attitude tracking. By blending the intermediate quaternion with a shifted one, we develop a systematic approach for synthesizing a hybrid attitude control scheme capable of steering any initial attitude error toward the desired stable equilibrium, delivering a final product for globally stable attitude tracking control of spacecraft free of singularity, ambiguity and unwinding.", "paper_title": "NEW INTERMEDIATE QUATERNION BASED CONTROL OF SPACECRAFT: PART II - GLOBAL ATTITUDE TRACKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000311584500020"}
