Digital libraries have collected large-scaled data for providing information service. However, there are still many problems such as limitations of computing on mobile devices and data transmission problems in the wireless network. This paper proposes a synergetic mechanism for digital library to provide information service in the mobile and cloud computing environment, which combines the digital library servers, mobile hosts and personal cloud space into a synergetic work group seamlessly. The proposed mechanism integrates the strong computing and large-scaled storage ability of cloud computing together with the convenience of mobile computing. It could help promoting knowledge sharing and improve work efficiency of users in the mobile and cloud computing environment.", "paper_title": "A synergetic mechanism for digital library service in mobile and cloud computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000344812200006"}
