The number of generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) is characterized in terms of alpha, where the interference-to-noise ratio (INR) is given by INR = SNR alpha. It is shown that the per-user GDoF of this network is the same as that of the two-user interference channel with feedback, except for alpha = 1, for which existence of feedback does not help in terms of GDoF. The coding scheme proposed for this network, termed cooperative interference alignment, is based on two key ingredients, namely, interference alignment and interference decoding. Moreover, an approximate characterization is provided for the symmetric feedback capacity of the network, when the and SNR are INR far apart from each other.", "paper_title": "On the Feedback Capacity of the Fully Connected K-User Interference Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500018"}
