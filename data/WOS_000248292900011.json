In data broadcast systems, a caching can be a useful technique to alleviate performance degradation by reducing contention for narrow bandwidth due to broadcast requests. In this paper, for pull-based data broadcast systems we propose a caching strategy which is expected to have prefetching effects by considering data popularity among clients. Then, we evaluate the proposed strategy through a simulation approach to analyze the prefetching effects. According to the results, in normal case the proposed strategy generally shows better performance than other strategies in terms of average response time.", "paper_title": "Evaluating effects of data popularity on performance of caching strategy in pull-based data boradcast systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248292900011"}
