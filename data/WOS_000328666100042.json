The UQUANTCHEM package is distributed under the general public license and can be directly downloaded from the code web-site (http://www.anst.uu.se/pesou087/DOWNLOADUQUANTCHEM/DOWNLOAD-UQUANTCHEM/DOWNLOAD-SITE-UQUANTCHEM.html) [1]. Together with a presentation of the different capabilities of the uquantchem code and a more technical discussion on how these capabilities have been implemented, a presentation of the user-friendly aspect of the package on the basis of the large number of default settings will also be presented. Furthermore, since the code has been parallelized within the framework of the message passing interface (MPI), the timing of some benchmark calculations are reported to illustrate how the code scales with the number of computational nodes for different levels of chemical theory.
