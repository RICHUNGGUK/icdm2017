Intelligent power grids, known as smart grids, are required as the demand for energy continues to grow and more emphasis is being placed on the supply of renewable energy. The main ingredient of smart grid is the integration of information and communication technology into the grids to monitor and regulate power generation and the demand. The impact of the communication networks on the performance of power system dynamics can only be understood through numerical simulations. This paper provides an overview of available simulation techniques for smart grid communications with a particular focus on the co-simulation frameworks and their enabling technologies. Moreover, a case study with VPNET for analyzing agent based shipboard smart grid protections considering communication impacts is provided. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
