Due to these attacks, corporate image can be impaired significantly by such damages as increditable service quality and unstable service, which can lead to fatal flaws. Among the malicious attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) is the most damaging and frequently reported form of internet attacks. Because DoS attacks employ IP spoofing to disguise the IP and hide the identity of the attacker's location, the correct address of attacker is not traceable only with the source IP address of packets received from damaged systems. Effective measures for the DoS attacks are not developed yet and even if defence is made for this attacks practically it is possible to repeatedly undergo attacks by the same attackers. In this point of view, in order to provide an effective countermeasure this study proposes mechanism to find out attack source by tracing the attack path using marking algorithms and then finding MAC address of attack source. In addition this study proposes technique to improve the packet arrival rate in marking algorithm and presents more effective measure with better performance to find attackers by enabling more prompt trace of the attack location.", "paper_title": "A proposal of extension of FMS-based mechanism to find attack paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300051"}
