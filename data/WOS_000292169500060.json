Also, the automatic generation of the optimized parts list has been investigated. The system has been developed in the Windows XP environment using an Open API (application programming interface) and a commercial CAD/CAM/CAE solution. It consists mainly of three kinds of module, i.e., a standard part module, parts-list module, and retrieval-system module. The standard part module is helpful for designers to effectively reuse or modify standard parts after registering them using a GUI. The parts-list module generates a parts list using either standard and/or non-standard parts. The retrieval-system module allows the effective retrieval and classification of standard parts. The system was applied to standardize mold bases and mold parts. It was applied to Hyundai Heavy Industry, S. Korea, which resulted in the reduction of design errors and design time.
