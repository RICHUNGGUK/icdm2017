It has been shown that ONPP is a strong analyzer of high-dimensional data. However, when applied to classification problems in a supervised setting, ONPP only focuses on the intraclass geometrical information while ignores the interaction of samples from different classes. To enhance the performance of ONPP in classification, a new algorithm termed discriminative ONPP (DONPP) is proposed in this paper. DONPP 1) takes into account both intraclass and interclass geometries; 2) considers the neighborhood information of interclass relationships; and 3) follows the orthogonality property of ONPP. Furthermore, DONPP is extended to the semisupervised case, i.e., semisupervised DONPP (SDONPP). This uses unlabeled samples to improve the classification accuracy of the original DONPP. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of both DONPP and SDONPP.", "paper_title": "Discriminative Orthogonal Neighborhood-Preserving Projections for Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000271440600023"}
