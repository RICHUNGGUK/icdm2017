In cloud computing, service reliability and service performance are two important issues. To improve cloud service reliability, fault tolerance techniques such as fault recovery may be used, which in turn has impact on cloud service performance. Such impact deserves detailed research. Although there exist some researches on cloud/grid service reliability and performance, very few of them addressed the issues of fault recovery and its impact on service performance. In this paper, we conduct detailed research on performance evaluation of cloud service considering fault recovery. We consider recovery on both processing nodes and communication links. The commonly adopted assumption of Poisson arrivals of users' service requests is relaxed, and the interarrival times of service requests can take arbitrary probability distribution. The precedence constraints of subtasks are also considered. The probability distribution of service response time is derived, and a numerical example is presented. The proposed cloud performance evaluation models and methods could yield results which are realistic, and thus are of practical value for related decision-makings in cloud computing.", "paper_title": "Performance evaluation of cloud service considering fault recovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000319942000026"}
