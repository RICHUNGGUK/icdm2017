SNAr is one of the six mechanistic domains that have been shown to be important in toxicological endpoints in which the ability to bind covalently to a protein is a key molecular initiating event. This study has analysed experimental data (2 h RC50 values), allowing a clear and interpretable structure-activity relationship to be developed for pyridines and pyrimidines which reside within the SNAr domain. The in-ring nitrogen(s) act as activating groups in the SNAr reaction. The position(s) of the in-ring nitrogen(s) as well as other activating groups, especially in relationship to the leaving group, affect reactive potency. The experimentally defined applicability domain has resulted in a series of structural alerts. These results build on early work on the benzene derivatives residing in the SNAr domain. The definition of the applicability domain for the SNAr reaction and the resulting structural alerts are likely to be beneficial in the development of computational tools for category formation and read-across in hazard identification, and the development of adverse outcome pathways.", "paper_title": "The definition of the toxicologically relevant applicability domain for the SNAr reaction for substituted pyridines and pyrimidines", "paper_id": "WOS:000320185900003"}
