Many governments have made considerable efforts to frame policies to reduce the use of hazardous materials and improve a product's recyclability. In this research, recyclability parameters are introduced to represent a product component's recyclability and to aid a designer in evaluating the component's recyclability. The recyclability index is defined as a measure of the ability of a material to regain its valued properties when subjected to a special recycling process. A method is proposed to determine the recyclability of a material during the design phase. This research method combines case-based reasoning (CBR) and the analytical hierarchy process to simplify the calculation of the recyclability index for a product. Designers can extract experiences from past cases to (1) calculate the recyclability rate of a designed product, (2) determine the possibility of recycling end-of-life (EOL) products, and (3) finalise a recycling plan for EOL products when including a new product in a recycling and treatment system.
