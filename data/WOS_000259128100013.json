The interaction relationships among these ERP implementation success factors, however, have been overlooked. The objective of this study is to explore the interaction patterns among the ERP implementation Success factors from a covariation (co-alignment) perspective. We conceptualize the \"consistency\" among the factors that facilitate ERP implementation and evaluate them in terms of their positive impact on successful ERP implementation. The results from a field survey of 90 Taiwanese manufacturing firms show that the \"consistency\" among these facilitating factors of ERP implementation had a significant positive impact on ERP implementation Success. The factors examined in this study include vendor Support, consultant competence, ERP project team member competence, ERP project manager leadership, top management support, and user support. Implications for managers and researchers conclude this study. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
