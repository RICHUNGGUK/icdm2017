Different from binary systems with a single proton donor, the tricomplexes have the property of forming multiple hydrogen bonds, which are analyzed from a structural and vibrational point of view, but verified only by means of the quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM). As traditionally done in the hydrogen bond theory, the charge transfer between proton donors and acceptors was computed using the CHELPG calculations, which also revealed agreement with dipole moment variation and a cooperative effect on the tricomplexes. Furthermore, redshift events on proton donor bonds were satisfactorily identified, although, in this case, an absence of experimental data led to the use of a theoretical argument to interpret these spectroscopic shifts. It was therefore the use of the QTAIM parameters that enabled all intermolecular vibrational modes to be validated. The most stable tricomplex in terms of energy was identified via the strength of the hydrogen bonds, which were modeled as directional and bifurcated.", "paper_title": "Hydrogen bonds determine the structures of the ternary heterocyclic complexes C2H4O center dot center dot center dot 2HF, C2H5N center dot center dot center dot 2HF and C2H4S center dot center dot center dot 2HF: density functional theory and topological calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000296301700014"}
