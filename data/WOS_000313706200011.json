The principle of compensation is introduced in detail. This work generates two different compensated currents in the whole temperature range, which is different from the traditional curvature-compensated circuit. The compensation is achieved by using difference of the negative temperature coefficients. Piecewise curvature-compensation and higher order nonlinear temperature compensation are applied at the same time. The proposed circuit is simple and easy to implement. Results of simulation with HSPICE show that the achieved temperature coefficient is only 34.2 ppm/degrees C compared with 364 ppm/degrees C under 1 mu m BCD process, which is unnecessary to compensate in the range of -25 degrees C similar to 125 degrees C at 5V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "PRECISING COMPLEX-COMPENSATED CURRENT REFERENCE BASED ON DIFFERENTIAL MODE OF CURRENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706200011"}
