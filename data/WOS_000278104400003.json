The studies obtained lead to establish certain objective criteria that let us select the best characters to observe and establish a methodology, which allows us to select the mathematical functions that best represent a given system. The studies provide the theoretical basis for obtaining computational algorithms that allow the computational implementation of model selection.", "paper_title": "Information Storage System", "paper_id": "WOS:000278104400003"}
