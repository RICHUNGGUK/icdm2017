In this letter, we suggest a new preamble for FBMC systems and for it develop a near maximum likelihood joint channel, carrier frequency, and timing phase estimation method. The superior performance of our design over those already in the literature is shown through computer simulations.", "paper_title": "Near Maximum Likelihood Synchronization for Filter Bank Multicarrier Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696600023"}
