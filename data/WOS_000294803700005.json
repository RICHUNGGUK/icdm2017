The proposed MUD method is termed CEFM-GA DA for short. We describe the scheme of CEFM-GA DA, analyze its algorithm, and compare its computational complexity with other MUDs. Simulation results show that a significant performance gain can be achieved by employing the proposed CEFM-GA DA, compared with successive interference cancellation (SIC), parallel interference cancellation (PIC), conventional GA, and CEFM-GA without DA, for UWB systems in lognormal fading channel. Moreover, CEFM-GA DA not only reduces computational complexity relative to conventional GA and CEFM-GA without DA, but also improves bit error rate (BER) performance.", "paper_title": "Differential multiuser detection using a novel genetic algorithm for ultra-wideband systems in lognormal fading channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000294803700005"}
