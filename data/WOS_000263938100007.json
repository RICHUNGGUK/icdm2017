Neutropenia is one major side-effect of many antitumor agents, and is related to an increased risk of infection. A model capable of describing the time-course of myelosuppression from administered drug could be used in individual dose selection. in this paper we describe the transfer of a previously developed semi-mechanistic model for myelosuppression. from NONMEM to a dosing tool in MS Excel, with etoposide as an example. The tool proved capable to solve a differential equation system describing the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, with estimation performance comparable to NONMEM. In the dosing tool the user provides neutrophil measures from a previous treatment course and request for the dose that results in a desired nadir in the upcoming course through a Bayesian estimation procedure.
