The orthogonal quantum signals in consecutive quantum sequences are prepared to avoid mutual interference and they are firstly transmitted to the quantum relay node and then to the destination node with space-time transmission. Moreover, quantum operations and transformations are implemented on the relay node and the destination node to maximize the correct information transmission. The fidelity between original and final received signals, the security, the quantum bit error rate and the lower bound on the capacity of quantum relay channels are analyzed. Especially it provides a valuable application prospedt in long distance reliable quantum communications.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM RELAY COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATION VIA SPACE-TIME TRANSMISSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188700007"}
