As the number of cores inside a Chip Multiprocessor (CMP) increases, the interconnection network will have significant impact on both overall performance and energy consumption as previous studies have shown. Moreover, wires used in such interconnect can be designed with varying latency, bandwidth and power characteristics. In this work, we show how messages can be efficiently managed in tiled CMP, from the point of view of both performance and energy, by combining both address compression with a heterogeneous interconnect. In particular, our proposal is based on applying an address compression scheme that dynamically compresses the addresses within coherence messages allowing for a significant area slack. The arising area is exploited for wire latency improvement by using a heterogeneous interconnection network comprised of a small set of very-low-latency wires for critical short-messages in addition to baseline wires. Detailed simulations of a 16-core CMP show that our proposal obtains average improvements of 10% in execution time and 38% in the energy-delay(2) product of the interconnect. Additionally, the sensitivity analysis shows that our proposal performs well when either OoO cores or caches with higher latencies are considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
