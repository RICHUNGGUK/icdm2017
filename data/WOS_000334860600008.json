However, the vast majority of research does not consider the enormous influence a crisis has on social media that further affects the relationship between social media and the stock market. This article aims to address these challenges by proposing a multistage dynamic analysis framework. In this framework, we use an authorship analysis technique and topic model method to identify stakeholder groups and topics related to a special firm. We analyze the activities of stakeholder groups and topics in different periods of a crisis to evaluate the crisis's influence on various social media parameters. Then, we construct a stock regression model in each stage of crisis to analyze the relationships of changes among stakeholder groups/topics and stock behavior during a crisis. Finally, we discuss some interesting and significant results, which show that a crisis affects social media discussion topics and that different stakeholder groups/topics have distinct effects on stock market predictions during each stage of a crisis.", "paper_title": "Analyzing market performance via social media: a case study of a banking industry crisis", "paper_id": "WOS:000334860600008"}
