Firstly, the concept of finite-time stability is generalized to the fuzzy neural networks. And then by the Lyapunov approach and linear matrix inequality technique, a sufficient condition for the system to be finite-time stable is proposed, based on which, the finite-time stability condition for the system with norm bounded uncertainties is also given. Finally a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
