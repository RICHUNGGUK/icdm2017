Carbon footprint models can enable research into ICT energy efficiency and carbon reduction. The Green Star Network (GSN) testbed is a prototype wide-area network of data centers powered by renewable energy sources. Through their work developing the GSN, the authors have researched fundamental aspects of green ICT such as virtual infrastructure, unified management of compute, network, power, and climate resources, smart power control, and a carbon assessment protocol.", "paper_title": "Powering a Data Center Network via Renewable Energy: A Green Testbed", "paper_id": "WOS:000313536400008"}
