As a consequence, clock tuning elements are employed to aid the post-silicon clock tuning. However, as the number of these elements continues to grow, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine their configurations in a compute effective manner. In this paper we describe a novel exact algorithm for post-silicon clock tuning, which employs smart pruning techniques that exploit the characteristics of the clock tuning buffers.", "paper_title": "A Novel Algorithmic Approach to Aid Post-Silicon Delay Measurement and Clock Tuning", "paper_id": "WOS:000336672600002"}
