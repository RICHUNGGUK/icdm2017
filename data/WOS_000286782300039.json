The equations contain time derivatives which are approximated by introducing small time steps. An alternative approach avoids time steps by using Monte Carlo to directly sample the time at which the next event occurs. That is, the time is advanced on a natural event-by-event basis rather than by introducing an artificial time step. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
