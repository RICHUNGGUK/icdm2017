Since environmental changes impact the transmission channel between devices, the detection of this alteration can be used to classify environmental situations. We identify relevant features to detect activities of non-actively transmitting subjects. In particular, we distinguish with high accuracy an empty environment or a walking, lying, crawling or standing person, in case-studies of an active, device-free activity recognition system with software defined radios. We distinguish between two cases in which the transmitter is either under the control of the system or ambient. For activity detection the application of one-stage and two-stage classifiers is considered. Apart from the discrimination of the above activities, we can show that a detected activity can also be localized simultaneously within an area of less than 1 meter radius.", "paper_title": "RF-Sensing of Activities from Non-Cooperative Subjects in Device-Free Recognition Systems Using Ambient and Local Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000333092700015"}
