The motion of such virtual humans should look realistic (or 'natural') and allow interaction with the surroundings and other (virtual) humans. Current animation techniques differ in the trade-off they offer between motion naturalness and the control that can be exerted over the motion. We show mechanisms to parametrize, combine (on different body parts) and concatenate motions generated by different animation techniques. We discuss several aspects of motion naturalness and show how it can be evaluated. We conclude by showing the promise of combinations of different animation paradigms to enhance both naturalness and control.", "paper_title": "Real Time Animation of Virtual Humans: A Trade-off Between Naturalness and Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000284119300020"}
