We also show how our proposed unified framework can be used for velocity field following, timed trajectory tracking and haptic interaction over the Internet, while also providing a complete stability (or collision avoidance) analysis. Experiments using a real quadrotor and lossy communication (for the teleoperation) are also performed to illustrate the theory. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
