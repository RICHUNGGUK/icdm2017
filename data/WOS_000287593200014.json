As our ultimate goal is to compare the results of standard fuzzy clustering algorithms (e.g. fuzzy c-means), we define a method to construct them from a set of fuzzy clusters obtained from several executions of fuzzy c-means. From a practical point of view, the approach presented here tries to solve the difficulty of comparing the results of fuzzy clustering methods and, in particular, the difficulty of finding the global optimal.", "paper_title": "A definition for I-fuzzy partitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000287593200014"}
