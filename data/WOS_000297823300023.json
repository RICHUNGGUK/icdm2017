Taking the palette indexing method as a representative, this paper presents two new strategies, the pruning-based search strategy and the lookup table (LUT)-based update strategy, to speed up the learning process in the SOFM. Based on four typical testing images, experimental results illustrate that our proposed two strategies have 35% execution-time improvement ratio in average. The practical improvement ratio is very close to that in the theoretical analysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
