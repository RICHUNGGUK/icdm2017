The current work proposes that the congestion control problem in the Internet can be inspired from natural population control tactics. Toward this idea, the congestion window size of each connection is viewed as population size of a species and then congestion control problem is redefined as population control of these windows species (W). This paper defines a three-trophic food chain and gives a model to control population size of W species within this food chain. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm leads to a fair, stable and high-performance congestion control scheme.", "paper_title": "Congestion control in the internet: Inspiration from balanced food chains in the nature", "paper_id": "WOS:000253994500001"}
