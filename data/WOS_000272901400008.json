Hierarchies of patterns of features or other modeling entities are used in architectural and mechanical CAD to eliminate laborious repetitions from the design process. Yet, often a subset of the repeated occurrences in the model must be edited. Specifying a desired selection is often tedious and difficult. Our approach addresses these two drawbacks Simultaneously, offering an effective and intuitive solution which requires only two mouse-clicks to specify any one of a wide range of selections, including selections in recursive hierarchies. The selection has a concise representation that is simple to compute. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
