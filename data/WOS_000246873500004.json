Few empirical studies have been conducted, however, to guide developers of distributed real-time and embedded (DRE) systems in choosing among alternative designs and performance optimizations. Moreover, few empirical studies have been conducted to examine the performance and flexibility trade-offs between standards-based and domain-specific DRE middleware solutions. This paper makes three key contributions to research on QoS-enabled component middleware for DRE systems. First, it describes optimizations applied to an implementation of the OMG's Deployment and Configuration (D&C) of Components specification that enable performance trade-offs between QoS aspects of DRE systems. Second, it compares the performance of several dynamic and static configuration mechanisms to help guide the selection of suitable configuration mechanisms based on specific DRE system requirements. Third, it compares the performance of our static standards-based approach to an avionics domain-specific approach. Our results show that these optimizations (1) provide developers improved control over key trade-offs between flexibility and performance at different stages of the DRE system lifecycle, (2) enhance trustworthiness of component-based DRE systems by supporting greater customization of how they are configured to meet specific requirements of each application, and (3) offer greater flexibility at a reasonable performance cost, compared to a domain-specific approach.
