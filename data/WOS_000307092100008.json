E) of order n is called arbitrarily partitionable, or AP for short, if given any sequence of positive integers n(1). . . . .n(k) summing up to n, we can always partition V into subsets V-1. . . . .V-k of sizes n(1). . . . .n(k), resp., inducing connected subgraphs in G. If additionally G is minimal with respect to this property, i.e. it contains no AP spanning subgraph, we call it a minimal AP-graph. It has been conjectured that such graphs are sparse, i.e., there exists an absolute constant C such that vertical bar E vertical bar <= Cn for each of them. We construct a family of minimal AP-graphs which prove that C >= 1 + 1/30 (if such C exists). (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
