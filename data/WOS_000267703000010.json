Human capital, however, is not only a resource required for conducting research, but also the eventual result of that research. When selecting a research portfolio, the decision-maker (DM) thus needs to take into consideration both current and future competence requirements, as well as other financial and nonfinancial objectives and constraints. We introduce a proper multicriteria decision support system (MCDSS) that first determines the set of Pareto-efficient solutions and then allows the DM to interactively filter and/or explore this set in various ways. Its practical application is demonstrated by means of a showcase at the Electronic Commerce Competence Center (EC3) in Vienna, Austria.", "paper_title": "A MULTICRITERIA DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR COMPETENCE-DRIVEN PROJECT PORTFOLIO SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000267703000010"}
