Existing techniques for Web service computing are not sufficient for this class of services that are exposed by resource-constrained devices. The vast number of distributed and redundantly deployed sensors necessitate specialised techniques for their discovery and ranking. Current research in this line mostly focuses on discovery, e.g., designing efficient searching methods by exploiting the geographical properties of sensing devices. The problem of ranking, which aims to prioritise semantically equivalent sensor services returned by the discovery process, has not been adequately studied. Existing methods mostly leverage the information directly associated with sensor services, such as detailed service descriptions or quality of service information. However, assuming the availability of such information for sensor services is often unrealistic. We propose a ranking strategy by estimating the cost of accessing sensor services. The computation is based on properties of the sensor nodes as well as the relevant contextual information extracted from the service access process. The evaluation results demonstrate not only the superior performance of the proposed method in terms of ranking quality measure, but also the potential for preserving the energy of the sensor nodes.
