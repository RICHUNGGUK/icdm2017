Supervised learning with static models has been applied pervasively for mobile activity recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel phone-based dynamic recognition framework with evolving data streams for activity recognition. The novel framework incorporates incremental and active learning for real-time recognition and adaptation in streaming settings. While stream evolves, we refine, enhance and personalise the learning model in order to accommodate the natural drift in a given data stream. Extensive experimental results using real activity recognition data have evidenced that the novel dynamic approach shows improved performance of recognising activities especially across different users.
