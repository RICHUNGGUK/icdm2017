In this context, the development of integrated and decentralized frameworks for executing complex control and monitoring applications is still in its infancy and needs to be researched. To address this issue, this paper conceptualizes a self-organizing computing framework, based on self-organizing agents, for solving the fundamental control and monitoring problems of an SMG without the need for centralized data acquisition and processing. Simulation results obtained for an 18-bus test network are presented and discussed in order to demonstrate the significance and validity of the proposed new framework.", "paper_title": "A Self-Organizing Architecture for Decentralized Smart Microgrids Synchronization, Control, and Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000030"}
