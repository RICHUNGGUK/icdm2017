The spectrum sensing is applied to a cognitive radio system, where each cognitive radio sends its decision to a fusion center through a reporting channel, in which an n-out-of-K rule is applied. We compare the performance of the decision rules, analyzing the impact of the errors introduced by the reporting channel, considering the Bayes risk criterion.", "paper_title": "Cooperative spectrum sensing under unreliable reporting channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000339380200012"}
