A simple, yet effective model for simulation of both mechanical deformation and permeability of the pack in specific case of polymeric proppant is presented. The mechanical deformation modeling is similar to the discrete elements method, where permeability is calculated with the lattice Boltzmann method. The simulation imitates the standard procedure for measuring the conductivity of a proppant. Permeabilities for different loads and different grain size distributions are obtained.", "paper_title": "Prediction of the permeability of proppant packs under load", "paper_id": "WOS:000356817300010"}
