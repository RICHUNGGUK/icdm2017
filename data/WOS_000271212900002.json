In this article, we propose novel update-conscious compilation (UCC) techniques to achieve energy efficiency. By integrating the compilation decisions in generating the old binary, an update-conscious compiler strives to match the old decisions, which improves the binary code similarity, reduces the amount of transmitted data to remote sensors, and thus, consumes less energy. In this article, we develop update-conscious register allocation and data layout algorithms. Our experimental results show great improvements over the traditional, update-oblivious approaches.", "paper_title": "Towards Update-Conscious Compilation for Energy-Efficient Code Dissemination in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000271212900002"}
