New contracts requirements differ from previous ones. Challenging the method of proposal offering in design-construct contracts. this paper seeks solutions for more rational proposing of project uncertainties. The problem commences with the question \"which duration and price a contractor must propose in a project with design-construct contract?\" A part of the answer to this question is the matter of the lowest-risk limit of uncertainties which result from output of Monte Carlo Simulation and its analysis. The output of this analysis is a series of intervals named \"safety Intervals\" which will be contractors' guide in offering the bid proposal. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
