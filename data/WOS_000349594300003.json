This constructive approach provides a unifying framework for univariate/bivariate primal and dual subdivision schemes with tension parameter and allows us to show that several existing subdivision algorithms, proposed in the literature via isolated constructions, can be obtained as specific instances of the proposed strategy. Moreover, this novel approach provides an intuitive theoretical tool for the derivation of new non-tensor product subdivision schemes that in the regular regions satisfy the property of reproducing bivariate cubic polynomials, thus resulting the natural extension of the univariate family presented in Hormann and Sabin (2008).
