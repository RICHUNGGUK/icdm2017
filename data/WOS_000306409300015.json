Based on normalised coprime factor model (NCFM) representations, a frequency-domain perturbed NCFM for an EIVM is derived according to a geometrical explanation for the v-gap metric. As a result, identification of the EIVM is converted into that of the NCFM. Besides an identified nominal NCFM, its worst case error has to be quantified. Unlike other traditional control-oriented identification methods, the v-gap metric is employed to measure the uncertainties including a priori information on the disturbing noises and the worst case error for the resulting nominal NCFM. Since this metric is also used as an optimisation criterion, the associate parameter estimation problem can be effectively solved by linear matrix inequalities. Finally, a numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust control oriented identification of errors-in-variables models based on normalised coprime factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000306409300015"}
