WIDE aims to deliver popular information services to registered mobile clients in WLAN hot spots. Data delivery is based on broadcasting and multicasting to provide scalability and efficient use of the wireless channel. Reliability is assured with a combination of Forward Error Correction (FEC), data carousel, and ARQ techniques. This paper presents the proposed system architecture with the details of reliable and secure data dissemination mechanisms. Functional evaluation of the proposed system and mechanisms on the implemented prototype are also included in this paper.", "paper_title": "Itinerant delivery of popular data via WIDE hot spots", "paper_id": "WOS:000237835400017"}
