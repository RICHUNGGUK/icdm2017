In this paper, we formulate the cooperative localization problem in a mobile network as an inference problem on a factor graph. Using a sequential schedule of message updates, a sequential uniformly reweighted sum-product algorithm (SURW-SPA) is developed for mobile localization problems. The proposed algorithm combines the distributed nature of belief propagation (BP) with the improved performance of sequential tree-reweighted message passing (TRW-S) algorithm. We apply the SURW-SPA to cooperative localization in both static and mobile networks, and evaluate its performance in terms of localization accuracy and convergence speed.", "paper_title": "Sequential Uniformly Reweighted Sum-Product Algorithm for Cooperative Localization in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340794600001"}
