We first give an algebraic characterization of abelian codes in any group algebra and provide some general results. For abelian codes in a PIGA, which can be viewed as cyclic codes over a semisimple group algebra, it is shown that every abelian code in a PIGA admits generator and check elements. These are analogous to the generator and parity-check polynomials of cyclic codes. A characterization and an enumeration of Euclidean self-dual and Euclidean self-orthogonal abelian codes in a PIGA are given, which generalize recent analogous results for self-dual cyclic codes. In addition, the structures of reversible and complementary dual abelian codes in a PIGA are established, again extending results on reversible and complementary dual cyclic codes. Finally, asymptotic properties of abelian codes in a PIGA are studied. An upper bound for the minimum distance of abelian codes in a non-semisimple PIGA is given in terms of the minimum distance of abelian codes in semisimple group algebras. Abelian codes in a non-semisimple PIGA are then shown to be asymptotically bad, similar to the case of repeated-root cyclic codes.", "paper_title": "Abelian Codes in Principal Ideal Group Algebras", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500029"}
