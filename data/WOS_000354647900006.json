Higher web site traffic could represent effective information disclosure and higher investor recognition. Both may reduce the risk of firm by reducing the level of information asymmetry and facilitating a more complete market by reaching to more potential investors. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the impact of firm web site traffic to the risk of firm. Design/methodology/approach - The authors conducted a cross-sectional study on the risk and firm web site traffic data of 4,122 US public firms. Findings - After controlling for confounding factors, web site traffic is significantly negatively associated with three firm risk measures: cost of equity, return volatility, and analyst forecast dispersion. Originality/value - The results provide new insights to the economic impact of web site traffic. Compared with previous studies that mostly investigated the relationships between web site traffic and firm performance measured by stock returns or company profitability, the authors documented empirical evidence that web site traffic influences the risk of firm through the level of information asymmetry and investor recognition. This paper suggests that when valuing a firm, investors would take web site traffic into consideration. Firm managers could use firm Websites as a channel to reduce information asymmetry, and increase investor recognition that can contribute to the firm's value through reduced risk.", "paper_title": "Firm websites and the risk of firm", "paper_id": "WOS:000354647900006"}
