The activation functions are assumed to be globally Lipschitz continuous. For the robust stabilization problem, a state feedback controller is designed to ensure global robust stability of the closed-loop system about its equilibrium point for all admissible uncertainties, while for the robust H-infinity control problem attention is focused on the design of a state feedback controller Such that in addition to the requirement of the global robust stability, a prescribed H-infinity performance level for all delays to satisfy both the lower bound and upper bound of the interval time-varying delay is also required to be achieved. A linear matrix inequality approach is developed to solve these problems. It is shown that the desired state feedback controller can be constructed by solving certain LMIs. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "DELAY-DEPENDENT H-infinity CONTROL FOR DISCRETE-TIME UNCERTAIN RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS WITH INTRERVAL TIME-VARYING DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100019"}
