The parallel simulation engine offers cycle-accurate as well as periodic synchronization; while preserving functional accuracy, this permits tradeoffs between perfect timing accuracy and high speed with very good accuracy. When run on six separate physical cores on a single die, speedups can exceed a factor of over 5, and when run on a two-die 12-core system with 2-way hyperthreading, speedups exceed 12x. Most hardware parameters are configurable, including memory hierarchy, interconnect geometry, bandwidth, crossbar dimensions, parameters driving power, and thermal effects. A highly parametrized table-based NoC design allows a variety of routing and virtual channel allocation algorithms out of the box, ranging from simple dimension-ordered routing to complex Valiant, ROMM, O1Turn or PROM schemes, BSOR, and adaptive routing. HORNET can run in network-only mode using synthetic traffic or traces, or directly emulate a MIPS-based multicore.
