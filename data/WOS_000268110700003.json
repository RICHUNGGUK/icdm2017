In this paper We present a travel approach to choreographing motions by live performance captured With degree of freedom (3-DOF) accelerometers. The process be gins by placing tire accelerometers air tire riser's limbs according to tire pre-specified positions. Tire computer then recognizes tire performed actions using Hidden Markov Model (HMM), Which is pre-trained by the acceleration data samples automatically generated from a pre-segmented motion capture database. At last, the captured actions are further synthesized with motion retiming and exaggeration based on tire acceleration signals from the accelerometers. This method can intuitively rap id-pro to type the choreographed motions for pre-production of animation, the avatar control in virtual reality and game-like scenarios, etc. The experimental results show that it can effectively recognize actions with spatial-time variance, and is easy-to-use especially for a novice with little experience.
