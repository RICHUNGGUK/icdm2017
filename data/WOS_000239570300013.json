This is accomplished by a bidirectional key distribution scheme based on Forward Key Setup and Backward Key Setup developed by using synchronized broadcast and multi-level key concept. Our protocol, called SPDA(Security Protocol for Data Aggregation) is well suited for any data aggregation algorithms and applications. Our analysis results prove SPDA's efficiency meaning that its communication cost is manageable.", "paper_title": "SPDA: A security protocol for data aggregation in large-scale wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300013"}
