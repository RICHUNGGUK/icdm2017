The problem was initially proposed by the need of sharing common software components among various departments within a same organization. Two significant contributions have been made in this study: (I),in assimilation exchange based software integration approach is proposed; (2) the software integration problem is formulated as a search problem and solved by using a GA. A case study is based on an on-going software integration project carried out in the Derbyshire Fire Rescue Service, and used to illustrate the application of the approach. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
