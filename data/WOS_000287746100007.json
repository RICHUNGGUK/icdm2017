(J. ACM 54(3):11, 2007). The algorithms draw a random sample from the input, solve a certain subproblem on the random sample, and augment the solution for the subproblem to a solution for the original problem. We give a general framework that allows us to derandomize most Sample-Augment algorithms, i.e. to specify a specific sample for which the cost of the solution created by the Sample-Augment algorithm is at most a constant factor away from optimal. Our approach allows us to give deterministic versions of the Sample-Augment algorithms for the connected facility location problem, in which the open facilities need to be connected by either a tree or a tour, the virtual private network design problem, 2-stage rooted stochastic Steiner tree problem with independent decisions, the a priori traveling salesman problem and the single sink buy-at-bulk problem. This partially answers an open question posed in Gupta et al. (J. ACM 54(3):11, 2007).", "paper_title": "Deterministic Sampling Algorithms for Network Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000287746100007"}
