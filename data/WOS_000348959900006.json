We then present a TCTL model checking algorithm for the pointwise case. An important consequence of our results is that they together describe a sound and complete TCTL model checking procedure for time-robust real-time rewrite theories also for dense time domains. We have implemented such a TCTL model checker for Real-Time Maude. Our model checker provides for free a sound and complete TCTL model checker for subsets of modeling languages, such as Ptolemy II and (Synchronous) AADL, which have Real-Time Maude analysis integrated into their tool environments.
