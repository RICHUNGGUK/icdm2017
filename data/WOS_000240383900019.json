The deployment of DVR in everyday clinical work, however, has so far been limited. One contributing factor is that current Transfer Function (TF) models can encode only a small fraction of the user's domain knowledge. In this paper, we use histograms of local neighborhoods to capture tissue characteristics. This allows domain knowledge on spatial relations in the data set to be integrated into the TF. As a first example, we introduce Partial Range Histograms in an automatic tissue detection scheme and present its effectiveness in a clinical evaluation. We then use local histogram analysis to perform a classification where the tissue-type certainty is treated as a second TF dimension. The result is an enhanced rendering where tissues with overlapping intensity ranges can be discerned without requiring the user to explicitly define a complex, multidimensional TF.", "paper_title": "Local histograms for design of transfer functions in direct volume rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383900019"}
