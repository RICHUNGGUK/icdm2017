A preliminary class of 140 druglike, small-molecule matrix metalloproteinase-3 inhibitors, intended as starting scaffolds for optimization and synthesis, has been designed in silico using a series of highly predictive three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship models, including comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis, with docking and scoring. Thalidomide was chosen as the skeleton on which to base the new lead series, as it moderately inhibits MMP-3, is antiangiogenic, and lends itself easily to structural modifications. Most of the new compounds demonstrate medium to high predicted biological activity and good bioavailability as estimated by the octanol-water partition coefficient ClogP. Compound 102 in particular exhibits extremely favorable predicted activity against MMP-3; is moderately bioavailable; satisfies Lipinski's Rule of Five; and shows promise for further optimization, synthesis, and experimental evaluation as a potential adjunct anticancer or antirheumatic therapeutic.", "paper_title": "A preliminary in silico lead series of 2-phthalimidinoglutaric acid analogues designed as MMP-3 inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000240701700026"}
