On the other hand, by the advance of the Internet, the demand for multimedia communication services which include video and voice will be expected to grow. Therefore, in the future, the mechanism of QoS guarantee must be realized even in wireless LAN environment. So far, IEEE 802.11e EDCF has been proposed, which is a contention based channel access method to achieve the QoS guarantee in wireless LAN. However, this cannot realize the desired throughput ratio or deterministic target throughput in principle. In this paper, we expand the EDCF to solve such QoS issues and enable more flexible QoS control. Moreover, we show the effectiveness of our proposal by computer simulation.", "paper_title": "Proportional and deterministic differentiation methods of multi-class QoS in IEEE 802.11e wireless LAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300004"}
