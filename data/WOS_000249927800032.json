However, it may not be possible to entirely eliminate the uncertainties in congestion prediction. To address these uncertainties, we propose Probabilistic Early Response TCP (PERT). PERT emulates the behavior of AQM/ECN, in the congestion response function of end-hosts. We present fluid-flow analysis of PERT/RED and PERT/PI, versions of PERT that emulate router-based RED and PI controllers. Our analysis shows that PERT/RED has better stability behavior than router-based RED. We also present results from ns-2 simulations to show the practical feasibility of PERT. The scheme presented here is general and can be used for emulating other AQM algorithms.", "paper_title": "Emulating AQM from end hosts", "paper_id": "WOS:000249927800032"}
