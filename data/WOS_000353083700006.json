The setting is based on a sequence of weights gamma(j) > 0 and sequences 1 + gamma(j)k and 1 + l(gamma J) of reproducing kernels k such that H(1 + gamma(j)k) = H(1 + l(gamma J)), in particular. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the norms on circle times(s)(j=1) H(1 + gamma(j)k) and H(1 + l(gamma J)) to be equivalent uniformly in s. Furthermore, we study relaxed versions of uniform equivalence by modifying the sequence of weights, e.g., by constant factors, and by analyzing embeddings of the respective spaces. Likewise, we analyze the limiting case s = infinity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
