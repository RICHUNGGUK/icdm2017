IoT comprises billions of Internet-connected devices (ICDs) or \"things,\" each of which can sense, communicate, compute, and potentially actuate, and can have intelligence, multimodal interfaces, physical/virtual identities, and attributes. ICDs can be sensors, RFIDs, social media, clickstreams, business transactions, actuators (such as machines/equipment fitted with sensors and deployed for mining, oil exploration, or manufacturing operations), lab instruments (such as a high energy physics synchrotron), and smart consumer appliances (TV, phone, and so on).", "paper_title": "Processing Distributed Internet of Things Data in Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000366897800014"}
