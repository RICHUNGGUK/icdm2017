Choquet, Theory of capacities, Annales de l'institut Fourier 5 (1953) 131-295]. In this paper, we use the Choquet integral to propose some intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators. The operators not only consider the importance of the elements or their ordered positions, but also can reflect the correlations among the elements or their ordered positions. It is worth pointing out that most of the existing intuitionistic fuzzy aggregation operators are special cases of our operators. Moreover, we propose the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy correlated averaging operator and the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy correlated geometric operator to aggregate interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy information, and apply them to a practical decision-making problem involving the prioritization of information technology improvement projects.
