The theoretical considerations are based on the Quattor framework configuration model. We also present some experimental results. Quattor is a framework for managing large scale computing fabrics. It is a result of developments of the Fabric Management Work Package of the European DataGrid project. Our experience on using the Quattor framework in the DataGrid test-bed and the CERN Computing Centre shows that the ability of proper configuration and management of a computing fabric is essential for having a working grid.", "paper_title": "A framework for managing large scale computing fabrics and its computational complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100035"}
