The new computation algorithm upgrades the validation power by including a direct correlation test between residuals and delayed outputs that have been quoted indirectly in the most previous approaches. Furthermore, based on the new validation procedure, three guidelines are proposed in this study to help explain the validation results and the statistic properties of the residuals. It is hoped that this study could promote awareness of why the correlation tests are an effective method of validating identified neural networks, and provide examples how to use the tests in user applications.", "paper_title": "A Correlation-Test-Based Validation Procedure for Identified Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429700001"}
