In this method, a novel description of the nonlinear part of the system, i.e., backlash, is developed. In this case, the nonlinear system is decomposed into a piecewise linearized model. Then, a modified recursive general identification algorithm (MRGIA) is employed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model. Furthermore, the convergence of the MRGIA for the pseudo-Wiener system with backlash is analysed. Finally, a numerical example is presented.", "paper_title": "RECURSIVE IDENTIFICATION ALGORITHM FOR DYNAMIC SYSTEMS WITH OUTPUT BACKLASH AND ITS CONVERGENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000273235100010"}
