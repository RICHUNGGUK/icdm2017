However, sustained performance is limited owing to restriction on memory bandwidth, especially on multicore microprocessors and graphics processing units (GPUs) because of their small operational intensity. In this paper, we present a custom computing machine (CCM), called a scalable streaming-array (SSA), for high-performance stencil computations with multiple field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs). We design SSA based on a domain-specific programmable concept, where CCMs are programmable with the minimum functionality required for an algorithm domain. We employ a deep pipelining approach over successive iterations to achieve linear scalability for multiple devices with a constant memory bandwidth. Prototype implementation using nine FPGAs demonstrates good agreement with a performance model, and achieves 260 and 236 GFlop/s for 2D and 3D Jacobi computation, which are 87.4 and 83.9 percent of the peak, respectively, with a memory bandwidth of only 2.0 GB/s. We also evaluate the performance of SSA for state-of-the-art FPGAs.", "paper_title": "Multi-FPGA Accelerator for Scalable Stencil Computation with Constant Memory Bandwidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000334672200017"}
