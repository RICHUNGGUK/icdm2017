The proposed notation gives added power to GOMS to model and evaluate the task completion time of parallel actions during the performance of a task, something that was previously only possible using CPM-GOMS, which is far more complicated to use. Codein's evaluative power is verified through an experiment. The first condition of the experiment compares the completion time predicted by a GOMSL model, a Codein model, and the actual completion time of participants in a direct manipulation task. The second compares the completion time of participants in a Tangible User Interface task with predictions by a GOMSL model and a Codein model. Predicted task times by Codein in both conditions come close to the actual experimental results.", "paper_title": "Codein-A New Notation for GOMS to Handle Evaluations of Reality-Based Interaction Style Interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000301841200004"}
