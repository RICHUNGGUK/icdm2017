Under reasonable assumptions, the global convergence, the locally linear and superlinear convergence of the proposed algorithm are developed, respectively. It is well known that in applying trust-region algorithms, the basic issue is how to solve the trust-region subproblem efficiently. To deal with the issue, an approximate solution method is developed in this paper. Note that the approximate solution method not only is computationally cheap, but also preserves the strong convergence properties as the exact solution methods. Numerical results are shown for a number of test problems from the literature.", "paper_title": "A nonmonotone quasi-Newton trust-region method of conic model for unconstrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000265975500003"}
