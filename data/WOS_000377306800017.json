These benefits depend on efficiently solving several technical problems, among which resource allocation that shares spectrum resources between cellular users and D2D pairs is critically challenging. We propose a social-aware D2D resource sharing scheme that exploits social network properties of community and centrality for the new system design paradigm. Extensive simulations with realistic network settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme, which significantly improves the system performance compared to the existing schemes.", "paper_title": "Social-Aware Resource Allocation for Device-to-Device Communications Underlaying Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800017"}
