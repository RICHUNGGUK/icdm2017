In the new approach, modification of the sequence and omission of test vectors from it are tightly coupled by focusing both subprocedures on subsequences of limited lengths. In a new process that is referred to as folding, a subsequence is partitioned into two halves, and the goal of the modification is to ensure that the two halves are as similar as possible. With similar halves, the expectation is that it will be possible to omit test vectors from the subsequence. Experimental results demonstrate that the procedure produces extremely short functional test sequences for benchmark circuits.", "paper_title": "FOLD: Extreme Static Test Compaction by Folding of Functional Test Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000362344900011"}
