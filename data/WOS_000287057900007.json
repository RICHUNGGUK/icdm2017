In this study a numerical scheme has been proposed to prevent the generation of the gravity wave decoupling. The proposed numerical method provides efficient communication between decoupled gravity wave finite-difference solutions by a simple averaging of a term in the height tendency in the continuity equation. The proposed method is tested using a shallow water sink model developed for the purpose of this study. It has been demonstrated that this method outperforms other existing approaches. The new scheme is time efficient, based on explicit time integration and can be easily implemented. The proposed method is applicable in hydrodynamic models specified on semi-staggered B or E grids.
