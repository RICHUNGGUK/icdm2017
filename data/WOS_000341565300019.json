We also propose a virtual input pin technique to improve leakage reduction and use path sensitization to reduce area overhead. Simulation results show that combining these techniques can achieve >51.18% delay improvement and 63.34% leakage power improvement with only 2.31% area overhead.", "paper_title": "NBTI and Leakage Reduction Using ILP-Based Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000341565300019"}
