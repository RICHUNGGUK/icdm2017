However, the traditional RPN methodology has been criticized to have several shortcomings. These shortcomings are addressed in this paper. Therefore, an efficient and simplified algorithm to evaluate the risk of failure is needed. This paper proposes a new approach, which utilizes the intuitionistic fuzzy set ranking technique for reprioritization of failures in a system FMECA. The proposed approach has two major advantages: (1) it resolves some of the shortcomings of the traditional RPN method, and (2) it provides an evaluation of the redundancy place, which can assist the designer in making correct decisions to make a safer and more reliable product design. In numerical verification, an FMECA of a silane supply system is presented as a numerical example. After comparing results from the proposed method and two other approaches, this research found that the proposed approach can reduce more duplicate RPN numbers and get a more accurate, reasonable risk ranking.", "paper_title": "Reprioritization of failures in a silane supply system using an intuitionistic fuzzy set ranking technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000270883200010"}
