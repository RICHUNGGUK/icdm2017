Although the nPSI problem has already some solutions, they become inefficient in the real-life applications, especially when they run over multiple dynamic datasets whose elements are frequently updated. This motivates our work to circumvent this problem and obtain a practically meaningful result. To this end, we extend Agrawal et al.'s 2-party protocol to an nPSI protocol without compromising its practical efficiency. We provide the complexity to show that our construction efficiently runs over dynamic datasets.", "paper_title": "A Generalization of Agrawal et al.'s Protocol for N-Party Private Set Intersection over Dynamic Datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000312045300006"}
