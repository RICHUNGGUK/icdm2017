Ridgelet packets provide many orthonormal bases that can effectively capture directional features present in pattern images. The Fourier transform is good at eliminating the orientation differences. By combining these two tools, very efficient rotation invariant pattern recognition techniques are created. Experimental results show that the proposed methods achieve very high classification rates and they outperform other state-of-the-art methods for rotation invariant pattern recognition under both noise-free and noisy environments.", "paper_title": "INVARIANT PATTERN RECOGNITION USING RIDGELET PACKETS AND THE FOURIER TRANSFORM", "paper_id": "WOS:000264633400005"}
