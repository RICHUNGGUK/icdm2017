(2003) for references on subresultants). As pointed out by Sylvester, the two notions are very closely related: Sylvester double sums and subresultants are equal up to a multiplicative non-zero constant in the ground field. Two proofs are already known: that of Lascoux and Pragacz (2003), using Schur functions, and that of d'Andrea et al. (2007), using manipulations of matrices. The purpose of this paper is to give a new simple proof using similar inductive properties of double sums and subresultants. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
