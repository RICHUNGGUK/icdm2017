The reconstruction of any cell that contains three materials is iterative: the approach is to locate a point of intersection between two interfaces that minimizes a given error expression. The advantages and limitations of the algorithm are presented via a series of advection tests that demonstrate that triple points can be reconstructed and advected just as well as simpler interfaces in typical applications.
