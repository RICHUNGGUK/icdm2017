In this paper, a novel data model called multi-dimensional concept lattice is proposed and, based on which, a new incremental multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining algorithm is developed. The proposed algorithm integrates sequential pattern mining and association pattern mining with a uniform data structure and makes the mining process more efficient. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on both synthetic and real-life financial date sets.", "paper_title": "Multi-dimensional sequential pattern mining based on concept lattice", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200077"}
