In this paper, we demonstrate that given a constant number of nodes, how distribution of nodes affects the lifetime. For this purpose, we first show that in a network with cluster-based routing protocol, nodes do not have equal importance, and their importance depends on their location, and we determine the most critical regions. We prove that the uniform distribution of nodes is not a good distribution. Finally, we propose a solution for the best distribution that concentrates the population of nodes on critical areas. Simulation results of our proposed distribution show a remarkable increase in network lifetime.", "paper_title": "The Role of Nodes Distribution in Extending the Lifetime of Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000298493200001"}
