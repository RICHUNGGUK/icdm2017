Their industrial uptake is however still compromised by the low level of trust on their performance and dependability. Whereas analytical models represent a valid mean to assess nonfunctional properties via simulation, their wide use is still limited by the complexity and dynamicity of WSNs, which lead to unaffordable modeling costs. To reduce this gap between research achievements and industrial development, this paper presents a framework for the assessment of WSNs based on the automated generation of analytical models. The framework hides modeling details, and it allows designers to focus on simulation results to drive their design choices. Models are generated starting from a high-level specification of the system and by a preliminary characterization of its fault-free behavior, using behavioral simulators. The benefits of the framework are shown in the context of two case studies, based on the wireless monitoring of civil structures.", "paper_title": "Automated Generation of Performance and Dependability Models for the Assessment of Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303165900010"}
