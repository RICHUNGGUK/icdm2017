We fully characterize the class of continuous t-norms on L(1) which satisfy the residuation principle, which are a natural extension of a t-norm on the unit interval and which are weakly Archimedean. We construct a separate representation for the t-norms in this class which are weakly nilpotent and for those which are not weakly nilpotent. Finally we give a characterization of the continuous t-norms on L(1) which satisfy the residuation principle, which are a natural extension of a t-norm on the unit interval and which are strict.
