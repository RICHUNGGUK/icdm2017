In this paper, a variable duration motion texture is proposed to represent complex human motion that is statistically similar to the original captured motion data. The motion texture is defined as a three-level structure with moton abstracts, motons and their distribution. The motion texture is modeled by a Semi-SLDS (Semi-Switching Linear Dynamic System), which provides an intuitive framework for describing the continuous but nonlinear dynamics of human motion. To explicitly incorporate duration modeling capability, the Semi-SLDS is adopted to improve SLDS by replacing the Markov switching layer with semi-Markov model. In addition, the proposed approach is proved flexible and effective by several motion applications, namely motion synthesis, motion recognition and motion compression.", "paper_title": "Variable duration motion texture for human motion modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500064"}
