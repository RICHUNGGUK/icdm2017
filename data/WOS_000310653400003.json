We consider a network including two types of sensors with different computational processing abilities: type-I sensors with more powerful ability than type-II sensors. Based on this computational heterogeneity, we present an estimator model for distributed sensor fusion in HWSNs and propose a sensor deployment scheme supporting the proposed distributed estimation. It is discovered that the network topology is closely related to the properties of the estimation algorithm. To satisfy the performance of the estimation algorithm, two sensor deployment algorithms are given. The first is concerned with the connectivity of network topology and the second illustrates a greedy approach to further optimize the network topology and the parameters of the estimators. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed estimators and sensor deployment algorithms for distributed estimation in HWSNs.", "paper_title": "Sensor Deployment for Distributed Estimation in Heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310653400003"}
