The result is a variety of agent-oriented programming languages, development frameworks, execution platforms, and tools that facilitate building and engineering of multi-agent systems. This paper provides an overview of the multi-agent programming research field and explains the aim and characteristics of various multi-agent programming languages and development frameworks. This overview is complemented with a discussion on the current trends and challenges in this research community.", "paper_title": "Programming multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000361136900003"}
