The statistical parameters of R-2 and root-mean-square error are 0.82 and 0.21, respectively using this method. These parameters show a considerable improvement compared to the stepwise multiple linear regression combined with ANN (stepwise MLR-ANN). Ten-fold shuffling crossvalidations are carried out to select the most important descriptors. Five descriptors of index of Balaban (J), average molecular weight (AMW), 3D-Wiener index (W3D), mean atomic van der Waals volume (Sv), and total charge (Q(total)) appear in most of the models. The results of GA-ANN are superior compared with those of GA-MLR and GA-PLS, which indicate that the inhibition behavior has nonlinear characteristics. The ability of GA-ANN model in predicting inhibition behavior of 1-phenylbenzimidazoles [log(1/IC50)] and its robustness is illustrated by validation techniques of leave-one-out and leave-multiple-out crossvalidations and also by Y-randomization technique.", "paper_title": "QSAR analysis of platelet-derived growth inhibitors using GA-ANN and shuffling crossvalidation", "paper_id": "WOS:000257477000008"}
