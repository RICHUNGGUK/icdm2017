In some cases this change is purposeful and deliberate, but in others an intriguing socio-technical drift is at work, and the influences over that drift are yet to be understood. Here, we surface four interrelated dimensions along which transformation is occurring (technology, context, users and purposes), and we commence a discussion aiming to articulate both the visible and the unremarked upon influences over that drift.", "paper_title": "Pervasive computing in the domestic space", "paper_id": "WOS:000247851200001"}
