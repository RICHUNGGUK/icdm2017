First, considering that the resolution of index objective weights derived from entropy weighting method is not high, a normalized decision matrix method based on adjusting coefficient was proposed, and the optimizing entropy model was established to determine the index objective weights. Furthermore, the mean area method was applied to convert index subjective weights into real number, and the D-S (Dempster-Shafer) combination rule was utilized to integrate the subjective and objective weights into comprehensive weights. Finally, the optimizing solution was determined via the size of positive target distance. An example is presented to illustrate the suitability and effectiveness of the obtained methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-index grey target decision method based on adjustment coefficient", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100028"}
