The first scheme uses a penalization strategy, and the second a Lagrange multiplier, to approximate and enforce the sphere constraint, respectively. Both schemes are applied to color image inpainting in the chromaticity and brightness color model and are also compared to inpainting with the standard Mumford-Shah functional, as well as channelwise red-green-blue inpainting.", "paper_title": "Mumford-Shah-Euler Flow with Sphere Constraint and Applications to Color Image Inpainting", "paper_id": "WOS:000298370600009"}
