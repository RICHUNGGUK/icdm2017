However this is not a guarantee for discovering all the subproblems that compose the structure of a given software problem. Moreover, a rigorous application of the technique requires a previous consensus about the meaning of I. Jacobson's statement \"a use case must give a measurable value to a particular actor\" (The Rational Edge, March 2003). This paper proposes a particular characterisation of the concept of \"value\" with the purpose of problem structuring. To this aim we base on the catalogue of frames for real software problems proposed by M. Jackson (Problem Frames, 2001) and we reason about what could be valuable for the user on each problem class. We illustrate our technique with the analysis of a web auction problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
