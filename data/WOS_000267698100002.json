The proposed algorithm allows a flexible selection of the helical pitch, which is useful for clinical applications. Our idea is an extension of the one proposed by Kohler, Bontus, and Koken (2006). It is based on optimizing the contribution weights of convolution families used in exact Katsevich 3PI algorithms, so that the total weight of each Radon plane is as close to 1 as possible. Optimization is based on solving a least squares problem subject to linear constrains. Numerical evaluation shows good noise and artifact reduction properties of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Optimized Reconstruction Algorithm for Helical CT With Fractional Pitch Between 1PI and 3PI", "paper_id": "WOS:000267698100002"}
