R. J. Ostergard and O. Pottonen, \"The perfect binary one-error-correcting codes of length 15: Part I-Classification,\" IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory vol. 55, pp. 4657-4660, 2009]. In the current accompanying work, the classified codes are studied in great detail, and their main properties are tabulated. The results include the fact that 33 of the 80 Steiner triple systems of order 15 occur in such codes. Further understanding is gained on full-rank codes via switching, as it turns out that all but two full-rank codes can be obtained through a series of such transformations from the Hamming code. Other topics studied include (non) systematic codes, embedded one-error-correcting codes, and defining sets of codes. A classification of certain mixed perfect codes is also obtained.", "paper_title": "The Perfect Binary One-Error-Correcting Codes of Length 15: Part II-Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000277880200006"}
