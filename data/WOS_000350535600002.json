To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work investigating the use of metaheuristic algorithms for solving this challenging combinatorial optimization problem in the case of general graphs. In this paper a new carefully devised Tabu Search algorithm, called TSCB, for finding near-optimal solutions for the CB problem is proposed. Different possibilities for its key components and input parameter values were carefully analyzed and tuned, in order to find the combination of them offering the best quality solutions to the problem at a reasonable computational effort. Extensive experimentation was carried out, using 113 standard benchmark instances, for assessing its performance with respect to a Simulated Annealing (SA(CB)) implementation. The experimental results show that there exists a statistically significant performance amelioration achieved by TSCB with respect to SA(CB) in 90 out of 113 graphs (79.646%). It was also found that our TSCB algorithm attains 56 optimal solutions and establishes new better upper bounds for the other 57 instances. Furthermore, these competitive results were obtained expending reasonable computational times. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
