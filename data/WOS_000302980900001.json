Drawing on chaos theory and the literature on knowledge management, we contrasted the information and knowledge sharing contexts. More specifically, we have provided a real-world case study of knowledge management practice at a U.S. Fortune 40 firm. We reviewed the major issues in this firm's downstream supply chain operations and have described its knowledge management initiative. Finally, we discuss the implications of knowledge management on managerial practice. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
