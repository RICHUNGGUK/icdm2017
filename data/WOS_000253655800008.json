A variable can be replaced with arbitrary edge-labeled rooted ordered trees. We consider the polynomial time learnability of finite unions of linear term trees in the exact learning model formalized by Angluin. The language L(t) of a linear term tree t is the set of all trees obtained from t by substituting arbitrary edge-labeled rooted ordered trees for all variables in t. Moreover, for a finite set S of linear term trees, we define L(S) = boolean OR(t is an element of S) L(t). A target of learning, denoted by T-*, is a finite set of linear term trees, where the number of edge labels is infinite. In this paper, for any set T-* of m linear term trees (m >= 0), we present a query learning algorithm which exactly identifies T-* in polynomial time using at most 2mn(2) Restricted Subset queries and at most m + 1 Equivalence queries, where n is the maximum size of counterexamples. Finally, we note that finite sets of linear term trees are not learnable in polynomial time using Restricted Equivalence, Membership and Subset queries.", "paper_title": "Learning of finite unions of tree patterns with internal structured variables from queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000253655800008"}
