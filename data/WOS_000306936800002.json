On the one hand, the specification formalism is general enough to include models like weighted modal transition systems and allows system developers to employ more complex label refinement than in previously studied theories. On the other hand, the formalism maintains the desirable properties required by any specification theory supporting compositional reasoning. In particular, we study modal and thorough refinement, determinisation, parallel composition, conjunction, quotient and logical characterisation of label-structured modal transition systems.", "paper_title": "Extending modal transition systems with structured labels", "paper_id": "WOS:000306936800002"}
