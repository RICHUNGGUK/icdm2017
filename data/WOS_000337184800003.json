Biped dynamics and platform kinematics are utilised. The effects of agonist-antagonist muscular co-activation and joint stiffness are formulated. The implementation of the necessary counter-manoeuvres for maintaining balance and postural stability is studied. A control strategy, applicable to large systems, is formulated. The biped manoeuvres and transitions terminate in pre-specified intervals of time. Gravity is included and compensated for. Certain voluntary and postural adjustment strategies are the same but are initiated differently. Further experimental/computational research may identify the central nervous system and sensory paths that lead to the CPG. All actuator forces linearly evolve in time from their original values to their terminal values. There are no central continuous feedback loops present. Monitoring and sensing, however, are ongoing. The counter-manoeuvres are based on learned human-like voluntary movements that are triggered by the disturbance. The required central inputs to the musculoskeletal system are designed in the CPG. A functional structure for the CPG is proposed. The effect of certain disorders and malfunctions of the CPG are studied by simulation.", "paper_title": "A model of the basal ganglia in voluntary movement and postural reactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000337184800003"}
