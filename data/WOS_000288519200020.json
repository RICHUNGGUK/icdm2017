The full satisfaction of all of these requirements and goals may not be possible, requiring decisions over conflicting human interests as well as technological alternatives, with an impact on the quality and cost of the final solution. This work aims at assessing the suitability of multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) methods to support software engineers' decisions. To fulfil this aim, a HAM ( Hybrid Assessment Method) is proposed, which gives its user the ability to perceive the influence different decisions may have on the final result. HAM is a simple and efficient method that combines one single pairwise comparison decision matrix (to determine the weights of criteria) with one classical weighted decision matrix (to prioritize the alternatives). To avoid consistency problems regarding the scale and the prioritization method. HAM uses a geometric scale for assessing the criteria and the geometric mean for determining the altemative ratings.
