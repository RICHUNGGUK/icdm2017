Managing such schema diversity promotes and enables communication and collaboration within these federations. This paper presents a process, model and algorithms to manage the lifecycle, refinement and dynamic combination of semantic mappings using federation context and automated correspondence pattern recognition for complex mappings. Related work is surveyed, key requirements are derived and the system is evaluated through prototyping and experimental results for semi-automated generation of executable groundings for complex mappings.", "paper_title": "Managed Semantic Interoperability for Federations", "paper_id": "WOS:000336802700002"}
