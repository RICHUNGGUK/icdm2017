Even with recent advances in biometrics, information forensics and security, vulnerability of facial biometric systems against spoofing attacks is still an open problem. Even though several methods have been proposed for photo-based spoofing attack detection, attacks performed with videos have been vastly overlooked, which hinders the use of the facial biometric systems in modern applications. In this paper, we present an algorithm for video-based spoofing attack detection through the analysis of global information which is invariant to content, since we discard video contents and analyze content-independent noise signatures present in the video related to the unique acquisition processes. Our approach takes advantage of noise signatures generated by the recaptured video to distinguish between fake and valid access videos. For that, we use the Fourier spectrum followed by the computation of video visual rhythms and the extraction of different characterization methods. For evaluation, we consider the novel unicamp video-attack database, which comprises 17 076 videos composed of real access and spoofing attack videos. In addition, we evaluate the proposed method using the replay-attack database, which contains photo-based and video-based face spoofing attacks.", "paper_title": "Using Visual Rhythms for Detecting Video-Based Facial Spoof Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352534300011"}
