It has been seen that the variations between the images of a person, under varying pose, facial expressions, illumination, etc., are quite high. Therefore, in face recognition problem to achieve high recognition rate, it is necessary to consider the structural information lying within these images in the classification process. In the present study, it has been realized by modeling each of the training images as a hidden layer neuron in the proposed RBFNN. Now, to classify a facial image, a confidence measure has been imposed on the outputs of the hidden layer neurons to reduce the influences of the images belonging to other classes. This process makes the RBFNN as self-adaptive for choosing a subset of the hidden layer neurons, which are in close neighborhood of the input image, to be considered for classifying the input image. The process reduces the computation time at the output layer of the RBFNN by neglecting the ineffective radial basis functions and makes the proposed method to recognize face images in high speed and also in interframe period of video. The performance of the proposed method has been evaluated on the basis of sensitivity and specificity on two popular face recognition databases, the ORL and the UMIST face databases. On the ORL database, the best average sensitivity (recognition) and specificity rates are found to be 97.30 and 99.94%, respectively using five samples per person in the training set. Whereas, on the UMIST database, the above quantities are found to be 96.36 and 99.81%, respectively using eight samples per person in the training set. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms some of the face recognition approaches.", "paper_title": "High-speed face recognition using self-adaptive radial basis function neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649100013"}
