A number of schemes have been proposed for undirected graphs, but the case of directed graphs remains an open problem. At CT-RSA 2007, Yi presented a scheme for directed trees based on RSA and a standard signature scheme. We present a new, conceptually simple, and generic construction from standard signatures only. Apart from not relying on any RSA-related security assumptions, our scheme outperforms that of Yi in both computation time and (worst-case) signature length. Our results indicate that the setting envisaged by Yi is much simpler than the general one of directed transitive signatures, which remains an open problem. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
