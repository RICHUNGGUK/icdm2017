However, no results have yet been presented for neural networks with neutral-type delays. Accordingly, this correspondence investigates the globally asymptotic stability of a class of neutral-type neural networks with delays. This class of systems includes Hopfield neural networks, cellular neural networks, and Cohen-Grossberg neural networks. Based on the Lyapunov stability method, two delay-independent sufficient stability conditions are derived. These stability conditions are easily checked and can be derived from the connection matrix and the network parameters without the requirement for any assumptions regarding the symmetry of the interconnections. Two illustrative examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed stability criteria.", "paper_title": "Globally asymptotic stability of a class of neutral-type neural networks with delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700018"}
