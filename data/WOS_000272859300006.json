Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method is one of the important research tools that carry out dynamic simulation of atomic thin films growth. Based on the method of KMC, this paper proposes an algorithm of the process of GaInP thin film grown by MOCVD. KMC simulation and the visualization emulation of GaInP thin film growth in MOCVD reactor are realized. The results of simulation and visualization truly and intuitively displayed process of GaInP thin film growth in MOCVD reactor. The simulation results with this paper's algorithm well coincide with experimental results. This visualization results provide the optimizations of processing parameters which grow GaInP thin film by MOCVD with theoretical basis. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
