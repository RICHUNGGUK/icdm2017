A technique was developed to apply the image-based flow visualisation (IBFV) algorithm to the raw dataset. Particle image velocimetry software was previously used to capture the flow field data by tracking neutrally buoyant particles with a high-speed camera. The dataset consisted of scattered 2D point velocity vectors and the IBFV visualisation facilitated flow feature characterisation within the GPT. The flow features played a pivotal role in understanding stormwater pollutant capture and retention behaviour within the GPT. It was found that the IBFV animations revealed otherwise unnoticed flow features and experimental artefacts. For example, a circular tracer marker in the IBFV program visually highlighted streamlines to investigate the possible flow paths of pollutants entering the GPT. The investigated flow paths were compared with the behaviour of pollutants monitored during experiments.", "paper_title": "Visualising experimental flow fields through a stormwater gross pollutant trap", "paper_id": "WOS:000330957400003"}
