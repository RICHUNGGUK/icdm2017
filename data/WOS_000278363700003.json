We develop a trimmed variant of Moebius inversion that proceeds point by point, finishing the calculation at a subset before considering its supersets. For an n-element universe U and a family F of its subsets, trimmed Moebius inversion allows us to compute the number of packings, coverings, and partitions of U with k sets from F in time within a polynomial factor (in n) of the number of supersets of the members of F. Relying on an projection theorem of Chung et al. (J. Comb. Theory Ser. A 43:23-37, 1986) to bound the sizes of set families, we apply these ideas to well-studied combinatorial optimisation problems on graphs with maximum degree Delta. In particular, we show how to compute the domatic number in time within a polynomial factor of (2(Delta+1)-2) (n/(Delta+1)) and the chromatic number in time within a polynomial factor of (2(Delta+1)-Delta-1) (n/(Delta+1)). For any constant Delta, these bounds are O((2-epsilon) (n) ) for epsilon > 0 independent of the number of vertices n.", "paper_title": "Trimmed Moebius Inversion and Graphs of Bounded Degree", "paper_id": "WOS:000278363700003"}
