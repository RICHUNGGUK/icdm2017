Some image classification or image retrieval techniques use the distance between histograms as a first step of the classification process. For this reason, some algorithms that find the distance between histograms have been proposed in the literature. Nevertheless, most of this research has been applied on one-dimensional histograms due to the computation of a distance between multi-dimensional histograms is very expensive. In this paper, we present an efficient method to compare multidimensional histograms in O(2z), where z represents the number of bins. Results show a huge reduction of the time consuming with no recognition-ratio reduction.", "paper_title": "An efficient distance between multi-dimensional histograms for comparing images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240075100045"}
