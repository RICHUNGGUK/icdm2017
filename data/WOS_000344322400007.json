We first present a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for the general problem; the algorithm has approximation ratio 2 when and when . In the special case of a family that contains all possible intervals on the given set of points, we show that a 2-approximation algorithm exists, for any . We also provide, in case , a quasipolynomial time algorithm to decide the existence of a -SCF coloring that uses at most colors.", "paper_title": "Strong Conflict-Free Coloring for Intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000344322400007"}
