Since this limits UWB communication range, this paper proposes a novel relay scheme that uses shared frequency repeaters for impulse UWB signal relay to improve System range. After considering possible problems with the repeater, in particular the coupling interference between the input and output and relay-delay, a switching control method is proposed that offers short relay-delay and suppresses the coupling interference at the repeaters. With respect to the proposed relay scheme, Pulse-Position-Modulation (PPM) UWB-based signal relay is evaluated by analyzing its BER performance using the point-to-point transmission link model.", "paper_title": "A short delay relay scheme using shared frequency repeater for UWB impulse radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400021"}
