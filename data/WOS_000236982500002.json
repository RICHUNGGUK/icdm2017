The proposed Ethernet-based WDM network architecture is decentralized and consists of independent regional ring networks with locally deployed video servers. Based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, a network design tool, minimizing the total installation cost for optical network equipment on the metro and the Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) access network, has been developed. Unicast as well as broadcast VoD services are taken into account. The influence of different parameters in our traffic and content models on the network design is studied.", "paper_title": "Design of optical content distribution networks for video on demand services", "paper_id": "WOS:000236982500002"}
