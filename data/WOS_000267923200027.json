Based on the discussion on two parameterizations of alpha S, a method of generating general Alpha Stable random variable is proposed for the standard parameterization. The proposed method overcomes the location error by Chambers's method in the skewed case. In the existing literature, the issue of parameters estimation has been studied. However, little work has been reported on the estimation problem of location parameter mu in the skewed case; such an important parameter has been assumed as zero in most literatures. In this paper, we develop a new technique to estimate mu of alpha S using the deskewed transform and propose an improved estimator for skewness parameter beta by a centered transform. Combined with the estimations of beta and mu in the case of alpha = 1 by Empirical Character Function (ECF) method, finally, a hybrid estimation scheme is proposed. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed hybrid method performs well on a wide region of alpha in estimating beta and mu.", "paper_title": "GENERATOR AND PARAMETERS ESTIMATION FOR IID GENERAL ALPHA STABLE RANDOM SERIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000267923200027"}
