Among them, one of the active topic areas is the mining and prediction of users' mobile commerce behaviors such as their movements and purchase transactions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, called Mobile Commerce Explorer (MCE), for mining and prediction of mobile users' movements and purchase transactions under the context of mobile commerce. The MCE framework consists of three major components: 1) Similarity Inference Model (SIM) for measuring the similarities among stores and items, which are two basic mobile commerce entities considered in this paper; 2) Personal Mobile Commerce Pattern Mine (PMCP-Mine) algorithm for efficient discovery of mobile users' Personal Mobile Commerce Patterns (PMCPs); and 3) Mobile Commerce Behavior Predictor (MCBP) for prediction of possible mobile user behaviors. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that facilitates mining and prediction of mobile users' commerce behaviors in order to recommend stores and items previously unknown to a user. We perform an extensive experimental evaluation by simulation and show that our proposals produce excellent results.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Personal Mobile Commerce Pattern Mining and Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000301746800001"}
