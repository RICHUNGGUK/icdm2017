By constructing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and employing a combination of the free-weighting matrix method, Newton-Leibniz formulation and inequality technique, the controllers are, respectively, designed to achieve the asymptotical and exponential synchronization of the addressed neural networks. The provided conditions are expressed in terms of LMIs, and are dependent on both the discrete and distributed time delays. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness and less conservatism of the obtained conditions. It is noteworthy that the traditional assumptions on the differentiability of the time-varying delays and the boundedness of its derivative are removed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
