One challenge in information retrieval is text classification. Current practices rely heavily on the classical naive Bayes algorithm due to its simplicity and robustness. However, results from this algorithm are not always satisfactory. In this article, the limitations of the naive Bayes algorithm are discussed, and it is found that the assumption on the independence of terms is the main reason for an unsatisfactory classification in many real-world applications. To overcome the limitations, the dependent factors are considered by integrating a term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting algorithm in the naive Bayes classification. Moreover, the TF-IDF algorithm itself is improved so that both frequencies and distribution information are taken into consideration. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, two simulation experiments were conducted, and the comparisons with other classification methods have shown that the proposed method has outperformed other existing algorithms in terms of precision and index recall rate.", "paper_title": "Feature weighted naive Bayes algorithm for information retrieval of enterprise systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000328473200005"}
