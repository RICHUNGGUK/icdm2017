A potential application is memory stacked on logic, providing enhanced throughput, and reduced latency and power consumption. However, testing the TSV interconnects between the two dies is challenging as both memory and logic dies might come from different providers. Currently, no standard exists and the proposed solutions fail to address dynamic and time-critical faults (at speed testing). In addition, memory vendors have not been in favor to put additional design-for-testability structures such as Joint Test Action Group for interconnect testing on their memory devices. This paper proposes a new memory-based interconnect test (MBIT) approach for 3-D memories stacked on logic (e.g., CPUs). A structural approach is used to develop fault models, their detection conditions, and test and diagnosis patterns. The test patterns are applied by read and write instructions to the memory and are validated by a case study where a 3-D memory is assumed to be stacked on a MIPS64 processor. The main benefits of the MBIT approach are: 1) zero area overhead; 2) the ability to detect both static and dynamic faults and perform at speed testing; 3) flexibility in applying any test pattern, as this can be executed by the CPU on the logic die; 4) extreme short test execution time; and 5) the ability to perform interconnect diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Post-Bond Interconnect Test and Diagnosis for 3-D Memory Stacked on Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000363240700014"}
