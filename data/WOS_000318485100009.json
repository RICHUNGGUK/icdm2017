The scene is decomposed into disjoint rigid objects. The free-field acoustic behavior of each object is captured by a compact per-object transfer function relating the amplitudes of a set of incoming equivalent sources to outgoing equivalent sources. Pairwise acoustic interactions between objects are computed analytically to yield compact inter-object transfer functions. The global sound field accounting for all orders of interaction is computed using these transfer functions. The runtime system uses fast summation over the outgoing equivalent source amplitudes for all objects to auralize the sound field for a moving listener in real time. We demonstrate realistic acoustic effects such as diffraction, low-passed sound behind obstructions, focusing, scattering, high-order reflections, and echoes on a variety of scenes.", "paper_title": "Wave-Based Sound Propagation in Large Open Scenes Using an Equivalent Source Formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318485100009"}
