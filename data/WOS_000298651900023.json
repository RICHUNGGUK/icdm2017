It is emphasized that the parameter of the system is not directly available. We introduce the concepts of uniform observability of the inverse of a function of state and input and N-order-input-to-state bifurcation stability. Based on the concepts, we propose a new method for designing dynamic compensators that guarantee bifurcation stability for the closed-loop system. As an example, we apply the general theory to active control of rotating stall in axial flow compressors by designing a stabilizing dynamic compensator for the three-state Moore-Greitzer model with a class of cubic compressor characteristics.", "paper_title": "Bifurcation stabilization of nonlinear systems by dynamic output feedback with application to rotating stall control", "paper_id": "WOS:000298651900023"}
