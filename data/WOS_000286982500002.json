However, mobility, QoS support, energy management, and service provisioning pose challenges to mobile grid. The paper presents a tradeoff policy between energy consumption and QoS in the mobile grid environment. Utility function is used to specify each QoS dimension; we formulate the problem of energy and QoS tradeoff by utility optimization. The work is different from the classical energy aware scheduling, which usually takes the consumed energy as the constraints; our utility model regards consumed energy as one of the components of measure of the utility values, which indicates the tradeoff of application satisfaction and consumed energy. It is a more accurate utility model for abstracting the energy characteristics and QoS requirement for mobile users and resources in mobile grid. The paper also proposes a distributed energy-QoS tradeoff algorithm. The performance evaluation of our energy-QoS tradeoff algorithm is evaluated and compared with other energy and deadline constrained scheduling algorithm.", "paper_title": "Tradeoffs between energy consumption and QoS in mobile grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000286982500002"}
