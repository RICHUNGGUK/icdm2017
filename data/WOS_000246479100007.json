Protein microarrays are quickly emerging as a follow-up technology, which will also begin to experience rapid growth as the challenges in protein to spot methodologies are overcome. Like DNA microarrays, their protein counterparts produce large amounts of data that must be suitably analyzed in order to yield meaningful information that should eventually lead to novel drug targets and biomarkers. Although the statistical management of DNA microarray data has been well described, there is no available report that offers a successful consolidated approach to the analysis of high-throughput protein microarray data. We describe the novel application of a statistical methodology to analyze the data from an immune response profiling assay using human protein microarray with over 5000 proteins on each chip.", "paper_title": "A consolidated approach to analyzing data from high-throughput protein microarrays with an application to immune response profiling in humans", "paper_id": "WOS:000246479100007"}
