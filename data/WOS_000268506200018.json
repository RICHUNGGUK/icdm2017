Control packets such as RTS, CTS and ACK are ignored in the broadcast scheme, and two busy tones are used, one for channel reservation and the other for negative acknowledgement. Unlike traditional schemes for reliable broadcasting. the proposed scheme is highly efficient as it achieves both collision avoidance and fast packet loss recovery. Simulation results. are presented which show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A Reliable and Efficient Broadcasting Scheme for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200018"}
