The analysis of such data is very sensitive to the analysis tools and the way they are used. On the one hand, some of the possible errors obtained by a misuse of the analysis tools are reported. On the other hand, a rigorous use of wavelet packets analysis reveals surprising results that slightly differ from the KLB theory for the flow considered. A careful wavelet packets filtering and a good computation of the energy and enstrophy fluxes show the role of the solid rotation vortices and the vorticity filaments to both the inverse energy cascade and the direct enstrophy cascade.
