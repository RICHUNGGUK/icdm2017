The comparison studies on the structure-function relationship of the conserved residues, which are located in the linker binding channel among class I HDACs (including 4 isoforms: HDAC1/2/3/8), have been carried out by using ab initio QM/MM MD simulations, a state-of-the-art approach to simulate metallo-enzymes. We found that the conserved tyrosine (Y303/308/286/306 in HDAC1/2/3/8, respectively) could modulate the zinc-inhibitor chelation among all class I HDACs with different regulatory mechanisms. For HDAC1/2/3 selective-inhibitor benzamide, the conserved tyrosine could modulate the coordinative ability of the central atom (Zn2+), while for pan-inhibitor SAHA, the conserved tyrosine could increase the chelating ability of the ligand (SAHA). Moreover, it is first found that the conserved tyrosine is correlated with the intertransformation of pi-pi stacking styles (parallel shift vs T-shaped) by the aromatic ring in benzamide and the two conserved phenylalanine residues of HDACs. In addition, the catalytic roles of the conserved tyrosine in stabilizing the transition state and intermediate are further revealed. These findings provide useful molecular basis knowledge for further isoform-selective inhibitor design among class I HDACs.", "paper_title": "Structure-Function Analysis of the Conserved Tyrosine and Diverse pi-Stacking among Class I Histone Deacetylases: A QM (DFT)/MM MD Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000345551000013"}
