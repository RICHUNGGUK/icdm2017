We study the state complexities of L-1* boolean OR L-2*, boolean OR(k)(i=1) L-i*, L-1* boolean AND L-2*, and boolean AND(k)(i=1) L-i* for regular languages L-i, 1 <= i <= k. We obtain the exact bounds for these combined operations and show that the bounds are different from the mathematical compositions of the state complexities of their component individual operations.
