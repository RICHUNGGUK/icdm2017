However, the influence of fine-scale deformation has not been considered in coarse-scale simulations. Thus, the simulation of highly nonhomogeneous detailed cloth is prone to large errors. We introduce an effective method to simulate cloth made of nonhomogeneous, anisotropic materials. We precompute a macroscopic stiffness that incorporates anisotropy from the microscopic structure, using the deformation computed for each unit strain. At every time step of the simulation, we compute the deformation of coarse meshes using the coarsened stiffness, which saves computational time and add higher-level details constructed by the characteristic displacement of simulated meshes. We demonstrate that anisotropic and inhomogeneous cloth models can be simulated efficiently using our method. (c) 2014 The Authors.
