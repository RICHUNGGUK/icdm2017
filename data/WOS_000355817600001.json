This paper focuses on the mathematical modelling of the hydraulic and mechanical components of a common-rail system in order to describe the dynamics of the diesel rail pressure. Based on this model, an average model is derived to reduce the model complexity and to allow for a fast calculation of the mass flow into the rail for different crank shaft revolution speeds and openings of the fuel metering unit. The main purpose of this average model is to serve as a basis for a model-based (non-linear) controller design. The stationary accuracy of the models is validated by means of measurement data.", "paper_title": "Mathematical modelling of a diesel common-rail system", "paper_id": "WOS:000355817600001"}
