In many applications, biologists have some knowledge of the genetic network and may want to assess the quality of their model using gene expression data. This is why one introduces a novel procedure for testing the neighborhoods of a Gaussian graphical model. It is based on the connection between the local Markov property and conditional regression of a Gaussian random variable. Adapting recent results on tests for high-dimensional Gaussian linear models, one proves that the testing procedure inherits appealing theoretical properties. Besides, it applies and is computationally feasible in a high-dimensional setting: the number of nodes may be much larger than the number of observations. A large part of the study is devoted to illustrating and discussing applications to simulated data and to biological data. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
