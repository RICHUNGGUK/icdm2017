However, in the bufferless network, deflections cause great performance loss. In this paper, three deflection models are firstly constructed for analyzing the causes of deflections. Then, we propose a low-deflection bufferless router (LDBR), in which a multi-channel network interface and a novel deflection routing based on turn model are designed for reducing the deflections during packet transmissions. Finally, LDBR is evaluated against the latest bufferless routers using synthetic and real-world traffic patterns. The experimental results exhibit that the deflection rate of LDBR network is reduced by 41% compared to other bufferless networks, and LDBR also shows superiority in cost and power consumption across all workloads.
