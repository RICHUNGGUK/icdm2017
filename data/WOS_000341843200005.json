However, prevalent SCTP-based handover solutions mostly evaluate candidate networks by a function of multiple attributes such as available bandwidth, delay, etc., which tend to vary often in burst and might cause the instability of handover decisions. Moreover, the SCTP congestion control strategy leads to sudden degradation of users' quality of experience for multimedia streaming service because of abrupt and frequent strong fluctuations in the transmission rate. In this paper, we propose a novel QoS-driven SCTP-based handover solution (SCTP-QD) appropriate for heterogeneous wireless multimedia transmission. A new network service and transport layer QoS-aware model is designed to help SCTP-QD accurately analyze the service stability and data transmission capacity for each path. A proper QoS-driven handover decision model is introduced in SCTP-QD in order to improve the SCTP handover efficiency while reducing unnecessary handoffs and fail-over probability. A proposal is finally addressed to help SCTP-QD avoid the slow start phase whenever handover occurs. The simulation results show that SCTP-QD outperforms existing solutions in terms of data delivery performance.", "paper_title": "Qos-driven SCTP-based multimedia delivery over heterogeneous wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341843200005"}
