Particularly, with many types of social media (e.g., Twitter and Face Book), such opinions are propagated to other users and might make a significant influence on them. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy propagation modeling for opinion mining by sentiment analysis of online social networks. Thereby, a practical system, called Tweet Scope, has been implemented to efficiently collect and analyze all possible tweets from customers.", "paper_title": "Sentiment Analysis Based on Fuzzy Propagation in Online Social Networks: a Case study on TweetScope", "paper_id": "WOS:000331779200015"}
