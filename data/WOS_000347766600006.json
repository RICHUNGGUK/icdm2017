(2014)). Zhao et al. (2013) constructed all the B (1)-GMC 2(n-m) : 2(r) designs with 5N/16 + 1 <= n <= N - 1, where N = 2(n-m), n and r are the numbers of runs, treatment factors and block factors respectively. In this paper, we establish a construction theory to obtain all the B (1)-GMC 2(n-m) : 2(r) designs with N/4 + 1 <= n <= 5N/16. For application, all the B (1)-GMC 2(n-m) : 2(r) designs with N/4 + 1 <= n <= 5N/16 and N = 16, 32, 64 and 128 respectively are tabulated.
