An optimization model based on the minimum structural compliance with a specified composite volume constraint is established. The ply angle and the distribution of the composite material are introduced as independent variables in two geometric scales (material and structural scales). The void material is added into the optional discrete material set to realize the topology change of the structure. This paper proposes an improved HPDMO (Heaviside Penalization of Discrete Material Optimization) model to obtain a better convergent result, and an explicit sensitivity analysis is performed. The effects of the HPDMO model on the convergence rate of the optimization results, the objective function value and the iteration history are studied and compared with those from the classical Discrete Material Optimization model and the Continuous Discrete Material Optimization model in this paper. Numerical examples in this paper show that the HPDMO model can effectively achieve the integrated optimization of the fiber ply angle and its distribution in the structural domain, and can also considerably improve the convergence rate of the optimal results compared with other DMO models. This model will help to reduce the manufacture cost of the optimal design.", "paper_title": "Integrated optimization of the material and structure of composites based on the Heaviside penalization of discrete material model", "paper_id": "WOS:000352705400012"}
