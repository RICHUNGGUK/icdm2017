It was shown in a recent paper, by reduction to 3-SAT, that the k-covers problem is NP-complete. In this paper we introduce a new problem that we call the k-bounded relaxed vertex cover problem (RVCPk), which we show is equivalent to k-bounded set cover (SCP(k)). We show further that kCP is a special case of RVCP(k) restricted to certain classes G(x,k) of graphs that represent all strings x. Thus a minimum k-cover can be approximated to within a factor k in polynomial time. We discuss approximate solutions of kCP, and we state a number of conjectures and open problems related to kCP and Gx,k. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
