The minimum risk metric (MRM) [2] is a distance measure based on the minimization of the risk of misclassification. The paper by Argentini and Blanzieri [1] refutes a remark in [5] about the time complexity of MRM, and presents an experimental comparison of MRM and NCM. This paper is a response to the paper by Argentini and Blanzieri [1]. The original remark is clarified by a combination of theoretical analysis of different implementations of MRM and experimental comparison of MRM and NCM using straightforward implementations of the two measures.", "paper_title": "Neighborhood Counting Measure and Minimum Risk Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000274548800017"}
