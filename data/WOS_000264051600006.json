The readers provide size, shape and perfusion grades for the presence of opacities in each region and then use all the ROI grades to classify the lung as normal or abnormal. The combined grades from all readers are then used to arrive at a consensus normal or abnormal classification. In this paper, using area under the ROC curve, we evaluate new mathematical models that are based on mathematical statistics, logic functions, and several statistical classifiers to analyze reader performance in grading chest radiographs for pneumoconiosis as the first step toward applying this technique to early detection of nodules found in lung cancer. In pneumoconiosis, rounded opacities are on the order of 1-10mm in size, while lung nodules are often not diagnosed until they reach a size on the order of I cm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
