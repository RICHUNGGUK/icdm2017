First, we demonstrate good scalability in the ultimate transmission distance over 100 km single-mode fiber without dispersion compensation of a 10G wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)-time division multiplexing (TDM)-optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) PON system. Second, we also demonstrate a 100 km 10G/1G-TDM-OCDM-PON system for the purpose of the scalability of the current mixed GE-PON and 10G-EPON system.", "paper_title": "Scaling the System Capacity and Reach of a 10G-TDM-OCDM-PON System Without an En/Decoder at an ONU", "paper_id": "WOS:000315288000006"}
