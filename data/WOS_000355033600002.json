This effect can be explained by considering the increase in voids connectivity within the cement paste and in concrete porosity due to polypropylene evaporation above certain temperatures. In this work the complex mechanism of polypropylene contribution on concrete behaviour under thermal conditions has been numerically evaluated through a coupled hygro-thermal-mechanical finite element formulation.
