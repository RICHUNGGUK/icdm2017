Here Conjecture C is presented, which states that the side length of the largest square on a closed curve that consists of edges of an nxn grid is at least times the side length of the largest axis-aligned square contained inside the curve. Conjecture C implies Toeplitz' conjecture and is verified computationally for n <= 13.", "paper_title": "A Note on Toeplitz' Conjecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000335753000013"}
