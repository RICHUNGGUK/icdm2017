We concentrate on the problem of trade-offs between the number of bits of information (size of advice) available to nodes and the time in which broadcasting can be accomplished. In particular, we ask what is the minimum number of bits of information that must be available to nodes of the network, in order to broadcast very fast. For networks in which constant time broadcast is possible under a complete knowledge of the network we give a tight answer to the above question: O(n) bits of advice are sufficient but o(n) bits are not, in order to achieve constant broadcasting time in all these networks. This is in sharp contrast with geometric radio networks of constant broadcasting time: we show that in these networks a constant number of bits suffices to broadcast in constant time. For arbitrary radio networks we present a broadcasting algorithm whose time is inverse-proportional to the size of the advice. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
