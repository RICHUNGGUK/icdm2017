We introduce sliced pure structures (sps), a very general version of Girard's proof-nets, and we apply to sps Gandy's method to infer SN from weak normalization (WN). We prove a standardization theorem for sps: if WN without erasing steps holds for an sps, then it enjoys SN. A key step in our proof of standardization is a confluence theorem for sps obtained by using only a very weak form of correctness, namely acyclicity slice by slice. We conclude by showing how standardization for sps allows to prove SN of LL, using as usual Girard's reducibility candidates. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
