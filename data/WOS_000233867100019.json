We extend the traditional flow cover inequality, and show that it is valid for a restriction of the set in which some variables are fixed. We also give conditions under which this inequality is facet-defining and, when it is not, we show how it can be lifted to obtain valid inequalities for the entire set using sequence independent lifting. In general, computing the lifting function is NP-hard, but under an additional restriction on the cover we obtain a closed form. Finally, we show how these results imply and extend known results about the single node fixed charge flow polyhedron.", "paper_title": "Sequence independent lifting for mixed integer programs with variable upper bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100019"}
