This framework, named GA-VBAC incorporates a level set approach named Variable Background Active Contour model (VBAC) that utilizes variable background regions, to reduce the effects of the intensity inhomogeneity in the thyroid ultrasound images. Moreover, a parameter tuning mechanism based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) has been considered to search for the optimal VBAC parameters automatically, without requiring technical skills. Experiments were conducted over a range of ultrasound images displaying thyroid nodules. The results show that the proposed GA-VBAC framework provides an efficient, effective and highly objective system for the delineation of thyroid nodules.", "paper_title": "A genetically optimized level set approach to segmentation of thyroid ultrasound images", "paper_id": "WOS:000249916000002"}
