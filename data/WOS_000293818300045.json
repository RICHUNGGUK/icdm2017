An analytical closed-form expression of the mean square error (MSE), of the post-FFT based CFO synchronization scheme, is presented in terms of time-variant fading channels. To verify our analysis in this paper, simulations are carried out within the framework of mobile WiMAX systems.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Fine Frequency Synchronization for OFDM in Time-Varying Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300045"}
