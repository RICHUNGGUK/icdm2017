Overlay networks offer several attractive features, including ease of deployment, flexibility, adaptivity, and an infrastructure for collaboration among hosts. In this paper, we explore cooperation among co-existing, possibly heterogeneous, overlay networks. We discuss a spectrum of cooperative forwarding and information sharing services, and investigate the associated scalability, heterogeneity, and security problems. Motivated by these services, we design Synergy, a utility-based overlay internet working architecture that fosters overlay cooperation. Our architecture promotes fair peering relationships to achieve synergism. Results from Internet experiments with cooperative forwarding overlays indicate that our Synergy prototype improves delay, throughput, and loss performance, while maintaining the autonomy and heterogeneity of individual overlay networks.", "paper_title": "Synergy: An Overlay Internetworking Architecture and Implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000277207600011"}
