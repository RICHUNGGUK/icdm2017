For this purpose we present an adaptation to the Multiple Hypothesis Tracking method, which unlike classic MHT, allows for one-to-many associations between targets and measurements in each hypothesis production cycle and is thus capable of operating in a scenario involving multiple sensors. Derivation of hypotheses probabilities accounts for the continuously changing overlapping areas in fields of view of the robots sensors and for detection uncertainty. In the context of three experiments involving people walking among moving robots, the successful integration of our tracking algorithm to a real-world setup is assessed.", "paper_title": "Multi-robot multiple hypothesis tracking for pedestrian tracking", "paper_id": "WOS:000298605900005"}
