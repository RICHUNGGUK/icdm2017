Given the extensive use of convex optimization in machine learning and statistics, gaining an understanding of these complexity-theoretic issues is important. In this paper, we study the complexity of stochastic convex optimization in an oracle model of computation. We introduce a new notion of discrepancy between functions, and use it to reduce problems of stochastic convex optimization to statistical parameter estimation, which can be lower bounded using information-theoretic methods. Using this approach, we improve upon known results and obtain tight minimax complexity estimates for various function classes.", "paper_title": "Information-Theoretic Lower Bounds on the Oracle Complexity of Stochastic Convex Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000303204900044"}
