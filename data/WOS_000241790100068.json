We proposed a energy function for higher order complex-valued Hopfield neural network and investigated the stability conditions. This proposed energy function formulation can be used for solving various problems such as optimization and synthesis of associative memory. In our work as an application, we discussed the recalling of a stored complex-valued vector (complex-valued associative memory). A real-valued approach is used for determining the weights and bias values for the proposed network.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis for higher order complex-valued Hopfield neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790100068"}
