However, it is much difficult to transmit the complex CAD models through the network be-cause of the limited network bandwidth. In this paper, a new approach is proposed to deal with the extruded and revolved features in the feature-based models. The proposed approach goes as follows: first, the extruded and revolved features of the models at the server side are highly compressed, then the models are transmitted through the network, finally they are reconstructed effectively at the client side. The results indicate that this approach can effectively cut down the transmission delay of the feature-based models, especially to those parts which contain many extruded and revolved features.", "paper_title": "An effective approach to compression and transmission of feature-based models", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800043"}
