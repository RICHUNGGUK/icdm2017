However, these existing results are far from enough. In order to supplement such theoretical study, this paper proves that separation principle for T-S fuzzy system with switching fuzzy controller and switching fuzzy observer does hold both in the continuous- and discrete-time case, which can guarantee the stability of total fuzzy system when designing corresponding controller and observer independently. At last, a numerical simulation, some conclusions and discussions about the future work are also presented. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
