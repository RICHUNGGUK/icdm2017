Here we study global convergence properties of methods based on this formulation, which involve generating an (exact or inexact) first- or second-order point of the formulation, for nondecreasing values of the penalty parameter. Under certain regularity conditions on the active constraints, we establish finite or asymptotic convergence to points having a certain stationarity property (such as strong stationarity, M-stationarity, or C-stationarity). Numerical experience with these approaches is discussed. In particular, our analysis and the numerical evidence show that exact complementarity can be achieved finitely even when the elastic-mode formulation is solved inexactly.", "paper_title": "Elastic-mode algorithms for mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints: global convergence and stationarity properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000245269700005"}
