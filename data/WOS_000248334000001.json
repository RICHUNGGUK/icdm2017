The current paper considers common and distinctive features found among these classifications, which govern their utility and completeness. Based on understandings gained about their collective features and shortcomings this paper argues a case for a unified classification of process types. Such a classification is presented and its applicability is discussed and exemplified.", "paper_title": "Process classes deployed in manufacturing enterprises", "paper_id": "WOS:000248334000001"}
