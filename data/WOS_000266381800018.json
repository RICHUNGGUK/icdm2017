We construct an empirical likelihood ratio test for heteroscedasticity. Also, under mild conditions, a nonparametric version of Wilk's theorem is derived, which says that our proposed test has an asymptotic chi-square distribution. Simulation results reveal that the finite sample performance of our proposed test is satisfactory in both size and power. An empirical likelihood bootstrap simulation is also conducted to overcome the size distortion in small sample sizes. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
