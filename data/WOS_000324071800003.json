Specifically, we extend our analysis to difficult' data structures from the recent literature and develop two synthetic data generators simulating affinity data of Gaussian clusters and genuine additive similarity data, with a controlled level of noise. The FADDIS is experimentally verified on these data in comparison with two state-of-the-art fuzzy clustering methods. The claimed ability of FADDIS to help in determining the right number of clusters is experimentally tested, and the role of the pseudo-inverse Laplacian data transformation in this is highlighted. A potentially useful extension of the method to biclustering is introduced.", "paper_title": "Laplacian normalization for deriving thematic fuzzy clusters with an additive spectral approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000324071800003"}
