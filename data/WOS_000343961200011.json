However, almost all GMM-based soft sensor modeling methods only employ GMM for identification of different operating modes, which means additional regression algorithms like PLS should be incorporated for quality prediction in different localized modes. In this paper, the Gaussian mixture regression (GMR) model is introduced for multiphase/multimode soft sensor modeling. In GMR, operating mode identification and variable regression are integrated into one model; thus, there is no need to switch prediction models when the operating mode changes from one to another. To improve the GMR model fitting performance, a heuristic algorithm is adopted for parameter initialization and component number optimization. Feasibility and efficiency of GMR based soft sensor are validated through a numerical example and two benchmark processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
