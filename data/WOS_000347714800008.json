Our main aim is to offer the programmer a useful insight into the effectful behaviour of programs. Handlers help here by cutting down possible effects and the resulting lengthy output that often plagues precise effect systems. Additionally, we present a set of methods that further simplify the displayed types, some even by deliberately hiding inferred information from the programmer.", "paper_title": "INFERRING ALGEBRAIC EFFECTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800008"}
