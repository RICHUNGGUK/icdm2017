Nevertheless, quantum tomography based on homodyne detection is a rather complicated technique when applied to short pulses in photocounting regime. In this paper, we present an experimental work addressed to test an innovative scheme for a full reconstruction of the density matrix by using on/off detection coupled to phase measurements respect to a local oscillator.", "paper_title": "TOWARD A FULL RECONSTRUCTION OF DENSITY MATRIX BY ON/OFF MEASUREMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282024200005"}
