While the long-established approach has been based on licensed (or primary) spectrum access, this new communication paradigm enables an opportunistic secondary access to shared spectrum resources provided mutual interference is kept below acceptable levels. In this paper we address the problem of primary-secondary spectrum sharing in cognitive radio access networks using a framework based on a Discrete Time Markov Chain (DTMC) model. Its applicability and advantages with respect to other approaches is explained and further justified. Spectrum awareness of primary activity by the secondary users is based on spectrum sensing techniques, which are modeled in order to capture sensing errors in the form of false-alarm and missed-detection. Model validation is successfully achieved by means of a system-level simulator which is able to capture the system behavior with high degree of accuracy. Parameter dependencies and potential tradeoffs are identified enabling an enhanced operation for both primary and secondary users. The suitability of the specified model is justified while allowing a wide range of extended implementations and enhanced capabilities to be considered. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
