Manufacturers are focusing on improving the overall quality of their products, as the demand for top quality products is increasing. Such changes increase the possibility of neglecting another crucial factor in manufacturing schedules, namely due date. Traditionally, jobs are dispatched with the focus on meeting due dates. That is, jobs are assigned to machines without consideration of product quality. This approach opens the possibility of manufacturing poor quality products. Realizing the shortcomings of the existing dispatching rules, manufacturers are tempted to dispatch jobs with the objective of maximizing product quality. With such an attempt, jobs are likely to be assigned to high performance machines only. In turn, waiting times will increase and job delays are inevitable. This research proposes a dispatching rule that satisfies both criteria, reducing due date delays, while ensuring a predefined product quality level. A quality index is introduced to standardize various product qualities. The index is used to ensure a predetermined quality level, whilst minimizing product delays. Simulations compare various dispatch methods, evaluating them based on mean tardiness and product quality. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
