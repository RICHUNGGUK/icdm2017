We present a sufficient condition on the minimum Hamming weight of the linear binary full-rank space-time code such that this lower bound is met. We show that the special Lu-Kumar codes does satisfy the sufficient condition, and therefore, the diversity products of the special Lu-Kumar codes are 4, where \"special\" means that the linear binary full-rank space-time codes are not general but specially constructed by Lu-Kumar.", "paper_title": "Diversity Product Properties of Lu-Kumar's Space-Time Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375500009"}
