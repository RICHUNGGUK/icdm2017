The 3D hand gesture data is acquired from VICON, and are processed and converted to features that are fed to a neural network. The extracted features are invariant for occlusion, rotation, scaling and translation of hand. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system call recognize the 20 static hand gestures in Taiwan sign language with all average accuracy of 96.58%. Additionally, the difference in recognition rate between training set and test set is 3.98% showing that the proposed system is robust. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
