The motivation of this approach is based on two observations. One is that Curvelet transform is a new anisotropic multi-resolution, analysis tool; which can effectively represent image edge discontinuities; the other is that local binary pattern operator is one of the best current texture descriptors for face images. As the curvelet features in different frequency bands represent different information of the original image, we extract such features using different methods for different frequency bands. Technically, the lowest frequency band component is processed using the local binary pattern method, and only the medium frequency band components are normalized. And then, we combine them to create a feature set, and use the local preservation projection to reduce its dimension. Finally, we classify the test samples using the nearest neighbor classifier in the reduced space. Extensive experiments on the Yale database, the extended Yale B database, the PIE pose 09 database, and the FRGC database illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
