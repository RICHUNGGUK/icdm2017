The generator produces optimized LNS arithmetic libraries that improve significantly over previous LNS designs on area and latency. We also provide area cost estimation and bit-accurate simulation tools that facilitate comparison between LNS and floating-point designs.", "paper_title": "FPGA Designs with Optimized Logarithmic Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000279059000012"}
