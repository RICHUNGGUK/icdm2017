Our algorithm combines random projection techniques for dimensionality reduction, polynomial threshold function constructions, and kernel methods. The algorithm is fast and simple. It learns a broader class of functions and achieves an exponential runtime improvement compared with previous work on learning intersections of halfspaces with a margin. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
