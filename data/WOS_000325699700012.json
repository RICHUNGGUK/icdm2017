Smart cameras that can perform part of the perceptual data processing improve scalability in both processing power and network resources. Based on these insights, this paper presents a particle filter for multiple person tracking designed for an FPGA-based smart camera. We propose a new joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based particle filter (MCMC-PF) with short Markov chains, devoted to each individual particle, in order to sample the particle swarm in relevant regions of the high dimensional state-space with increased particle diversity. Finding an efficient sampling method has become another challenge when designing particle filters, especially for those devoted to more than two or three targets. A proposal distribution, combining diffusion dynamics, learned HOG + SVM person detections, and adaptive background mixture models, limits here the well-known burst in terms of particles and MCMC iterations. This informed proposal based on saliency maps has only been marginally used in the literature in a joint state space PF framework. The presented qualitative and quantitative results-for proprietary and public video datasets-clearly show that our tracker outperforms the well-known MCMC-PF in terms of (1) tracking performances, i.e. robustness and precision, and (2) parallelization capabilities as the MCMC-PF processes the particles sequentially.", "paper_title": "Tracking-by-detection of multiple persons by a resample-move particle filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000325699700012"}
