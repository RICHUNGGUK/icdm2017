The paper exhibits effectiveness of the proposed method using the real application of multi-frequency offset estimation in distributed multiple-input multiple-output system. The simulation results demonstrate Bayesian decision-making based on prior information has better global searching capability when sampling data is deficient.", "paper_title": "Application of Bayesian Decision Theory Based on Prior Information in the Multi-Objective Optimization Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930600004"}
