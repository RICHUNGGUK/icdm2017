The development of these limiters is inspired by the biased averaging procedure of Choi and Liu [10]. The remarkable features of the present limiters are the new biased functions and the weighted average procedure, which enable the present limiter to capture strong shock waves and achieve excellent convergence for steady state computations. The mechanism of the developed limiters for eliminating spurious oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities is revealed by studying the asymptotic behavior of the limiters. Numerical experiments for a variety of test cases are presented to demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed limiters. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
