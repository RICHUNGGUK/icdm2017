In particular, the algorithm applied to the unweighted 3D-MATCHING problem results in a deterministic algorithm with time O*(16(k+0(k))), improving the previous best result O*(21.26(k)). For the weighted r-sET PACKING problem, we present a deterministic parameterized algorithm with time complexity O*(2((2r-1)k+o(k))) improving the previous best result O*(2(2rk+o(k))). The algorithm, when applied to the unweighted 3-SET PACKING problem, has running time O*(32(k+o(k))), improving the previous best result O*(43.62(k+o(k))). Moreover, for the weighted r-SET PACKING and weighted rD-MATCHING problems, we give a kernel of size O(k(r)), which is the first kernelization algorithm for the problems on weighted versions.
