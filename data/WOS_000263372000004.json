The network will locate within the external world stimulus, the target memory, defined by a specific pattern of micro-features. The proposed network is robust and efficient. Akin in operation to the swarm intelligence paradigm, stochastic diffusion search, it will find the best-fit to the memory with linear time complexity. information multiplexing enables neurons to process knowledge as 'tokens' rather than 'types'. The network illustrates possible emergence of cognitive processing from low level interactions such as memory retrieval based on partial matching. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
