It is based upon an accurate discrete-time model of the drive, accounting for both voltage saturation and current limitation constraints. It aims to properly manage these constraints in order to guarantee a good exploitation of both transient and steady state SPM performances, especially over flux-weakening operation. The effectiveness of the proposed MPC is first validated by a simulation study, in which the sensitivity of the proposed MPC against un-compensated inverter un-idealities and parameter uncertainties is properly highlighted and discussed, as well as the effects of sudden load torque variations. Then, an experimental study is performed on a radial-flux SPM driven by a Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) control board. The performances achievable by the proposed MPC are compared with those obtained by a conventional PI-based control system in order to highlight the improvements, especially regarding transient and flux-weakening operation.", "paper_title": "Operating Constraints Management of a Surface-Mounted PM Synchronous Machine by Means of an FPGA-Based Model Predictive Control Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600024"}
