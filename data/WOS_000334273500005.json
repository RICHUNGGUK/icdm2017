To allow unrestricted navigation through the environment, a system must be capable of constructing novel views given the reference images, typically, cubic panoramas. This paper proposes a processing pipeline for cubic panorama synthesis based on 2D/3D triangular reprojection. This pipeline uses matching features to implement the triangular meshing on cubic panoramas, and introduces the matching line constraint, which significantly reduces the artifacts of straight-line features in the rendered image and accelerates the division process. The modules of this pipeline take the geometrical characteristics of cubic panorama into account. Thus, it can handle the discontinuities of the cube edges when the triangular mesh covers different faces. Furthermore, these modules could be reconfigured to compose customized pipelines and generate virtual cubic panoramas of different quality based on the amount of features. The performance and efficiency of the proposed pipeline is demonstrated with comparison experiments.
