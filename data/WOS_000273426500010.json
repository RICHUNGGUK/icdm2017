This is in contrast with the previous remote state preparation schemes that the receiver has no classical knowledge of preparing state. It is demonstrated that the total success probability of remote state preparation will be greatly improved when the receiver has partial classical knowledge of preparing state.", "paper_title": "IMPROVING THE SUCCESS PROBABILITY OF REMOTE STATE PREPARATION BY USING PARTIAL CLASSICAL KNOWLEDGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000273426500010"}
