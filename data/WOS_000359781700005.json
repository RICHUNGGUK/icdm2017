Johansson [Tech. report (1996)] proved that every triangle-free graph with maximum degree Delta has list chromatic number O(Delta/log Delta). Frieze and Mubayi (Electron J Comb 15 (2008), 27) proved that every linear (meaning that every two edges share at most one vertex) triangle-free triple system with maximum degree Delta has chromatic number O(root Delta/log Delta). The restriction to linear triple systems was crucial to their proof. We provide a common generalization of both these results for rank 3 hypergraphs (edges have size 2 or 3). Our result removes the linear restriction from [8], while reducing to the (best possible) result [Johansson, Tech. report (1996)] for graphs. In addition, our result provides a positive answer to a restricted version of a question of Ajtai Erdos, Komlos, and Szemeredi (combinatorica 1 (1981), 313-317) concerning sparse 3-uniform hypergraphs. As an application, we prove that if C-3 is the collection of 3-uniform triangles, then the Ramsey number R(C-3, K-t(3)) satisfies at(3/2)/(log t)(3/4) <= R(C3, K-t(3)) <= bt(3/2)/(log t)(1/2) for some positive constants a and b. The upper bound makes progress towards the recent conjecture of Kostochka, Mubayi, and Verstraete (J Comb Theory Ser A 120 (2013), 1491-1507) that R(C-3, K-t(3)) = o(t(3/2)) where C-3 is the linear triangle.
