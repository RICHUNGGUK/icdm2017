To achieve more fine-grained delegation on the condition set, we introduce a new cryptographic primitive called fuzzy conditional proxy re-encryption (FC-PRE) in which we view conditions in C-PRE as a set of descriptive keywords. A FC-PRE scheme allows for a proxy with the re-encryption key for a conditional keyword set, W, to re-encrypt a ciphertext encrypted with a conditional keyword set, W', if and only if W' and W' are close to each other as measured by the \"set overlap\" distance metric. Therefore, our system allows a certain amount of error-tolerance in the conditions. We formalize the FC-PRE security model by incorporating the advantages in previous C-PRE. Finally, we present an efficient construction of FC-PRE scheme, and prove its CCA-security under the well-studied decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DED1-1) assumption in the random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy conditional proxy re-encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000319531200017"}
