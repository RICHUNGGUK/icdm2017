We generalize the IB method to handle porous membranes by incorporating an additional transmembrane flux that obeys Darcy's law. An approximate analytical solution is derived that clearly illustrates the effect of porosity on the immersed boundary motion. Numerical simulations in two dimensions are used to validate the analytical results and to illustrate the motion of more general porous membrane dynamics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
