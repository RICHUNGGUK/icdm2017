Existing studies perform content adaptation on web pages and other media files that have the same start times and durations. In this paper, we present a content adaptation method for multimedia presentations constituting media files with different start times and durations. We perform adaptation based on preferences and temporal constraints specified by authors and generate an order of importance among media files. Our method can automatically generate layouts by computing the locations, start times, and durations of the media files. We compare three solutions to generate layouts: 1) exhaustive search, 2) dynamic programming, and 3) greedy algorithms. We analyze the presentations by varying screen resolutions, media files, preferences, and temporal constraints. Our analysis shows that screen utilizations are 92%, 85%, and 80% for the three methods, respectively. The time to generate layouts for a presentation with 100 media files is 1200, 17, and 10 s, respectively, for the three methods.", "paper_title": "Adaptation of Multimedia Presentations for Different Display Sizes in the Presence of Preferences and Temporal Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000283448500004"}
