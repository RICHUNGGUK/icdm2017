Given the orientation of the surface and a nonlinear model of the elastic force, a controller is designed requiring no information on the robot parameters and the disturbances. This controller will guarantee that the tracking errors satisfy PP indexes such as the maximum steady-state errors and overshoots, and the minimum convergence rates. Thus, contact maintenance can be ensured as prescribed. An approximation of the Jacobian is utilized in the presence of uncertain robot kinematics, and PP position/attitude tracking of the free-flying base is achieved in addition to the PP force/position tracking of the manipulator's fingertip. The proposed controller is based on an error transformation technique, and a directly tunable gain for the transformed error feedback is introduced in the control to trade off between the tracking performance and control effort. Numerical simulations and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed controller. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
