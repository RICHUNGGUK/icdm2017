As for 4-channel tight frame wavelet filter, the tight frame transforms' matrix is 2x4, but the lifting scheme transforms' matrix must be 4x4. And in the case of 3-channel tight frame wavelet filter, the transforms' matrix is 2x3, but the lifting scheme transforms' matrix must be 3x3. In order to solve this problem, we introduce two concepts: transferred polyphase matrix for 4-channel filters and transferred unitary matrix for 3-channel filters. The transferred polyphase matrix is symmetric/antisymmetric. Thus, we use this advantage to realize the lifting scheme.", "paper_title": "Lifting scheme of symmetric tight wavelets frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000257394000011"}
