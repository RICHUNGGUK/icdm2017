Fashion is based on two efficient yet effective techniques: 1) dynamic pattern routing (DPR) and 2) movable-segment-driven DPR. These two techniques enable Fashion to explore large solution space to achieve high routability with low time complexity. Compared with BoxRouter, Fashion has a shorter wire length and reduces overflow and runtime by 5 and 15 times, respectively. Compared with FastRoute, Fashion has similar runtime but 90% smaller overflow and 1.9% shorter wire length. Fashion is significantly better than Labyrinth and Fengshui in terms of overflow, wire length, and runtime.", "paper_title": "Fashion: A fast and accurate solution to global routing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000254226000013"}
