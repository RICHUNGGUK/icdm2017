Instead of considering them as fuzzy sets, we see them as crisp sets of entities we call gradual (real) numbers. They are a gradual extension of real numbers, not of intervals. Such a concept is apparently missing in fuzzy set theory. Gradual numbers basically have the same algebraic properties as real numbers, but they are functions. A fuzzy interval is then viewed as a pair of fuzzy thresholds, which are monotonic gradual real numbers. This view enables interval analysis to be directly extended to fuzzy intervals, without resorting to alpha-cuts, in agreement with Zadeh's extension principle. Several results show that interval analysis methods can be directly adapted to fuzzy interval computation where end-points of intervals are changed into left and right fuzzy bounds. Our approach is illustrated on two known problems: computing fuzzy weighted averages and determining fuzzy floats and latest starting times in activity network scheduling.", "paper_title": "Gradual numbers and their application to fuzzy interval analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500010"}
