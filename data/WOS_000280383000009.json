There are n items and m servers each of which stores a subset of the items. It is required that, for prescribed integers k and t, any k items can be retrieved by reading at most t items from each server. Only the case t = 1 is considered here. An optimal combinatorial batch code is one in which the total storage required is a minimum. We establish an important connection between combinatorial batch codes and transversal matroids, and exploit this connection to characterize optimal combinatorial batch codes if n = m + 1 and n = m + 2.", "paper_title": "COMBINATORIAL BATCH CODES AND TRANSVERSAL MATROIDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280383000009"}
