The GFML is applied to the genetic fuzzy system for dealing with the knowledge base, the rule base, and the genetic learning base of the healthy diet domain, including the ingredients and the contained servings of six food categories of some common food in Taiwan. Moreover, the proposed novel system is able to infer the healthy status of human's daily eating. In the proposed system, the domain experts first define the nutrient facts of the common food to construct the fuzzy food ontology. Meanwhile, the involved Taiwanese students of National University of Tainan (NUTN) record their daily meals for a constant period of time. Then, based on the built fuzzy profile ontology, fuzzy food ontology, and fuzzy personal food ontology, a GFML-based genetic fuzzy system is carried out to infer the possibility of dietary healthy level for one-day meals. The experimental results show that the proposed GFML-based genetic fuzzy system gives good results for the healthy diet assessment.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL GENETIC FUZZY MARKUP LANGUAGE AND ITS APPLICATION TO HEALTHY DIET ASSESSMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000308710000012"}
