Ordinary Portland cement (OPC), Modified cement (MC), Rapid-hardening Portland cement (RHC) and Low-heat Portland cement (LHC) were used. The total chloride contents and free chloride contents were analyzed by ASTM. The contents of C-S-H, AFm hydrates and Friedel's salt were determined by X-ray diffraction Rietveld (XRD Rietveld) analysis. The results showed that OPC had the highest chloride binding capacity, and, LHC had the lowest binding capacity of chloride ions. MC and RHC had very similar capacities to bind chloride ions. Experimental equations which distinguish the chemically bound chloride and physically bound chloride were formulated to determine amounts of the bound chloride basing on chloride binding capacity of hydrates.", "paper_title": "Chloride binding isotherms of various cements basing on binding capacity of hydrates", "paper_id": "WOS:000344577600001"}
