Developed in the context of simulating semiconductor manufacture equipment, this framework reduces the software development cycle time associated with designing process systems and it improves the overall efficiency of the simulator development process. Modularized simulator components can be solved and analyzed individually, as well as formed into modular systems that can be solved using sequential or simultaneous approaches. A tungsten chemical vapor deposition simulation application is presented to illustrate the capability of the proposed tools in facilitating an evolutionary simulation approach. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
