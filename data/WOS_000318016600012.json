A central problem is how to estimate the distance between two objects. Most conventional methods integrate the distances of view pairs across two objects as an estimation of their distance. In this paper, we propose a discriminative probabilistic object modeling approach. It builds probabilistic models for each object based on the distribution of its views, and the distance between two objects is defined as the upper bound of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the corresponding probabilistic models. 3D object retrieval and recognition is accomplished based on the distance measures. We first learn models for each object by the adaptation from a set of global models with a maximum likelihood principle. A further adaption step is then performed to enhance the discriminative ability of the models. We conduct experiments on the ETH 3D object dataset, the National Taiwan University 3D model dataset, and the Princeton Shape Benchmark. We compare our approach with different methods, and experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach.", "paper_title": "View-Based Discriminative Probabilistic Modeling for 3D Object Retrieval and Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000318016600012"}
