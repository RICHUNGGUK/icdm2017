Our algorithm is based upon a novel extension of a method introduced by Alon et al. [ 1999]. This improves over previous work on this problem. We show a space lower bound of Omega(epsilon(-2)/log(2)(epsilon(-1))), demonstrating that our algorithm is near-optimal in terms of its dependency on epsilon. We show that generalizing to multiplicative-approximation of the kth-order entropy requires close to linear space for k >= 1. In contrast we show that additive-approximation is possible in a single pass using only poly-logarithmic space. Lastly, we show how to compute a multiplicative approximation to the entropy of a random walk on an undirected graph.", "paper_title": "A Near-Optimal Algorithm for Estimating the Entropy of a Stream", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362000008"}
