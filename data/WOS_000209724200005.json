Today, IT services are increasingly shared amongst workflows, and static prioritization is applied during phases of high system workload to mitigate the business impact of service queuing and resulting workflow response-time increase. Static prioritization rules can only be optimal for one particular workflow definition and demand mix scenario, while in practice workflow definitions are continuously re-engineered and demand varies over time. We propose a technique to automatically adapt workflow priorities aimed at minimizing overload-related costs resulting from workflow delays. We continuously align maximum service buffer lengths and bid-prices reflecting current marginal opportunity costs of invoking a shared service. New prioritization is derived by comparing expected costs when queuing a workflow with its current opportunity costs, computed as the sum of bid-prices of invoked services. Simulation outcomes based on industry data illustrate that the approach dominates standard queuing disciplines as well as static prioritization.", "paper_title": "Autonomic Prioritization of Enterprise Transactions Based on Bid-Price Controls", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724200005"}
