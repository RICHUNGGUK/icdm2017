The data based methodology is focused on using the linear time varying (LTV) perturbation model in an iterative learning control (ILC) framework to provide a convergent batch-to-batch improvement of the process performance indicator. The major contribution of this work is the development of a novel hierarchical ILC (HILC) scheme for systematic design of the supersaturation controller (SSC) of seeded batch cooling crystallizers. The HILC is used to determine the required supersaturation setpoint for the SSC and the corresponding temperature trajectory required to produce crystals with desired end-point property. The performance and robustness of these approaches are evaluated through simulation case studies. These results demonstrate the potential of the ILC approaches for controlling batch processes without rigorous process models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
