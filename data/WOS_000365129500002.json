In this era, people live and work in cyberspace. Cyberspace is the collection of all information systems; it is the information environment for human survival. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure the security of cyberspace. This paper gives a comprehensive introduction to research and development in this field, with a description of existing problems and some currently active research topics in the areas of cyberspace itself, cyberspace security, cryptography, network security, information system security and information content security.", "paper_title": "Survey on cyberspace security", "paper_id": "WOS:000365129500002"}
