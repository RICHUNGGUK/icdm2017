The program features simple conversion between different parametrizations of the 2HDM potential, a flexible Yukawa sector specification with choices of different Z(2)-symmetries or more general couplings, a decay library including all two-body - and some three-body - decay modes for the Higgs bosons. and the possibility to calculate observables of interest for constraining the 2HDM parameter space, as well as theoretical constraints from positivity and unitarity.
