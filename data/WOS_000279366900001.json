Our system enables automated analysis of thousands of images, where manual processing would be infeasible. We automate the analysis of raw imaging data using statistics that are tailored to the task of interest. These \"features\" are a representation to be fed to classifiers that exploit spatial and temporal consistencies. Our testbed can detect the presence or absence of a bird with an accuracy of 82%, count eggs with an accuracy of 84%, and detect the inception of the nesting stage within a day. Our results demonstrate the challenges and potential benefits of using imagers as biological sensors. An exploration of system performance under varying image resolution and frame rate suggest that an in situ adaptive vision system is technically feasible.", "paper_title": "Heartbeat of a Nest: Using Imagers as Biological Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000279366900001"}
