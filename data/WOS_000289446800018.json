In this paper we propose a new method for the topology design of such inductors. The inverse electromagnetic casting problem is formulated as an optimization problem, and topological derivatives are considered in order to locate new wires in the right position. Several numerical examples are presented showing that the proposed technique is effective to design suitable inductors. (c) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
