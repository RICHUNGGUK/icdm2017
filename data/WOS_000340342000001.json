This algorithm is based on a novel decomposition theorem for claw-free graphs, which is also introduced in the present article. Despite being weaker than the structural results for claw-free graphs given by Chudnovsky and Seymour [2005, 2008a, 2008b] our decomposition theorem is, on the other hand, algorithmic, that is, it is coupled with an O(vertical bar V vertical bar vertical bar E vertical bar)-time algorithm that actually produces the decomposition.", "paper_title": "Solving the Weighted Stable Set Problem in Claw-Free Graphs via Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340342000001"}
