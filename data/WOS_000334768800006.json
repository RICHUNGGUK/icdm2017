However, a potential issue that keeps SVM from being efficiently applied in identifying financial distress is how to select features in SVM-based FDI. Although filters are commonly employed, yet this type of approach does not consider predictive capability of SVM itself when selecting features. This research devotes to constructing a statistics-based wrapper for SVM-based FDI by using statistical indices of ranking-order information from predictive performances on various parameters. This wrapper consists of four levels, i.e., data level, model level based on SVM, feature ranking-order level, and the index level of feature selection. When data is ready, predictive accuracies of a type of SVM model, i.e., linear SVM (LSVM), polynomial SVM (PSVM), Gaussian SVM (GSVM), or sigmoid SVM (SSVM), on various pairs of parameters are firstly calculated. Then, performances of SVM models on each candidate feature are transferred to be ranking-order indices. After this step, the two statistical indices of mean and standard deviation values are calculated from ranking-order information on each feature. Finally, the feature selection indices of SVM are produced by a combination of statistical indices. Each feature with its feature selection index being smaller than half of the average index is selected to compose the optimal feature set. With a dataset collected for Chinese FDI prior to 3 years, we statistically verified the performance of this statistics-based wrapper against a non-statistics-based wrapper, two filters, and non-feature selection for SVM-based FDI. Results from unseen dataset indicate that GSVM with the statistics-based wrapper significantly outperformed the other SVM models on the other feature selection methods and two wrapper-based classical statistical models.
