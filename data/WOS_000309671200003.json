Our techniques handle transparency/performance trade-offs and use the fault-occurrence information to reduce the overhead due to fault tolerance. Processes and messages are statically scheduled, and we use process reexecution for recovering from multiple transient faults. We propose a fine-grained transparent recovery, where the property of transparency can be selectively applied to processes and messages. Transparency hides the recovery actions in a selected part of the application so that they do not affect the schedule of other processes and messages. While leading to longer schedules, transparent recovery has the advantage of both improved debuggability and less memory needed to store the fault-tolerant schedules.", "paper_title": "Scheduling and Optimization of Fault-Tolerant Embedded Systems with Transparency/Performance Trade-Offs", "paper_id": "WOS:000309671200003"}
