The architectures of the present DL reasoners such as RACER or FaCT were developed using programming languages as Java or LISP. The implementations are not based on original definition of the abstract syntax, but they require transformation of abstract syntax into concrete syntax implementation languages use. In order to address these issues, we propose the use of model-driven engineering principles for the development of a DL reasoner where a definition of a DL abstract syntax is provided by means of metamodels. The presented approach is based on the use of a MOF-based model repository and QVT-like transformations, which transform models compliant to the DL metamodel taken from the OMG's Ontology Definition Metamodel specification into models compliant to the Tableau metamodel defined in this paper.", "paper_title": "Model Driven Engineering of a Tableau Algorithm for Description Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000268481800002"}
