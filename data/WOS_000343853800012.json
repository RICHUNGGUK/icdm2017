The action model of a robot/agent is specified as a causal theory following McCain and Turner's nonmonotonic causal theories. New knowledge is needed when the robot/agent is given a user task that cannot be accomplished only with the action model. This problem is cast as a variant of abduction, that is, to find the most suitable set of causal rules from open-source knowledge resources, so that a plan for accomplishing the task can be computed using the action model together with the acquired knowledge. The core part of our theory is constructed based on credulous reasoning and the complexity of corresponding abductive reasoning is analyzed. The entire theory is established by adding weights to hypothetical causal rules and using them to compare competing explanations which induce causal models satisfying the task. Moreover, we sketch a model theoretic semantics for the weighted causal theory and present an algorithm for computing a weighted-abductive explanation. An application of the techniques proposed in this paper is illustrated in an example on our service robot, KeJia, in which the robot tries to acquire proper knowledge from OMICS, a large-scale open-source knowledge resource, and solve new tasks with the knowledge.
