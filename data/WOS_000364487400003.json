Extensive research efforts have been dedicated to this task, while it is still difficult to measure the relevance between two objects with multiple views. In recent years, learning-based methods have been investigated in view-based 3-D object retrieval, such as graph-based learning. It is noted that the graph-based methods suffer from the high computational cost from the graph construction and the corresponding learning process. In this paper, we introduce a general framework to accelerate the learning-based view-based 3-D object matching in large scale data. Given a query object Q and one object O from a 3-D dataset D, the first step is to extract a small set of candidate relevant 3-D objects for object O. Then multiple hypergraphs can be constructed based on this small set of 3-D objects and the learning on the fused hypergraph is conducted to generate the relevance between Q and O, which can be further used in the retrieval procedure. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "Efficient View-Based 3-D Object Retrieval via Hypergraph Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000364487400003"}
