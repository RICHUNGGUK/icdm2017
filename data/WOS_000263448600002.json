In this paper the accuracy of this method is tested by comparing Simulations to an exact solution of distribution of random walks on a one-dimensional lattice. The boundary effects of restricting the region of parameter space are investigated as well. Finally by FLATPERM we calculate the distribution of end-to-end distance of self-avoiding walks oil a cubic lattice and simulate the scaling behavior of most probable end-to-end distance.
