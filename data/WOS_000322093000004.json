This paper studies energy gains that come from the application of two popular energy saving techniques, Dynamic Voltage Scaling (DVS) and Dynamic Power Management (DPM), in a real-time 2-level heterogeneous grid system: While these techniques generally work in a competitive way, we show that under certain circumstances they can work together and achieve greater savings when they are both applied at the processor level. A simulation model is used to evaluate the performance of the system. Experimental results show encouraging energy savings up to 46% and minimum performance degradation when both energy saving techniques are applied. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
