Each message containing 1 bit, its bit complexity per channel is O(log n). From this algorithm, we deduce and analyse a randomised distributed vertex colouring algorithm for arbitrary graphs of maximum degree Delta and size n that uses at most Delta + 1 colours and halts in time O(log n) with probability 1 - o(n(-1)). We also obtain a partition algorithm for arbitrary graphs of size n that builds a spanning forest in time O(log n) with probability 1 - o(n(-1)). We study some parameters such as the number, the size and the radius of trees of the spanning forest.
