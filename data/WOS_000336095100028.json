Results: Here we present , a complete infrastructure to support and guide the sound analysis of quantitative mass-spectrometry-based spatial proteomics data. It provides functionality for unsupervised and supervised machine learning for data exploration and protein classification and novelty detection to identify new putative sub-cellular clusters. The software builds upon existing infrastructure for data management and data processing.", "paper_title": "Mass-spectrometry-based spatial proteomics data analysis using pRoloc and pRolocdata", "paper_id": "WOS:000336095100028"}
