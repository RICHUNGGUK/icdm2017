In particular, we consider methods of establishing such assertions using only restricted forms of distributivity. At the same time, we explore ways in which \"local\" decision or heuristic procedures for fragments of the theory of the reals can be amalgamated into global ones. Let T-add [Q] be the first-order theory of the real numbers in the language with symbols 0, 1, +, -, <, ..., f(a), ... where for each a is an element of Q, fa denotes the function f(a)(x) = ax. Let T-mult [Q] be the analogous theory for the language with symbols 0, 1, x, divided by, <, ..., f(a), .... We show that although T[Q] = T-add [Q] boolean OR T-mult [Q] is undecidable, the universal fragment of T[Q] is decidable. We also show that terms of T[Q] can fruitfully be put in a normal form. We prove analogous results for theories in which Q is replaced, more generally, by suitable subfields F of the reals. Finally, we consider practical methods of establishing quantifier-free validities that approximate our (impractical) decidability results.", "paper_title": "COMBINING DECISION PROCEDURES FOR THE REALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209479600004"}
