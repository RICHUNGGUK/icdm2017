A Peak Energy criterion (P. E.) is proposed in this paper for the simultaneous automatic selection of both the center frequency and the bandwidth of the relevant wavelet window to be used. As shown in a number of application cases, this criterion presents a more effective behavior than other criteria used (Crest Factor, Kurtosis, Smoothness Index, Number of Peaks), since it combines the advantages of energy based criteria, with criteria characterizing the spikiness of the response.", "paper_title": "A PEAK ENERGY CRITERION (P.
