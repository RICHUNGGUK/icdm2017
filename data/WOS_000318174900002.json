Although this class is well studied, little is known about how to efficiently interpolate such data within the class. We extend the 4-point interpolatory subdivision scheme, as a method of interpolation, to data consisting of symmetric positive definite matrices. This extension is based on an explicit formula for calculating a binary \"geodetic average\". Our method generates a smooth curve of matrices, which retain many important properties of the interpolated matrices. Furthermore, the scheme is robust and easy to implement.", "paper_title": "Subdivision Schemes for Positive Definite Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000318174900002"}
