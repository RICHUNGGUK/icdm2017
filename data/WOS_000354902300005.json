In partnership with Kaggle (http://www.kaggle.com), 357 users participated in the competition which saw 2278 downloads of the data and 3358 submissions. We found that the best algorithms improved on the benchmark code, LENSTOOL by >30% and could measure the positions of >3 x 10(14)M(circle dot) halos to <5 '' and <10(14)M(circle dot) to within 1'. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the winning algorithms with links to available code. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
