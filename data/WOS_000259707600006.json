For the discovery of TKF firstly knowledge map (KM) is proposed to represent the textual knowledge; then a hash algorithm is used to code KMs in (order to form an Island which contains enormous KMs belonging to a domain. Under the control of the Island, C-Location and R-Location are introduced to manage those KMs belonging to in Island. KM-Chord is proposed to manage the number of Islands, C-Locations and R-Locations in Web or a library. With the help of the management of KMs, similar relation and associated relation between KMs are found to build the semantic link network (SLN) between KMs. Based on the SLN and users' profile and input, similar or associated TKF with the user's different demands is activated. Experiments show that the proposed method can effectively discover TKF for Web services and e-Science Knowledge Grid. Copyright (E) 2008 John Wile & Sons.
