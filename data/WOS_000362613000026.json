Some studies have shown that the data published in these platforms may contain sensitive personal information and that external entities can gather and exploit this knowledge for their own benefit. Even though some methods to preserve the privacy of social networks users have been proposed, they generally apply rigid access control measures to the protected content and, even worse, they do not enable the users to understand which contents are sensitive. Last but not least, most of them require the collaboration of social network operators or they fail to provide a practical solution capable of working with well-known and already deployed social platforms (e.g., Twitter). In this paper, we propose a new scheme that addresses all these issues. The new system is envisaged as an independent piece of software that does not depend on the social network in use and that can be transparently applied to most existing ones. According to a set of privacy requirements intuitively defined by the users of a social network, the proposed scheme is able to: (i) automatically detect sensitive data in users' publications; (ii) construct sanitized versions of such data; and (iii) provide privacy-preserving transparent access to sensitive contents by disclosing more or less information to readers according to their credentials toward the owner of the publications. We also study the applicability of the proposed system in general and illustrate its behavior in two well-known social networks (i.e., Twitter and PatientsLikeMe). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
