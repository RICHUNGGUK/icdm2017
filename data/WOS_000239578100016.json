In this study, we propose an efficient two-level delay control method, called frame sequence adaptation and audio sampling frequency compensation, for achieving stable audio delay with a small variation. To prove the effectiveness of our scheme, we implemented and evaluated the scheme on a Bluetooth network. Experimental results show that our scheme can control audio delay robustly and remove phase shift problem in multi-channel stereophonic audio broadcasting as well.", "paper_title": "Robust delay control for audio streaming over wireless link", "paper_id": "WOS:000239578100016"}
