In particular, the article focuses on the (pre)congruences associated with the weak simulation, the weak complete simulation and the weak ready simulation preorders. We present results on the (non)existence of finite (ground-)complete (in)equational axiomatizations for each of these behavioural semantics. The axiomatization of those semantics using conditional equations is also discussed in some detail. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
