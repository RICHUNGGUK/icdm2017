In this paper, we propose a scheme to provide interoperability between two widely discussed identity systems, namely Shibboleth and Information Card systems such as CardSpace or Higgins. When using this scheme, Information Card users are able to obtain an assertion token from a Shibboleth-enabled identity provider that can be processed by an Information Card-enabled relying party. The scheme is based on a browser extension and operates with both the CardSpace and the Higgins identity selectors without any modification. We specify the operation of the scheme and also describe an implementation of a proof-of-concept prototype. Additionally, security and operational analyses are provided.
