A user-friendly software, using Visual Basic 6.0 program, is developed to find out the optimal size of the OFR in terms of percentage of field area (here in called as OFR sizes throughout the manuscript) by simulating the water balance model parameters of the crop field and the OFR. The software is meant for all the concerned including the engineers, planners and farming community for any monsoon influenced cropping area, which uses rainfed agriculture. The menu driven system is flexible enough to simulate the OFR sizes for various combinations of the OFR geometry, field sizes, and the cropping systems. The user has to specify the crops to be grown in the fields, irrigation management practices of the crops, types of OFR (lined or unlined), side slope, depth of OFR, and field sizes. Evapotranspiration sub-model is embedded with the main model to compute the ET from the meteorological data. As model application, the developed model is used to simulate the OFR sizes for the rice-mustard and rice-groundnut cropping systems using the experimental observed and meteorological data of the study area located at Indian institute of Technology, Kharagpur in eastern India. The water balance model parameters of the crop field are validated with 2 years of observed data from the experimental field of above mentioned study area. The study reveals that rice-groundnut cropping system requires higher OFR sizes than rice-mustard cropping systems. Moreover, it is observed that as the field areas increase, the OFR sizes for each cropping systems is found to decrease.
