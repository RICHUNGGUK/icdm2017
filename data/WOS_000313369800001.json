Firstly, the process planning problem, considering the selection of machining resources, operations sequence optimization and the manufacturing constraints, is mapped to a weighted graph and is converted to a constraint-based traveling salesman problem. The operation sets for each manufacturing features are mapped to city groups, the costs for machining processes (including machine cost and tool cost) are converted to the weights of the cities; the costs for preparing processes (including machine changing, tool changing and set-up changing) are converted to the 'distance' between cities. Then, the mathematical model for process planning problem is constructed by considering the machining constraints and goal of optimization. The ACO algorithm has been employed to solve the proposed mathematical model. In order to ensure the feasibility of the process plans, the Constraint Matrix and State Matrix are used in this algorithm to show the state of the operations and the searching range of the candidate operations. Two prismatic parts are used to compare the ACO algorithm with tabu search, simulated annealing and genetic algorithm. The computing results show that the ACO algorithm performs well in process planning optimization than other three algorithms.", "paper_title": "Application of ant colony optimization algorithm in process planning optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369800001"}
