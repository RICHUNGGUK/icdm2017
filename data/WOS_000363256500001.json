The concatenated coding scheme brings together a maximum rank distance code as an outer code and either a globally regenerating or a locally repairable code as an inner code. In addition, error resilience for combination of locally repairable codes with regenerating codes is considered. This concatenated coding system is designed to handle two different types of adversarial errors: the first type includes an adversary that can replace the content of an affected node only once; while the second type studies an adversary that is capable of polluting data an unbounded number of times. The paper establishes an upper bound on the resilience capacity for a locally repairable code. This paper also proves that the proposed concatenated coding approach attains the upper bound on the resilience capacity in the presence of the first type of adversary for both minimum storage regenerating codes and locally repairable codes. Further, this paper presents mechanisms that combine the presented concatenated coding scheme with subspace signatures to achieve error resilience for the second type of errors.", "paper_title": "Error-Correcting Regenerating and Locally Repairable Codes via Rank-Metric Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000363256500001"}
