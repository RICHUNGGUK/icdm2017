The 3D graphical representation also avoids loss of information accompanying alternative 2D and 3D representation in which the curve standing for DNA overlaps and intersects itself. The geometrical centers of the 3D graph of DNA sequences indicate the distribution of base frequencies. An interesting phenomenon is observed for Goat and Gallus beta-globin genomes with high G+C content. The examination of similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences of the first exon of beta-globin gene of different species illustrates the utility of the approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
