In traditional public utilities, technology and standardization developments enable customers to seamlessly migrate across utility providers without being required to make changes to their home appliances. However, this is not the case with cloud computing, the so-called \"fifth utility.\" Currently, cloud computing customers do not have at their disposal user-friendly tools and mechanisms that can preserve application deployments across different resource providers. Here, the authors present current efforts to develop an open source Cloud Application Management Framework (CAMF) based on the Eclipse Rich Client Platform. This framework facilitates cloud application lifecycle management in a vendor-neutral way.", "paper_title": "Enabling Interoperable Cloud Application Management through an Open Source Ecosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000355209600009"}
