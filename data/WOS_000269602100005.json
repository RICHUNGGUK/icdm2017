From a technical point of view, this objective requires middleware technology which is able to cope with the stringent interoperability, multi-lingualism, distribution, and privacy requirements arising in eHealth settings. This paper presents triplespace computing, a coordination middleware for the Semantic Web,and demonstrates its relevance to the realization of the European Patient Summary, an infrastructure for sharing and coordinating access to patient summaries at the European level.
