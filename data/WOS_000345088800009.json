In this article we show how computer graphics and visualization techniques have played an important role in real-time visualization, data management, modelling, and data fusion in an increasing number of applications such as surveying engineering, structure analysis, architecture, archaeology and cultural heritage. Specifically, we describe the typical modelling steps involved in the creation of a range of digital documents provided by the 3D digitization company Artescan to customers. We present how these modelling steps were applied in the context of creating digital documents used in the preservation of Mosteiro da Batalha.", "paper_title": "3D modelling of laser scanned and photogrammetric data for digital documentation: the Mosteiro da Batalha case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000345088800009"}
