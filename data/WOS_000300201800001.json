To do so, we use the concept of fuzzy set, which can be seen as a special kind of fuzzy multiset, to define a generalization of Atanassov's operators for n-dimensional fuzzy values (called n-dimensional intervals). We prove that our generalized Atanassov's operators also generalize OWA operators of any dimension by allowing negative weights. We apply our results to a decision making problem. We also extend the notions of aggregating functions, in particular t-norms, fuzzy negations and automorphism and related notions for n-dimensional framework. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
