We use one dimensional circular profile to represent iris features. The reduced and significant features afterward are extracted by Sobel operator and 1-D wavelet transform. So as to improve the accuracy, this paper combines probabilistic neural network (PNN) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for an optimized PNN classifier model. A comparative experiment of existing methods for iris recognition is evaluated on CASIA iris image databases. The experimental results reveal the proposed algorithm provides superior performance in iris recognition.
