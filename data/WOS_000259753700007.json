We use spectral Chebyshev collocation in r, spectral Fourier collocation in 0, and a simple integral condition to specify the value of the approximate solution at the center of the disk. The scheme is solved at a quasi optimal cost using the idea of superposition, a matrix decomposition algorithm, and fast Fourier transforms. Both the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are considered and extensions to equations with variable coefficients are discussed. Numerical results confirm the spectral convergence of the method. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
