Often uncertainties may be associated with demand and relevant costs. In most of the existing models uncertainties are treated as randomness and are handled by appealing to probability theory. Here, we propose a fuzzy mathematical programming model for a supply chain which considers multiple depots, multiple vehicles, multiple products, multiple customers, and different time periods. In this work not only demand and cost but also decision variables are considered to be fuzzy. We apply two ranking functions for solving the model. The aim of the fuzzy mathematical program is to select the appropriate depots among candidate depots, the allocation of orders to depots and vehicles, also the allocation of the returning vehicles to depots, to minimize the total costs. To validate the model some numerical experiments are worked out and a comparative analysis is investigated. Also, a regression model is considered to analyze the applied fuzzy ranking methods.
