Under some low-dimensional conditions, it is shown that the network can be pinned to a homogenous state by applying adaptive feedback control actions to a small fraction of network nodes. In particular, the paper addresses how to determine a set of pinned nodes for a linearly coupled delayed neural network model with fixed coupling matrices and strengths. Numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical analysis. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
