Based on these blending functions, trigonometric B,zier curves analogous to the quartic B,zier curves, with two exponential shape parameters, are presented. The ellipses and parabolas can be represented exactly by using the trigonometric B,zier curves. Based on the blending functions, trigonometric B-spline curves with three local shape parameters and a global shape parameter are also constructed. The obtained spline curves can be C (2)a (c) FC (2k+3) (kaa\"currency sign(+)) continuous by fixing some values of the shape parameters. Without solving a linear system, the spline curves can be also used to interpolate sets of points with C (2) continuity partly or entirely.", "paper_title": "Curve construction based on five trigonometric blending functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000310992400008"}
