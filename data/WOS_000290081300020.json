A popular approach is to combine p-values. Motivated by the observation that p-values under the alternative are stochastically smaller than p-values under the null, we develop new combination rules that explicitly account for this ordering. The new combination rules are broadly applicable, optimal against some alternatives, and highly efficient against optimal procedures. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
