The controllers are designed by introducing certain well-defined sign functions and neural network approximations as well as by using the backstepping technique. The salient feature of the approach is that no knowledge is assumed on unknown system parameters and nonlinearities. It is shown that the proposed controller not only can guarantee semiglobal stability, but also excellent transient performance can be achieved. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
