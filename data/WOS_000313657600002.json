Based on a useful inequality and Kronecker product technique, a new criterion is obtained, which has fewer unknown variables and is a significant improvement in the performance. Synchronization criteria are derived by some new mathematical skills and Schur complement. The result is expressed by linear matrix inequalities, which can be easily computed and checked in practice. Finally, numerical examples will be used to show the effectiveness of the obtained result.", "paper_title": "New global synchronization analysis for complex networks with coupling delay based on a useful inequality", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600002"}
