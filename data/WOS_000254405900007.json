For a one-dimensional ad-hoc network G(1), assuming all the nodes are independently uniform distributed in a closed interval [0, Z](z is an element of R+), we derive a generic formula for the probability that the network is connected. The finite connected ad-hoc networks is analyzed. And we separately suggest necessary conditions to make the ad-hoc network to be connected in one and two dimensional cases, facing possible failed nodes (f-nodes). Based on the necessary condition and unit-disk assumption for the node transmission, we prove that the nodes of the connected two-dimensional ad-hoc networks (G(2)) can be divided into at most five different groups. For an f-node n (0) in either of the five groups, we derive a close formula for the probability that there is at least one route between a pair of nodes in G(2) - {n(0)}.", "paper_title": "Connectivity in finite ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000254405900007"}
