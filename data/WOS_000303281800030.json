Fresenius Medical Care (FME) as a global provider of dialysis services through its NephroCare network has a strong interest in monitoring patient satisfaction. The aim of the paper is to test and validate a methodology for detecting a residual area of low satisfaction in dialysis patients. The FME Patient Satisfaction Programme questionnaire was distributed to haemodialysis (HD) patients treated in 335 centers of its network. It contained 79 questions covering various satisfaction aspects regarding Dialysis Unit, Dialysis Arrangement, Nurses, Doctors, etc. To analyse the data provided by the questionnaire, the Self-Organising Map (SOM) method was used. SOM is a neural network model for clustering and projecting high-dimensional data into a low-dimensional space, preserving topological relationships of original high-dimensional data spaces. 10,632 HD patients completed the questionnaire. Mean age was 63.05 +/- 14.93 years with 56.69% males. Response rate was 66%. Overall level of satisfaction was 1.99 (range from -3 to +3). On average patients were very satisfied with all issues. Nevertheless, a group of patients, around 60 years old, balanced gender ratio, whose level of satisfaction was lower than 1, were highlighted. In the NephroCare clinics patient satisfaction with service is rather high. While traditional analysis usually stops here, the SOM method allows identification of areas of potential improvement for specific patient groups. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
