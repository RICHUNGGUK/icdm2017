The cardinality of the minimum R(k)-vertex-cut of G is the R(k)-connectivity of G, denoted by K(k)(G). This parameter measures a kind of conditional fault tolerance of networks. This parameter measures a kind of conditional fault tolerance of networks. In this paper, we determine R(1)-connectivity and R(2)-connectivity of (n, k)-star graphs. (C) 2010 Elsevier By.
