In this paper, a new online control strategy of a static synchronous series compensator (SSSC) is proposed to improve the transient stability of power systems. In this strategy, an auxiliary damping controller with an adaptive structure is used to generate an essential signal which can enhance the damping of the SSSC. This auxiliary damping controller consists of a Wiener-type neural network controller (WNNC). The back propagation (BP) algorithm is utilized to online training of the WNNC. The Lyapunov method is used to guarantee the stability of WNNC. The test power system is a two-area four-machine system power. The simulation results show that the oscillations are satisfactorily damped out by the WNNC. The proposed approach is effective to mitigate power system oscillations and improve the stability. Since the Lyapunov stability theory is used to obtain the adaptive learning rates, the stability of closed-loop system can be guaranteed. In this case, the overall control scheme has capabilities of learning and adaptiveness.", "paper_title": "Suppression of inter-area oscillations in a multi-machine power system using a new intelligent controller", "paper_id": "WOS:000349834500043"}
