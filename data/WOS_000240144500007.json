The searching movement of the legs after stepping into the gap is analyzed in the first part of this study. Based on these and earlier biological results, a simulation study is carried out using WALKNET, a neural network model of the stick insect walking system. Five new modules are implemented into the model in the form of a unit assembly system. The performance of the enhanced model is evaluated in a series of tests designed based on previous biological experiments. The simulation study shows that with only four new modules (for searching movements, velocity control, a load effect and short steps), the performance of the model in a simulated gap crossing situation can be improved beyond the performance of the biological system under comparable conditions.", "paper_title": "Crossing large gaps: A simulation study of stick insect behavior", "paper_id": "WOS:000240144500007"}
