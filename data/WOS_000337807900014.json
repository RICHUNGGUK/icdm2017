In this case, one of the most often adopted strategies for manipulating qubits is that of using external magnetic fields. However, selectively applying a field just to one qubit may be a practically unattainable goal, as it is, for instance, in most solid-state based setups. In this work, we present a proposal for using nonlinear excitations of solitonic type to accomplish the above task. Our scheme entails the generation of a dynamical soliton in a classical spin-chain which is locally coupled with one qubit: as the soliton runs through, the qubit behaves, due to its interaction with the chain, as if it were subject to a magnetic field with a time dependence that follows from the soliton's features. We here present results for the time evolution of the qubit density-matrix induced by the overall dynamics of the above scheme.", "paper_title": "Using solitons for manipulating qubits", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807900014"}
