Although these statistics has been formulated using crisp mathematics, their use returns statements about \"quality control\" which are full of vagueness (for example, the aforementioned idea of precise or imprecise processes). For this reason, it seems both natural and interesting to introduce tools from Fuzzy Sets Theory for the formulation of quality control models. Fuzzy Sets shall be used to study process quality capability and to generate a bilateral simultaneous control for the central tendency and a unilateral one for variability. We shall define linguistic rules in order to perform this control and membership functions for the sample control mean and deviation, (x) over cap and (s) over cap.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy set based protocols for process quality control", "paper_id": "WOS:000236240800006"}
