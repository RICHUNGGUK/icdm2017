Domain-specific enterprise websites are similar in the topic structures and textual contents. Considering the semantic information of website content terms, a novel website feature vector modelling method representing website topic were proposed on the basis of vector space model. The feature vector elements integrated textual semantic information about topic content and structure information through different semantic terms and weighting schema respectively. The contrast recognition performances demonstrate that this feature analysis approach to website topic gives full potentials for specific enterprise web search.", "paper_title": "Topic-based website feature analysis for enterprise search from the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200008"}
