In the Constraint Programming resolution process, it is known that the order in which the variables are assigned have a significant impact in terms of computational cost. In this paper we propose a new framework for guiding the classical Constraint Programming resolution process. Such a framework is able to measure the resolution process, using some indicators, in order to perform on-the-fly replacements of variable/value ordering heuristics exhibiting poor performances. The replacement is performed depending on a quality rank, which is computed by means of a choice function-based Hyperheuristic, where its parameters are fine-tuned by a Genetic Algorithm which trains the choice function carrying out a sampling phase. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach where our combination of strategies outperforms the use of individual strategies.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Selection of Enumeration Strategies for Solving Constraint Satisfaction Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000314525100003"}
