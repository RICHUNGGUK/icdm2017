In this paper, we implement a force-sensing glove system for measuring real-time hand forces during motorbike riding with the aim of giving feedback to the riders. It consists of a pair of gloves with tactile sensors suitably mounted and configured for data acquisition via a wireless smartphone. A novel calibration method is developed for dynamic calibration considering force measurement in natural operation and environments. Consequently, a series of data classification algorithms ensure accurate hand performance feedbacks for motorbike riders. The feedback data could potentially alert the riders to predict and prevent accidents. Validation tests demonstrate that this force-sensing glove system has a strong potential as a tool for hand performance monitoring in real environment.", "paper_title": "Force-Sensing Glove System for Measurement of Hand Forces during Motorbike Riding", "paper_id": "WOS:000366423200001"}
