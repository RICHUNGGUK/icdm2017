The model was tested by measuring students' perceptions, who participated in an experimental study that required them to use a GCP for collaboratively planning a trip. Students used Yahoo! Trip Planner (YITP) for forming groups and then for identifying, selecting and discussing the inclusion and scheduling of geo-referenced travel activities, places and itineraries on the top of a map. The findings confirmed the multidimensionality of the YITP's impact on collaborative decision making, but the respondents gave a greater importance to the process (i.e. effectiveness and community building) rather than the outcome impacts (efficiency and results) of YITP. Specifically, the findings show that GCP can effectively support and foster teamwork, when GCP are designed to scaffold the group tasks, manage group intelligence, as well as facilitate and nurture group communication and bonding processes. The outcome impacts of GCP related to both qualitative (e.g. group consensus) and quantitative items (e.g. time and effort savings). Finally, the study discusses the implications of the findings on further investigating the functionality and effectiveness of GCP.
