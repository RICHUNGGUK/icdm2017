Because of long time-delay of the DOSP measurements, multi-step-ahead predictions are obtained recursively by Levinson predictor and then used as input of DRNN. Simulation results on the actual industrial process data show that the proposed dynamic soft-sensing model took good effects practically and significantly diminished the time-delay of output value.", "paper_title": "Dynamic soft-sensing model by combining diagonal recurrent neural network with Levinson predictor", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300154"}
