Those models advance classical RBAC models in that they regulate the access to sensitive resources based on the position of mobile users. An issue that has not yet been investigated is how to administer spatially-aware access control policies. In this paper we introduce GEO-RBAC Admin, the administration model for the location-based GEO-RBAC model. We discuss the concepts underlying such administrative model and present a language for the specification of GEO-RBAC policies.", "paper_title": "Spatial Domains for the Administration of Location-based Access Control Policies", "paper_id": "WOS:000260618200004"}
