Cryan and Dyer [J. Comput. System Sci., 67 ( 2003), pp. 291 - 310] have recently given a fully polynomial randomized approximation scheme (fpras) for the related counting problem, which employs Markov chain methods indirectly. They leave open the question as to whether a natural Markov chain on such tables mixes rapidly. Here we show that the \"2 x 2 heat-bath\" Markov chain is rapidly mixing. We prove this by considering first a heat-bath chain operating on a larger window. Using techniques developed by Morris [ Random Walks in Convex Sets, Ph. D. thesis, Department of Statistics, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 2000] and Morris and Sinclair [ SIAM J. Comput., 34 ( 2004), pp. 195 - 226] for the multidimensional knapsack problem, we show that this chain mixes rapidly. We then apply the comparison method of Diaconis and Saloff-Coste [ Ann. Appl. Probab., 3 ( 1993), pp. 696 - 730] to show that the 2 x 2 chain is also rapidly mixing.", "paper_title": "Rapidly mixing Markov chains for sampling contingency tables with a constant number of rows", "paper_id": "WOS:000238324600012"}
