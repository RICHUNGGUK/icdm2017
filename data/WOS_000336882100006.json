We have a collection of n players, each with a budget for purchasing links. Each link has a cost and a length. Each node has a preference weight for each node, and its objective is to purchase outgoing links within its budget to minimize its sum of preference-weighted distances to the nodes. We show that determining if a BBC game has pure Nash equilibria is NP-hard. We study (n, k)-uniform BBC games, where all link costs, lengths, and preferences are equal and every budget equals k. We show that pure Nash equilibria exist for all (n, k)-uniform BBC games and all equilibria are essentially fair. We construct a family of equilibria spanning the spectrum from minimum to maximum social cost. We also analyze best-response walks and alternative node objectives. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
