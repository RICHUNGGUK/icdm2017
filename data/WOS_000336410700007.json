Users can add tags on Web pages to allow easy comprehension and retrieval of Web pages. However, tag spams could also be added to promote the opportunity of being referenced of a Web page, which is troublesome to users for accessing uninterested Web pages. In this work, we proposed a scheme to automatically detect such tag spams using a proposed text mining approach based on self-organizing map (SOM) model. We used SOM to find the associations among Web pages as well as tags. Such associations were then used to discover the relationships between Web pages and tags. Tag spams can then be detected according to such relationships. Experiments were conducted on a set of Web pages collected from a social bookmarking site and obtained promising result.", "paper_title": "Detecting tag spams for social bookmarking Websites using a text mining approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000336410700007"}
