In this paper, gossiping of a single source with multiple messages is treated, for networks modeled as certain structured graphs, wherein upper bounds of the high-probability completion time are established through a novel \"dependency graph\" technique. The results shed useful insights into the behavior of multiple-message gossiping and can be useful for data dissemination in sensor networks, multihopping content distribution, and file downloading in peer-to-peer networks.", "paper_title": "Gossiping with Message Splitting on Structured Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349112200001"}
