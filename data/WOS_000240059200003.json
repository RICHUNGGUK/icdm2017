One drawback of these protocols, however, is that they cannot prevent a \"collusion attack\" in which two key generation servers communicate with each other to get useful information about the user's private key. In this paper, we present two new server-aided RSA key generation protocols secure against such an attack. In addition to this, we adopt a fast primality test in our protocols, which is locally run on a hand-held device. In the concluding section a weakness of the proposed protocol is discussed.", "paper_title": "Server-aided RSA key generation against collusion attack", "paper_id": "WOS:000240059200003"}
