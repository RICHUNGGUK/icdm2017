We present AlarmNet, a novel system for assisted living and residential monitoring that uses a two-way flow of data and analysis between the front- and back-ends to enable context-aware protocols that are tailored to residents' individual patterns of living. AlarmNet integrates environmental, physiological, and activity sensors in a scalable heterogeneous architecture. The SenQ query protocol provides real-time access to data and lightweight in-network processing. Circadian activity rhythm analysis learns resident activity patterns and feeds them back into the network to aid context-aware power management and dynamic privacy policies.", "paper_title": "Context-aware wireless sensor networks for assisted living and residential monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000258031400006"}
