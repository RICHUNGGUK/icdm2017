However, traditional optical character recognition (OCR) and handwritten character recognition (HCR) technologies are not suitable for calligraphic character retrieval. In this paper, a novel shape descriptor called SC-HoG is proposed by integrating global and local features for more discriminability, where a gradient descent algorithm is used to learn the optimal combining parameter. Then two efficient methods, keypoint-based method and locality sensitive hashing (LSH) based method, are proposed to accelerate the retrieval by reducing the feature set and converting the feature set to a feature vector. Finally, a re-ranking method is described for practicability. The approach filters query-dissimilar characters using the LSH-based method to obtain candidates first, and then re-ranks the candidates using the keypoint- or sample-based method. Experimental results demonstrate that our approaches are effective and efficient for calligraphic character retrieval.", "paper_title": "Efficient shape matching for Chinese calligraphic character retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000297416200002"}
