Methods and material: Domain knowledge is used to create a set of heuristics that guide the various steps involved in the process. Initially, using an eye fundus colour image as input, a set of hypothesis points was obtained that exhibited geometric properties and intensity levels similar to the ONH contour pixels. Next, a genetic algorithm was used to find an ellipse containing the maximum number of hypothesis points in an offset of its perimeter, considering some constraints. The ellipse thus obtained is the approximation to the ONH. The segmentation method is tested in a sample of 110 eye fundus images, belonging to 55 patients with glaucoma (23.1%) and eye hypertension (76.9%) and random selected from an eye fundus image base belonging to the Ophthalmology Service at Miguel Servet Hospital, Saragossa (Spain). Results and conclusions: The results obtained are competitive with those in the literature. The method's generalization capability is reinforced when it is applied to a different image base from the one used in our study and a discrepancy curve is obtained very similar to the one obtained in our image base. In addition, the robustness of the method proposed can be seen in the high percentage of images obtained with a discrepancy 6 < 5 (96% and 99% in our and a different image base, respectively). The results also confirm the hypothesis that the ONH contour can be property approached with a non-deformable ellipse. Another important aspect of themethod is that it directly provides the parameters characterising the shape of the papilla: lengths of its major and minor axes, its centre of location and its orientation with regard to the horizontal position.
