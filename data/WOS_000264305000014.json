Two separate solvers, one using high order finite difference methods and another using the node-centered unstructured finite volume method are coupled in a truly stable way. The two flow solvers run independently and receive and send information from each other by using a third coupling code. Exact solutions to the Euler equations are used to verify the accuracy and stability of the new computational procedure. We also demonstrate the capability of the new procedure in a calculation of the flow in and around a model of a coral. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
