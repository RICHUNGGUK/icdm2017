This work proposed a Dynamic Clique-based Link Scheduling algorithm (DCLS) with minimal bandwidth guarantee for a WiMAX mesh backhaul network. DCLS includes two phases. First, it exploits a novel scheme based on cliques to maximize parallel transmission and ensure minimum bandwidth guarantee. Second, it employs a bandwidth tracking scheduling to enhance fairness among users. Simulation results show that DCLS performs better than existing scheduling schemes in network throughput and fairness.", "paper_title": "DCLS: A Fair and Efficient Scheduling with Bandwidth Guarantee in WiMAX Mesh Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280434700017"}
