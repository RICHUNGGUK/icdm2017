This method is based on a statistical estimation of the discrete tangent plane on the voxels of the discrete surface. A geometrical constraint is used to control the recognition of the tangent plane. The resulting surface representation allows us to get both smooth normal vectors of the surface and a smooth surface mesh while preserving the geometrical properties of the surface.
