Recent studies proposed an algebraic approach to the solution of classic economic order quantity (EOQ) and the economic production quantity (EPQ) models without reference to the use of derivatives. This paper extends it to the solution of a specific EPQ model as was examined by Chiu et al. [Chiu, S. W., Chen, K.-K., & Lin, H.-D. (in press). Numerical method for determination of the optimal lot size for a manufacturing system with discontinuous issuing policy and rework. International Journal for Numerical Methods in Biomedical Engineering. doi:10.1002/cnm.1369]. As a result, optimal replenishment lot size and a simplified optimal production-inventory cost formula for such a particular EPQ model can be derived without derivatives. This alternative approach may enable practitioners who with little knowledge of calculus to understand the realistic production systems with ease. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
