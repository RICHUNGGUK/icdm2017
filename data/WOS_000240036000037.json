The proposed system for the symbol recognition consists of 3 steps: 1) degradation model preprocessing step, 2) a different normalization for the second moment invariant and a measure for roundness and eccentricity for feature extraction step, 3) k-Nearest Neighbor with Mahalanobis distance compared to Euclidean distance and k-D tree for classifier. A comparison using multi-layer feed forward neural network classifier is given. An improvement of the discriminant factor around 4 times is achieved compared to that of the original normalized second moments using GREC 2005 dataset. Experimentally we tested our system with 3300 training images using k-NN classifier and on all 9450 images given in the dataset and achieved recognition rates higher than 86 % for all degradation models and 96 % for degradation models 1 to 4.", "paper_title": "Robust moment invariant with higher discriminant factor based on Fisher discriminant analysis for symbol recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000037"}
