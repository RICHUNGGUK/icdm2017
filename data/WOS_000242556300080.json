A set of compounded mutations for binary chromosome through combining the local asexually reproducing with multiple mean step size search was proposed, and a gradually approach method for evolving larger scale images was fabricated. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the computing time much more, and can scale up the image size increasing up to 70 times with relative slower increase speed of computing time.", "paper_title": "Towards intrinsic evolvable hardware for predictive lossless image compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300080"}
