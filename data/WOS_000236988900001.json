We propose to harness the power of conditional estimators for correlation attacks on these ciphers. Conditional estimators compensate for some of the obfuscating effects of the irregular clocking, resulting in a correlation with a considerably higher bias. On GSM's cipher A5/1, a factor two is gained in the correlation bias compared to previous correlation attacks. We mount an attack on A5/1 using conditional estimators and using three weaknesses that we observe in one of A5/1's LFSRs (known as R2). The weaknesses imply a new criterion that should be taken into account by cipher designers. Given 1500-2000 known-frames (about 4.9-9.2 conversation seconds of known keystream), our attack completes within a few tens of seconds to a few minutes on a PC, with a success rate of about 91%. To complete our attack, we present a source of known-keystream in GSM that can provide the keystream for our attack given 3-4 minutes of GSM ciphertext, transforming our attack to a ciphertext-only attack.", "paper_title": "Conditional estimators: An effective attack on A5/1", "paper_id": "WOS:000236988900001"}
