Existing models present some drawbacks that may limit their regulatory application. In this study, a dataset of 908 chemicals was used to develop a QSAR model to predict the LC50 96 hours for the fathead minnow. Genetic algorithms combined with k nearest neighbour method were applied on the training set (726 chemicals) and resulted in a model based on six molecular descriptors. An automated assessment of the applicability domain (AD) was carried out by comparing the average distance of each molecule from the nearest neighbours with a fixed threshold. The model had good and balanced performance in internal and external validation (182 test molecules), at the expense of a percentage of molecules outside the AD. Principal Component Analysis showed apparent correlations between model descriptors and toxicity.", "paper_title": "A similarity-based QSAR model for predicting acute toxicity towards the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas)", "paper_id": "WOS:000351156100001"}
