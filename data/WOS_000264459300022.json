It belongs to table decision making to choose the pivotal fields or partition fields into conditions and decisions to discover their causality. This paper is intended to list the basic operations to achieve the aims and to explore possible solving methods. Design/methodology/approach - Methods, to some degree, means problem transformation. That is, a problem can be converted to another problem and then to be solved. This paper is developed to explore possible problem transformations surrounding the basic table decision operations. Findings - The basic table decision operations can be converted to two different types of problems. Originality/value - This paper provides formal description of the basic table decision operations and their transforming schemes so that strict mathematical proof can be used to guarantee their correctness.", "paper_title": "Pansystems decision making on tables", "paper_id": "WOS:000264459300022"}
