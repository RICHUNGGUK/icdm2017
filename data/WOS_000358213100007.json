In fact, for some large real problems, it is accepted that after tremendous learning time (within finite epochs), the network output error of SLFN will stop or reduce increasingly slowly. This report offers an extreme learning machine (ELM)-based learning method, referred to as the parent-offspring progressive learning method. The proposed method works by separating the data points into various parts, and then multiple ELMs learn and identify the clustered parts separately. The key advantages of the proposed algorithms as compared to the traditional supervised methods are twofold. First, it extends the ELM learning method from a single neural network to a multi-network learning system, as the proposed multiELM method can approximate any target continuous function and classify disjointed regions. Second, the proposed method tends to deliver a similar or much better generalization performance than other learning methods. All the methods proposed in this paper are tested on both artificial and real datasets.", "paper_title": "Data Partition Learning With Multiple Extreme Learning Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100007"}
