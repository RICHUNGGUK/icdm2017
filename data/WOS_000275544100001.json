In this paper, a volume preserving density filter based on Heaviside functions is presented. Different from earlier Heaviside density filters, this filter is volume preserving, which ensures efficiency and stability in optimization. The new filter is compared with four other filters through a compliance minimization problem.", "paper_title": "Volume preserving nonlinear density filter based on heaviside functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000275544100001"}
