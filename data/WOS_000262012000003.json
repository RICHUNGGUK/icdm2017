Discretization of the corresponding integral equations by method of moment (MoM) with Rao-Wilton-Glisson (RWG.) basis functions can model arbitrarily shaped planar structures, but usually leads to a fully populated matrix. AIM could ilia p these basis functions onto a rectangular grid, where the Toeplitz property of the Green's function would be utilized, which enables the calculation of the matrix-vector multiplication by use of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) technique. It reduces the memory requirement from O(N(2)) to O(N) and the operation complexity from O(N(2)) to O(N log N), where N is the number of unknowns. The resultant equations are then solved by the loose generalized minimal residual method (LGMRES) to accelerate iteration, which converges much faster than the conventional conjugate gradient method (CG). Furthermore, several preconditioning techniques are employed to enhance the computational efficiency of the LGMRES. Some typical microstrip circuits and microstrip antenna array are analyzed and numerical results show that the preconditioned LGMRES can converge much faster than conventional LGMRES.
