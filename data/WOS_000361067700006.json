Both static and dynamic power dissipations are increasing, caused mainly by the intrinsic leakage currents and large data traffic. Alternative approaches beyond charge-only-based electronics, and in particular, spin-based devices, show promising potential to overcome these issues by adding the spin freedom of electrons to electronic circuits. Spintronics provides data non-volatility, fast data access, and low-power operation, and has now become a hot topic in both academia and industry for achieving ultra-low-power circuits and systems. The ITRS report on emerging research devices identified the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) nanopillar (one of the Spintronics nanodevices) as one of the most promising technologies to be part of future micro-electronic circuits. In this review we will give an overview of the status and prospects of spin-based devices and circuits that are currently under intense investigation and development across the world, and address particularly their merits and challenges for practical applications. We will also show that, with a rapid development of Spintronics, some novel computing architectures and paradigms beyond classic Von-Neumann architecture have recently been emerging for next-generation ultra-low-power circuits and systems.", "paper_title": "Spintronics: Emerging Ultra-Low-Power Circuits and Systems beyond MOS Technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000361067700006"}
