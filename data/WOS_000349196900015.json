The model is intended for reactive gas-solid flows in bubbling fluidized bed reactors. A model is desired that allows for a more complex description of the fluidized bed reactors (e.g. prediction of the bed expansion) relative to the conventional fluidized bed reactor models such as, e.g., Kunii-Levenspiel type of models. The model should not predict details in the flow as the two- and three-dimensional Euler two-fluid models in order to ensure reasonable simulation costs. In particular, the two- and three-dimensional Euler two-fluid models challenges the current available computational capacity for studies of reactive flows. The novel sorption-enhanced steam methane reforming (SE-SMR) technology is simulated in the bubbling bed regime. Simulation results of the one-dimensional Euler two-fluid model is compared to both a two-dimensional Euler model and a conventional fluidized bed model consisting of mass and heat balances. Furthermore, a sensitivity study to operation conditions and transport coefficients is performed for the one-dimensional Euler two-fluid model. The present simulation results reveal that the chemical process performance of the reactor is to a large extent determined by the imposed temperature in the reactor. Further, the one-dimensional Euler model provides an improvement of the simpler conventional fluidized bed reactor models by prediction of the bed expansion. Compared with the two-dimensional Euler model, cross-sectional averaging results in a significant reduction in the computational time but on the cost of loss of flow details.
