The system consists of energetic materials confined in a steel cylinder. The strain failure model of the confinement is a modified Johnson-Cook model with a statistical failure distribution. By using the size distribution data of the fragments from the thermal explosion tests, the failure strain distribution can be empirically obtained and then entered into the model. The simulated fracture and fragment sizes are compared with the experimental records.", "paper_title": "High-end modeling and simulation of cookoff of HMX-based energetic materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900053"}
