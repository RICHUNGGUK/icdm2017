Caregivers equipped with portable computers now have levels of interaction at the bedside not possible with paper charts and can leverage accurate real-time patient information at the point of care to diagnose and treat patients with greater speed and efficiency. We present a mobile medical application that integrates heterogenous medical media (e.g. textual patient case descriptions, relevant medical imagery, physician dictations and endoscopies) into encapsulated patient profiles. This paper provides an overview and initial evaluation of the MEDIC mobile healthcare recommender system that facilitates decision support for expert diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Contextual media integration and recommendation for mobile medical diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300044"}
