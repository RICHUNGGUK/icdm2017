Although this appears to be a basic instance of the hypergraph Turan problem (with a t-edge matching as the excluded hypergraph), progress on this question has remained elusive. In this paper, we verify this conjecture for all t < n/3k(2). This improves upon the best previously known range t = O(n/k(3)), which dates back to the 1970s.", "paper_title": "The Size of a Hypergraph and its Matching Number", "paper_id": "WOS:000302875400006"}
