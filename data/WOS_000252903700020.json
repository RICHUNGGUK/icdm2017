The expanding set of in silico approaches offers a flourishing ground for the acceleration of meaningful findings in this area by exploitation of rich and diverse sources of omic data. These approaches are cheap, flexible, extensible, often complementary and can continuously integrate new information and tests to improve the selection of genes responsible for hereditary diseases. Following this principle, we improved and extended our web-service TOM for the identification of candidate genes in the study of complex hereditary diseases.", "paper_title": "TOM: enhancement and extension of a tool suite for in silico approaches to multigenic hereditary disorders", "paper_id": "WOS:000252903700020"}
