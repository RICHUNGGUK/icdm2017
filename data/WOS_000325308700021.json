The proper orientation number of G is defined as (chi) over right arrow (G) = min(D is an element of Gamma) max(v is an element of v)(G)d((D) over bar)(v) where Gamma is the set of proper orientations of G. We have chi(G) 1 <= (chi) over right arrow (G) <= Delta(G), where chi(G) and Delta(G) denote the chromatic number and the maximum degree of G, respectively. We show that, it is NP-complete to decide whether (chi) over right arrow (G) = 2, for a given planar graph G. Also, we prove that there is a polynomial time algorithm for determining the proper orientation number of 3-regular graphs. In sharp contrast, we will prove that this problem is NP-hard for 4-regular graphs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
