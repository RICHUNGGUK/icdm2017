We show that in each mixed cell the piecewise linear interface reconstruction and the approximation of the derivatives and curvature based on three consecutive height function values are second-order accurate. We also discuss the quadratic reconstruction and fourth-order accurate expressions of the normal and curvature. We present a hierarchical algorithm to compute the normal vector and curvature of an interface line with the height function method that switches automatically between second- and fourth-order approximations and that can be applied also when the local radius of curvature is of the order of the grid spacing.
