These ODEs can be derived as limits of Markovian models under a natural scaling as the number of nodes increases. While an analytical study of Markovian models is quite complex and numerical solution impractical for large networks, the corresponding ODE models yield closed-form expressions for several performance metrics of interest, and a numerical solution complexity that does not increase with the number of nodes. Using this ODE approach, we investigate how resources such as buffer space and the number of copies made for a packet can be traded for faster delivery, illustrating the differences among various forwarding and recovery schemes considered. We perform model validations through simulation studies. Finally we consider the effect of buffer management by complementing the forwarding models with Markovian and fluid buffer models.
