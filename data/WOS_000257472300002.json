However, when it is applied to the downlink of a cellular system with universal frequency reuse, users near the sector boundary may experience significant interference from more than one sector. The use of a minimum mean square error (MMSE)-type receiver may not sufficiently cancel out the interference unless a sufficient number of receive antennas are used. In this paper, we consider the use of inter-sector beamforming that cooperates with a neighboring sector in the same cell to mitigate this interference problem in time-division duplex (TDD) environments. The proposed scheme can avoid interference from an adjacent sec- tor in the same cell, while enhancing the transmit array gain by using the TDD reciprocity. The performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed in terms of the output signal-to-interference-plus noise power ratio (SINR) and the output capacity when applied to an MMSE-type receiver. The beamforming mode can be analytically switched between the inter-sector and the single-sector mode based on the long-term channel information. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed scheme is verified by computer simulation.", "paper_title": "Inter-sector beamforming with MMSE receiver in the downlink of TDD cellular systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257472300002"}
