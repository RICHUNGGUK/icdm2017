The model contains a surface scattering component together with a subsurface scattering component. The former component corresponds to the roughness on the upper surface boundary and is modeled using the modified Beckmann model. The latter component accounts for both refraction due to Fresnel transmission through the layer and rough (Beckmann) scattering at the lower layer boundary. Depending on the type of surface, the contributions of the two scattering components to the total outgoing radiance can vary dramatically for different materials. This behavior is conveniently captured by allowing a balance parameter in the model. Our experiments with BRDF data from several types of surface and with different scales of roughness confirm that the new model outperforms alternative variants of the Beckmann model together with several alternative reflectance models.", "paper_title": "A light scattering model for layered rough surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600016"}
