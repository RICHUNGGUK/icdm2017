Particularly, finite element contact formulation was employed to simulate the sliding behavior of unbonded tendons. The contact formulation along with other discretizing schemes was selected to assemble the post-tensioned concrete system. Three previously tested unbonded post-tensioned two-way and one-way slabs with different reinforcement configurations and boundary conditions were modeled. Numerical results were compared against experimental data in terms of global pressure-deflection relationship, stiffness degradation, cracking pattern, and stress variation in unbonded tendons. All comparisons indicate a very good agreement between the simulations and experiments. The exercise of model validation showcased the robustness and reliability of the proposed modeling approach applied to numerical simulation of post-tensioned concrete slabs.", "paper_title": "Modeling of post-tensioned one-way and two-way slabs with unbonded tendons", "paper_id": "WOS:000337303300001"}
