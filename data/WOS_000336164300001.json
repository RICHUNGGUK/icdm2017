We compare them in terms of energy consumption. By including both positive and negative acknowledgement, our second proposed scheme can effectively reduce the number of unnecessary error control messages and, thereby, significantly reducing the unnecessary power consumption relative to the first scheme. Also, we provide an analytical framework for the evaluation of different reliable broadcast techniques. Simulation results show that Scheme 2 achieves energy savings of up to about 85% compared to Scheme 1.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Reliable Broadcast Protocol for WSNs Based on IEEE 802.15.5", "paper_id": "WOS:000336164300001"}
