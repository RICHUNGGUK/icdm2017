This field of study, which was the subject of 2006 Nobel Prize of medicine, has drastically changed the conventional methods of analysis of genes. A large number of images have been produced by the RNAi experiments. Even though a number of capable special purpose methods have been proposed recently for the processing of RNAi images but there is no customized compression scheme for these images. Hence, highly proficient tools are required to compress these images. In this paper, we propose a new efficient lossless compression scheme for the RNAi images. A new predictor specifically designed for these images is proposed. It is shown that pixels can be classified into three categories based on their intensity distributions. Using classification of pixels based on the intensity fluctuations among the neighbors of a pixel a context-based method is designed. Comparisons of the proposed method with the existing state-of-the-art lossless compression standards and well-known general-purpose methods are performed to show the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Lossless Compression of RNAi Fluorescence Images Using Regional Fluctuations of Pixels", "paper_id": "WOS:000321144400001"}
