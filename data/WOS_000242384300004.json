The device structure was CuPc(12 nm)/NPB(40 nm)/ADN:DCJTB(0.2%):TBPe(1%)(50 nm)/Alq:C545(0.5%)(12 nm)/ LiF(4 nm)/Al. Here copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) is a buffer layer, N,N'-di(naphthalene-1-yl)-N,N'-dipheyl-benzidine (NPB) is a hole transporting layer, 9,10-di-(2-naphthyl) anthracene (ADN) is blue emitting layer, tris (8-quinolinolato)aluminium complex (Alq) is an electron transporting layer, 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-t-butyl-6-(1,1,7,7-tetramethyljulolidyl-9-enyl)-4H- pyran (DCJTB), 2,5,8,1 1-tetra-butylperylene (TBPe), Coumarin6 and deveriative (C545) are red, blue and green dyes, respectively. This device shows a luminance of 21200 cd/ m 2 at driving current of 400 mA/cm(2) and 1026 cd/m(2) at 20 mA/cm(2). Its efficiency is 6 cd/A and 3.11 Lm/W. It also shows a higher operating stability: the half lifetime is 22,245 h at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m(2), while the driving voltage increased only 0.3 V. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
