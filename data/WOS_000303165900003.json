Although their method uses Karatsuba's multiplication, a quadratic number of operations are still needed. In this paper, we extend their result by providing a complete reduction to polynomial multiplication in monomial basis, which therefore offers many subquadratic methods. Our reduction scheme does not rely on basis conversions and we demonstrate that it is efficient in practice. Finally, we show a linear time equivalence between the polynomial multiplication problem under monomial basis and under Chebyshev basis.", "paper_title": "On Polynomial Multiplication in Chebyshev Basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000303165900003"}
