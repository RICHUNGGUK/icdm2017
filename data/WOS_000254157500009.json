The problem is known to be NP-hard. Therefore, a branch-and-bound algorithm incorporating with several dominance properties and lower bounds is proposed to derive the optimal solution for the problem. In addition, easy-implemented heuristic algorithms are also provided to obtain the near-optimal solution. The computational experiments indicate that the branch-and-bound algorithm can solve most of the medium-job-sized problems within a reasonable time, and the heuristic is quite accurate with an average error percentage of less than 0.30%.
