Firstly, one circular feature template is attached onto a planar screen and a single un-calibrated camera observes the circular feature template and the tiled arrangement for each projector alternatively. Secondly, geometric coordinates on the planar screen for all features in each the are computed according to the two vanishing points from the perspective template image. Thirdly, the inscribed quadrangle region in the planar screen space is calculated as the effectively region of the tiled display. Finally the geometric alignment is achieved by the correspondence between the quadrangular mesh in the projector space and the one in the display space. Our algorithm removes the limitation against the parallelism between camera image plane and planar screen plane and improves the convenience to deploy a multi-projector display system. The provided experimental results demonstrate the validity and efficiency of our new method.", "paper_title": "Geometric calibration for multi-projector tiled display based on vanishing point theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200120"}
