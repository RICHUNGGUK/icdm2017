Advances in both hardware and software technology are expediting this move. Absence of a user friendly, cost effective and easy to apply advanced control strategy based software is the motivation for this work. In this paper we reviewed issues of software application in process control systems. We present the development of an advance process control software tool and its application on a pH neutralization plant. Neural network model based DIC (Direct Inverse Control) strategy is implemented to control the process. The application and results shows the viability and robustness of the advanced control software and its superiority over the conventional PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller.", "paper_title": "Advanced control software framework for process control applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000334125500004"}
