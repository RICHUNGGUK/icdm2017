Here, we identify such binding poses and their associated energetics and kinetics using molecular dynamics simulations on AmpC beta-lactamase. Only one of the crystallographic binding poses was found to be thermodynamically favorable; however, the ligand shows several binding poses within the pocket. This study demonstrates free-binding molecular simulations in the context of fragment-to-lead development and its potential application in drug design.", "paper_title": "Kinetic Characterization of Fragment Binding in AmpC beta-Lactamase by High-Throughput Molecular Simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000331992000002"}
