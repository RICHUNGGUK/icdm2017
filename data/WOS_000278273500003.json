But what capabilities are these and why do they seem to be so needed? In this essay, I consider several different consultancy specializations - business strategy, technology assessment, business process improvement, systems integration, business support services - and how they facilitate an IT innovation process both within and across firms. For each specialization. I examine the consultancy's capabilities and contributions both to the client (within an engagement) and to the broader support of the innovation (across and beyond engagements). The analysis suggests a number of conjectures as to the influence of consultancies on an IT innovation's adoption, diffusion and eventual institutionalization. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
