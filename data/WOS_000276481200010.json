The method partitions a set of functions into K clusters and represents each cluster by a simple prototype (e.g., piecewise constant). The total number of segments in the prototypes, P, is chosen by the user and optimally distributed among the clusters via two dynamic programming algorithms. The practical relevance of the method is shown on two real world datasets. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
