In this paper, a collaborative framework of a distributed agent-based intelligence system is addressed to control and resolve dynamic scheduling problem of distributed projects for practical purposes. If any delay event occurs, the self-interested activity agent, the major agent for the problem solving of dynamic scheduling in the framework, can automatically cooperate with other agents in real time to solve the problem through a two-stage decision-making process: the fuzzy decision-making process and the compensatory negotiation process. The first stage determines which behavior strategy will be taken by agents while delay event occurs, and prepares to next negotiation process; then the compensatory negotiations among agents are opened related with determination of compensations for respective decisions and strategies, to solve dynamic scheduling problem in the second stage. A prototype system is also developed and simulated with a case to validate the problem solving of distributed dynamic scheduling in the framework. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
