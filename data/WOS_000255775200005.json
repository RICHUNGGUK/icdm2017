The aim of NEPA is to help companies improve productivity through applying lean manufacturing management practices and knowledge. The Industry Forum's master class methodology is being used to transfer technology into local companies. This paper considers the process in terms of Lillrank's model of innovation transfer. Initial results obtained from 15 companies show that the savings are eight times greater than total costs. It has been found that the commitment of management and the ability of the change agents are the key determinants of success. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
