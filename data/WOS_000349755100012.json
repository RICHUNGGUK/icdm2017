We adopt a scale-bias adjustment migration strategy for integrating base and new models based on similar nature underlying processes. Further, we propose a Bayesian sequential algorithm for obtaining the statistically most informative data about the migrated model for use in parameter estimation. The benefits of the proposed strategy over traditional approaches presented in recent reported work are demonstrated using Monte Carlo simulations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
