In this paper, we address the problem of privacy and liability in VANETs. We propose a scheme that provides location privacy by utilizing a variant of ring signature. It allows a vehicle to form a ring arbitrarily with nearby vehicles and sign its messages anonymously, so that it can hide itself in the surrounding vehicles. When solving a dispute, the real signer will be responsible for what it has signed as the anonymity is revocable by the authority.", "paper_title": "A Collaboratively Hidden Location Privacy Scheme for VANETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000333839700001"}
