The algebraic code-excited linear prediction (ACELP) technique is recommended in AMR-WB, and it is noted that most of the complexity in the ACELP structure comes from the codebook search. In this paper, a new method is proposed for codebook search based on the behavior of backward filtered target signal, d(n), introduced in ITU-T G.722.2 recommendation. To optimize the proposed scheme, five optimization algorithms (i.e., modified genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization with dynamic inertia weight, bee colony optimization, modified differential evolution, and imperialist competition algorithm) are investigated. Experimental results show that the reduction in codebook search operations of the proposed method is able to reach up to 59 percent as compared with ITU-T G.722.2 recommendation. Meanwhile, BCO-based codebook search scheme has better convergence speed without significant degradation in quality metrics, such as segmental signal-to-noise ratio, mean opinion score, and perceptual evaluation of speech quality, when used in an AMR-WB speech codec.", "paper_title": "Modification of codebook search in adaptive multi-rate wideband speech codecs using intelligent optimization algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000331638400041"}
