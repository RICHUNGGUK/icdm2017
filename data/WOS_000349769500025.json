Based on our recently proposed confident information coverage (CIC) model, this paper studies the multi-modal confident information coverage (M2CIC) problem. Assuming that each node is equipped with different types of sensors, the objective is to schedule the multi-modal sensors' activity, such that the confident information coverage for each sensing modality can be guaranteed while the network lifetime can be maximized. We model the M2CIC problem as a multi-modal set cover problem (M2SC) and prove its NP-completeness. For solving the M2SC problem, we design two energy-efficient heuristics including a centralized one and a distributed one. In the proposed algorithms, different modal sensors are organized into a family of set covers, each of which can provide confident information coverage for all the monitored physical phenomena. Simulation results show that both the proposed algorithms can efficiently prolong the network lifetime and outperform two classical peer algorithms in terms of the extended network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Sensor Scheduling for Multi-Modal Confident Information Coverage in Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000349769500025"}
