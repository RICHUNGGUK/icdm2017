We study two containment problems related to the QCSP. Firstly, we give a combinatorial condition on finite structures A and B that is necessary and sufficient to render QCSP(A) subset of QCSP(B). We prove that QCSP(A) subset of QCSP(B), that is all sentences of positive Horn logic true on A are true on B, if there is a surjective homomorphism from A(vertical bar A vertical bar vertical bar B vertical bar) to B. This can be seen as improving an old result of Keisler that shows the former equivalent to there being a surjective homomorphism from A(omega) to B. We note that this condition is already necessary to guarantee containment of the 112 restriction of the QCSP, that is Pi(2)-CSP(A) subset of Pi(2)-CSP(B). The exponent's bound of vertical bar A vertical bar(vertical bar B vertical bar) places the decision procedure for the model containment problem in non-deterministic double-exponential time complexity. We further show the exponent's bound vertical bar A vertical bar(vertical bar B vertical bar) to be close to tight by giving a sequence of structures A together with a fixed B, vertical bar B vertical bar = 2, such that there is a surjective homomorphism from A to B only when r >= A. Secondly, we prove that the entailment problem for positive Horn fragment of first-order logic is decidable. That is, given two sentences phi and psi, of positive Horn, we give an algorithm that determines whether phi -> psi, is true in all structures (models). Our result is in some sense tight, since we show that the entailment problem for positive first-order logic (i.e. positive Horn plus disjunction) is undecidable. In the final part of the paper we ponder a notion of Q-core that is some canonical representative among the class of templates that engender the same QCSP. Although the Q-core is not as well-behaved as its better known cousin the core, we demonstrate that it is still a useful notion in the realm of QCSP complexity classifications.", "paper_title": "QUANTIFIED CONSTRAINTS AND CONTAINMENT PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000365417600009"}
