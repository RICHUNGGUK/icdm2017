The fuzzy control algorithms, however, should be simple because of the bounded computational time and load of real time operation. The existing FLC algorithms and their design methods are complex, iterative and require qualified experts and specific software. This research aims at the development of an engineering design for simple PI-like FLCs, which ensures system robustness and can be performed by PLCs. The design is based on the derivation of tuning models employing the least square error method and an artificial neural networks approach. The tuning models relate the FLC' parameters and the parameters of the nominal plant model, the plant uncertainty, and the fuzzy unit. The engineering design is applied for the real time control of a laboratory dryer temperature.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF PROCESS FUZZY CONTROL FOR PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC CONTROLLERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200001"}
