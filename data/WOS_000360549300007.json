Supply chain system with the help of RFID system reduces the cost in business operation. Different members in the supply chain connect to the same RFID tag for acquiring their own data. Members can protect their secret information not being revealed by internal attacker, and unauthorized member and cloud service provider cannot decrypt the secret information. However, the traditional architecture lacks of data search and scalability. It causes the difficulty in searching a specific object. When one of supply chain member wants to search data of specific tag in database, it will be difficult to locate and search the object. In this paper we proposed a novel cloud-architecture for RFID supply chain system and we also proposed the detail schemes such as authentication, ownership transfer, authority recovery and data sharing. The proposed method comfort to supply chain environment and data sharing phase enhances the efficiency of supply chain. We analyze our method with security and performance.", "paper_title": "A Cloud-Based Authentication Protocol for RFID Supply Chain Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360549300007"}
