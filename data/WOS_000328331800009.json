In encryption part, the gray values of two neighboring pixels are masked by same pseudo-random bits. In data-hiding part, the additional data are embedded into various bit planes with a reversible manner, and a parameter optimization method based on a capacity-distortion criterion is used to ensure a good performance. Because the data space used for accommodating the additional data is not affected by the encryption operation, the data embedded in plain/encrypted domain can be extracted from encrypted/plain domain, and the way of insertion/extraction of additional data in plain domain is same as that in encrypted domain. Furthermore, the original image can be recovered without any error from an image containing additional data.
