In this model, data is viewed to be organized in a matrix form (A(i,j))(1 <= i),(j,<= n). The entries A(i,j) are updated coordinate-wise, in arbitrary order and possibly multiple times. The updates include both increments and decrements to the current value of A(i,j). The hybrid frequency moment F-p,F-q(A) is defined as Sigma(n)(j=1)(Sigma(n)(i=1) A(i,j)(p))(q) and is a generalization of the frequency moment of one-dimensional data streams. We present the first (O) over tilde (1) space algorithm for the problem of estimating F-p,F-q for p is an element of [0, 2] and q is an element of [0, 1] to within an approximation factor of 1 +/- epsilon. The (O) over tilde notation hides poly-logarithmic factors in the size of the stream m, the matrix size n and polynomial factors of epsilon(-1). We also present the first (O) over tilde (n(1-1)/q) space algorithm for estimating F-p,F-q for p is an element of [0, 2] and q is an element of (1, 2].", "paper_title": "Estimating hybrid frequency moments of data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000300490100005"}
