In this paper, we first show his protocol is still vulnerable to a partition attack (offline dictionary attack). Thereafter we propose an enhanced verifier-based protocol that can defeat the attacks described and yet is reasonably efficient. Furthermore, we can provide the rigorous proof of the security for it.", "paper_title": "Secure verifier-based three-party password-authenticated key exchange", "paper_id": "WOS:000313413100002"}
