Without assuming bounded conditions on these activation functions, we establish some sufficient conditions on the existence and global exponential stability of almost periodic solutions for Cohen-Grossberg neural networks on time scales. In addition, a comparison of results shows that these results are generalized. Finally, two examples are given to show the obtained results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
