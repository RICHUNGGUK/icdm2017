It supports environments in which coalition formations are carried out targeting multiple service requests at the same time, and in which the autonomic management systems compete to work in the most appropriate coalition. The protocol exploits the benefits of social networking in favor of manageability and scalability. Its performance is analyzed taking into account crucial aspects of self-organizing systems such as stability and convergence to optimal coalition formation results.", "paper_title": "A Service-Centric Orchestration Protocol for Self-Organizing Autonomic Management Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297585900004"}
