Usually constraints are set on vertices of the object to drive the deformation. How to simulate dynamic force constraints in interactive design is still a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a novel haptic-constraint modeling method based on interactive metaballs, during which the haptic-constraint tools are attracted to the target location and then control the touch-enabled deformation within the constrained areas. The interactive force feedbacks facilitate designers to accurately deform the target regions and fine carve the details as their intention on the objects. Our work studies how to apply touch sensation in such constrained deformations using interactive metaballs, thus users can truly feel and control the soft-touch objects during the deforming interactions. Experimental results show that the dynamic sense of touch during the haptic manipulation is intuitively simulated to users, via the interacting interface we have developed.
