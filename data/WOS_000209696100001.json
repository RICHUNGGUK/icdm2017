In order to provide a flexible tool for system design, we derive an upper bound for the downlink throughput with best-M CQI feedback for both single and multi-antenna communication schemes. Asymptotic analysis shows that, for a large number of users, multiuser diversity provides an SNR gain that scales as 1/M.", "paper_title": "On the Asymptotic Throughput of OFDMA Systems with Best-M CQI Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696100001"}
