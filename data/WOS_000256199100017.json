If the partition of the vertices is part of the input, we call G a partitioned probe graph of g. In this paper we show that there exists a polynomial-time algorithm for the recognition of partitioned probe graphs of comparability graphs. This immediately leads to a polynomial-time algorithm for the recognition of partitioned probe graphs of cocomparability graphs. We then show that a partitioned graph G is a partitioned probe permutation graph if and only if G is at the same time a partitioned probe graph of comparability and cocomparability graphs.
