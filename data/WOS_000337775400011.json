LSPDA constructs the local scatter and the between-class scatter to characterize the sub- and multi-manifold information respectively. More specifically, the local structure is constructed according to a certain kind of similarity between data points which takes special consideration of both the local information and the class information based on a parameter-free neighborhood decision rule, and the between-class structure is constructed according to the importance degrees of the not-same-class points measured by a strictly monotonically decreasing function. After the local scatter and the between-class scatter have been characterized, the novel feature extraction criterion is derived via maximizing the difference between the between-class scatter and the local scatter. Experimental results on the Wine dataset, AR, FERET, CMU PIE, ORL and LFW face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
