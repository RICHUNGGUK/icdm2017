Furthermore, the minimum weight and dimension of codes which are sum of two minimal codes in F-q(C-p x C-p) are also computed. Finally, the efficiency of cyclic codes and noncyclic abelian codes of length p(2) are compared.", "paper_title": "On Cyclic and Abelian Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100023"}
