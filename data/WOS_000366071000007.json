In this paper, an autonomous system for performing this quality control is presented. The system is equipped with a heating tool, a thermocamera, and a robot to handle the part. The inspection process is based on the observation of the propagation of thermal waves through the inspected part, a method that can highlight very small cracks with high reliability. A knowledge-based approach to visual inspection is exploited for detecting the cracks: all the system parameters are known by means of an accurate calibration of the workcell. The system was tested on a large dataset and demonstrated its capability of detecting tiny production defects, that can lead to dangerous failures when the metal components are put under strong mechanical stress.
