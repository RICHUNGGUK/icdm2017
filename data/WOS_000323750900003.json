Recently, many researchers have paid attention to the reversible data hiding scheme, which can completely recover original multi-media files after the embedded data are extracted. In this paper, a side-match approach is proposed to achieve more capacity in histogram-based reversible data hiding for grayscale images. The histogram is created by exploiting the difference in all the values between pixels and their predictedive values. Experimental results show that our method is capable of providing a great embedding capacity without causing noticeable distortion. In one-level hiding, where it has the best capacity, our method conserves image qualities larger than 48 dB. Furthermore, in multilevel hiding, a rotation strategy is proposed to further improve image qualities. Experimental results show that our method performs better than other existing methods in multilevel hiding cases.", "paper_title": "Reversible data hiding using side-match predictions on steganographic images", "paper_id": "WOS:000323750900003"}
