This paper describes the system that was created to participate in the contest, along with observations of the team's experiences in the contest. The system itself was built using the AF-TeleoReactive and AF-AgentSpeak agent programming languages running on the Agent Factory platform. A hybrid control architecture inspired by the SoSAA strategy aided in the separation of concerns between low-level behaviours (such as movement and obstacle evasion) and higher-level planning and strategy.", "paper_title": "From bogtrotting to herding: a UCD perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000297588400006"}
