Firstly, we present an improvement on a known construction of resilient S-boxes such that the nonlinearity and the algebraic degree will become higher in some cases. Then a construction of highly nonlinear t-resilient Boolean functions without linear structures is given, whose algebraic degree achieves n-t-1, which is optimal for n-variable t-resilient Boolean functions. Furthermore, we construct a class of resilient S-boxes without linear structures, which possesses the highest nonlinearity and algebraic degree among all currently known constructions.", "paper_title": "Highly Nonlinear Resilient Functions without Linear Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738600030"}
