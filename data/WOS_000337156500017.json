In the proposed scheme, not only can the secret image be completely revealed, but the original cover images can also be losslessly recovered. A difference value between neighboring pixels in a secret image is shared by 2n pixels in 2n shadow images, respectively, where n a parts per thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 1. A pair of shadow images which are constructed from the same cover image are called brother stego-images. To decrease pixel values changed in shadow images, each pair of brother stego-images is assigned a weighted factor when calculating difference values to be shared. A pixel in a cover image is recovered by calculating the average of corresponding pixels in its brother stego-images. A single stego-image reveals nothing and a pair of pixels in brother stego-images reveals partial difference value between neighboring secret pixels. The more brother stego-images are collected, the more information in the secret image will be revealed. Finally, a secret image will be completely revealed if all of its brother stego-images are collected.", "paper_title": "Reversible secret-image sharing with high visual quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000337156500017"}
