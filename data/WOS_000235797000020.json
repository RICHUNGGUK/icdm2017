This model which is inspired by cell assemblies gives some hints on how diagnostic problem-solving might actually be performed by the human brain. The diagnostic process is described by a deduction system that performs an abductive inference. The abductive inference itself is described by the verbal category theory. A mapping of a diagnostic problem into a diagnostic system represented by an associative memory with feedback connections is presented. The associative memory with feedback connections offers a self-contained architecture for the administration and representation of manifestations and disorders. This can be implemented efficiently on a serial computer, requiring low memory space and low computational costs. Because of these advantages, this model was chosen for the implementation of a real embedded diagnostic system for a wire bonder machine. The knowledge base of this system is composed of 350 rules, which are stored in I I modules. These modules model the error behaviour of the microcontroller based units of the machine and are arranged in a taxonomy which corresponds to the hierarchical chains that describe the relationship between disorders and manifestations.
