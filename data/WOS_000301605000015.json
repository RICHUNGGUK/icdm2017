Outputs of a CBM model include the calculation of optimal maintenance decisions, conditional reliability, and the calculation of remaining useful life, among other measures. It is necessary to have a model for the manner in which the condition monitoring data changes over time to produce these output measures; many models have been developed to do so. It is also common to record minor maintenance actions carried out on critical assets, with lubricant changes being one of the most common, but it is unusual for models to consider the impact of such maintenance actions that affect the condition monitoring data. In this paper we discuss the impact of minor maintenance on CBM models. A dataset on a collection of gearboxes, consisting of reliability and oil analysis information, including data on oil changes and oil additions, is used to illustrate the benefit of modelling minor maintenance actions.", "paper_title": "Minor maintenance actions and their impact on diagnostic and prognostic CBM models", "paper_id": "WOS:000301605000015"}
