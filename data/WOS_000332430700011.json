The use of satellite links, as a segment of the network, ensures connectivity where no terrestrial networks are available and in some cases can also represent an efficient and cost effective mean to transfer data. This work aims both at defining a suitable network architecture, to identify and design optimum protocol solutions and at evaluating performance, in terms of throughput and service delay, when DVB-RCS standard is adopted over the satellite segment. The considered platform is composed of a cluster of sensors (including low data rate devices and bulk data cameras) deployed over a vast geographical area, which collects on ground and distribute via satellite multimedia information, i.e. audio, video and sensed data, either for emergency or monitoring operations. A geostationary satellite system is selected in order to guarantee high flexibility in terms of channel capacity. The proposed architecture integrates wireless sensor networks and satellite networks, implying to approach technological issues from access layer up to transport and session layers, with heterogeneous traffic sources multiplexed by a satellite gateway, before being encapsulated into TCP/IP flows. The proposed architecture assumes a session layer protocol, between the transport and application layers, which manages the multiplexing of streams coming from the input sources. At the transport layer, TCP Noordwijk is proposed to optimize data transfer over the satellite link. Finally, different access scheme for satellite return link are taken into account, in order to assess an efficient resource allocation. Simulation results show the validity of the proposed architecture and protocol solutions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
