After pixels of iris annulus around a pupil have been converted into Cartesian coordinates, 30 features on the iris was selected then the features were tracked using the iterative Lucas-Kanade algorithm to calculate torsional shift. The results show that a precision of the method is higher than those measured by a conventional cross-correlation and by a template matching method. The suggested method showed 0.03 degrees mean error with 0.15 degrees maximum error. Particularly, the method was robust to change of pupil size and misalignment of pupil location. Processing time was also fast enough to be implemented in a real-time system. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
