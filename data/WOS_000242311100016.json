Moreover, the rights to consume content are rather device bound than person bound. We present a first step towards an open DRM framework which is based on the security of its building blocks. The presented framework binds the right to consume content to persons instead of to devices. An extension of the current TPM specification is proposed to enhance the security of DRM clients.", "paper_title": "A flexible and open DRM framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000242311100016"}
