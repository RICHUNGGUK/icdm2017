FPS is a functional performance specification language which describes passage-time, transient, steady-state and continuous state space performance questions. We present a generalisation of stochastic probes, a formalism-independent specification of behaviour in stochastic process algebra models. Stochastic probes select the performance-critical paths for which the measures are required; increasing their expressiveness in turn gives us greater expressive power to represent performance questions. We end by demonstrating these tools on an RSS syndication architecture of up to 1.5 X 10(51) states.", "paper_title": "Functional performance specification with stochastic probes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239480100003"}
