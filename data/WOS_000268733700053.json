By using adaptive feedback control scheme and exploiting some stochastic analysis techniques, several sufficient conditions are developed to ensure the synchronization of stochastically hybrid coupled fuzzy neural networks with all admissible uncertainties in mean square. Finally, a numerical example illustrated by scale-free complex networks is provided to show the effectiveness and the applicability of the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
