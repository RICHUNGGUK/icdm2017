This paper proposes a fine-grained access control method for cloud resources. The basic idea is to use XACML as access control language and to optimize policies by data fragmentation and policy refinement algorithms. Through data fragmentation, the accessible resources are divided into disjoint data blocks, and each of them will be combined with a set of policy rules. This helps to refine the policy and to avoid data leakage caused by rule conflicting on the resource intersections. Finally, the disjoint data blocks and the optimized policy are distributed in the three-layered cloud, and the decision to a request is made by rule matching on a specific resource rather than traversing the whole policy rules. Experiments show that our proposal enjoys higher efficiency in cloud-based access control.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grained Access Control via XACML Policy Optimization in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000372155400018"}
