Computational models address such limitations by providing insight into the complex biological mechanisms of tumor progression. A set of clinically-oriented, multiscale models of solid tumor dynamics has been developed by the In Silico Oncology Group (ISOG), Institute of Communication and Computer Systems (ICCS)-National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) to study cancer growth and response to treatment. Within this context using certain representative parameter values, tumor growth and response have been modeled under a cancer preoperative chemotherapy protocol in the framework of the SIOP 2001/GPOH clinical trial. A thorough cross-method sensitivity analysis of the model has been performed. Based on the sensitivity analysis results, a reasonable adaptation of the values of the model parameters to a real clinical case of bilateral nephroblastomatosis has been achieved. The analysis presented supports the potential of the model for the study and eventually the future design of personalized treatment schemes and/or schedules using the data obtained from in vitro experiments and clinical studies.
