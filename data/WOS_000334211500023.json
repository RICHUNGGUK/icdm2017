Also, in optimality conditions, it is shown that how the FLMOLP problem can be solved by employing the preceding computations if the degree of priority of the fuzzy objective functions is changed. It should be noted that this permutation of fuzzy objective functions is a kind of sensitivity analysis which it may be happen due to the change in the management strategy with the passing of time.", "paper_title": "A particular simplex algorithm to solve fuzzy lexicographic multi-objective linear programming problems and their sensitivity analysis on the priority of the fuzzy objective functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000334211500023"}
