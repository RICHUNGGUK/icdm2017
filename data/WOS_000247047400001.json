The disks can overlap and have different sizes. The problem is NP-hard and does not admit a PTAS. In the L(infinity) metric, we give a 2-approximation algorithm running in O(n root n log(2) n) time. In the L(infinity) metric, we give a quadratic time algorithm that gives an 8 /3-approximation in general, and a similar to 2.2393-approximation when all the disks are congruent.
