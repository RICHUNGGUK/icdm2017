One of the main problems facing such systems is the systems' ability to support the materials and integrate them into the system in such a way that they can be tailored to the user's ability level. Accordingly, it is very difficult for the system to support user-oriented learning materials or courses efficiently. In this research, we applied the CAT (Computerized Adaptive Testing) system with SCORM interfaces to improve the learning effect. CAT is a method which focuses on analysis and evaluation of learning outcomes. SCORM is an international standard used to manage the learning materials. To support user-oriented learning and testing, we made a learning process using IRT (Item response theory). Throughout the process in this system, we implemented logic as a service component. The system process performs the learning test program's logic by interface between the service components. The structure of this system interlinks SCORM API with the learning contents and items through a separate e-learning server.", "paper_title": "A service component based CAT system with SCORM for advanced learning effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000316069400014"}
