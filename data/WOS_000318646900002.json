Semi-supervised learning, typically integrated with the relevance feedback techniques, is an effective method to narrow down the semantic gap. However, in semi-supervised learning, the amount of unlabeled data is usually much greater than that of labeled data. Therefore, the performance of a semi-supervised learning algorithm relies heavily on its effectiveness of using the relationships between the labeled and unlabeled data. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to better explore those relationships by augmenting the relational graph representation built on the entire data set, expected to increase the intra-class weights while decreasing the inter-class weights and linking the potential intra-class data. The augmented relational matrix can be directly used in any semi-supervised learning algorithms. The experimental results in a range of feedback-based image retrieval tasks show that the proposed algorithm not only achieves good generality, but also outperforms other algorithms in the same semi-supervised learning framework.", "paper_title": "Image retrieval based on augmented relational graph representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000318646900002"}
