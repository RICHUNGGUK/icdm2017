For industrial robots working side-by-side with humans in manufacturing industry, Al systems are necessary to lower the demand on programming time and system integration expertise. Only by building a system with appropriate knowledge and reasoning services can one simplify the robot programming sufficiently to meet those demands while still getting a robust and efficient task execution. In this paper, we present a system we have realized that aims at fulfilling the above demands. The paper focuses on the knowledge put into ontologies created for robotic devices and manufacturing tasks, and presents examples of AI-related services that use the semantic descriptions of skills to help users instruct the robot adequately.
