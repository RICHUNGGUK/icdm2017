Shellable complexes have been widely studied because they have nice combinatorial properties. It turns out that several standard models of concurrent computation can be constructed from shellable complexes. We consider adversarial schedulers in the synchronous, asynchronous, and semi-synchronous message-passing models, as well as asynchronous shared memory. We show how to exploit their common shellability structure to derive new and remarkably succinct tight (or nearly so) lower bounds on connectivity of protocol complexes and hence on solutions to the -set agreement task in these models.
