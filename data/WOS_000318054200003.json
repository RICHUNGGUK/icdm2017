Firstly, we present a review of methods for recovery of static anatomical structures by only using intraoperative data without any preoperative patient-specific information. Then, methods for recovery of intraoperative motion and deformation are reviewed by combining intraoperative sparse data with preoperative patient-specific stationary data, which is followed by a survey of articles which incorporated biomechanics. Furthermore, the articles are reviewed which addressed the used of statistical models for optimization of interventions. Finally, we conclude the survey by describing the future perspective.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Statistical Modeling and Machine Learning Approaches to Computer Assisted Medical Intervention: Intraoperative Anatomy Modeling and Optimization of Interventional Procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000318054200003"}
