It is modelled by a nonlinear difference equation, and it is shown, that control techniques available for nonlinear discrete-time systems yield new results for managing power consumption through increasing the efficiency of digital electronic circuits. Namely an attempt is made to achieve higher efficiency of power amplifier by linearizing its characteristics (output power vs. input power). The results are illustrated by numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Linearization of the power amplifier in mobile telecommunications", "paper_id": "WOS:000244619700018"}
