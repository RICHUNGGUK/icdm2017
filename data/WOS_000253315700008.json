Instead of sending a unique stream to each newly arriving client, clients share as many multicast transmissions as possible, and are serviced only those parts of the video that they have missed. We present a novel video patching scheme using hierarchies of patches. Our scheme minimizes the bandwidth needed by the video server, and may result in the fact that clients receive several streams in parallel. We show analytically that for Poisson arrival our algorithm achieves the optimal possible server bandwidth for all schemes where clients share multicast transmissions. We also show, how our approach can be combined with batching. This combination requires less server bandwidth than all fixed start point periodic broadcast algorithms.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical video patching with optimal server bandwidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000253315700008"}
