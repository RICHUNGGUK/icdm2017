Workload generation, which is a key technique for performance analysis and simulations, has also attracted an increasing interest in cloud community in recent years. Though a large number of methods for synthetically generating bursty or self-similar workloads have been proposed in the literature, none of them can deal with workload generation with both of the two characteristics. In this paper, a configurable and intelligible synthetic generator (BURSE) is proposed for bursty and self-similar workloads in cloud computing based on a superposition of two-state Markov Modulated Poisson Processes (MMPP2s). The proposed generator can produce workloads with both specified intension of burstiness and self-similarity. Detailed experimental evaluation demonstrates the accuracy, robustness and good applicability of BURSE.", "paper_title": "BURSE: A Bursty and Self-Similar Workload Generator for Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000349769500005"}
