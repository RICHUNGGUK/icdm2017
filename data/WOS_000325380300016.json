Beside morphological changes, image intensity may also change over time, for example when studying brain maturation. However, such intensity changes are not accounted for in image similarity measures for standard image registration methods. Hence, 1) local similarity measures, 2) methods estimating intensity transformations between images, and 3) metamorphosis approaches have been developed to either achieve robustness with respect to intensity changes or to simultaneously capture spatial and intensity changes. For these methods, longitudinal intensity changes are not explicitly modeled and images are treated as independent static samples. Here, we propose a model-based image similarity measure for longitudinal image registration that estimates a temporal model of intensity change using all available images simultaneously.", "paper_title": "Longitudinal Image Registration With Temporally-Dependent Image Similarity Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000325380300016"}
