The design employs a complementary stacked-MOSFET structure to achieve reliable, n9 scalable high-voltage switching. In addition, the power driver enhances the current drivability, thereby improving the switching speed of the power switches in modern power conversion systems. By exploiting the availability of the rated power supply, it uses fewer on-chip biasing capacitors and diodes, which considerably reduces silicon area and cost. A hardware prototype of the proposed power driver is fabricated using the TSMC 0.25-lm CMOS process. It is capable of switching at 7.5 V, using 2.5-V rated transistors. The design improves the rise and fall times by 26.0 and 21.1 % at 1 MHz while driving a load of 70 pF, when compared to the prior art. In addition, the proposed design achieves 16.8 % silicon area savings due to the reduction of on-chip biasing capacitors and diodes.", "paper_title": "High-voltage tolerant power driver with enhanced current drivability for integrated power applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000335157500005"}
