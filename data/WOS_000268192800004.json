Based on a batch of recent past slow rate measurements in a finite horizon window, the initial state estimation in this window is solved by minimizing a receding-horizon objective function, and then the fast rate state estimations are calculated by the prediction of dynamic equation to compensate for the network-induced time delays. Furthermore, convergence results and unbiasedness properties are analyzed. An upper bound of estimation error is presented under the assumption of bounded disturbances acting on the system and measurement equations. A simulation example shows the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Receding horizon estimation to networked control systems with multirate scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000268192800004"}
