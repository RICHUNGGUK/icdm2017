The host audio signal is first permuted and divided into frames equally, and the watermark embedding and extraction procedure are executed frame by frame. In embedding procedure, the embedding watermark signal is generated firstly, and then mixed together with the permuted host audio signal through a BSS model. After that, the obtained mixtures are combined and inverse permuted to form the watermarked audio signal. In extraction procedure, watermarked audio signal is permuted and split into two signals, and then BSS technique is applied to obtain the separated embedding watermark signal, by observing the correlation values between it and the embedding watermark signal, the existence of watermark can be determined. With the secret keys, we can recover the watermark image further more. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A blind source separation based multi-bit digital audio watermarking scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300045"}
