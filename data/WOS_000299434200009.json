We combined MRI-based 3D finite element modelling of a residuum with an injury threshold and a muscle damage law to study risks for DTI in one sitting subject in two postures: 30 degrees-knee-flexion vs. 90 degrees-knee-flexion. We recorded skin-socket pressures, used as model boundary conditions. During the 90 degrees-knee-flexion simulations, major internal muscle injuries were predicted (>1000 mm(3)). In contrast, the 30 degrees-knee-flexion simulations only produced minor injury (<14 mm(3)). Predicted injury rates at 90 degrees-knee-flexion were over one order of magnitude higher than those at 30 degrees-knee-flexion. We concluded that in this particular subject, prolonged 90 degrees-knee-flexion sitting theoretically endangers muscle viability in the residuum. By expanding the studies to large subject groups, this research approach can support development of guidelines for DTI prevention in prosthetic-users.", "paper_title": "Effects of sitting postures on risks for deep tissue injury in the residuum of a transtibial prosthetic-user: a biomechanical case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434200009"}
