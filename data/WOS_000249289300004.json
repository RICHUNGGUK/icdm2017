Graph-rewriting automata define symbol dynamics on graphs, in contrast to cellular automata on lattice space. Structural change is possible along with state transition. Self-replication based on a self-description is shown as an example of self-description for construction. This process is performed using a construction arm, which is realized as a subgraph, that executes a program described in the graph structure. In addition, a metanode structure is introduced to embed rule sets in the graph structure as self-description for computation. These are regarded as universal graph-rewriting automata that can serve as a model of systems that maintain themselves through replication and modification.", "paper_title": "Self-description for construction and computation on graph-rewriting automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000249289300004"}
