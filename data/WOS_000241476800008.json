Conflict of interest for the centralized model was previously discussed by Nyanchama and Osborn. More recently, a decentralized administrative model for role graphs has been introduced by Wang and Osborn. This paper investigates how considerations of conflict of interest interact with the decentralized administrative model, and the resulting impact on role graph operations.", "paper_title": "Conflict of interest in the administrative role graph model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241476800008"}
