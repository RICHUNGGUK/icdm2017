We propose a new framework to finely control the resolution of the models. This allows us to dynamically concentrate the computational force where it is most needed. Given the segmented scan of an object to simulate, we first compute a bounding box and then recursively subdivide it where needed. The cells of this octree structure are labelled with mechanical properties based on material parameters and fill rate. An efficient physical simulation is then performed using hierarchical hexaedral finite elements. The object surface can be used for rendering and to apply boundary conditions. Compared with traditional finite element approaches, our method dramatically simplifies the task of volume meshing in order to facilitate the using of patient specific models, and increases the propagation of the deformations.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical multi-resolution finite element model for soft body simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239565100005"}
