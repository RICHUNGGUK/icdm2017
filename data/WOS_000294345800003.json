Our security solution consists of a link-anonymized data scheme, a secure data transportation service, a secure data sharing and collection service, and a more advanced access control mechanism. The novel security service architecture, as part of the integrated system architecture, provides a secure health-care infrastructure for HealthAgents and can be easily adapted for other health-care applications.", "paper_title": "The design and implementation of a novel security model for HealthAgents", "paper_id": "WOS:000294345800003"}
