They help to share interests between groups of people with common features. Undoubtedly, there is an inherent social network in any e-learning system, where the main actors are teachers, learners and learning resources. Most e-learning software are mainly focused in content dissemination and group work, but the possibilities that Internet LMSs could offer go further. Recently, there has been research work focused on Web Communities for learning and their formulation as Social Networks. Thus, social network analysis may be applied to infer group structures and to make intelligent recommendation systems and data mining. This paper proposes a method for the formulation and interpretation of learning management platforms as social networks. In order to achieve a major generalization, we develop an ontology to integrate the information from different Learning Management Systems. After that, a personalized social network is extracted from the ontology. This change in the point of view of a LMS could be a challenge to make further studies about learners, teachers and learning resources to obtain a better understanding of their social structure, and therefore to make or improve decisions about the learning process.
