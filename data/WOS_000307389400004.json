We consider the case when an implementation under test can have more states than its specification while user defined faults are implemented in an arbitrary way. We show that our approach can be used for FSM-based incremental and mutation testing and correspondingly we investigate cases that can be used for reducing length of obtained test suites. In some cases, worst-case length of obtained test suite becomes polynomial. Experiments show significant gains is using our approach in comparison to testing the whole specification.", "paper_title": "FSM-Based Testing from User Defined Faults Adapted to Incremental and Mutation Testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000307389400004"}
