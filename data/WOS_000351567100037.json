It is shown that all the sequences in the proposed FHS sets are shift distinct. The proposed FHS sets are suitable for quasi-synchronous time/frequency hopping code division multiple access systems to eliminate multiple-access interference.", "paper_title": "New Classes of Optimal Low Hit Zone Frequency Hopping Sequences with New Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100037"}
