However, few studies have tried to classify queries based on ambiguity and to answer \"what the proportion of ambiguous queries is\". This paper deals with these issues. First, we clarify the definition of ambiguous queries by constructing the taxonomy of queries from being ambiguous to specific. Second, we ask human annotators to manually classify queries. From manually labeled results, we observe that query ambiguity is to some extent predictable. Third, we propose a supervised learning approach to automatically identify ambiguous queries. Experimental results show that we can correctly identify 87% of labeled queries with the approach. Finally, by using our approach, we estimate that about 16% of queries in a real search log are ambiguous. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
