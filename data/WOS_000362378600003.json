Two auction-based algorithms to solve this problem in a decentralized fashion are first proposed. Centered around the notion of leader election, the first approach finds an optimal solution through a greedy bidding, while the second approach provides a sub-optimal solution which reduces complexity according to a sliding mode parameter. Then, by exploiting certain local structural properties of graph rigidity, a parallelization to build a portion of the optimal solution in constant time is derived. A theoretical characterization of algorithm performance is provided together with complexity analysis. Finally, simulation results are presented to corroborate the theoretical findings.", "paper_title": "Decentralized and Parallel Constructions for Optimally Rigid Graphs in R-2", "paper_id": "WOS:000362378600003"}
