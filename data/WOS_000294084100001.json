Such approaches are impractical since labeled data are usually hard to obtain in reality. In this paper, we build a clustering feature decision tree model, CFDT, from data streams having both unlabeled and a small number of labeled examples. CFDT applies a micro-clustering algorithm that scans the data only once to provide the statistical summaries of the data for incremental decision tree induction. Micro-clusters also serve as classifiers in tree leaves to improve classification accuracy and reinforce the any-time property. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that CFDT is highly scalable for data streams while generating high classification accuracy with high speed.", "paper_title": "Clustering feature decision trees for semi-supervised classification from high-speed data streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000294084100001"}
