On the one hand, management systems (in the form of batch queue systems) are responsible for all issues related to executing jobs on the existing machines. On the other hand, run-time tools (in the form of debuggers, tracers, performance analyzers, etc.) are used to guarantee the correctness and the efficiency of execution. Executing an application under the control of both a resource management system and a run-time tool is still a challenging problem in most cases. Using run-time tools might be difficult or even impossible in usual environments due to the restrictions imposed by resource managers. We propose TDP-Shell as a framework for providing the necessary mechanisms to enable and simplify using run-time tools under a specific resource management system. We have analyzed the essential interactions between common run-time tools and resource management systems and implemented a pilot TDP-Shell. The paper describes the main components of TDP-Shell and its use with some illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "TDP_SHELL: An interoperability framework for resource management systems and run-time monitoring tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500002"}
