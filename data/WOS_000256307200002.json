In this paper, we present a technique based on triangulated irregular networks (or TINs for short) and fuzzy set theory to model imprecise or uncertain regions. A fuzzy region is represented by a Extended TIN, which allows for an associated value for each point of the region in the presented approach to be considered; this associated value will be a membership grade. As is common in fuzzy set theory, membership grades can indicate a degree of \"belonging to the set\"; in our approach these are the degree to which every crisp location belongs to the fuzzy region (membership grades in fuzzy set theory can have other interpretations(7) as well, but these are not needed for the modelling of fuzzy regions). While modelling a fuzzy region as described provides a more accurate model of a real world situation, it does require many operators from the geographic realm to be extended and also new operators ( mainly from the fuzzy realm) to be added at the object level. In this paper, from the GIS realm, the calculation of the surface area and the minimum bounding rectangle for fuzzy regions are considered; from the fuzzy realm the calculation of the alpha-cut is considered. Other operations (i.e. convex hull of a fuzzy region, distance between two fuzzy regions,...) are still under development.", "paper_title": "Using TIN-based structures for the modelling of fuzzy GIS objects in a database", "paper_id": "WOS:000256307200002"}
