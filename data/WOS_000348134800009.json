The synthetic images were used to test the performance of the DCM. By adding random erasing to the genuine matching data, the influence of noise effect was simulated and analyzed. A comparison with the minimum net-flux method indicates that the DCM is more effective in identifying erroneous vectors as particles having no genuine candidates are more readily identified, thereby, ensuring strong consistent match. The DCM is also found to be more effective in addressing particle saltation, based on the accurately abstracted trajectories, the kinetic parameters of the sand grains are calculated.", "paper_title": "Relaxation algorithm-based PTV with dual calculation method and its application in addressing particle saltation", "paper_id": "WOS:000348134800009"}
