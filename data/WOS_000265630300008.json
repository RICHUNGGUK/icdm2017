Self-stabilizing protocols provide autonomous recovery from finite number of transient faults. Fault-containing, self-stabilizing protocols promise not only self-stabilization but also containment of faults (quick recovery and small effect) against small number of faults. However. existing composition techniques for self-stabilizing protocols; (e.g. Fair composition) cannot preserve the fault-containment properly when composing fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols. In this paper, we present Recovery Waiting Fault-containing Composition (RWFC) framework that provides a composition of multiple fault-containing self-stabilizing protocols while preserving the fault-containment property of the source protocols.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Composition of Self-Stabilizing Protocols Preserving the Fault-Containment Property", "paper_id": "WOS:000265630300008"}
