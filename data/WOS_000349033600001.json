In this article, we examine the potential benefits and limitations of cloud adoption from the perspective of a client firm's competitive priorities, identifying business motivators for each priority, mechanisms deployed in pursuing each priority, and the possible costs impacts and potential returns impacts of mechanism deployment in the context of each priority. This research is intended to add to the growing body of available business value-focused cloud computing studies and provides an additional vantage point for further conceptual and empirical work.", "paper_title": "Competing on the Cloud: A Review and Synthesis of Potential Benefits and Possible Pitfalls", "paper_id": "WOS:000349033600001"}
