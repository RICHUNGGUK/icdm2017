We bring to light some structural properties of 2-level matroids and exploit them for enumerative purposes. Moreover, the counting results are used to show that the number of combinatorially non-equivalent (n - 1)-dimensional 2-level polytopes is bounded from below by c.n(-5/2). p(-n), where c approximate to 0.03791727 and p(-1) approximate to 4.88052854.", "paper_title": "Many 2-Level Polytopes from Matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000363959500008"}
