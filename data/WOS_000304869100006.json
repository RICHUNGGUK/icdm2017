In this review article we explain the basic principles of numerical modeling and characterization of selected broadband cloaking structures that are designed to operate within the microwave frequency range. Because the cloaks are periodical structures, the numerical modeling is simplified by employing symmetry boundary conditions. The modeling and characterization are done both with frequency-domain and time-domain simulations. Various experimental results are also compared to numerical results.
