Unlike conventional parsing algorithms, scannerless generalized-LR parsing supports the full set of context-free grammars, which is closed under composition, and hence can parse languages composed from separate grammar modules. To apply this algorithm in an interactive environment, this article introduces a novel error recovery mechanism. Our approach is language independent, and relies on automatic derivation of recovery rules from grammars. By taking layout information into consideration it can efficiently suggest natural recovery suggestions.", "paper_title": "Natural and Flexible Error Recovery for Generated Modular Language Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000313658500001"}
