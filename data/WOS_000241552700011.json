In this paper such a method is presented to denoise digital images, while preserving discontinuous image patterns like edges and corners. This method is theoretically superior to the commonly used anisotropic diffusion approach in many aspects such as convergence and robustness. Denoising experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method.", "paper_title": "A discontinuous finite element method for image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000241552700011"}
