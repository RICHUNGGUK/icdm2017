The study is based on a reliable and representative publication set of 755 papers retrieved from the Web of Science database using keywords and citation links. In the course of the study we analyse several aspects of the emergence of this topic, the differentiation of methodological research, its application within and outside the field and the dissemination process of information among different disciplines in the sciences and social sciences. Finally, a cluster analysis of h-related literature is conducted. The hybrid clustering algorithm results in four clusters, which depict two different aspects each of basic and applied research related to the h-index and its derivatives.
