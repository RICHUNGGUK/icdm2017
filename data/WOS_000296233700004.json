This article presents a traffic-aware semantic routing service for mobile users based on the Large Knowledge Collider (LarKC) Semantic Web pluggable platform. It proposes a technique for integrating conceptual query answering with statistical learning and operations research algorithms. The presented prototype of a traffic-aware semantic routing service works efficiently with large, heterogeneous information sources and delivers value-added services to mobile users.", "paper_title": "Semantic Traffic-Aware Routing Using the LarKC Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000296233700004"}
