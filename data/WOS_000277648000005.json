In this paper, the optimal cooperative relaying strategies in the MAC layer are analyzed while considering the UWB unique properties such as fine ranging and immunity to small scale fading. Specifically, the optimal cooperation strategies in the absence of coordination message passing between relays are determined in order to maximize the system throughput while reducing the control packet overhead. Mobile networks are also considered, in which the relays should exchange their ranging information together in some update intervals. The optimal update interval length is calculated in order to maximize the system throughput. More importantly, we show that if this optimal update interval is used, the optimal cooperation strategies in the mobile case will be similar to those in the static network. Two different relay selection schemes, namely proactive and reactive settings, are considered. Analysis and simulations confirm that the proposed UWB-based Cooperative Relaying Scheme, UCoRS, can achieve a considerable diversity gain in spite of its implementation simplicity. UCoRS also minimizes the number of control packets that are required for the optimal cooperation, which leads to the energy efficiency in the UWB costly data-receiving process.", "paper_title": "Optimal Cooperative Relaying Schemes in IR-UWB Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000277648000005"}
