One of the major challenges of designing a sensor enabled grid is how to efficiently schedule sensor resource to user jobs across the collection of sensor resources. The paper presents an agent based scheme for assigning sensor resources to appropriate sensor grid users on the basis of negotiation results among agents. The proposed model consists of two types of agents: the sensor resource agents that represent the economic interests of the underlying sensor resource providers of the sensor grid and the sensor user agents that represent the interests of grid user application using the grid to achieve goals. Interactions between the two agent types are mediated by means of market mechanisms. We model sensor allocation problems by introducing the sensor utility function. The goal is to find a sensor resource allocation that maximizes the total profit. This paper proposes a distributed optimal sensor resource allocation algorithm. The performance evaluation of proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with other resource allocation algorithms for sensor grid. The paper also gives the application example of proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Agent based sensors resource allocation in sensor grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000320039500008"}
