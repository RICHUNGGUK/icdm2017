The logarithmic spin tensor properties linking the Eulerian Hencky strain with the Cauchy stress is used thanks to hypoelasticity assuming the additive decomposition of the stretching into elastic and viscoplastic parts. The constitutive model with its nonlocal formulation is implemented in an efficient manner in a commercial implicit finite element code. The proposed model exhibits mesh-independent responses and is in agreement with strain evolution observed experimentally. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
