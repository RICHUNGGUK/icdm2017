They have shown great potential for detecting and repairing inconsistent data. Constant CFDs are 100% confidence association rules. The theoretical search space for the minimal set of CFDs is the set of minimal generators and their closures in data. This search space has been used in the currently most efficient constant CFD discovery algorithm. In this paper, we propose pruning criteria to further prune the theoretic search space, and design a fast algorithm for constant CFD discovery. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on a number of media to large real-world data sets. The proposed algorithm is faster than the currently most efficient constant CFD discovery algorithm, and has linear time performance in the size of a data set.", "paper_title": "Effective Pruning for the Discovery of Conditional Functional Dependencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000315631100009"}
