However, because of the data exposure when transmitted via cable, wireless mobile devices, and other technologies, its security vulnerability has become a great concern during its further extending development. This problem may even get worse if the user privacy and property are considered. Therefore, the authentication process of communicating entities has attracted wide investigation. Meanwhile, the data confidentiality also becomes an important issue in M2M, especially when the data are transmitted in a public and thereby insecure channel. In this paper, we propose a promising M2M application model that connects a mobile user with the home network using the existing popular Time Division-Synchronous Code Division Multiple Access (TD-SCDMA) network. Subsequently, a password-based authentication and key establishment protocol is designed to identify the communicating parties and hence establish a secure channel for data transmissions. The final analysis shows the reliability of our proposed protocol.
