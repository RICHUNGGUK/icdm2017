This article measures and compares the latency and the throughput of Time Division - Long Term Evolution (TD-LTE), WiMAX, and third-generation (3G) systems based on several technical trials. Our quantitative measures and comparisons provide guidelines for the operators to deploy their future networks.", "paper_title": "PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS OF TD-LTE, WIMAX AND 3G SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000321278800021"}
