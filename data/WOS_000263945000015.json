If furthermore G[R] is k-connected and every element in V is covered by at least m sets in R, then R is a (k, m)-CSC. In this paper, we present two approximation algorithms for the minimum CSC problem, and one approximation algorithm for the minimum (2, m)-CSC problem. Performance ratios are analyzed. These are the first approximation algorithms for CSC problems in general graphs with guaranteed performance ratios. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
