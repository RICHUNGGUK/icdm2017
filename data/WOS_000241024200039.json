In this paper we discuss our current work on a prototype lightweight Java-based argumentation engine that can be used to implement a non-monotonic reasoning component in Internet or agent-based applications. As far as possible we are aiming towards implementing a general purpose argumentation engine that can be configured to conform to one of a range of semantics.", "paper_title": "An implementation of a lightweight argumentation engine for agent applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241024200039"}
