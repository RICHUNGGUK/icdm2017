The phenomena of ROQ and missing measurements are governed by a Bernoulli distributed stochastic sequence. The purpose of the addressed problem is to design a state estimator such that the dynamics of the estimation error is exponentially stable in the mean square and the prescribed H-infinity performance constraint is satisfied. By constructing proper Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and employing stochastic analysis techniques, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the existence of the desired estimator. Furthermore, the explicit expression of the gain of the desired estimator is described in terms of the solution to a conVex optimization problem that can be easily solved by using the semi-definite programme method. Finally, a numerical example is employed to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed estimator design approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
