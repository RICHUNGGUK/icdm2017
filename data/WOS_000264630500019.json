In the recent literature, the extension of a face classifier in order to include new people in the model has been solved using online feature extraction techniques. The most successful approaches of those are the extensions of the principal component analysis or the linear discriminant analysis. In the current paper, a new online boosting algorithm is introduced: a face recognition method that extends a boosting-based classifier by adding new classes while avoiding the need of retraining the classifier each time a new person joins the system. The classifier is learned using the multitask learning principle where multiple verification tasks are trained together sharing the same feature space. The new classes are added taking advantage of the structure learned previously, being the addition of new classes not computationally demanding. The present proposal has been (experimentally) validated with two different facial data sets by comparing our approach with the current state-of-the-art techniques. The results show that the proposed online boosting algorithm fares better in terms of final accuracy. In addition, the global performance does not decrease drastically even when the number of classes of the base problem is multiplied by eight.", "paper_title": "Boosted Online Learning for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000264630500019"}
