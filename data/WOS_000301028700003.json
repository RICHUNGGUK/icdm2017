Our method avoids calculating exponential matrices, is very intuitive and easy to express, and can be implemented without toil in any number of spatial dimensions. Although there is currently a vast literature on the numerical treatment of the one-dimensional sine-Gordon equation, the references for the two-dimensional case are much sparser, and virtually nonexistent for higher dimensions. We apply it to a battery of two-dimensional problems taken from the literature, showing that it largely outperforms the previously existing algorithms: while for three-dimensional problems, the results seem very promising.
