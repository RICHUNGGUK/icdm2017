If G is a group of automorphisms of Gamma, then there is a polynomial OP(Gamma),(G)((X)), whose value at the positive integer k is the number of orbits of G on proper k-colourings of Gamma. It is known that real chromatic roots cannot be negative, but they are dense in [32/27, infinity infinity]. Here we discuss the location of real orbital chromatic roots. We show, for example, that they are dense in R, but under certain hypotheses, there are zero-free regions. We also look at orbital flow roots. Here things are more complicated because the orbit count is given by a multivariate polynomial; but it has a natural univariate specialization, and we show that the roots of these polynomials are dense in the negative real axis.", "paper_title": "Orbital chromatic and flow roots", "paper_id": "WOS:000246254600004"}
