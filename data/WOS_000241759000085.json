Though stochastic optimization strategies simulating evolution process are proved to be valuable tools, the balance between exploitation and exploration of which is difficult to be maintained. In this paper, some established techniques to improve the performance of evolutionary computation are discussed firstly, such as uniform design, deflection and stretching the objective function, and space contraction. Then a novel scheme of evolutionary algorithms is proposed to solving the optimization problems through adding evolution operations to the searching space contracted regularly with these techniques. A typical evolution algorithm differential evolution is chosen to exhibit the new scheme's performance and the experiments done to minimize the benchmark nonlinear optimization problems and to detect nonlinear map's unstable periodic points show the put approach is very robust.", "paper_title": "UEAS: A novel united evolutionary algorithm scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000085"}
