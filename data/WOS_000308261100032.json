The robust residual STO estimator is derived by properly selecting the amount of cyclic delay and a pilot pattern in the presence of frequency selectivity. Via computer simulation, it is shown that the proposed STO estimation scheme is robust to the frequency selectivity of the channel, with a performance better than the conventional scheme.", "paper_title": "Improved STO Estimation Scheme by Cyclic Delay and Pilot Selection for OFDM-Based Broadcasting Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308261100032"}
