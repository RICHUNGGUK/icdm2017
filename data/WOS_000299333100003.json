Hence, it is clear the necessity of having efficient performance evaluation models to select the best control policy in a specific context. This paper proposes a mathematical programming representation of the main pull control policies applied to single-product serial manufacturing systems. The proposed models simulate the pull controlled system in the sense that, if instantiated with the same parameter values as in a simulation model, their solution gives the same event sequence of the simulation. The proposed mathematical representation is also used for a formal comparison of the considered pull control policies. The new models presented in this paper can represent a base to build new efficient optimization algorithms for the design of pull controlled production systems.", "paper_title": "Mathematical programming representation of pull controlled single-product serial manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000299333100003"}
