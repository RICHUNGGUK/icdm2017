For every natural number k we construct a family (L(r)(k) vertical bar r is an element of N) of languages which can be recognized by NFA's with size k.poly(r) and ambiguity O(n(k)), but L(r)(k) has only NFA's with size exponential in r, if ambiguity o(n(k)) is required. In particular, a hierarchy for polynomial ambiguity is obtained, solving a long standing open problem (Ravikumar and Ibarra, SIAM J. Comput. 19: 1263-1282, 1989, Leung, SIAM J.
