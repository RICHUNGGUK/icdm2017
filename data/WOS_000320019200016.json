A novel model with structured norm-bounded uncertainties is proposed to describe control system with input quantisation. Under a multirate scheme, a delay compensation strategy is presented. The networked predictive control synthesis approach is developed by solving a finite receding horizon optimisation problem with free control moves. It is shown that the proposed predictive controller not only efficiently reduces the negative effects of the quantisation and communication delays but also guarantees the closed-loop stability and satisfies constraints. Finally, a simulation example illustrates the effectiveness of the derived method.", "paper_title": "Networked predictive control of constrained linear systems with input quantisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000320019200016"}
