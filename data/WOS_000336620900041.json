The media considered may have significantly different physical properties and constitutive laws, describing for example fluids or hyperelastic solids. The model is fully Eulerian and the scheme is the same for all materials. We show stiff numerical illustrations in case of gas-gas, gas-water, gas-elastic solid interactions in the large deformation regime. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
