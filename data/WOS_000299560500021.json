Biclustering algorithms have been proven to be able to group the genes with similar expression patterns under a number of experimental conditions. In this paper, we propose a new biclustering algorithm based on evolutionary learning. By converting the biclustering problem into a common clustering problem, the algorithm can be applied in a search space constructed by the conditions. To further reduce the size of the search space, we randomly separate the full conditions into a number of condition subsets (subspaces), each of which has a smaller number of conditions. The algorithm is applied to each subspace and is able to discover bicluster seeds within a limited computing time. Finally, an expanding and merging procedure is employed to combine the bicluster seeds into larger biclusters according to a homogeneity criterion. We test the performance of the proposed algorithm using synthetic and real microarray data sets. Compared with several previously developed biclustering algorithms, our algorithm demonstrates a significant improvement in discovering additive biclusters.", "paper_title": "Parallelized Evolutionary Learning for Detection of Biclusters in Gene Expression Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000299560500021"}
