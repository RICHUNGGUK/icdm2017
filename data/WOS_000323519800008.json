The objective of this work was to use laser Doppler and micro-computer tomography (micro-CT) scanning to characterise neovascularisation of the soft tissues surrounding the fracture during healing. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats underwent mid-shaft osteotomy of the left femur, stabilised with a custom-designed external fixator. Five animals were killed at each of 2, 4 days, 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-operatively. Femoral blood perfusion in the fractured and intact contralateral limbs was measured using laser Doppler scanning pre- and post-operatively and throughout the healing period. At sacrifice, the common iliac artery was cannulated and infused with silicone contrast agent. Micro-CT scans of the femur and adjacent soft tissues revealed vessel characteristics and distribution in relation to the fracture zone. Blood perfusion dropped immediately after surgery and then recovered to greater than the pre-operative level by proliferation of small vessels around the fracture zone. Multi-modal imaging allowed both longitudinal functional and detailed structural analysis of the neovascularisation process.", "paper_title": "Characterising neovascularisation in fracture healing with laser Doppler and micro-CT scanning", "paper_id": "WOS:000323519800008"}
