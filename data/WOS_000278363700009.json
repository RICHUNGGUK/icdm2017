Weber in 1996. Our construction is based on a lexicographic ordering of computations of automata and on two coverings that can be build by means of this ordering. The complexity of the construction, measured as the number of states of the transducers involved in the decomposition, improves the original one by one exponential.", "paper_title": "Lexicographic Decomposition of k-Valued Transducers", "paper_id": "WOS:000278363700009"}
