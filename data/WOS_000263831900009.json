A fast Fourier transformation (FFT)-based disturbance frequency estimation approach is proposed and performance indexes are improved by integrating such frequency information. Furthermore, in the left eigenvector assignment, both eigenvalues and free parameters are optimized. As illustrated in the application to the actuator fault detection of a GTE, significant improvements are achieved compared to the existing methods. By combining the frequency estimation and eigenvalue optimization, the main contribution of the paper is the reduction of the computation complexity and the avoidance of the local optimal solution due to fixed eigenvalues.", "paper_title": "Disturbance Attenuation in Fault Detection of Gas Turbine Engines: A Discrete Robust Observer Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000263831900009"}
