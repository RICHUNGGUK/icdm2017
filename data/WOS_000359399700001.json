LDRSKM extends the regularized soft k-means algorithm by exploiting the local and non-local geometric information of the data and generalized linear discriminant analysis to provide a better and more meaningful data partition. LDRSKM can perform clustering and subspace selection simultaneously, enhancing the separability of data residing in different clusters. With the data partition obtained, kernel support vector data description (KSVDD) is used to establish the monitoring statistics and control limits. Two Bayesian inference based global fault detection indicators are then developed using the local monitoring results associated with principal and residual subspaces. Based on clustering analysis, Bayesian inference and manifold learning methods, the within and cross-mode correlations, and local geometric information can be exploited to enhance monitoring performances for nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes. The effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method are evaluated using the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process.", "paper_title": "A novel multimode process monitoring method integrating LDRSKM with Bayesian inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000359399700001"}
