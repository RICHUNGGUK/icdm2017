SVD decomposes a rectangular real or complex matrix into two orthogonal matrices and one diagonal matrix. The proposed Quantum-SVD algorithm interpolates the non-uniform angles in the Fourier domain. The error of the Quantum-SVD approach is some orders lower than the error given by ordinary Quantum Fourier Transformation. Our Quantum-SVD algorithm is a fundamentally novel approach for the computation of the Quantum Fourier Transformation (QFT) of non-uniform states. The presented Quantum-SVD algorithm is based on the singular value decomposition mechanism, and the computation of Quantum Fourier Transformation of non-uniform angles of a quantum system. The Quantum-SVD approach provides advantages in terms of computational structure, being based on QFT and multiplications.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM SINGULAR VALUE DECOMPOSITION BASED APPROXIMATION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000283501400001"}
