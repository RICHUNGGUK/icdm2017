However, serious time-varying interference obstructs this macro/femto overlaid network to realize its true potential. In this article, we present a macro services guaranteed resource allocation scheme, which can mitigate various dominant interferences and provide multiple services in macro/femto overlaid Third-Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution-Advanced networks. We model our multiple services resource allocation scheme into a multiobjective optimization problem, which is a non-deterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard problem. Then, we give a low-complexity algorithm consisting of two layers based on chordal graph. Simulation results verify that the proposed scheme can achieve better efficiency than the previous works and raise the satisfaction ratio of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) services while improving the average performance of non-GBR services.", "paper_title": "Efficient resource allocation scheme for multi-service based on interference mitigation in LTE-Advanced networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339365500004"}
