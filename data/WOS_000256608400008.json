The torus has been the underlying topology for a number of practical multicomputers. Analytical models of fully adaptive routing have recently been proposed for PCS in the torus under the uniform traffic pattern. However, there has not been any similar analytical model of PCS under the non-uniform traffic pattern, such as that generated by the presence of hot spots in the network. This pap er proposes a new analytical model of PCS in the torus operating under the hot spot traffic pattern. Results from simulation experiments show close agreement with those predicted by the analytical model. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
