The mobile agents are autonomous, oblivious, labeled, and move asynchronously. Moreover, we consider an undirected anonymous connected graph. For this problem, we exhibit some asymptotical time and space lower bounds as well as some necessary conditions. We also propose an algorithm that is asymptotically optimal in both space and round complexities.", "paper_title": "ASYMPTOTICALLY OPTIMAL DETERMINISTIC RENDEZVOUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753200009"}
