The following methods are discussed: Kalman filtering, extended Kalman filtering, unscented Kalman filtering, particle filtering, and moving horizon estimation. The current research literature on particle filtering and moving horizon estimation is reviewed, and the advantages, and disadvantages of these methods are presented. Topics for new research are suggested that address combining the best features of moving horizon estimation and particle filters. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
