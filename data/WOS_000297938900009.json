This moduli set has 4n-bit dynamic range and well-formed moduli which result in increased performance of RNS arithmetic unit. Then, an efficient reverse converter is presented based on New Chinese remainder theorem2 (New CRT-II) for proposed moduli set. The converter is ROM-free and based on carry save adders and modular adders which can be efficiently implemented by VLSI circuits. The presented reverse converter for moduli set {2(2n), 2(n+1) - 1, 2(n/2) + 1, 2(n/2) - 1} has lower delay and hardware cost in comparison to the reverse converter of the latest introduced four-moduli set {2(n) - 1, 2(n), 2(n) + 1, 2(n+1) - 1} with 4n-bit dynamic range.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT REVERSE CONVERTER FOR THE NEW FOUR-MODULI SET {2(2n), 2(n+1)-1, 2(n/2)+1, 2(n/2)-1}", "paper_id": "WOS:000297938900009"}
