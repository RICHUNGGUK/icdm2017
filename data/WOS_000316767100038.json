However, we use our modified ABC (MABC; Mansouri et al. [13]) to perform the required task. Some examples (including the benchmark functions Griewank and Rastrigin) illustrate the rationality of the method and the validity of the solution. We compare our results with other methods including Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Algorithm (PSO). The results show that proposed method outperforms the other algorithms.
