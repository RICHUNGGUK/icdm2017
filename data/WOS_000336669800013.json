The use of transmission power control (TPC) can help address industrial issues concerning energy consumption, interference, and fading. This paper presents a TPC algorithm designed for industrial applications based on theoretical and empirical studies. It is shown that the proposed algorithm adapts to variations in link quality, and is hardware-independent and practical.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Multi-Channel Transmission Power Control for Industrial Wireless Instrumentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336669800013"}
