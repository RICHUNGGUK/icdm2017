Instead of performing Alamouti coding on original data symbols, we perform Alamouti coding on pre-processing signal at the transmitter in our proposed scheme. We show that our proposed scheme has fast single-symbol maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding and achieves full spatial diversity. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve the BER performance of Alamouti coding under both of the flat-fading channel and the frequency-selective channel. Therefore, it is an efficient Alamouti coding scheme for CP-FBMC systems with two transmit antennas.", "paper_title": "An Alamouti coded CP-FBMC-MIMO system with two transmit antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000362698900011"}
