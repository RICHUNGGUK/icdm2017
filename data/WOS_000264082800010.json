These technologies include spectrum-efficient multiband generation and dispersion-tolerant transmission, long-reach transmission without dispersion compensation, and a transport feasibility study for flexible optical routing using multiple reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs). Using the developed system, we successfully implement the testbed trial on the delivery of uncompressed 270 Mbits/s standard-definition television and 1.485 Gbits/s HD television video signals over optical fiber and air links.
