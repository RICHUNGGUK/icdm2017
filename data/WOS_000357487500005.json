In this paper, we introduce a novel technique for discretization of a sphere in the integer space, which gives rise to a set of mathematically accurate, 3D-printable physical voxels up to the desired level of precision. The proposed technique is based on an interesting correspondence between the voxel set forming a discrete sphere and certain easy-to-compute integer intervals defined by voxel position and sphere dimension. It gives us several algorithmic leverages, such as computational sufficiency with simple integer operations and amenability to layer-by-layer additive fabrication. Theoretical analysis, prototype characteristics, and experimental results demonstrate its efficiency, versatility, and further prospects.", "paper_title": "Layer the sphere For accurate and additive voxelation by integer operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000357487500005"}
