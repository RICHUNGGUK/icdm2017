The formal framework of READYLOG, Which is based oil the situation calculus, features imperative control structures such as loops and procedures, allows for decision-theoretic planning, and accounts for a continuously changing world. We developed high-level controllers in READYLOG, for our soccer robots in RoboCup's Middle-size league, but also for service robots and for autonomous agents in interactive computer games. For a successful deployment of READYLOG on a real robot it is also important to account for the control problem as a whole, integrating the low-level control Of the robot (Such as localization, navigation, and object recognition) with the logic-based high-level control. In doing so, our approach can be seen as a step towards bridging the gap between the fields of robotics and knowledge representation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
