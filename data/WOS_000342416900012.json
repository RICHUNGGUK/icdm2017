Using a stochastic control problem formulation, the existence and structure of optimal quantization policies are studied. For a finite-horizon problem with bounded per-stage distortion measure, the existence of an optimal zero-delay quantization policy is shown provided that the quantizers allowed are ones with convex codecells. The bounded distortion assumption is relaxed to cover cases that include the linear quadratic Gaussian problem. For the infinite horizon problem and a stationary Markov source, the optimality of deterministic Markov coding policies is shown. The existence of optimal stationary Markov quantization policies is also shown provided randomization that is shared by the encoder and the decoder is allowed.", "paper_title": "On Optimal Zero-Delay Coding of Vector Markov Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900012"}
