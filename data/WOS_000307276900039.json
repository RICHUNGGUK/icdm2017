We have pointed out three possible pathways and found a new low-energy process of its decomposition. The N-N bond cleavage in composition B has higher dissociation energies than the monomer, but it is also the initial step. The optimized structures and the frequencies of all the stationary points were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The minimum-energy paths were obtained by using the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) theory, and the reaction potential energy curve was corrected with zero-point energy. Finally, the rate constants were calculated in a wide temperature region from 200 to 2500 K using TST, TST/Eckart theories. The obtained results also indicate that the tunneling effects are remarkable at low temperature (200 K < T < 500 K).", "paper_title": "Theoretical study of the decomposition mechanisms and kinetics of the ingredients RDX in composition B", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900039"}
