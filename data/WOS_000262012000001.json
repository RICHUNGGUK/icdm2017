The use of a concurrent topology enables saving die area and power consumption compared with the parallel solution that employs two separated LNAs. An original design methodology that helps in the selection of input/output matching network element values is also presented. The LNA die area is 1.0 x 0.9 mm(2) and it consumes 9 mW (5 MA at 1.8 V).
