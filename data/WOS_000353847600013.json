However, random behavior of the primary user (PU) appears to be an enormous challenge. In this paper, we propose a PU behavior aware joint channel selection and allocation scheme. In the first step, the channels are ranked based on statistics of the PU usage whereas in the second phase, a proportional fair oriented channel allocation scheme is employed to allocate channels among CRs. We also introduce the concept of a time-varying framing process (TVFP) that minimizes the overall data transmission time. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing schemes in terms of the transmission-time and the number of collisions with the PUs. In addition, it helps to save a significant amount of transmission power. Moreover, it provides a significantly higher system throughput as compared to the existing schemes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
