In Science and Technology, there is a wide use of data mining in areas like bioinformatics, genetics, Web, and, more recently, astroinformatics. However, the application in NSM has been limited and inconsiderable. In this article, we provide an account of how data mining has been applied in managing networks and systems for the past four decades, presumably since its birth. We look into the field's applications in the key NSM activities-discovery, monitoring, analysis, reporting, and domain knowledge acquisition. In the end, we discuss our perspective on the issues that are considered critical for the effective application of data mining in the modern systems which are characterized by heterogeneity and high dynamism.", "paper_title": "Four Decades of Data Mining in Network and Systems Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000361245300009"}
