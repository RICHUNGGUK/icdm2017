We show an interesting non-smooth bifurcation of the crossing-sliding type that causes symmetry breaking. In its simplicity it was not obvious for a long time to find chaos in the simple one degree-of-freedom sliding block model with dry-friction. With the introduction of static coefficient of friction besides the dynamic one we found chaotic bands over a wide range of parameters. In this work we also highlight the possibility of transient chaos for a narrow range of parameters. (C) 2013 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
