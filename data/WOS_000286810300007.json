The problem to be addressed is the design of a state feedback controller such that the acceptability, internal stability and causality of the resulting closed-loop system is guaranteed and a prescribed H-infinity performance level is ensured. In terms of a linear matrix inequality (LMI), a sufficient condition for the solvability of the problem is obtained. A desired state feedback controller can be designed by solving a certain LMI. A numerical example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "H-infinity control for 2-D singular delayed systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000286810300007"}
