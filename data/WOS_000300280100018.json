First type with fuzzy coefficients in the objective function and the second type with fuzzy right-hand side values and fuzzy variables. Considering fuzzy derivative and fuzzy differential equations, these kinds of problems are solved using a fuzzy neural network model. To show the applicability of the method, it is applied to solve the fuzzy shortest path problem and the fuzzy maximum flow problem. Numerical results illustrate the method accuracy and it's simple implementation.", "paper_title": "A new fuzzy neural network model for solving fuzzy linear programming problems and its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000300280100018"}
