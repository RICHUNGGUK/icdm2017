As a result, providing efficient and secure query assurance over these emerging future information systems is a concern. This paper details the use of temporary time stamps and variable hash granularity to increase the efficiency of query assurance. This approach is implemented against datasets of varying type and size, including encrypted data to illustrate the potential overhead issues present in distributed systems and data repositories.", "paper_title": "External and Distributed Databases: Efficient and Secure XML Query Assurance", "paper_id": "WOS:000304476000003"}
