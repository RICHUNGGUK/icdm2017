To cluster multi-represented objects, dedicated data mining algorithms have been shown to achieve improved results. In this paper, we will introduce combination trees for describing arbitrary semantic relationships which can be used to extend the hierarchical clustering algorithm OPTICS to handle multi-represented data objects. To back up the usability of our proposed method, we present encouraging results on real world data sets.", "paper_title": "Clustering multi-represented objects using combination trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600021"}
