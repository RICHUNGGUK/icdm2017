It could cost much effort in digitization and archiving. To meet the requirements in a digital archiving system, several issues must be addressed. First, it usually requires resources such as computation and storage for each individual digital archive to maintain its own service. Second, the archived content would be more useful if they can be easily utilized in providing services such as searching across multiple archives. Current approaches usually adopt metadata harvesting that would build a centralized index from separate digital libraries. They usually suffer from the problem of metadata inconsistency. In this paper, we propose a distributed indexing approach to collaborative content-based multimedia retrieval across digital archives. To reduce the loads in each archive, we dynamically distribute the tasks of crawling, indexing, and query processing depending on the response time. Distributed crawler-based approach can simplify the design of indexing and query processing steps by maintaining the data to be indexed local to the machine for crawling. It can facilitate efficient archiving and indexing by automatically following the link structure of contents published on the Web. Also, it enables simpler implementation and easier support for cross-archive applications such as search and copy detection. Experimental results show the potential of the proposed approach in load balancing with appropriate task distribution.", "paper_title": "CoBITs: a distributed indexing approach to collaborative content-based multimedia retrieval across digital archives", "paper_id": "WOS:000351692300005"}
