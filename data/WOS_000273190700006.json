In our proposed method, the routing structure on each layer is restricted while keeping most of feasible patterns to efficiently obtain a feasible routing pattern. A routing pattern that satisfies the design rule is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming. In experiments with seven data. we obtain a routing pattern such that satisfies the design rule within a practical time by using a mixed integer linear programming solver.", "paper_title": "MILP-Based Efficient Routing Method with Restricted Route Structure for 2-Layer Ball Grid Array Packages", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700006"}
