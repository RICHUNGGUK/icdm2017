Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is used to solve the Navier Stokes equations. A fully flooded inlet and outlet conditions are assumed taking into account the piston ring elasticity. Honing and wave-cut cylinder geometries were compared while the pressure distribution along the ring thickness and the lubricant film is determined for each crank angle. The present results demonstrate that the honed cylinder geometry improves the friction results increasing the oil film thickness. Further, the artificially textured piston rings with the honed cylinder liner were investigated. As a result, we propose the operational function between the textured rings with the modified cylinder liners in marine engines. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
