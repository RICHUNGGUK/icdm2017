In this article we present a statistical machine learning approach to performance estimation in fast, instruction accurate simulators and evaluate our methodology comprehensively against three popular embedded RISC processors and about 300 embedded applications. We show that our methodology is capable of providing accurate performance estimations with an average error of less than 3.9% while, on average, operating approximate to 14.5 times faster than cycle-accurate simulation.", "paper_title": "Statistical Performance Modeling in Functional Instruction Set Simulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000307050900012"}
