Here, the authors examine research in this space, starting with a historical look at papers that address two consistent problems: user authentication and email encryption. Drawing from successes and failures within these areas, they study several security systems to determine how important design is to usable security. Their discussion offers guidelines for future system design.", "paper_title": "A brief introduction to usable security", "paper_id": "WOS:000255504400005"}
