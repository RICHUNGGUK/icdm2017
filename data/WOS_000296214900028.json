Intelligent agents are used to simulate team members of self-organizing teams. In the virtual self-organizing team, agents adapt the Q-learning algorithm to adjust their actions. Three sets of experiments are manipulated to study the evolution of rules. The results of few experiments show a new rule for conflict resolution emerged from the dynamic interactions of agents. For the other experiments, agents cannot resolve conflicts by themselves. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
