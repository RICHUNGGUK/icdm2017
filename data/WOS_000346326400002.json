We connected EC2 based cloud clusters located in USA to university clusters located in Switzerland. We ran a concurrent multiscale MPI based application on this infrastructure and measured the overhead induced by extending our HPC clusters with EC2 resources. Our results indicate that accommodating some parts of the multiscale computation on cloud resources can lead to low performance without a proper adjustment of CPUs power and workload. However, by enforcing a load-balancing strategy one can benefit from the extra Cloud resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
