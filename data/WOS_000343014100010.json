An image processor and a transceiver are also adopted in multimedia system-on-a-chip to handle the data from the image sensor. A wide input range and flexible data bandwidth are needed for the serial link receiver to deal with various sensor specifications. This paper presents an 11.2-Gb/s low-voltage differential signaling (LVDS) receiver for various portable devices that employ a LVDS system for data transmission between an image sensor and a processor. The designed LVDS receiver has 16 data channels and four clock channels. All the channels are selectively turned on or off, depending on the application. The proposed comparator used for the input driver of the receiver has a rail-to-rail input range and 60 mV of minimum input swing level. The clock dividing ratio and the data de-serializing factor of the proposed receiver are also programmable to deal with various color depths of image sensors. The designed LVDS receiver is fabricated in a 0.13-mu m CMOS process, occupying 4-4 mm, with a 7.24-mm(2) core. Power consumption is 77.38 mW, when every channel is turned on.", "paper_title": "An 11.2-Gb/s LVDS Receiver With a Wide Input Range Comparator", "paper_id": "WOS:000343014100010"}
