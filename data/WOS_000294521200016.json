The scheduling algorithm is responsible for allocating the available system resources to the existing jobs. The emergence of multi-core processors poses new demands on schedulers. In this paper, we study the performance of gang scheduling algorithms for homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters which consist of multi-core processors. Furthermore, a migration schema is suggested which is suitable for scheduling gangs in multi-core clusters. A simulation model is used to provide results on the performance of the system.
