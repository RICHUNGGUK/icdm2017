The total costs consist of two components: firstly linear transportation cost and secondly the costs of investing in a facility as well as maintaining and operating it. These facility costs are general and non-linear in shape and could express both changing economies of scale and diseconomies of scale. We formulate the problem as a two-stage stochastic programming model where both demand and short-run costs may be uncertain at the investment time. We use a solution method based on Lagrangean relaxation, and show computational results for a slaughterhouse location case from the Norwegian meat industry. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
