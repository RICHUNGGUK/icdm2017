TSF employs a combination of entropy gain and a distance measure, referred to as the Entrance (entropy and distance) gain, for evaluating the splits. Experimental studies show that the Entrance gain improves the accuracy of TSF. TSF randomly samples features at each tree node and has computational complexity linear in the length of time series, and can be built using parallel computing techniques. The temporal importance curve is proposed to capture the temporal characteristics useful for classification. Experimental studies show that TSF using simple features such as mean, standard deviation and slope is computationally efficient and outperforms strong competitors such as one-nearest-neighbor classifiers with dynamic time warping.
