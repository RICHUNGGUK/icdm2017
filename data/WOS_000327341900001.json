The data dissemination protocol for V2V applications should not only provide end-to-end transmissions with low error probability and high throughput but also offer antieavesdropping capabilities. To achieve this goal, we in this paper propose a secrecy-enhanced relaying protocol for vehicular environments. Based on the network topology and the velocity of the moving vehicles, the proposed scheme first generates the relay candidate set, from which a single relay is then selected opportunistically to assist the source. By using the superposition coding strategy, the selected relay jointly sends the source message and the artificial interference to enable secure communications. We derive the tight closed-form expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the secrecy outage probability, based on which we analyze the diversity order of the system. The method to generate the interference signal is introduced, and the choice of superposition weight factor is also given. The analytical and simulation results show that the proposed relay-aided protocol yields a better performance than the competing alternatives in terms of both the secrecy performance and the implementation complexity.", "paper_title": "Secrecy-Enhanced Data Dissemination Using Cooperative Relaying in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327341900001"}
