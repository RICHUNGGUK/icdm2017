This analysis can inform the choice of appropriate likelihood functions, thereby advancing hydrologic modeling with improved parameter and quantity estimates and more reliable assessment of uncertainty. For long-running models, the Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM) algorithm offers spectacular reductions in time required for MCMC analysis. This is partly due to multiple parameter sets being evaluated simultaneously. The ability to use this feature is hindered in models that have a large number of input files, such as SWAT. A conceptually simple, robust method for applying DREAM to SWAT in R is provided. The general approach is transferrable to any executable that reads input files. We provide this approach to reduce barriers to the use of MCMC algorithms and to promote the development of appropriate likelihood functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
