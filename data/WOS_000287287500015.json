The proposed extension introduces a conjunction of a pair of role inclusion axioms (RIAs) and defines quasi simple roles. In our proposal, we define the syntax, semantics and knowledge base for the extension of the SROIQ DL We also present a sound and complete tableau algorithm for the SROIQ DL extension. Finally, we give an analysis of the expressiveness of the proposed extension of the SROIQ DL for modeling part-part relations and compare it with the state of the art in the area.
