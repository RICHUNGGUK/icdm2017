By following classic coupled-resonator filter theory, the equivalent circuits (parallel LCs) of the dual-mode resonators between the J inverters are derived separately at the two passbands. Each dual-mode resonator is first approximately constructed with a series combination of the two parallel lumped circuit (LC) resonators, and then the element values are iteratively updated for better accuracy. A design example is given and good agreement is achieved between the simulated and measured results, demonstrating the feasibility of the synthesis method. The passband bandwidths are fully controllable.
