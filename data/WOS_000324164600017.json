In this paper, we present a novel framework which generates approximate Poisson disk distribution directly on mesh, a discrete representation of 2-manifold surfaces. Our framework is easy to implement and provides extra flexibility to specified sampling issues like feature-preserving sampling and adaptive sampling. We integrate the tensor voting method into feature detection and adaptive sample radius calculation. Remeshing as a special downstream application is also addressed. According to our experiment results, our framework is efficient, robust, and widely applicable.", "paper_title": "Approximate Poisson disk sampling on mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000324164600017"}
