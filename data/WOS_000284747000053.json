The problem is motivated by winter gritting applications where the timing of each intervention is crucial. The variable neighborhood descent is based on neighborhood structures that manipulate arcs or sequences of arcs. Computational results are reported on problems derived from classical capacitated arc routing problem instances. A comparison is also provided with an alternative approach where the arc routing problem is solved after being transformed into an equivalent node routing problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
