The proposed combination differs from previous formulations in that one of the inverse Fourier transforms and the Green's functions (GF) integrals are obtained in closed form. This strategy is not only supremely efficient, but also avoids singularities when the collocation point belongs to the integrating boundary element, and provides accurate evaluations of the coefficients of the boundary element matrices.
