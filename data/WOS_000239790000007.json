From the computational point of view, his algorithms illustrate that quantum computation could be more powerful. It is natural to consider that the power of quantum computation could be exploited to withstand even quantum adversaries. Over the last decade, quantum cryptography has been discussed and developed even from the computational complexity-theoretic point of view. In this paper, we will survey what has been studied in quantum computational cryptography.", "paper_title": "Progress in quantum computational cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000239790000007"}
