To simultaneously accommodate such diverse technical requirements in the H-CRAN, in this article, a new paradigm of HCRAN design to significantly reduce latency is presented. From the refined radio access in the air interface, new methodology of radio resource optimization in the system architecture, and intelligent routing/paging in the backhaul, the provided foundation suggests open-loop communications and other new directions to facilitate state-of-the-art practices of the H-CRAN.", "paper_title": "ULTRA-LOW-LATENCY UBIQUITOUS CONNECTIONS IN HETEROGENEOUS CLOUD RADIO ACCESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000357662100006"}
