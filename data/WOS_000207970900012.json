The convergence speed of SSE is much faster than simple genetic algorithm. It sacrifices somewhat the global search performance. This paper describes an improved algorithm of SSE, which is named as cross-generational elitist selection SSE (cSSE). In cSSE, the use of the cross-generational elitist selection enhances the diversity of the individuals in the population and therefore, the global search performance is improved. In the numerical examples, cSSE is compared with genetic algorithm with minimum generation gap (MGG), Bayesian optimization algorithm (BOA), and SSE. The results show that cSSE has fast convergence and good global search performance.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary algorithm based on schemata theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000207970900012"}
