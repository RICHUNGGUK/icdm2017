The automation of the negotiation process among buyers and suppliers has become an important policy in the transactional networks. This leads to assessing the roles of both quantifiable and non-quantifiable parameters in coordination mechanisms with the aim of achieving higher performance. Here, we develop an e-based supply chain multi-agent model for the design of mass-customized on-line services. The model addresses the bullwhip effect in multi-stage supply chain and also clarifies the evaluation of inventory policies in various supply and demand uncertainties. To illustrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement a prototype system and evaluate its performance by simulation using Colored Petri Nets (CPNs). The validation results reveal the model efficiency in providing a more realistic optimization process that takes the dynamic information flow in uncertainty environments into consideration.", "paper_title": "Agent-based web service for the design of a dynamic coordination mechanism in supply networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000271643400010"}
