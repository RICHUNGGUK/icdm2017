The output error method was used to produce aerodynamic coefficients, stability and control derivatives. A flight training device (FTD) was developed based on the estimated flight parameters. Flat earth, rigid body, and standard atmosphere were assumed in the FTD model. Euler angles were adapted for rotated state variables to reduce the computational load. Variations in flight Mach number and Reynolds number were assumed to be negligible. Body, wind, stability and inertial axes allow 6 second-order linear differential equations for translational and rotational motions. The equations of motion were integrated with respect to time, resulting in good agreement with the flight tests. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
