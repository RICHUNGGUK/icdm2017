We prove that only straight lines have uniform rational parameterizations. For any plane curve other than lines, we show how to find a rational reparameterization that has the maximum uniformity among all the rational parameterizations of the same degree. We also establish specific results for quadratic and certain cubic Bezier curves. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
