Among these details, effects produced by aging are particularly hard to handle, and adding them is significantly time-consuming. Existing methods such as physically based and empirical simulations are not suitable for artists since they require the manipulation of complex physical parameters, and their results are difficult to control. Our approach offers a framework for quickly adding aging effects based on a simple example. By defining an aging recipe based on local properties, an artist can easily apply similar effects to different objects or to multiple occurrences of the same object. Also, when aging patterns consist of simple color variations, we propose a color-independent process capable of producing various colorations of the same effect from a single example.
