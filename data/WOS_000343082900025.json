The sensitivity analysis is based on metabolic control analysis, computing the local, global and time-dependent properties of model components. Interactive visualization facilitates interpretation of usually complex results. SensA can contribute to the analysis, adjustment and understanding of mathematical models for dynamic systems.", "paper_title": "SensA: web-based sensitivity analysis of SBML models", "paper_id": "WOS:000343082900025"}
