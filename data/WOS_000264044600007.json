Design/methodology/approach - After a careful survey of various tools and techniques available for computerised client-centred information services, the study selected to apply web usage mining, proxy level data collection and a vector space retrieval model to develop the personalised information Support for teaching and research in a higher education institution. Findings - There are practical constraints in the implementation stage. There is considerable difficulty ill getting real and correct User interests and mapping them effectively into the products and services offered by the library. Also the interests Of users change continuously. If multiple users share the same PC, it is difficult to identify the user as there is no one-to-one mapping between user and IP address. Research limitations/implications - The paper has not considered cases for all the faculty members due to time constraints. The results obtained from the system also need correlation with the sources actually used by the faculty to test its efficacy in a highly fluid research situation like higher academics. Practical implications - A pragmatic client-centred information support prototype described in this paper may find use in other institutions needing similar information support. Originality/value - This paper demonstrates the pragmatic application of ICT for linking users and e-resources in an academic library.", "paper_title": "A personalised information support system for searching portals and e-resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000264044600007"}
