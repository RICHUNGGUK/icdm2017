In this article, we propose a two-parameter probit model with latent variables. Introducing the latent variables enables exact Bayesian inference in the sense that conditional posterior distributions of all the parameters, including the latent variables, are known. Such inference can be more accurate than the maximum likelihood inference and can also alleviate the estimation issue due to small sample size [Albert J, Chib S.
