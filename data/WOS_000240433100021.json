While conventional superpositioning methods use ordinary least-squares (LS) as the optimization criterion, MIL superpositions provide substantially improved accuracy by down-weighting variable structural regions and by correcting for correlations among atoms. ML superpositioning is robust and insensitive to the specific atoms included in the analysis, and thus it does not require subjective pruning of selected variable atomic coordinates. Output includes both likelihood-based and frequentist statistics for accurate evaluation of the adequacy of a superposition and for reliable analysis of structural similarities and differences. THESEUS performs principal components analysis for analyzing the complex correlations found among atoms within a structural ensemble.", "paper_title": "THESEUS: maximum likelihood superpositioning and analysis of macromolecular structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240433100021"}
