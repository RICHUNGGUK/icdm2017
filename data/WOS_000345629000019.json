Our attention is focused on the design of a reliable filter to ensure a strictly dissipative performance for the filtering error system. Based on the reciprocally convex approach, firstly, a sufficient condition of reliable dissipativity analysis is proposed for T-S fuzzy systems with time-varying delays and sensor failures. Then, a reliable filter with strict dissipativity is designed by solving a convex optimization problem, which can be efficiently solved by standard numerical algorithms. Finally, numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques.", "paper_title": "Reliable Filtering With Strict Dissipativity for T-S Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345629000019"}
