To overcome this shortcoming, this paper presents a new penalty function which has no parameter and can effectively handle constraint first, after which a hybrid-fitness function integrating this penalty function into the objective function is designed. The new fitness function can properly evaluate not only feasible solution, but also infeasible one, and distinguish any feasible one from an infeasible one. Meanwhile, a new crossover operator based on simplex crossover operator and a new PSO mutation operator are also proposed, which can produce high quality offspring. Based on these, a new evolutionary algorithm for constrained optimization problems is proposed. The simulations are made on ten widely used benchmark problems, and the results indicate the proposed algorithm is effective.", "paper_title": "HYBRID-FITNESS FUNCTION EVOLUTIONARY ALGORITHM BASED ON SIMPLEX CROSSOVER AND PSO MUTATION FOR CONSTRAINED OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264491300010"}
