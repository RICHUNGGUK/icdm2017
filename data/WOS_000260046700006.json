This paper proposes a \"functional-type SIRMs method,\" which is an extended version of the SIRMs method, and clarifies the relationship between the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) reasoning method and the functional-type SIRMs method. The functional-type SIRMs method can be shown to be transformed to the T-S reasoning method, but generally the conversion to functional-type SIRMs method from the T-S reasoning method is impossible. It is shown, however, that the T-S reasoning method can be transformed to the functional-type SIRMs method when the T-S reasoning method fills some conditions. For this reason, it is shown that the functional-type SIRMs method is the subset of the T-S reasoning method.", "paper_title": "On the Generalization of Single Input Rule Modules Connected Type Fuzzy Reasoning Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000260046700006"}
