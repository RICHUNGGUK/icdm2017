This approach uses a flexible software architecture to gather data on distribution system structural elements, water quality sampling and especially distribution system events, all of which can be key to explaining water quality problems. The tool has been applied to five water utilities in North all with different data formats and data gathering practices. The approach America and Europe, was successful in explaining about 40% of positive coliform samples at the Laval (Quebec) utility. It also led to better data quality and responsiveness at the utilities.", "paper_title": "A GIS-based tool for distribution system data integration and analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000235110800002"}
