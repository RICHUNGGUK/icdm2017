In spite of the extensive research, however, the research community has made few efforts to guide the direction of innovation, considering the general evolutionary patterns of technical systems. Therefore, this research suggests a novel approach to predict prioritized directions of innovation as well as to create the most promising design of practical concept design. For the purpose, firstly, we analyze the main functions of a target system using function analysis techniques. Then we develop an evolution opportunity map based on the Laws of Technical Systems Evolution in TRIZ, from which we generate the most suitable concept for a next-generation system. Finally, we analyze technical challenges that might arise in realizing the concept using Su-field analysis, which can help to obtain a feasible solution for it. Samsung Advanced Institute for Technology in Korea adopted the suggested approach to the new technology generation process, and verified its practicability and utility. We expect this research to be useful for those in charge of innovation management or new product development processes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
