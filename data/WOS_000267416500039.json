The notion of neutrosophic topology on the non-standard interval is also due to Smarandache. The purpose of this paper is to study relations between INSs and topology. Design/methodology/approach - The paper investigates the possible relations between INSs and topology. Findings - Relations on INSs and neutrosophic topology. Research limitations/implications - Clearly, the paper is confined to IFSs and NSs. Practical implications - The main applications are in the mathematical field. Originality/value - The paper shows original results on fuzzy sets and topology.", "paper_title": "Interval neutrosophic sets and topology", "paper_id": "WOS:000267416500039"}
