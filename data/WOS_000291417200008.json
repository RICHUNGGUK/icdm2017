However, video streaming over NGNs has many challenges due to the high bit error rates of these networks. Forward error correction (FEC) is often applied to improve the quality of video streaming. However, continuous lost packets decrease the recovery performance of FEC protection in NGNs. To disperse continuous lost packets to different FEC blocks, we propose a concurrent multipath transmission that combines FEC with path interleaving. Our proposed control scheme adaptively adjusts the FEC block length and concurrently sends data interleaved over multiple paths. Experimental results with our approach show improved packet loss and signal to noise ratio performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
