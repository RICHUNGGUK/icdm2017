Many of these approaches are based on 'brute force' search methods and they usually do not care about structures of plans previously computed in particular planning domains. By analyzing these structures, we can obtain useful knowledge that can help us find solutions to more complex planning problems. The method described in this paper is designed for gathering macro-operators by analyzing training plans. This sort of analysis is based on the investigation of action dependencies in training plans. Knowledge gained by our method can be passed directly to planning algorithms to improve their efficiency.", "paper_title": "Generation of macro-operators via investigation of action dependencies in plans", "paper_id": "WOS:000282113800003"}
