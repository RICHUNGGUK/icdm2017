The deployment of such networks has allowed clients to gain access to publicly available broadband networks. The lack of standards and support for multicasting over wireless mesh networks makes this area very challenging as well as providing much scope for improvement. For first time in this paper, we use CMAC neural network model to predict route or node disconnection probability and to control congestion and losses specifically in the gateways. This prediction leads to recover the network before fault occurrence. In this paper, we propose a new QoS multicast routing framework for WMNs to solve the problem of load balancing and to enhance the QoS in multicast communication among Internet hosts and Mesh hosts dynamically. We also present an optimized hybrid multicast protocol based on this framework called HMFPM provisioning problems in the Next-Generation IEEE 802 11 s. The proposed protocol combines Proactive and Reactive multicast routing to eliminate unnecessary delays and also minimize control overhead in setting up routes amongst the backbone mesh routers. It also supports multiple gateways for the gateway balancing and routing based on CMAC prediction in each node to have the routes with least miss ratio.
