Motivated by this fact, this letter has a twofold motivation: 1) to propose a Hankel transform approach to transform the average error-rate integral for a Multiple-Input-Single-Output system with Maximum-Likelihood detection and perfect Channel State Information into the Hankel transform domain using Parseval theorem; 2) to derive simple analytical expressions for the Average Bit Error Probability of a generic Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output wireless system employing space shift keying modulation, by using an accurate exponential bound for the Gaussian Q-function along with the theory of Hankel transforms; Both methods, require only the knowledge of the Hankel transform of the probability density function of the signal envelope, which is readily available. The proposed analysis is tested and verified by numerically evaluated results accompanied with Monte-Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "Unified Error Performance Analysis of Space Shift Keying Modulation for MISO and MIMO Systems Under Generalized Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100022"}
