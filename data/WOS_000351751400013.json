In particular, we consider bias temperature instability (BTI), namely negative BTI in pMOS transistors and positive BTI in nMOS transistors that are recognized as the most critical aging mechanisms reducing the reliability of ICs. We show that BTI reduces significantly the critical charge of nodes of combinational circuits during their in-field operation, thus increasing the SE susceptibility of the whole IC. We then propose a time dependent model for SE susceptibility evaluation, enabling the use of adaptive SE hardening approaches, based on the ICs lifetime.", "paper_title": "Impact of Bias Temperature Instability on Soft Error Susceptibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000351751400013"}
