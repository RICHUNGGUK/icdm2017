First, the characteristics of such meshes are investigated by conducting quasi-static and dynamic experimental tests. Second, the discrete model for the simulation of such meshes is presented. A stochastically distorted contact model is introduced to account for distortions of the wires and hexagons, allowing a more realistic representation of the mechanical response of the mesh from the deformation point of view and the force point of view. Quasi-static tensile tests of a plane net sheet, subjected to a constant strain rate, are used to study the effect of the stochastically distorted contact formulation and to calibrate the numerical model. Finally, the dynamic response of an impacting block on a horizontal mesh sheet is used to compare the numerical predictions against experimental results in order to validate the proposed approach.
