Specifically, first, we divide the time-varying delay into non-uniformly subintervals and decompose the corresponding integral intervals to estimate the bounds of integral terms more exactly. Second, novel delay-derivation-dependent stability criteria are derived by introducing a parameter gamma in the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Third, we define some new variables to deal with uncertain parameters. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the theoretical results.
