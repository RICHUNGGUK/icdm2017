H. Ozarow, A.D. Wyner was the first instance of a Partial Exposure Problem. General Exposure-Resilient Functions (l-ERF) are known to be appropriate to provide a solution to the Partial Exposure Problem as long as random secret chains are to be protected. It is known that a perfect l-ERF is nothing but a t-resilient function for t = n - l, where n is the length of the exposed symbol-chain and t the largest number of symbols that an adversary is able to observe. We here manage to adapt the use of t-resilient functions for protecting messages against partial exposure. A solution to that problem had been given by the perfect local pseudo-random generator introduced by Maurer and Massey which is based upon a t-resilient function, but its use needs a secret key shared by the sender and the receiver. We are able to provide solutions to protect messages against Partial Exposure without using secret keys, for various ranges of parameters. Moreover low complexity algorithms are devised to that end.", "paper_title": "t-resilient functions and the partial exposure problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000254360100002"}
