This question is relevant at least for two reasons: one is speed of convergence of standard methods; the other is applicability of some recently proposed approaches for handling degenerate constraints. We show that for the class of damped Newton methods, convergence of the dual sequence to multipliers satisfying SOSC is unlikely to occur. We support our findings by numerical experiments. We also suggest a simple auxiliary procedure for computing multiplier estimates, which does not have this undesirable property. Finally, some consequences for the case of mixed equality and inequality constraints are discussed.", "paper_title": "On attraction of Newton-type iterates to multipliers violating second-order sufficiency conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000257381200013"}
