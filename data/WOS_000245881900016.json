The images of fluid art introduced here are categorized into four groups: the reflected or refracted patterns of free surface motion in nature and in a controlled environment, the coherent turbulent phenomena of fluid flow, and the fluid motion induced by the physical properties of fluids. It is shown that flow visualization techniques, which were originally developed in the field of engineering, have been successfully applied to the creation of artistic images.", "paper_title": "Recent progress in flow visualization techniques toward the generation of fluid art", "paper_id": "WOS:000245881900016"}
