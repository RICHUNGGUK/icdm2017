The system features a silicon Hall sensor with nested-chopping-like biasing circuitry, DC Hall voltage compensation, amplifying and multistage filtering. Low-noise performances are achieved by applying 100 kHz spinning current to the Hall device and chopping at 200 kHz to the signal conditioning blocs downstream. The microsystem achieves 20 mu T resolution over a 1.6 kHz bandwidth extending from 5 Hz to 1.6 kHz under 1.5 T static field.", "paper_title": "Integrated instrumental chain for magnetic pulse measurement in strong static field environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000260550000001"}
