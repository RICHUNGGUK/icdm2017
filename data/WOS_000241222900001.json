Because the numbers of the application tasks and amounts of required resources are enormous and quick responses to the requirements of users are necessary in the real grid environment, real-time resource co-allocation may be large-scale. A parallel resource co-allocation algorithm based on the framework for mapping with resource co-allocation is proposed in this paper. Through the result of experiments, it is concluded that the parallel method reduces the execution time of the resource co-allocation algorithm significantly, and makes the overall response time to the end-users small.
