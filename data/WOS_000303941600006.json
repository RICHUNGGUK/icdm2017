In addressing this question, we considered a threshold model of diffusion, focusing on the formation of a critical mass, which enables diffusion to be self-sustaining. Performing an agent-based simulation, we found that the diffusion model produces only two outcomes: Almost perfect adoption or relatively few adoptions. In order to explain the difference, we considered the various properties of network structures and found that the manner in which thresholds are arrayed over a network is the most critical factor determining the size of a cascade. On the basis of the results, we derived a threshold arrangement method effective for generation of a critical mass and calculated the size required for perfect adoption.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF CRITICAL MASS IN THRESHOLD MODEL OF DIFFUSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000303941600006"}
