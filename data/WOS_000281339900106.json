In this paper, we implemented and tested an AVO inversion scheme based on ACO algorithms. The ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms are inspired by the behavior of ants to find solutions to combinatorial optimization problem. Inversion results of synthetic data and real model demonstrate that ACO algorithms applied in nonlinear AVO inversion should be considered well not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of computation effort. Meanwhile it can provide a new approach to solve the nonlinear problems of network traffic allocation optimization.
