However, a good consensus prediction relies on the accuracy of individual methods. This article reports our efforts to further improve a single-method fold recognition technique called SPARKS by changing the alignment scoring function and incorporating the SPINE-X techniques that make improved prediction of secondary structure, backbone torsion angle and solvent accessible surface area. Results: The new method called SPARKS-X was tested with the SALIGN benchmark for alignment accuracy, Lindahl and SCOP benchmarks for fold recognition, and CASP 9 blind test for structure prediction. The method is compared to several state-of-the-art techniques such as HHPRED and BoostThreader. Results show that SPARKS-X is one of the best single-method fold recognition techniques. We further note that incorporating multiple templates and refinement in model building will likely further improve SPARKS-X.", "paper_title": "Improving protein fold recognition and template-based modeling by employing probabilistic-based matching between predicted one-dimensional structural properties of query and corresponding native properties of templates", "paper_id": "WOS:000292778700008"}
