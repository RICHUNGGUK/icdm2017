The optimal representation of precoding information, namely the precoder, with least bits therefore becomes the key problem. Inspired by the characteristics of the distributed antenna system, we focus our work on the precoder construction, adaptable in response to the large and small scale fading, such that the symbol error probability is significantly reduced over that of a fixed, non-adaptive, independent and identically distributed precoder codebook design. Furthermore, a suboptimal power-loading strategy is presented by minimizing the derived tight upper bound on the average pairwise error probability of the precoded orthogonal space time block codes, which approaches the optimal performance asymptotically without additional channel knowledge other than the available feedback information. We prove that the proposed precoded orthogonal space time transmission scheme can achieve full diversity order. In particular, the robustness of our proposed transmission scheme to channel estimation error and feedback delay is respectively investigated in some detail, and numerical results show that it obviously improves the link reliability and obtains substantial gains even with few bits of feedback in comparison with conventional antenna selection scheme.
