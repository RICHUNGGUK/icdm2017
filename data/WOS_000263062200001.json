An efficient method based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) is here proposed. We improve the performance of the evidential k-nearest-neighbour (EkNN) classifier using a random subspace based ensembling method. Given a set of random subspace EkNN classifier, a PSO is used for obtaining the best parameters of the set of evidential k-nearest-neighbour classifiers, finally these classifiers are combined by the \"vote rule\". The performance improvement with respect to the state-of-the-art approaches is validated through experiments with several benchmark datasets.", "paper_title": "Particle swarm optimization for ensembling generation for evidential k-nearest-neighbour classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000263062200001"}
