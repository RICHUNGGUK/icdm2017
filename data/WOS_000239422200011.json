Laws and a Galois connection with the more traditional probabilistic model are provided. Reversibility in the probabilistic guarded-command language is discussed. Finally the formalism is applied to unify quantum computation and cryptography within the probabilistic method.", "paper_title": "Unifying probability", "paper_id": "WOS:000239422200011"}
