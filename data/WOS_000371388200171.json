The developed algorithm iteratively and dynamically assigns the MPCs to the best cluster thanks to the MCD metric. Its performance and robustness are compared with the K-means MCD algorithm using cluster data simulated with four reference scenarios of the WINNER II channel model. The results indicate that K-means MCD is outperformed for all investigated scenarios in spite of its having a lower computational complexity and faster convergence. Moreover, a by-product of the algorithm is an optimal MCD threshold, that is, the characteristic of the cluster statistical properties for a given propagation scenario. This parameter provides a stronger physical link between the MPCs distribution and the propagation scenario. Therefore, it could be introduced in radio channel models with clusterlike features.", "paper_title": "Performance of a Novel Automatic Identification Algorithm for the Clustering of Radio Channel Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200171"}
