The purpose of metadata management is to provide adequate information for query processing, while at the same time to make the cost of maintaining the metadata as low as possible. In this paper, we discuss new issues about metadata management in wireless sensor networks; and propose a metadata management solution which includes an architecture and a model-aided approach for the base station to collect meta-data from sensor nodes. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our solution.", "paper_title": "Model-aided metadata management for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300026"}
