In order to introduce reliability concept to design code, the proposed live load model is based on truck weight survey. Test data of domestic material strengths are collected to model statistical properties of member strengths. Sample RC and PSC girder sections are designed following the safety factor format of the proposed code and compared with the current design practice. Reliability indexes are calculated and examined for material and member resistance factor formats and sample calibrations of safety factors are presented. It is concluded that the proposed code provides reasonable level of reliability compared to the international design standards.", "paper_title": "Reliability analysis of concrete bridges designed with material and member resistance factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000264170800004"}
