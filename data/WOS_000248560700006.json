The paper presents an effective approach based on an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) for the classification stage required in a speech/music discrimination system. A new simple feature, called warped LPC-based spectral centroid (WLPC-SC), is also proposed. Comparison between WLPC-SC and the classical features proposed in the literature for audio classification is performed, aiming to assess the good discriminatory power of the proposed feature. The vector length used to describe the proposed psychoacoustic-based feature is reduced to a few statistical values (mean, variance and skewness). With the aim of increasing the classification accuracy percentage, the feature space is then transformed to a new feature space by LDA. The classification task is performed applying ANFIS to the features in the transformed space. To evaluate the performance of the ANFIS system for speech/music discrimination, comparison to other commonly used classifiers is reported. The classification results for different types of music and speech signals show the good discriminating power of the proposed approach. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
