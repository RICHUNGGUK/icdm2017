R-SMS supports fashion designers and clothing merchandisers in working out the best way to fabricate their new collections and to expedite the product development process. This study attempts to use a case-based reasoning (CBR) technique to solve problems of fabric selection. In addition, radio frequency identification (RFID) technology is incorporated in the system to provide real-time swatches tracking and accurate fabric status updates within a fabric sample storeroom. The outcomes of this study provide fashion designers and merchandisers with appropriate fabric knowledge, enabling them to select the most appropriate fabric or fabric combination effectively and efficiently for new products; in turn, to enhance a garment enterprise's overall competency in managing its fabric resources.
