A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is used to model the movement and idle-related EEG data. The GMM built along with appropriate classification and post processing methods are used to detect movement onsets using self-paced EEG signals recorded from five subjects, achieving True-False rate difference between 63 and 98%. The results show significant performance enhancement using the proposed unsupervised method, both in the sample-by-sample classification accuracy and the event-by-event performance, in comparison with the state-of-the-art supervised methods. The effectiveness of the proposed method suggests its potential application in self-paced Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI).", "paper_title": "Unsupervised movement onset detection from EEG recorded during self-paced real hand movement", "paper_id": "WOS:000275135300005"}
