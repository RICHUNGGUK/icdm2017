This study was designed to predict B2M binding (or non-binding) of newly identified MhcSF proteins, in order to decipher their function, understand the molecular recognition mechanisms and identify deleterious mutations. IMGT standardization of MhcSF protein domains provides a unique numbering of the multiple alignment positions, and conditions to develop such predictive tool. Method: We combine a simple-Bayes classifier with IMGT unique numbering. Our method involves two steps: (1) selection of discriminant binary features, which associate an alignment position with an amino acid group; and (2) learning of the classifier by estimating the frequencies of selected features, conditionally to the B2M binding property. Results: Our dataset contains aligned sequences of 806 allelic forms of 47 MhcSF proteins, corresponding to 9 receptor types and 4 mammalian species. Eighteen discriminant features are selected, belonging to B2M contact sites, or stabilizing the molecular structure required for this contact. Three leave-one-out procedures are used to assess classifier performance, which corresponds to B2M binding prediction for: (1) new proteins, (2) species not represented in the dataset and (3) new receptor types. The prediction accuracy is high, i.e. 98, 94 and 70%, respectively. Application of our classifier to lower vertebrate MHC-I proteins indicates that these proteins bind to B2M and should then be expressed on the cellular surface by a process similar to that of mammalian MHC-I proteins. These results demonstrate the usefulness and accuracy of our (simple) approach, which should apply to other function or interaction prediction problems.", "paper_title": "A simple method to predict protein-binding from aligned sequences-application to MHC superfamily and beta 2-microglobulin", "paper_id": "WOS:000235277300010"}
