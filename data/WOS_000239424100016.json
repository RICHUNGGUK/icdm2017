However over the years a lot of research has focused on the computational properties of dynamical systems other than Turing machines, such cellular automata, artificial neural networks, mirrors systems, etc. In this talk we review some of the definitions that have been proposed for Turing universality of various systems, and the attempts to understand the relation between dynamical and computational properties of a system.", "paper_title": "Turing universality in dynamical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100016"}
