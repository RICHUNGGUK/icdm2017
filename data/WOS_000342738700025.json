To achieve better intra prediction performance, the Depth Modeling Mode (DMM) technique is employed as an ultra prediction technique for depth-maps. However, the complexity and computation load have dramatically increased with the application of DMM. Therefore, in view of the limited colors in depth-maps, this paper presents a novel fast ultra coding scheme based on Base Colors and Index Map (BUM) to reduce the complexity of DMM effectively. Furthermore, the index map is remapped, and the Base Colors are coded by predictive coding in BCIM to improve compression efficiency. Compared with the ultra prediction coding in DMM, the experimental results illustrate that the proposed scheme provides a decrease of approximately 51.2% in the intra prediction time. Meanwhile, the BD-rate increase is only 0.83% for the virtual intermediate views generated by Depth-Image-Based Rendering.", "paper_title": "A Novel Fast Intra Prediction Scheme for Depth-Map in 3D High Efficiency Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000342738700025"}
