H.264/AVC is the newest international video coding standard, jointly developed by groups from ISO/IEC and ITU-T, which aims at achieving improved compression performance and a network-friendly video representation for different types of applications, such as conversational, storage, and streaming. In this paper, we discuss various error resiliency schemes employed by H.264/AVC. The related topics such as non-normative error concealment and network environment are also described. Some experimental results are discussed to show the performance of error resiliency schemes. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
