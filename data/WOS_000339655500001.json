Quantum computation has many interdisciplinary aspects, ranging from physics and chemistry to mathematics and computer science. In this paper, we focus on physical hardware, present day challenges and future directions for design of quantum architectures.", "paper_title": "The physics of quantum computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000339655500001"}
