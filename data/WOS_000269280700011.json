In this paper, we propose a novel approach to reducing computational complexity in ontology integration. Thereby, we address the importance and types of concepts, for priority matching and direct matching between concepts, respectively. Identity-based similarity is computed, to avoid comparisons of all properties related to each concept, while matching between concepts. The problem of conflict in ontology integration has initially been explored on the instance-level and concept-level. This is useful to avoid many cases of mismatching.", "paper_title": "Complexity Analysis of Ontology Integration Methodologies: a Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000269280700011"}
