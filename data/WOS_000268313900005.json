For example, ambient media is delivered to the user depending on their context and hence, the system needs to dynamically determine the context and provide media that are relevant therein. To set the premise of ambient media, a system may also need to customize the physical environment, for example, by dimming the lighting level or by lowering the volume. Besides, users' need for media services changes over time and space that requires mechanisms to continually update their preferences based on their mobility in the environment. In this paper, we propose an ambient media service provisioning framework that incorporates the above requirements while keeping the user at the center of the media selection loop. To demonstrate the usefulness of this framework, we show experimental results by considering real-life scenario in a smart home environment.", "paper_title": "A framework for human-centered provisioning of ambient media services", "paper_id": "WOS:000268313900005"}
