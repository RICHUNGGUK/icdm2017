However, gaining statistically significant results is challenging and requires both biological knowledge and computational know-how. Here we present a novel, user-friendly microarray reporting tool called maRt. The software provides access to bioinformatic resources, like gene ontology terms and biological pathways by use of the DAVID and the BioMart web-service. Results are summarized in structured HTML reports, each presenting a different layer of information. In these report, contents of diverse sources are integrated and interlinked. To speed up processing, maRt takes advantage of the multi-core technology of modern desktop computers by using parallel processing. Since the software is built upon a RCP infrastructure it might be an outset for developers aiming to integrate novel R based applications. Availability: Installer, documentation and various kinds of tutorials are available under LGPL license at the website of our institute http://www.pharma.uni-bonn.de/www/mart. This software is free for academic use.", "paper_title": "A Microarray Tool Provides Pathway and GO Term Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000298089900001"}
