We compare the performance of our algorithm on several problem instances taken from the literature with previous algorithms. The computational results show that the proposed approach produces high-quality solutions within reasonable computational times. Although our algorithm is less efficient than Zhang's for several large-scale equal-size instances, it is noteworthy that for several unequal circle instances we found new lower bounds missed in previous papers.
