Such minimizers were called forward I-alpha-projections. Here, a complementary class of minimization problems leading to the so-called reverse I-alpha-projections are studied. Reverse I-alpha-projections, particularly on log-convex or power-law families, are of interest in robust estimation problems (alpha > 1) and in constrained compression settings (alpha < 1). Orthogonality of the power-law family with an associated linear family is first established and is then exploited to turn a reverse I-alpha-projection into a forward I-alpha-projection. The transformed problem is a simpler quasi-convex minimization subject to linear constraints.", "paper_title": "Minimization Problems Based on Relative alpha-Entropy II: Reverse Projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900038"}
