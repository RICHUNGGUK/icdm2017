Progressive learners want to access and utilize services and information content using all available devices. While use of computers to teach English in a conventional educational environment promotes motivation and effective learning in students, the method generates problems such as provision of learning materials without consideration of teaching methods and evaluation without consideration of individual differences in students. To solve these problems and produce a superior system, we propose an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) for learning English that uses multi-modal technology. By overcoming limitations of the mobile environment and using appropriate mobile contents and content negotiation and adaptation strategies, the proposed system provides an effective method of learning based on ITS to support a teacher's role.", "paper_title": "An intelligent tutoring system based on a multi-modal environment for the 300-certification program of English conversation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100098"}
