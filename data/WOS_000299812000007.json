Starting with a collection of audio recordings of real performances, we apply a sequential-covering genetic algorithm in order to obtain computational models for different aspects of expressive performance. We use these models to automatically synthesize performances with the timing and energy expressiveness that characterizes the music generated by a professional musician. The reported results indicate that evolutionary computation is an appropriate technique for solving the problem considered. Specifically, our evolutionary algorithm provides a number of potential advantages over other supervised learning algorithms, such as a method for non-deterministically obtaining models capturing different possible interpretations of a musical piece.", "paper_title": "A Rule-Based Evolutionary Approach to Music Performance Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000299812000007"}
