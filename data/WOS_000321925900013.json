Distributed compressive sensing extends this framework by defining ensemble sparsity models, allowing a correlated ensemble of sparse signals to be jointly recovered from a collection of separately acquired compressive measurements. In this paper, we introduce a framework for modeling sparse signal ensembles that quantifies the intra- and intersignal dependences within and among the signals. This framework is based on a novel bipartite graph representation that links the sparse signal coefficients with the measurements obtained for each signal. Using our framework, we provide fundamental bounds on the number of noiseless measurements that each sensor must collect to ensure that the signals are jointly recoverable.", "paper_title": "Measurement Bounds for Sparse Signal Ensembles via Graphical Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000321925900013"}
