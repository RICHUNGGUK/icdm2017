Educational MMORPGs, however, are very rare, as are studies on garners' behavioral patterns during such games. The current study is an empirical observation and analysis of the behavioral patterns of 100 garners participating in an educational MMORPG called Talking Island. In our study, we recorded and summarized the gaming behaviors demonstrated by these participants over 335 days of observation from December 2009 to October 2010. We coded the recorded behaviors and conducted a frequency analysis, sequential analysis and cluster analysis to explore the behavioral distributions, behavioral-frequency transition and behavior-cluster patterns in the MMORPG. Gender differences in behavioral patterns were also compared and discussed. Based on the results, we discuss the potential and limitations of the game and provide suggestions for future research on and the development of educational MMORPGs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
