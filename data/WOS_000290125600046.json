The performance degradation has been evaluated when there are the following mismatches between the actual and designed parameters: background variance in the case of hypothesis H-1 and one-lag correlation coefficient of background. It has been shown that the delectability depends strongly on the fill factor of targets in the case of the mode signal matrix with high rank for a prescribed false alarm probability and a given signal-to-background ratio. These results have been also justified via Monte Carlo simulations for an example scenario.", "paper_title": "Performance of the Matched Subspace Detector in the Case of Subpixel Targets", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600046"}
