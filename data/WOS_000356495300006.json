In 1983, Beck provided a beautiful argument that shows that (r) over cap (P-n) is linear, solving a problem of Erdos. In this note, we provide another proof of this fact that actually gives a better bound, namely, (r) over cap (P-n) < 137n for n sufficiently large.", "paper_title": "An Alternative Proof of the Linearity of the Size-Ramsey Number of Paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000356495300006"}
