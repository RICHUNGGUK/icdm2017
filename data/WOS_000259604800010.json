In this paper we investigate the semantics of a fragment of the logic for pragmatics proposed by Bellin and Dalla Pozza in \"A pragmatic interpretation of substructural logics\" (Feferman Festschrift, ASL Lecture Notes in Logic 15, 2002). The logic deals with acts of assertion and acts of obligation, and it incorporates a rule that relates acts of obligation to acts of assertion via a notion of causal implication. As our main result we show that the logic is sound and complete with respect to a class of algebraic, Kripke, and categorical models.", "paper_title": "A semantic analysis of a logic for pragmatics with assertions, obligations, and causal implication", "paper_id": "WOS:000259604800010"}
