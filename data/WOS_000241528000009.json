We connect importance sampling techniques with interacting particle algorithms, and multi-splitting branching models. These Monte Carlo methods are illustrated with a variety of examples arising in particle trapping analysis, as well as in ruin type estimation problems. We also provide a rather detailed presentation of the asymptotic theory of these particle algorithms, including exponential extinction probabilities, L-p-mean error bounds, central limit theorem, and fluctuation variance comparaisons.", "paper_title": "Branching and interacting particle interpretations of rare event probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000241528000009"}
