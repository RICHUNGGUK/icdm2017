In this paper, these indices are analyzed to obtain a new decision making tool. Process accuracy index (C-a) measures the degree of process centering and gives alerts when the process mean departures from the target value. It focuses oil the location of process mean and the distance between mean and target value. We modify the traditional process accuracy index to obtain a new tool under fuzziness. With the proposed tool. specification limits and process mean can be defined as triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy numbers The proposed tool is illustrated to solve a supplier selection problem (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
