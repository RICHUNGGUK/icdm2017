The time-varying delays include not only discrete delays but also distributed delays. The parameter uncertainties are time-varying and norm-bounded. Based on the Lyapunov stability theory and Lur's system approach, sufficient conditions are given to ensure the stability of genetic regulatory networks. All the stability conditions are given in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which are easy to be verified. Illustrative example is presented to show the effectiveness of the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Robust stability of stochastic genetic regulatory networks with discrete and distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000268257700008"}
