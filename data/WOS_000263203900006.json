Residual noise which is musical in nature is very annoying to human listeners. Many speech enhancement approaches assume that the transform coefficients are independent of one another and can thus be attenuated separately, thereby ignoring the correlations that exist between different time frames and within each frame. This paper, proposes a single channel speech enhancement system which exploits such correlations between the different time frames to further reduce residual noise. Unlike other 2D speech enhancement techniques which apply a post-processor after some classical algorithms such as spectral subtraction, the proposed approach uses a hybrid Wiener spectrogram filter (HWSF) for effective noise reduction, followed by a multi-blade post-processor which exploits the 2D features of the spectrogram to preserve the speech quality and to further reduce the residual noise. This results in pleasant sounding speech for human listeners. Spectrogram comparisons show that in the proposed scheme, musical noise is significantly reduced. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is further confirmed through objective assessments and informal subjective listening tests. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
