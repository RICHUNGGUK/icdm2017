This commonness makes convenient modeling of production scheduling problem possible with mature hardware modeling method in the field of electronics design. Considering the typical bell-type batch annealing production-scheduling problem, the traveling flow of lots in annealing shop is mapped into hardware design modeling analogously. A simulation model of annealing shop scheduling is developed with hardware description method based on SystemC simulation engine. Accurate and efficient simulation of batch annealing workflow can be achieved by this model. Simulation comparison and application test in a steel enterprise show the feasibility and validity of this modeling method.", "paper_title": "SIMULATION MODELING METHOD OF BATCH ANNEALING PRODUCTION SCHEDULING PROBLEM BASED ON SYSTEMC", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900033"}
