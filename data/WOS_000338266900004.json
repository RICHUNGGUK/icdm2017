We give relation-algebraic specifications of some important solution concepts of spatial voting games, such as the uncovered set, the majority core, the Pareto set, the win set, and the loss set. These specifications are relation-algebraic expressions and can be evaluated with the help of the BDD-based tool RELVIEW after a simple translation into the tool's programming language. To give an impression of the tool's possibilities, we present some concrete applications.
