The complementary maximal strip recovery (CMSR) problem has the complementary goal to delete the minimum number of markers. Both MSR and CMSR have been shown to be NP-hard and APX-complete, and they admit a 4-approximation and a 3-approximation respectively. In this paper, we present an improved 7/3-approximation algorithm for the CMSR problem, with its worst-case performance analysis done through a local amortization with a re-weighting scheme.
