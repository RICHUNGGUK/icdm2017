The aim of this paper is to propose an environmental impact assessment methodology based on an integrated fuzzy AHP-ELECTRE approach in the context of urban industrial planning. In the proposed methodology the criteria weights are generated by a fuzzy AHP procedure. The fuzzy set theory is a perfect means for modeling uncertainty or imprecision arising from human mental phenomena. The usage of fuzzy sets in describing uncertainties and vagueness in different environmental factors simplifies the complex structure of EIA. A fuzzy outranking methodology, fuzzy ELECTRE is used to assess the environmental impact generated by the six different industrial districts which were predicted to shape the future industrial structure of Istanbul metropolitan area. Finally, a fuzzy dominance relation (FDR) methodology is used to rank the alternatives from the most risky to the least. A sensitivity analysis is also provided. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
