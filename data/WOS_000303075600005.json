The first step in the analysis of experimental data is the extraction of intensity-energy spectra from a series of diffraction images. In this paper, we describe a novel method for an automatic extraction of these spectra based on Kalman filtering. The algorithm combines the knowledge about the movement of the diffraction maxima with spot detection. We show successful implementation of the proposed method using simulated and real data.
