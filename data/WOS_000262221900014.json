Background subtraction is a very popular approach for foreground segmentation in a still scene image. In order to compensate for illumination changes, a background model updating process is generally adopted,, and leads to extra computation time. In this paper, we propose a fast background subtraction scheme using independent component analysis (ICA) and, particularly, aims at indoor surveillance for possible applications in home-care and health-care monitoring, where moving and motionless persons must be reliably detected. The proposed method is as computationally fast as the simple image difference method, and yet is highly tolerable to changes in room lighting. The proposed background subtraction scheme involves two stages, one for training and the other for detection. In the training stage, an ICA model that directly measures the statistical independency based on the estimations of joint and marginal probability density functions from relative frequency distributions is first proposed. The proposed ICA model can well separate two highly-correlated images. In the detection stage, the trained de-mixing vector is used to separate the foreground in a scene image with respect to the reference background image. Two sets of indoor examples that involve switching on/off room lights and opening/closing a door are demonstrated in the experiments. The performance of the proposed ICA model for background subtraction is also compared with that of the well-known FastICA algorithm.", "paper_title": "Independent Component Analysis-Based Background Subtraction for Indoor Surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000262221900014"}
