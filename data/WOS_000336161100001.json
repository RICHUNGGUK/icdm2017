Compared to the existing approaches based on time series or classical statistic method, the binary exponential deviation offset prediction proposed in this paper focuses on the increment or decrement on every sampling point during an exponential offset period. Then the deviations will be revised at different levels in the next prediction process. The proposed approach is validated with some real end-user data from a WiFi network and simulation experiments. Based on such a precise prediction, we allocate the channels with different bandwidth to end-users according to diverse quality-of-service (QoS), which increases both the system's profits and actual spectrum utilization. The multidimensional bounded knapsack problem is introduced to divide channels, to which the proposed balance between value density and request probability strategy gets the approximate solution. The simulation experiment results show its good performance in not only utility but also spectrum utilization of the base-stations, especially when the resources are deficient.", "paper_title": "Traffic Pattern Prediction and Spectrum Allocation with Multiple Channel Width in Cognitive Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336161100001"}
