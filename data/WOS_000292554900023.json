In current mesoscopic-scale simulators of the immune system, this crucial step has been modeled in a very approximated way. Results: We have equipped an agent-based model of the immune system with immuno-informatics methods to allow the simulation of the cardinal events of the antigenic recognition, going from single peptides to whole proteomes. The recognition process accounts for B cell-epitopes prediction through Parker-scale affinity estimation, class I and II HLA peptide prediction and binding through position-specific scoring matrices based on information from known HLA epitopes prediction tools, and TCR binding to HLA-peptide complex calculated as the averaged sum of a residue-residue contact potential. These steps are executed for all lymphocytes agents encountering the antigen in a wide-reaching Monte Carlo simulation.", "paper_title": "Immune system simulation online", "paper_id": "WOS:000292554900023"}
