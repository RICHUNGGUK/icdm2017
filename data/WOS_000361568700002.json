We propose a new operational semantics that allows a simple correctness result and the definition of a simple meta-interpreter. We compare, and prove the equivalence, with the operational semantics defined and used in other papers on this topic.", "paper_title": "A Theoretical Perspective of Coinductive Logic Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000361568700002"}
