In this system, discounts on the purchasing cost based on order frequency are given to the warehouse. Models with assumptions analogous to the EOQ environment are discussed for all-unit and incremental order frequency discounts. 94%-effective power-of-two policies are developed for both models. For incremental discounts, a 98%-effective power-of-two policy for a variable base planning period is also derived. For each model, a computational study shows every test problem considered has a power-of-two policy that is over 96% effective. An extension to holding costs that are dependent on the purchasing price is also provided. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
