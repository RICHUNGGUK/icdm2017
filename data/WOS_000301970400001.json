We propose a novel approach for shared protection routing in multi-domain networks where the key feature is a special Topology Aggregation. In this Topology Aggregation, only some potential intra-domain paths (intra-paths for short) are selected for carrying working and backup traffic between domain border nodes. The abstraction of each intra-path to a virtual edge makes the original multi-domain network to become an aggregated network. On the aggregated network, a single-domain routing algorithm for shared protection can be applied for obtaining the complete routing solutions. The experiments show that the proposed approach is scalable. Moreover it is close to the optimal solution in single-domain networks and outperforms the previously proposed scalable solutions in multi-domain networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
