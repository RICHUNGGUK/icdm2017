We show that the matrix S-1(f)S-0(f)(-1) has a nice form when f is chosen lobe the majority function, where S-1(f) is the matrix with row vectors upsilon(k)(alpha) for all alpha is an element of 1(f) and S-0(f) = S-1(f circle plus 1). And an exact counting for Boolean functions with maximum algebraic immunity by exchanging one point in on-set with one point in offset of the majority function is given. Furthermore, we present a necessary condition according to weight distribution for Boolean functions to achieve algebraic immunity not less than a given number.", "paper_title": "A Note on \"On the Construction of Boolean Functions with Optimal Algebraic Immunity\"", "paper_id": "WOS:000294701900016"}
