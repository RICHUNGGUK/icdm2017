We study this integration for two tasks: vehicles geo-localization and obstacles detection. A virtual 3D city model is a realistic representation of the evolution environment of a vehicle. It is a database of geographical and textured 3D data. We describe an ego-localization method that combines measurements of a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver, odometers, a gyrometer, a video camera and a virtual 3D city model. GPS is often consider as the main sensor for localization of vehicles. But, in urban areas, GPS is not precise or even can be unavailable. So, GPS data are fused with odometers and gyrometer measurements using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). However, during long GPS unavailability, localization with only odometers and gyrometer drift. Thus, we propose a new observation of the location of the vehicle. This observation is based on the matching between the current image acquired by an on-board camera and the virtual 3D city model of the environment. We also propose an obstacle detection method based on the comparison between the image acquired by the on-board camera and the image extracted from the 3D model. The following principle is used: the image acquired by the on-board camera contains the possible dynamic obstacles whereas they are absent from the 3D model. The two proposed concepts are tested on real data.", "paper_title": "Virtual 3D City Model for Navigation in Urban Areas", "paper_id": "WOS:000302490800006"}
