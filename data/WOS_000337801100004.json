In real-world application, each view should be acquired in unequal cost. Taking web-page classification for example, it is cheaper to get the words on itself (view one) than to get the words contained in anchor texts of inbound hyper-links (view two). However, almost all the existing multi-view learning does not consider the cost of acquiring the views or the cost of evaluating them. In this paper, we support that different views should adopt different representations and lead to different acquisition cost. Thus we develop a new view-dependent cost different from the existing both class-dependent cost and example-dependent cost. To this end, we generalize the framework of multi-view learning with the cost-sensitive technique and further propose a Cost-sensitive Multi-View Learning Machine named CMVLM for short. In implementation, we take into account and measure both the acquisition cost and the discriminant scatter of each view. Then through eliminating the useless views with a predefined threshold, we use the reserved views to train the final classifier. The experimental results on a broad range of data sets including the benchmark UCI, image, and bioinformatics data sets validate that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the total cost and have a competitive even better classification performance. The contributions of this paper are that: ( 1) first proposing a view-dependent cost; ( 2) establishing a cost-sensitive multi-view learning framework; ( 3) developing a wrapper technique that is universal to most multiple kernel based classifier.", "paper_title": "COST-SENSITIVE MULTI-VIEW LEARNING MACHINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000337801100004"}
