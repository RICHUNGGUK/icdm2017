However, ubiquitous learning approaches are not at a full level of maturity, much of these approaches lacking proposals aiming to provide its practical use. This paper presents an architecture for ubiquitous learning, which employs the paradigm of ontology-based data access (OBDA) for solving problems related to data integration and access of data sources in complex structures. OBDA techniques are explored to allow access and mapping of contextual data and their integration into a student's context-aware semantic model. The applicability of this proposal is evaluated through a case study with an e-learning environment and a middleware for ubiquitous computing.", "paper_title": "Integrated Infrastructure for Ubiquitous Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000365098400002"}
