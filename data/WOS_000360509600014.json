According to the operator, a corresponding complexity of the sequence is called (the first) depth, which also contributes to another two definitions (the second and third depths) by using polynomial factor and high order difference, respectively. For a sequence of period over (a finite field with elements and characteristic ), the three depths are the same as its linear complexity if . This paper focuses on sequence s of period with infinite third depth. For cyclic-left-shift-difference operator on , we generally depict circulant matrix structure of the operator for all and determine its rank. Furthermore, our results show that the interleaving technique really works with difference operator on producing sequences with good correlation property and long period, which are constructed from 2-level autocorrelation sequences of period except -sequences. The method is lightweight since the computation complexity is and only the XOR logical operator is used. In addition, ultimate period of a sequence is investigated systematically. Some upper bounds on the ultimate period and a formula to determine the least ultimate period are presented.", "paper_title": "Sequences with good correlation property based on depth and interleaving techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000360509600014"}
