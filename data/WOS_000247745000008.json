Learning the multimodal representation of the body is supposed to be the first step toward binding since the morphological constraints on sensations during self-body-observation would make the binding problem tractable. In this paper, we address an issue of learning to match the foci of attention in vision and touch through self-body-observation. We propose the cross-anchoring Hebbian learning rule to uniquely associate double-touching and self-occlusion. Experiments with both the computer simulation and a real robot show the validity of the proposed method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
