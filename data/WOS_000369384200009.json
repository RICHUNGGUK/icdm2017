This paper presents a new gray scale watermarking method in wavelet domain based on the compression of the watermark and the pretreatment of the original image. Through the compression of watermark, it can greatly reduce the embedding capacity of the watermark, which can embed more watermark bits in the host image. Through the preprocessing of the original image based on human visual system's characteristic, it can ensure the imperceptibility. The use of threshold T can adaptively determine the quantity of embedded blocks, and control the capacity of embedded secret information. The experimental results show that our method has an excellent transparency and robustness.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Gray Scale Watermarking Method in Wavelet Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000369384200009"}
