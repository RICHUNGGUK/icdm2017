This paper mainly focuses on the multiplicative consistency of the hesitant fuzzy preference relation. First of all, we explore some properties of the hesitant fuzzy preference relation and develop some new aggregation operators. Then we introduce the concepts of multiplicative consistency, perfect multiplicative consistency and acceptable multiplicative consistency for a hesitant fuzzy preference relation, based on which, two algorithms are given to improve the inconsistency level of a hesitant fuzzy preference relation. Furthermore, the consensus of group decision making is studied based on the hesitant fuzzy preference relations. Finally, several illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms.", "paper_title": "MULTIPLICATIVE CONSISTENCY OF HESITANT FUZZY PREFERENCE RELATION AND ITS APPLICATION IN GROUP DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000330586100004"}
