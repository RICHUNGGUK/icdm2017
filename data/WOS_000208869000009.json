This phenomenon continues to drive enormous revenue growth for the online advertising industry. One of the difficult challenges facing this industry is determining how to schedule online advertisements. We extend prior research in this area by developing a quantitative model which incorporates a very important economic strategy, volume pricing discounts. In addition, motivated by the NP-Hard nature of the problem, we propose and test a several heuristic and metaheuristic solution approaches. We show that explicit consideration of this economic pricing strategy in the scheduling process can, under certain elasticity of demand assumptions, significantly improve the revenue generation ability of online ad publishers. This provides significant support for the proposed model.", "paper_title": "SCHEDULING ONLINE ADVERTISEMENTS TO MAXIMIZE REVENUE UNDER NON-LINEAR PRICING", "paper_id": "WOS:000208869000009"}
