In applying the radial basis function network to grade estimation of the deposit, several pertinent issues regarding RBF model construction are addressed in this study. One of the issues is the selection of the RBF network along with its center and width parameters. Selection was done by an evolutionary algorithm that utilizes the concept of cooperative coevolutions of the RBFs and the associated network. Furthermore, the problem of data division, which arose during the creation of the training, calibration and validation of data sets for the RBF model development, was resolved with the help of an integrated approach of data segmentation and genetic algorithms (GA). A simulation study conducted showed that nearly 27% of the time, a bad data division would result if random data divisions were adopted in this study. in addition. the efficacy of the RBF network was tested against a feed-forward network and geostatistical techniques. The outcome of this comparative study indicated that the RBF model per-formed decisively better than the feed-forward network and the ordinary kriging (OK). (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
