Further, most existing approaches do not support user revocation. In this paper, we present a secure and efficient authentication protocol named Handauth. Similar to the mechanisms of this field, Handauth provides user authentication and session key establishment. However, compared to other well-known approaches, Handauth not only enjoys both computation and communication efficiency, but also achieves strong user anonymity and untraceablility, forward secure user revocation, conditional privacy-preservation, AAA server anonymity, access service expiration management, access point authentication, easily scheduled revocation, dynamic user revocation and attack resistance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is feasible for real applications.", "paper_title": "Handauth: Efficient Handover Authentication with Conditional Privacy for Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000314391600017"}
