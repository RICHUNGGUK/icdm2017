Two information patterns for the controller are considered and the conditions are presented in terms of iterative Riccati recursions. By using the delta operator, the calculation stiffness of the discrete system can be circumvented when the sampling frequency is extremely high. The proposed method is applied to the longitudinal flight control of the hypersonic flying vehicle and the effectiveness is verified by the experimental results.", "paper_title": "A dynamic games approach to H-infinity control design of DoS with application to longitudinal flight control", "paper_id": "WOS:000359801900001"}
