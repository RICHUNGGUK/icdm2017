Placement with higher correlation coefficients has fewer mismatches and lower variation of capacitor ratio, thus achieving higher yield performance. This study presents a new optimization criterion that quickly determines if the placement is optimal. The optimization criterion leads to the development of the concepts of C-entries and partitioned subarrays which can significantly reduce the searching space for finding the optimal/near-optimal placements on a sufficiently large array size.", "paper_title": "Optimal Common-Centroid-Based Unit Capacitor Placements for Yield Enhancement of Switched-Capacitor Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000329131400007"}
