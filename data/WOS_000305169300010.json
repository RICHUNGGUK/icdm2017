The user-friendly proposed intelligent system is accommodated on a hospital server supporting e-health tools, for use through pocket PCs under wireless connection as a decision support system for resident doctors, as well as an educational tool for medical students. It is based on expert system knowledge representation provided from urology experts in combination with rich bibliographic search and study ratified with statistical results from clinical practice. Preliminary experimental results on a real patient hospital database provide acceptable performance that can be improved using more than one computational intelligence approaches in the future.
