Although this statement is generally well accepted, the internal mechanisms which are responsible for these interactions are not clear. In the last decade, dealing with this problem, many models have been proposed. In this paper, we introduce a model that creates an artificial world economy that is a network of countries. Each country has its own national system of innovation and the interactions between countries are given by functions that connect the competitiveness of their prices and their technological capabilities. Starting from different configurations, the artificial world economy self-organizes itself and creates a hierarchies of countries.", "paper_title": "National systems of innovation and technological differentiation: A multi-country model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237364600008"}
