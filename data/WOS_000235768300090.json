In this scheme, the system anthenticates each user by both his/her possession (smartcard) and biometrics (fingerprint). A smartcard is used for the first layer of authentication. Based on the successful pass of the first layer authentication, a subsequent process of the biometric fingerprint authentication proceeds. The proposed scheme is fast and secure. Computer simulations and statistical analyze are presented.", "paper_title": "A novel hybrid crypto-biometric authentication scheme for ATM based banking applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300090"}
