An important question about the smallest diameter among all the BC graphs is: Does there exist a BC graph whose diameter is less than the known BC graphs such as crossed cubes, twisted cubes, Mobius cubes, etc., with the same dimension? This paper answers this question. In this paper, we find that there exists a kind of BC graphs called spined cubes and we prove that the n-dimensional spilled cube has the diameter [n/3] + 3 for any integer n with n >= 14. It is the first time in literature that a hypercube variant with such a small diameter is presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
