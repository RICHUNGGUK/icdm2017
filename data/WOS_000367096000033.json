First, the FISST is used to derive the multi-sensor likelihood function of MSBF, and then combining the MSBF filter with the interacting multiple models (IMM) algorithm to track the maneuvering target. Moreover, the sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) method is used to implement the MM-MSBF algorithm. Eventually, the simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed filter.", "paper_title": "Multi-Sensor Tracking of a Maneuvering Target Using Multiple-Model Bernoulli Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000033"}
