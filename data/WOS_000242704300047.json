A major characteristic of microarray data consists in the small number of observations n and a very large number of genes p. This \"large p, small n\" paradigm makes the discriminant analysis for classification difficult. In order to offset this dimensionality problem a solution consists in reducing the dimension. Supervised classification is understood as a regression problem with a small number of observations and a large number of covariates. A new approach for dimension reduction is proposed. This is based on a semi-parametric approach which uses local likelihood estimates for single-index generalized linear models. The asymptotic properties of this procedure are considered and its asymptotic performances are illustrated by simulations. Applications of this method when applied to binary and multiclass classification of the three real data sets Colon, Leukemia and SRBCT are presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
