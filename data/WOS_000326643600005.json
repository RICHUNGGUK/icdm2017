Several recent embarrassing incidents involving the irreproducibility of high-profile studies have illustrated the importance of this issue and the need for rigorous methods for the assessment of reproducibility. Results: Here, we describe an existing statistical model that is very well suited to this problem. We explain its utility for assessing the reproducibility of validation experiments, and apply it to a genomescale study of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-mediated RNA editing in Drosophila. We also introduce a statistical method for planning validation experiments that will obtain the tightest reproducibility confidence limits, which, for a fixed total number of experiments, returns the optimal number of replicates for the study.", "paper_title": "Assessing the validity and reproducibility of genome-scale predictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000326643600005"}
