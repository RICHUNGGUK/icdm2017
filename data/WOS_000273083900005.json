A 2-D OOC is said to be optimal if its cardinality is the largest possible. In this paper, we develop some constructions for optimal 2-D OOCs using combinatorial design theory. As an application, these constructions are used to construct an infinite family of new optimal 2-D OOCs with auto-correlation 1 and cross-correlation 1.", "paper_title": "On constructions for optimal two-dimensional optical orthogonal codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000273083900005"}
