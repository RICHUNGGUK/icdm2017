Under the singularity of the Korean tablet PC market, into which both the iPad and Galaxy Tab (with an Android operating system) were simultaneously released, this study closely analyses consumer preferences for tablet PCs. It uses the Bayesian mixed logit model, which can reflect consumers' heterogeneous preferences based on data collected from a conjoint method, and using the estimates of the consumer utility function with model verification, it offers forecasts for the tablet PC market under six likely situations.", "paper_title": "Strategic demand forecasts for the tablet PC market using the Bayesian mixed logit model and market share simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000326350700009"}
