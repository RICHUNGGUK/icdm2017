This paper considers nonlinearly constrained tolerance allocation problems. The purpose is to minimize the ratio between the sum of the manufacturing costs (tolerances costs) and the risk (probability of the respect of geometrical requirements). The techniques of Monte Carlo simulation and genetic algorithm are adopted to solve these problems. As the simplest and the popular method for non-linear statistical tolerance analysis, the Monte Carlo simulation is introduced into the frame. Moreover, in order to make the frame efficient, the genetic algorithm is improved according to the features of the Monte Carlo simulation. An illustrative example (hyperstatic mechanism) is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
