This work addresses the problem of defining the elements that constitute a multiple-objective design optimization problem, that is, design variables, constants, objective functions, and constraint functions. In light of this, contributions are reviewed from the field of evolutionary design optimization with respect to their concrete implementation for design exploration. Machine learning and natural language processing are supposed to facilitate feasible approaches to the support of configuration and parameterization. Hence, the authors further review promising machine learning and natural language processing methods for automatic knowledge elicitation and formalization with respect to their implementation for evolutionary design optimization. These methods come from the fields of product attribute extraction, clustering of design solutions, relationship discovery, computation of objective functions, metamodeling, and design pattern extraction.", "paper_title": "A survey on automating configuration and parameterization in evolutionary design exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000363271100002"}
