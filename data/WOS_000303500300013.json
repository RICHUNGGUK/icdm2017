It is shown that the corresponding function, h(T), is concavely increasing. Next, we construct an implicit relation between the h-index and the impact factor IF (an average number of items per source). The corresponding function h(IF) is increasing and we show that if the parameter C in the numerator of the shifted Lotka function is high, then the relation between the h-index and the impact factor is almost linear.", "paper_title": "The Hirsch index of a shifted Lotka function and its relation with the impact factor", "paper_id": "WOS:000303500300013"}
