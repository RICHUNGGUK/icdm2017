The construction of such ABCs needs to perform a rigorous mathematical and numerical analysis, in order to obtain a well-posed problem, from a mathematical point of view, and a stable algorithm, from a numerical point of view. In a previous study, Joly and Mercier (1989) [8] have proposed a new second-order ABC for Maxwell's equation in dimension 3, well adapted to a variational approach. In this paper, we present how to apply the second-order ABC proposed in [8] in the framework of a finite element method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
