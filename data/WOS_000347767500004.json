In the case of Cauchy interpolation (interpolation without multiplicities), we give explicit formulas for the solution in terms of symmetric functions of the input data, generalizing the well-known formulas for Lagrange interpolation. In the case of the osculatory rational interpolation (interpolation with multiplicities), we give determinantal expressions in terms of the input data, making explicit some matrix formulations that can independently be derived from previous results by Beckermann and Labahn.
