Both methods are generally applicable although in this work they are applied to grey-scale pixel values of facial images which form the original feature domain. We further investigate the issue of diversity within the generated ensembles of classifiers which emerges as an important concept in classifier fusion and propose a formal definition based on statistically independent classifiers using the kappa statistic to quantitatively assess it. Results show that our methods outperform a number of alternative algorithms applied on the same dataset, while our analysis indicates that diversity among the classifiers in a combination scheme is not sufficient to guarantee performance improvements. Rather, some type of trade off seems to be necessary between participant classifiers' accuracy and ensemble diversity in order to achieve maximum recognition gains. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
