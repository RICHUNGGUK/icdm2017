Learning outcomes are demonstrated by a number of work samples, which provide a good overview, not only of the acquired competences, but also of the path followed to get there. However, ePortfolios do no provide means for their automatic integration in Distributed Learning Environments, where the work samples (learning evidence) are scattered across a number of systems, such as Virtual Learning Environments and Web 2.0 tools. This paper proposes a scalable approach to tackle evidence collection in DLEs, by aligning the generated artefacts with the pedagogical purpose the teacher aims at. The proposal takes advantage of Learning Design practices, making alignment explicit to guide the technological infrastructure for the automatic collection and organization of pieces of evidence in an ePortfolio and thus reducing the associated burden on teachers and students. The feasibility of the proposal was assessed by means of an evaluation study, in which a University teacher designed and enacted an authentic collaborative learning situation in the context of a master's degree course.", "paper_title": "Helping Teachers Align Learning Objectives and Evidence: Integration of ePortfolios in Distributed Learning Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000365385300003"}
