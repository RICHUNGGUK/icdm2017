Firstly, linear stability of the model is investigated by analyzing the associated transcendental characteristic equation. Next, by means of the symmetric bifurcation theory of delay differential equations coupled with representation theory of standard dihedral groups, we not only investigate the effect of synaptic delays of signal transmission on the pattern formation, but also obtain some important results about the spontaneous bifurcation of multiple branches of periodic solutions and their spatio-temporal patterns. Thirdly, based on the normal form approach and the center manifold theory, we derive the formula to determine the bifurcation direction and stability of Hopf bifurcating periodic solutions. Finally, some numerical examples and the corresponding numerical simulations are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
