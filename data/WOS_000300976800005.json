Interfaces of the gateway that are implemented include the system interface, EPC discovery service (DS), uID DS, and the certification card mechanism. Five major operations are also developed, including inquiry of EPC DS, uID DS, code diversion mechanism, PIN-IC interface, and code conversion mechanism. Simulation results indicate that in addition to providing codes diversion and conversion, the proposed code gateway achieves low-order conformity between these two systems. Moreover, the implemented EPC DS and uID DS interface provide immediate commodity news and exchange of historical information. In addition to delivering inevitable processing efficiency, the integrated system between these two systems significantly improves ubiquitous computing environments.
