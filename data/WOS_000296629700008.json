These discontinuous systems are transformed into functional differential inclusion systems. Adaptive feedback laws are presented to stabilize the systems. An example is simulated to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design.", "paper_title": "STABILIZATION FOR TIME-DELAY, DISCONTINUOUS AND UNCERTAIN SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296629700008"}
