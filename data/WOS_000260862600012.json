These two semantic spaces are enriched with ontology knowledge, while emphasizing consistent and uniform comparison of ontological relatedness among concepts for query-to-concept mapping. OS2, in addition to being a linear space like OSS, also guarantees orthogonality of the semantic space. Compared with other ontology reasoning measures, both spaces are capable of providing platforms that offer a global view of concept inter-relatedness, by allowing evaluation of concept similarity in metric spaces. We simulate OSS and OS2 by using LSCOM concepts and experiment search effectiveness with VIREO-374 concept detectors. Empirical observations indicate that the proposed semantic spaces enable more effective selection of concept detectors than eight other existing ontology measures. OS2, in particular, is better in providing a viable and reasonable solution for fusion of multiple concept detectors.", "paper_title": "Selection of Concept Detectors for Video Search by Ontology-Enriched Semantic Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000260862600012"}
