This problem stems from the so called projection methods for the unsteady Navier-Stokes equations and is, one of the most computationally intensive parts of the method. The present study is focused on the efficient implementation of the modified incomplete LU factorization MIC(0) as a preconditioner in the PCG iterative method for the reduced Schur complement system following from the mixed formulation of the pressure Poisson problem. The presented model analysis and the related set of numerical tests illustrate well the potential of the proposed approach. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
