Service composition in Cloud raises new challenges caused by the diversity of users with different QoS requirements and vague preferences, as well as the development of cloud computing having geographically distributed characteristics. So the selection of the best service composition is a complex problem and it faces trade-off among various QoS criteria. In this paper, we propose a Cloud service composition approach based on evolutionary algorithms, i.e., NSGA-II and MOPSO. We utilize the combination of multi-objective evolutionary approaches and Decision-Making method (AHP) to solve Cloud service composition optimization problem. The weights generated from AHP are applied to the Crowding Distance calculations of the above two evolutionary algorithms. Our algorithm beats single-objective algorithms on the optimization ability. And compared with general multi-objective algorithms, it is able to precisely capture the users' preferences. The results of the simulation also show that our approach can achieve a better scalability.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective Optimization Model with AHP Decision-making for Cloud Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000364203500002"}
