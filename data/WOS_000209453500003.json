State-of-the-art approaches for event extraction use a multi-class classifier for finding the event types. However, such approaches consider each event in isolation. In this paper, we present a sentence-level inference strategy which enforces consistency constraints on attributes of those events which appear close to one another. Our approach is general and can be used for other tasks as well. We also design novel features like clinical descriptors (from medical ontologies) which encode a lot of useful information about the concepts. For timex extraction, we adapt a state-of-the-art system, HeidelTime, for use in clinical narratives and also develop several rules which complement HeidelTime. We also give a robust algorithm for date extraction. For the event extraction task, we achieved an overall F1 score of 0.71 for determining span of the events along with their attributes. For the timex extraction task, we achieved an F1 score of 0.79 for determining span of the temporal expressions. We present detailed error analysis of our system and also point out some factors which can help to improve its accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
