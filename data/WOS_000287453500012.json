Most of recent CCP recognition works are on statistical feature extraction and artificial neural network (ANN)-based recognizers. In this paper, a two-stage hybrid detection system has been proposed using support vector machine (SVM) with self-organized maps. Direct Cosine transform of the CCP data is taken as input. Simulation results show significant improvement over conventional recognizers, with reduced detection window length. An analogous recognition system consisting of statistical feature vector input to the SVM classifier is further developed for comparison.", "paper_title": "An hybrid detection system of control chart patterns using cascaded SVM and neural network-based detector", "paper_id": "WOS:000287453500012"}
