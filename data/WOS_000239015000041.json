As the LPP model is linear, it may fail to extract the nonlinear features. This paper proposes to address this problem using an alternative formulation, kernel locality preserving projections (KLPP). Our algorithm consists of two steps: kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) plus LPP. We provide an outline for implementing KLPP. Experiments on the ORL face database and PolyU palmprint database demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
