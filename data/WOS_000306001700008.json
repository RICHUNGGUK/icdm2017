Each distance query is answered in O(1) worst-case time, and the stretch of the returned distances is at most 1 + epsilon. The algorithm uses (O) over tilde (n(2)) space. (ii) For any fixed integer k >= 1, a decremental algorithm with an expected total running time of (O) over tilde (mn). Each query is answered in O(1) worst-case time, and the stretch of the returned distances is at most 2k - 1. This algorithm, however, uses only O(m + n(1+1/k)) space. It is obtained by dynamizing techniques of Thorup and Zwick. In addition to being more space efficient, this algorithm is also one of the building blocks used to obtain the first algorithm. (iii) For any fixed epsilon, delta > 0 and every t <= m(1/2-delta), a fully dynamic algorithm with an expected amortized update time of (O) over tilde (mn/t) and worst-case query time of O(t). The stretch of the returned distances is at most 1 + epsilon. All algorithms can also be made to work on undirected graphs with small integer edge weights.
