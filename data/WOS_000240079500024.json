The images are created by employing animated autostereoscopic image of integral videography (IV), which provides geometrically accurate 3D images and reproduce motion parallax without using any supplementary glasses or tracking devices. The spatially projected 3D images are superimposed onto the patient and are viewed via a half-slivered mirror. We developed a spatial image registration method for intraoperative IV image-guided diagnosis and therapy. Two sets of preliminary experiments showed that the total system error was 0.90 +/- 0.21 mm in patient-to-image registration and the procedure time of guiding a needle toward a target was shortened to 24%. The augmented reality of the image overlay system is possible to increase the surgical instrument placement accuracy and also to reduce the procedure time as the result of intuitive 3D viewing.", "paper_title": "Surgical navigation of integral videography image overlay for open MRI-guided glioma surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500024"}
