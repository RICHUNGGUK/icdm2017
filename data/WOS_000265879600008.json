In more detail, we show that a coloring at distance 2k + 1 is necessary and sufficient to obtain the local topology at distance k that includes outgoing links. This bound drops to 2k when outgoing links are not needed. A second contribution of this article deals with color bootstrapping (from which local topology can be obtained using the aforementioned mechanisms). On the negative side, we show that (i) with a distributed daemon, it is impossible to achieve deterministic color bootstrap, even if the whole network topology can be instantaneously obtained, and (ii) with a central daemon, it is impossible to achieve distance m when instantaneous topology knowledge is limited to m - 1. On the positive side, we show that (i) under the k-central daemon, deterministic self-stabilizing bootstrap of colors up to distance k is possible provided that k-local topology can be instantaneously obtained, and (ii) under the distributed daemon, probabilistic self-stabilizing bootstrap is possible for any range.", "paper_title": "On Bootstrapping Topology Knowledge in Anonymous Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265879600008"}
