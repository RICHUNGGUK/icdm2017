Upstream pulse carriers are produced by a SC-BLS at the central office (CO), modulated by 10 Gbit/s upstream data at optical network units (ONUs), and finally detected by MLSE at the CO. MLSE effectively compensates the impairments from (1) asynchronous modulation of upstream pulse carriers at ONUs; and (2) chromatic dispersion (CD) in the fibers. Compared to the conventional method using alignment monitors at ONUs for upstream modulation synchronization and all-optical components for CD compensation, the proposed method features significant cost saving, lower power requirement for upstream signals, and lower operation complexity for ONUs in the SC-BLS WDM-PON.
