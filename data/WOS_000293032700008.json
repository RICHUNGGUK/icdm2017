Excessive power dissipation causes overheating, which can lead to soft errors or permanent damage. It also limits battery life in portable equipment. High power consumption can be reduced by properly increasing area. However, arbitrarily large area, namely high number of functional units (FU) in high-level view, dramatically increases IC cost. This paper describes a new dynamic-power aware High Level Synthesis data path approach that considers dynamic FU allocation while attempting to minimize area, power, or make a trade-off between them. The experimental results have shown that when the area is nearly the same, our approach delivers a 5.99% reduction in power consumption. And when the power consumption is nearly the same, a 11.81% reduction in total FU area occurs. And we can obtain different optimal power-area trade-off values by adjusting power and area ratios.", "paper_title": "A NEW DYNAMIC FUNCTIONAL UNIT ALLOCATION STRATEGY IN HIGH-LEVEL SYNTHESIS TO ACHIEVE POWER-AREA TRADE-OFFS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293032700008"}
