In previous Hausdorff distance (HD) measures, points are treated as same importance, or weight different points that calculated from gray domain. In this paper, a new weighting function of HD based on the eigenface from edge domain, which reflects the discriminative properties of face edge images effectively, is proposed for face recognition. Experiments show the proposed method outperforms previous HD measures.", "paper_title": "Edge Eigenface Weighted Hausdorff Distance for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000303572000037"}
