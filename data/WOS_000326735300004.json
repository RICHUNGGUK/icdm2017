We aim at showing that, if the dimensions of the considered spaces are bounded by a constant, then the computations can be done in polynomial time. In this paper we make a significant technical step towards this goal: we show that the Eilenberg-MacLane space , represented as a simplicial group, can be equipped with polynomial-time homology (this is a polynomial-time version of effective homology considered in previous works of the third author and co-workers). To this end, we construct a suitable discrete vector field, in the sense of Forman's discrete Morse theory, on . The construction is purely combinatorial and it can be understood as a certain procedure for reducing finite sequences of integers, without any reference to topology. The Eilenberg-MacLane spaces are the basic building blocks in a Postnikov system, which is a \"layered\" representation of a topological space suitable for homotopy-theoretic computations. Employing the result of this paper together with other results on polynomial-time homology, in another paper we obtain, for every fixed k, a polynomial-time algorithm for computing the kth homotopy group pi (k) (X) of a given simply connected space X, as well as the first k stages of a Postnikov system for X, and also a polynomial-time version of the algorithm of adek et al. mentioned above.", "paper_title": "Polynomial-Time Homology for Simplicial Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000326735300004"}
