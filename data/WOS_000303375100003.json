Finding a minimum independent dominating set in a graph is an NP-hard problem. Whereas it is hard to cope with this problem using parameterized and approximation algorithms, there is a simple exact O(1.4423(n))-time algorithm solving the problem by enumerating all maximal independent sets. In this paper we improve the latter result, providing the first non-trivial algorithm computing a minimum independent dominating set of a graph in time O(1.3569(n)). Furthermore, we give a lower bound of Omega(1.3247(n)) on the worst-case running time of this algorithm, showing that the running time analysis is almost tight.", "paper_title": "A Branch-and-Reduce Algorithm for Finding a Minimum Independent Dominating Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000303375100003"}
