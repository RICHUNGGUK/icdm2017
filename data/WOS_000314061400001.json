An extension of the classical Stein-Lovasz theorem for multiple coverings is given, followed by some applications for finding upper bounds of the sizes of (d,s out of r;z]-disjunct matrices and (k,m,c,n;z)-selectors, respectively. This gives a unified treatment for some previously known results relating to various models of group testing.", "paper_title": "An extension of Stein-Lovasz theorem and some of its applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000314061400001"}
