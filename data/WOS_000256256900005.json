We formulate a non-linear program (NLP) that finds the optimal bandwidth allocation by maximizing efficiency subject to (alpha, beta)-fairness constraints. This leads to what we call an efficiency-faimess function, which shows the benefit in efficiency as a function of the extent to which fairness is compromised. To solve the NLP we use two algorithms. The first is a well-known branch-and-bound-based algorithm called Lipschitz Global Optimization and the second is a recently developed algorithm called Algorithm for Global Optimization Problems (AGOP). We demonstrate the applicability of the framework to a range of examples from sharing a single link to efficiency fairness issues associated with serving customers in remote communities.(c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
