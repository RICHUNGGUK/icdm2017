In this paper, soft computing technique and fuzzy statistical tool are used to evaluate the school performance of the time management. The proposed metric system helps us to assess the distance among fuzzy data. The indices of efficiency between observed time and ideal time are also presented. Empirical studies show that the use of interval data is more realistic and reasonable in the social science research. Finally, suggestions are made for the further studies.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENCY EVALUATION IN TIME MANAGEMENT FOR SCHOOL ADMINISTRATION WITH FUZZY DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800026"}
