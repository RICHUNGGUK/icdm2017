We consider arithmetic operations on the set of beta-integers, i.e., on the set of numbers whose greedy expansion in base beta has no fractional part. We show that the number of fractional digits arising under addition of beta-integers is at most 5 for m >= 3 and 6 for m=2, whereas under multiplication it is at most 6 for all m >= 2. We thus generalize the result known for Tribonacci numeration system, i.e., for m=1. We summarize the combinatorial properties of infinite words naturally defined by beta-integers. We point out the differences between the structure of beta-intergers in cases m=1 and m >= 2.", "paper_title": "Addition and multiplication of beta-expansions in generalized Tribonacci base", "paper_id": "WOS:000253284200007"}
