Because of such geographical diversity, the quality control of sub-assemble products (SAP) is of great importance to ensure a high level of production quality. To-address the challenges of DMS management, manufacturers need to access real-time operational information captured from multiple locations. A real-time quality control information system (RTQCIS) can help control the flow of quality-related information among shop floors in the production network. This paper suggests a unique design of RTQCIS based on a new mathematical model. This model concentrates on converting multi-attribute quality measurements into a quality value corresponding to each entity in the quality space. To validate the proposed approach a prototype e-RTQCIS-DMS is developed and applied to subcontractors of an automobile company. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
