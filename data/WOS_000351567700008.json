They suffer from inadequate experiences that are lacking in them to be skilled software engineers. This paper proposes a new approach to teach and train the students of software engineering course. The qualification approach (proposed in this paper) concentrates to establish a separate centre to provide a facility for students to understand real time environment similar to one in the industry. Furthermore, it focuses to live availability of real customers during software development. The approach also proposes to test each student using one of the personality tests. This will support to focus to develop a student's skills in one area, which is related to their personality preference.", "paper_title": "The Proposal of a Qualification Based Approach Teach Software Engineering Course", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567700008"}
