However, the biomedical applications of WSN haven't received significant development due to its many unique challenges for the engineers and physicians. In this paper, a system architecture solution of body area network (BAN), our so called project \"MediMesh\", is presented. A biomedical dedicated BAN node hardware platform is devised to fit the medical monitoring application. The sensor node is built up especially for healthcare monitoring while the biocompatibility and portability are considered. A light weight network protocol is designed considering the radiation effect and Communication overhead. After data acquisition from sink stations, a data publishing system based on web service technology is implemented for typical hospital environment. The publishing of biomedical data is realized through 3 phases: first storing the data automatically in a database, then creating information sharing service by using Web Service technology, and finally allowing data access by the physicians and end users.", "paper_title": "System architecture of a body area network and its web service based data publishing", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100132"}
