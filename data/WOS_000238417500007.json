A new SW packet switching scheme for PPS, which is called SW-PPS, was presented in the authors' earlier study [1]. The PPS class is characterized by deployment of distributed center-stage switch planes with memory buffers that run slower than the external line speed. Given identical Bernoulli and Bursty data traffic, the proposed SW-PPS provided substantially outperformed typical PPS. in which the dispatch algorithm applies a round-robin method (RR) [1]. This study develops a presented Markov chain model that successfully exhibits throughput, cell delay and cell drop rate. A Simulation reveals that the chains are accurate for reasonable network loads. Major findings concerning the presented model are that: (1) the throughput and cell drop rates of a SW-PPS can theoretically emulate those of a FCFS-OQ packet switch when each slower packet switch operates at a rate of around R/K (Eq. 19). and, (2) his investigation also roves he theoretical possibility that the cell delay of a SW-PPS can emulate that of an FCFS-OQ packet switch, when each slower packet switch operates at a rate of about (R/cell delay of FCFS-OQ switch) (Eq. 20).", "paper_title": "Speedup requirements for output queuing emulation with a sliding-window parallel packet switch", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417500007"}
