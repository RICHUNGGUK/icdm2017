The initial fraction of Bell singlet state determines whether the common thermal reservoir can enhance the entanglement of two qubits or not in this case. Moreover, the stationary maximally entangled mixed state can emerge in the collective decay of two qubits in a thermal reservoir at zero-temperature only if the fraction of Bell singlet state in the initial state is not smaller than 2/3. Furthermore, it is shown that the collective decay can induce the entanglement of two qutrits initially in the maximally mixed state, and induce distillable entanglement from bound entangled states.", "paper_title": "ENHANCING STATIONARY ENTANGLEMENT OF TWO QUBITS OR QUTRITS BY COLLECTIVELY INTERACTING WITH A COMMON THERMAL RESERVOIR", "paper_id": "WOS:000262138000004"}
