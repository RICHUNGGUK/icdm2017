This analysis allows us to propose several methods to improve the accuracy of time-parallel simulation. We describe an implementation based on the widely used ns-2 simulator and on the iterative extension of the warmup period. We introduce a method for initial state approximation which can improve the accuracy of the simulation for table-driven ad hoc routing protocols. A series of experiments show that on typical scenarios time-parallel simulation leads to a significant speedup while maintaining a high level of accuracy.", "paper_title": "Time-parallel simulation of wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263983000006"}
