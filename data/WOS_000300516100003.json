One of the main causes is that no significant method of assessment of risk of battery depletion has yet been proposed. As a result decision of redirection to a charging station is fixed and takes into account neither a dynamic evaluation of the risk of battery depletion nor an evaluation of the gain, defined as the level of mission accomplishment that could be achieved. In this paper we propose a novel method for evaluation of risk of battery depletion for mobile robots. Uncertainties concerning effective battery capacity, current discharge rate and energy required for reaching the station are addressed by the use of probability density functions. This risk assessment will allow replacing the usage of battery threshold by a customizable risk-taking parameter that will be used to define what level of gain is required for balancing a given level of risk. This risk/gain management of battery will guarantee that decision of redirection to the station corresponds to a favorable compromise between risk and level of mission accomplishment. While the proposed approach has been tested using a simulated and real room cleaning robot, it could be applied on a wider range of mobile robots.", "paper_title": "Autonomous battery management for mobile robots based on risk and gain assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000300516100003"}
