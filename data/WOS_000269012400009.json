By exploiting the potential of multi-core architecture and the characteristic of streaming applications, we propose a two-phase approach to solve the energy minimization problem for periodic dependent tasks on multi-core processors with discrete voltage levels. With our approach, in the first phase, we propose a coarse-grained task-level software pipelining algorithm called RDAG to transform the periodic dependent tasks into a set of independent tasks based on the retiming technique (Leiserson and Saxe, Algorithmica 6:5-35, 1991). In the second phase, we propose two DVS scheduling algorithms for energy minimization. For single-core processors, we propose a pseudo-polynomial algorithm based on dynamic programming that can achieve optimal solution. For multi-core processors, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm called SpringS which works like a spring and can effectively reduce energy consumption by iteratively adjusting task scheduling and voltage selection. We conduct experiments with a set of benchmarks from E3S (Dick 2008) and TGFF (http://ziyang.ece.northwestern.edu/tgff) based on the power model of the AMD Mobile Athlon4 DVS processor. The experimental results show that our technique can achieve 12.7% energy saving compared with the algorithms in Zhang et al. (2002) on average.", "paper_title": "Combining Coarse-Grained Software Pipelining with DVS for Scheduling Real-Time Periodic Dependent Tasks on Multi-Core Embedded Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000269012400009"}
