However, balancing production and consumption with self-generation capacity is a challenging task since the energy production and consumption must be balanced in real time with the criteria specified by power grid. In this article, a mathematical model for minimising the production cost with exactly realisable energy delivery schedule is formulated. And a dynamic programming (DP)-based self-balancing dynamic scheduling algorithm is developed to obtain the complete solution set for such a multiple optimal solutions problem. For each stage, a set of conditions are established to determine whether a feasible control trajectory exists. The state space under these conditions is partitioned into subsets and each subset is viewed as an aggregate state, the cost-to-go function is then expressed as a function of initial and terminal generation levels of each stage and is proved to be a staircase function with finite steps. This avoids the calculation of the cost-to-go of every state to resolve the issue of dimensionality in DP algorithm. In the backward sweep process of the algorithm, an optimal policy is determined to maximise the realisability of energy delivery schedule across the entire time horizon. And then in the forward sweep process, the feasible region of the optimal policy with the initial and terminal state at each stage is identified. Different feasible control trajectories can be identified based on the region; therefore, optimising for the feasible control trajectory is performed based on the region with economic and reliability objectives taken into account.", "paper_title": "Self-balancing dynamic scheduling of electrical energy for energy-intensive enterprises", "paper_id": "WOS:000320356300002"}
