In the first model, a linear programming problem with fuzzy decision variables and fuzzy random coefficients is introduced. Then an algorithm is developed to solve the model based on fuzzy optimization method and fuzzy ranking method. In the second model, a fuzzy random quadratic spanning tree problem is presented. Then the proposed problem is formulated and solved by using the scalar expected value of fuzzy random variables. Furthermore, illustrative numerical examples are also given to clarify the methods discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Special classes of mathematical programming models with fuzzy random variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000255211400004"}
