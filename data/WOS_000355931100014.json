It summarizes the fundamental problems and enumerates factors that should be considered when addressing these problems. Existing techniques are categorized as either stepwise or integrated and sub-problems are highlighted including text localization, verification, segmentation and recognition. Special issues associated with the enhancement of degraded text and the processing of video text, multi-oriented, perspectively distorted and multilingual text are also addressed. The categories and sub-categories of text are illustrated, benchmark datasets are enumerated, and the performance of the most representative approaches is compared. This review provides a fundamental comparison and analysis of the remaining problems in the field.", "paper_title": "Text Detection and Recognition in Imagery: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000355931100014"}
