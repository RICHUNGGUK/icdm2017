We also present the modem experimental approach for studying the fire-resistance of different structural components, along with the role of numerical modeling to provide more detailed information on quantifying the temperature and heat flux fields In the last part of this work we provide the relined models for assessment of fire-induced damage in structures built of concrete and/or reinforced-concrete. We show that the refined models of this kind are needed to provide a more thorough explanation of damage and to complete the damage assessment and post-fire evaluations.", "paper_title": "On modeling of fire resistance tests on concrete and reinforced-concrete structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000280429600002"}
