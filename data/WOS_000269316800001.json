The proposed model is a timed automaton with a discrete time domain and in which each state is a timed P system. A result on expressive power and on features of the formalism sufficient for full expressiveness is proved and, as an application example, the model of an ecological system is given.", "paper_title": "Timed P Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000269316800001"}
