This article explores the energy-latency-reliability tradeoff for broadcast in WSNs by presenting a new protocol called PBBF. Essentially, for a given reliability level, energy and latency are found to be inversely related and our study quantifies this relationship at the reliability boundary. Therefore, PBBF offers an application designer considerable flexibility in the choice of desired operation points. Furthermore, we propose an extension to dynamically adjust the PBBF parameters to minimize the input required from the designer.", "paper_title": "Adaptive probability-based broadcast forwarding in energy-saving sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258298800001"}
