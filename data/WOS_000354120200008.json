In such an algorithm, the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) component provides a solution to the hydrodynamic equations, whereas the Lagrangian Monte Carlo Probability Density Function (PDF) component solves for the PDF of chemical compositions. Special attention is paid to the transfer of specific volume information from the PDF to the LES code: the specific volume field contains probabilistic noise due to the nature of the Monte Carlo PDF solution, and thus the use of the specific volume field in the LES pressure solver needs careful treatment. Using a test flow based on the Sandia/Sydney Bluff Body Flame, we determine the optimal strategy for specific volume feedback. Then, the overall second-order convergence of the entire LES/PDF procedure is verified using a simple vortex ring test case, with special attention being given to bias errors due to the number of particles per LES Finite Volume (FV) cell.
