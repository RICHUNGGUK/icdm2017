All of them are generalized or specialized versions of set-cover and have applications in biology ranging from full-sibling reconstructions in wild populations to biomolecular clusterings: however, as this paper shows, their approximability properties differ considerably. Our inapproximability constant for the triangle packing problem improves upon the previous results in [A. Caprara, R. Rizzi, Packing triangles in bounded degree graphs, Inform. Process. Lett. 84 (4) (2002) 175-180; J. Chlebikova, M. Chlebik, Complexity of approximating bounded variants of optimization problems. Theoret. Comput. Sci. 354 (3) (2006) 320338]: this is done by directly transforming the inapproximability gap of Hastad for the problem of maximizing the number of satisfied equations for a set of equations over GF(2) [J. Hastad, Some optimal inapproximability results, in: Proc. of the 29th Annual ACM Symp. on Theory of Computing, 1997, pp. 1-10] and is interesting in its own right. Our approximability results on the full siblings reconstruction problems answers questions originally posed by Berger-Wolf et al. [T.Y. Berger-Wolf, B. DasGupta, W. Chaovalitwongse. M.V. Ashley, Combinatorial reconstruction of sibling relationships. in: Proc. of the 6th International Symposium on Computational Biology and Genome Informatics, 2005, pp. 1252-1255; T.Y. Berger-Wolf, S.

Putrevu, Reconstructing sibling relationships in wild populations, Bioinformatics 23 (13) (2007) i49-i56] and our results on the maximum profit coverage problem provides almost matching upper and lower bounds on the approximation ratio, answering a question posed by Hassin and Or [R. Hassin, E. Or, A maximum profit coverage algorithm with application to small molecules Cluster identification, in: 5th International Workshop Experimental Algorithms, in: Lecture Notes in Comput.
