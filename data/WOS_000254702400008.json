Results indicated that individuals have different beliefs about the social role and capabilities of computing technology along four dimensions, including beliefs about: 1) intelligence; 2) socialness; 3) control; 4) control of rights. Results further indicated that an individual's CP was related to gender, experience with computers, as well as locus of control, self-esteem, neuroticism and general computer self-efficacy. Implications are drawn for future research investigating various beliefs about the social role and capabilities of computing technology.", "paper_title": "Beliefs about the social roles and capabilities of computing technology: development of the computing technology continuum of perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000254702400008"}
