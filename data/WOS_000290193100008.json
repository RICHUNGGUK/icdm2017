In this model, some decision-makers are first identified to formulate a group decision-making framework. Then a standard multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) process is performed on specific decision-making problems and different decision results are obtained from different decision-makers. Finally, these different decision results are aggregated into a group consensus to support the final decision-making. For illustration and verification purposes, a numerical example and a practical unconventional emergency decision case are presented. Experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed distance-based multi-criteria GDM methodology can improve decision-making objectivity and emergency management effectiveness.
