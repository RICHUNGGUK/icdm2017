The algorithm works in three steps. Firstly, constrained Delaunay triangulation of a polygon is done. After that, the obtained triangulation is heuristically corrected by inserting Steiner points. Finally, the obtained triangles are classified into three classes, thus enabling the construction of the polygon's medial axis. As shown by experiments, the obtained approximate polygon medial axis has better properties than those methods based on a Voronoi diagram. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
