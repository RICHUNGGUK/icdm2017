For this it is necessary to study the different stages of this chronic disease: multiple recurrences and progression. The sum of two random independent variables is considered, each of them being associated with a homogeneous time-continuous Markovian process of multiple absorbing states. The distribution function of the variable sum is modeled by means of a new associated Markov process. In order to maintain manageable problem dimension we have applied the Frechet derivate and the Kronecker matrix representation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
