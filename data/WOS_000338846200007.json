A framework of game theory is provided to study relationship between interference signal subspace and altruistic-egoistic bayesian game cost function. We demonstrate that the asymptotic interference alignment under proposed scheme can be realized through a numerical algorithm using local channel state information at transmitters and receivers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can achieve the total degrees of freedom that is equivalent to the Cadambe-Jafar interference alignment algorithms with perfect channel state information. Furthermore, proposed scheme can effectively minimize leakage interference in desired signal subspace at each receiver and obtain a moderate average sum rate performance compared with several existing interference alignment schemes.", "paper_title": "A Signal Subspace Interference Alignment Scheme with Sum Rate Maximization and Altruistic-Egoistic Bayesian Gaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000338846200007"}
