The reachability problem as well as the computation of certain objects of the phase portrait is decidable. In this paper we show how to compute the viability, controllability and invariance kernels, as well as semi-separatrix curves for SPDIs. We also present the tool SPeeDI(+), which implements a reachability algorithm and computes phase portraits of SPDIs. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
