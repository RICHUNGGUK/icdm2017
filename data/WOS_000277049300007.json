To achieve a low area cost, the proposed statically-configurable asymmetric architecture assigns large buffer resources to only the nearest neighbor interconnect and much smaller buffer resources for long distance interconnect. To maintain flexible routing capability, each neighboring processor pair has multiple connecting links. The architecture supports long distance communication in GALS systems by transferring the source clock with the data signals along the entire path for write synchronization. Compared to a traditional dynamically-configurable interconnect architecture with symmetric buffer allocation and single-links between neighboring processor pairs, this implementation has approximately two times smaller communication circuitry area with a similar routing capability. Area and speed estimates are obtained with the physical design of seven chips in 0.18-mu m CMOS.", "paper_title": "A Low-Area Multi-Link Interconnect Architecture for GALS Chip Multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000277049300007"}
