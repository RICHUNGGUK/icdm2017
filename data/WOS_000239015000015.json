Evolutionary strategies and genetic algorithms were used to explore a computationally intractable search space of physiological parameters and network connectivity. We found that evolutionary strategies perform well in refining good initial solutions, while the simple genetic algorithm achieves worse results even when using a higher computational load. The main obstacles in this challenging study of evolutionary neural networks are exposed and discussed, as well as the results obtained after intensive simulation. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
