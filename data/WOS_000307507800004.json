In particular, we show that the vertices of an N-vertex convex polytope in a\"e (d) can be reconstructed from the knowledge of O(DN) axial moments (w.r.t. to an unknown polynomial measure of degree D), in d+1 distinct directions in general position. Our approach is based on the collection of moment formulas due to Brion, Lawrence, Khovanskii-Pukhlikov, and Barvinok that arise in the discrete geometry of polytopes, combined with what is variously known as Prony's method, or the Vandermonde factorization of finite rank Hankel matrices.", "paper_title": "The Inverse Moment Problem for Convex Polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000307507800004"}
