The method makes use of semantic analysis and can realize Automatic Abstracting of multi-documents. The algorithm of twice word segmentation based on the title and first-sentences in paragraphs is brought forward. Its precision and recall is above 95%. For a specific domain on plastics, an Automatic Abstracting system named TCAAS is implemented. The precision and recall of multi-document's Automatic Abstracting is above 75%. And experiments do prove that it is feasible to use the method to develop a domain Automatic Abstracting system, which is valuable for further study in more depth. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
