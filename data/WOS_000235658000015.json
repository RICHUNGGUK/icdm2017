A web QoS measurement and evaluation system(WQMES) was designed and implemented based on in-depth research on the key techniques of web QoS. The prototype implementation of WQMES and the performance evaluation criteria based on performance aggregation are carefully introduced. Our contribution is presenting a single and quantitative result combining several web performance metrics. Experiment results indicate the scalable WQMES can do the real-time detection on web QoS from the end user's perspective. The performance aggregation approach is a bran-new idea, and of a definite practicability.", "paper_title": "User-perceived web QoS measurement and evaluation system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000015"}
