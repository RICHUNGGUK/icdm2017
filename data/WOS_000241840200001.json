The main objective of the paper is to compare these two methods of path planning for applications involving a biped robot. The statically stable biped robot under consideration is a 4-degree of freedom walking robot that can follow any given trajectory on flat ground and has a fixed step length of 200 mm. It is proved that the path generated by the first method produces the shortest smooth path but it also increases the computational burden on the controller, as the robot has to turn at almost all steps. However the second method produces paths that are composed of straight-line segments and hence requires less computation for trajectory following. Experiments were also conducted to prove the effectiveness of the reinforcement learning based path planning method.", "paper_title": "Path planning for a statically stable biped robot using PRM and reinforcement learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000241840200001"}
