Besides, the input matrix for each subsystem is not necessarily the same. First, a common sliding surface depending on dropout probability is constructed by means of a weighted sum approach of the input matrices. And then, a sliding mode controller based on the estimator of the lost signal is designed. It is shown that both the reachability of sliding surface and the stability of sliding mode dynamics can be guaranteed, simultaneously. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Sliding mode control for switched systems subject to successive packet dropout", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363200002"}
