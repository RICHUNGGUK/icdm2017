Design/methodology/approach - The coil-emf vectors, which are widely used for analyzing the conventional fractional-slot PM machines with non-overlapping windings, are employed for FSPM machines. Findings - Although the coil-emf vectors have been employed to obtain coil connections in the conventional fractional-slot PM machines, they are different in FSPM machines. It is mainly due to different polarities in the stator of FSPM machines. In addition, from the coil-emf vectors it is able to predict whether the back-emf waveforms are symmetrical or asymmetric. Originality/value - This is the first time that coil-emf vectors are used to determine the coil connections and winding factors in FSPM machines with different topologies and combination of stator and rotor pole numbers.", "paper_title": "Coil connections and winding factors in flux-switching PM brushless AC machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000288567800007"}
