In this paper, we study the problem of general subspace-based face recognition under the scenarios with spatial misalignments and/or image occlusions. For a given subspace derived from training data in a supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised manner, the embedding of a new datum and its underlying spatial misalignment parameters are simultaneously inferred by solving a constrained norm optimization problem, which minimizes the error between the misalignment-amended image and the image reconstructed from the given subspace along with its principal complementary subspace. A byproduct of this formulation is the capability to detect the underlying image occlusions. Extensive experiments on spatial misalignment estimation, image occlusion detection, and face recognition with spatial misalignments and/or image occlusions all validate the effectiveness of our proposed general formulation for misalignment-robust face recognition.", "paper_title": "Misalignment-Robust Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000275662900020"}
