They are based on a hypermap model for polyhedra and on formal specifications in the Calculus of Inductive Constructions. First, a type of free maps is inductively defined from three atomic constructors. Next, a hierarchy of types defined by invariants, with operations constrained by preconditions, is built Oil the free maps: hypermaps, orientated combinatorial maps and a central notion of quasi-hypermaps. Besides, the proofs of their properties are established until the genus theorem and the Euler formula, mainly using a simple induction principle based oil the free map term algebra. Finally, a constructive sufficient condition for polyhedra to be planar is set and proved. The whole process is assisted by the interactive Coq proof system. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
