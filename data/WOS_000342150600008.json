This makes it difficult to understand the recorded behavior in terms of the high-level activities in the process model. Also, it makes it difficult to improve the model based on run-time data about the process. In this work we present an approach to mine mappings between the events in the log and the activities in the model. These mappings can be used to generate suggestions of how the process model can be extended in order to capture the behavior recorded in the event log. Using a real-world and publicly available event log, we show how the approach can improve the model in a stepwise manner, until it covers all the behavior recorded in the event log.", "paper_title": "Improving process models by mining mappings of low-level events to high-level activities", "paper_id": "WOS:000342150600008"}
