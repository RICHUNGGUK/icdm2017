Recently, the IEEE 802.11s standard introduces the hybrid wireless mesh protocol (HWMP) which is inspired by a combination of on-demand and tree-based pro-active routing algorithms. In this paper, we argue that the proposed unimetric path selection algorithm in the standard is not reliable. We introduce and examine a novel multimetric wireless mesh path selection algorithm using fuzzy decision making under realistic wireless channel conditions. The proposed path selection algorithm is designed to improve the performance of both re-active and pro-active routing protocols of HWMP for not only single-channel but also multi-channel WMNs. The reported results show the superior performance of the proposed path selection algorithm in terms of delay and packet delivery ratio without increasing overhead significantly. Although some fuzzy-based routing algorithms have been defined in literature recently, to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first one to introduce and examine the use of fuzzy logic in the path selection of single- and multi-channel wireless local area network-based WMNs under realistic wireless channel conditions.", "paper_title": "Intelligent wireless mesh path selection algorithm using fuzzy decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000299386100002"}
