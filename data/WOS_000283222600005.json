Digital dental models can be generated by scanning the surfaces of plaster dental models or dental impressions with a high-resolution laser scanner. During the planning process, one of the essential steps is to reestablish the dental occlusion. Unfortunately, this task is time-consuming and often inaccurate. This paper presents a new approach to automatically and efficiently reestablish dental occlusion. It includes two steps. The first step is to initially position the models based on dental curves and a point matching technique. The second step is to reposition the models to the final desired occlusion based on iterative surface-based minimum distance mapping with collision constraints. With linearization of rotation matrix, the alignment is modeled by solving quadratic programming. The simulation was completed on 12 sets of digital dental models. Two sets of dental models were partially edentulous, and another two sets have first premolar extractions for orthodontic treatment. Two validation methods were applied to the articulated models. The results show that using our method, the dental models can be successfully articulated with a small degree of deviations from the occlusion achieved with the gold-standard method.", "paper_title": "An Automatic and Robust Algorithm of Reestablishment of Digital Dental Occlusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000283222600005"}
