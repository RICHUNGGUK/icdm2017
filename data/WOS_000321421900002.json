We propose a simple and effective algorithm for calculation and visualization of Conway matrices C-n and the corresponding matrices P-n that give probabilities that player (1) will win for the chosen words w(1) and w(2) via the standard technique of the multidimensional discrete Fourier transform (DFT). We consider also the Hamming weight-spectra of these matrices and propose an algorithm for their computation and visualization. (c) 2012 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
