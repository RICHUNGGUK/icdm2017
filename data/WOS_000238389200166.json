In this paper, network coordinate is introduced in grid information service mechanism to locate each grid node. With the hop count generation algorithm, network hops between user and resource providers can be forecasted, and results can be submitted to grid information service, which offers a list of resource providers with network hops increasing so that scheduler can work more efficiently. Performance proves that it is suitable for time-sensitive applications or applications with special restriction of network hops.", "paper_title": "Grid information service based on network hops", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200166"}
