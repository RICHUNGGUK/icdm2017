Several methods to adjust those parameters have been developed in order to enhance EA performance. For this purpose, it is important to understand the EA dynamics, i.e., to appreciate the behavior of the population. Hence, this paper presents a new model of population dynamics to describe and predict the diversity in any particular generation. The formulation is based on selecting the probability density function of each individual. The population dynamics proposed is modeled for a generational population. The model was tested in several case studies of different population sizes. The results suggest that the prediction error decreases as the population size increases. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
