We determine how quickly the domain size must grow with n to ensure that these models are robust in the sense that they exhibit a non-trivial threshold of satisfiability, and we determine the asymptotic order of that threshold. We also provide resolution complexity lower bounds for these models. One of our results immediately yields a theorem regarding homomorphisms between two random graphs.
