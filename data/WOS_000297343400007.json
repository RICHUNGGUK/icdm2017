However, existing approaches have insufficient resolution and low frame rate per second, or have high complexity and cost. We take inspiration from the human visual system and propose a multi-resolution design, e-Fovea, which provides peripheral vision with a steerable fovea that is in higher resolution. In this paper, we firstly present two user studies, with a total of 36 participants, to compare e-Fovea to two existing multi-resolution visual monitoring designs. The user study results show that for visual monitoring tasks, our e-Fovea design with steerable focus is significantly faster than existing approaches and preferred by users. We then present our design and implementation of e-Fovea, which combines both multi-resolution camera input and multi-resolution steerable projector output. Finally, we present our deployment of e-Fovea in three installations to demonstrate its feasibility.", "paper_title": "Multi-Resolution Design for Large-Scale and High-Resolution Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000297343400007"}
