A robust adaptive state-feedback controller is constructed by a stabilising controller gain and an adaptive control gain function. Using mode-dependent Lyapunov functions, linear matrix inequality-based conditions are developed to find the controller gain such that disturbance attenuation performance is optimised. Adaptive control schemes are proposed to estimate the unknown controller parameters on-line for unparametrisable stuck faults and perturbation compensations. Based on Lyapunov stability theory, it is shown that the resulting closed-loop systems can guarantee asymptotic tracking with H-infinity performances in the presence of faults on actuators and perturbations. An application to a decoupled linearised dynamic aircraft system and its simulation results are given.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity and adaptive tracking control against actuator faults with a linearised aircraft application", "paper_id": "WOS:000311084900012"}
