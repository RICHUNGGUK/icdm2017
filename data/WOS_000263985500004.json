It Supports host macro-mobility well. However, it will produce unnecessary signaling cost and handoff latency When used in micro-mobility environment. In this paper, we propose a novel dynamic hierarchical location management scheme for HIP called DH-HIP to support host micro-mobility. DH-HIP has a three-layer architecture, Which is managed by the rendezvous server, gateway rendezvous server and local rendezvous server, respectively. Each mobile node selects its local rendezvous server and computes the optimal size of the administrative domain according to its current mobility rate and packet arrival rate. We also propose an analytical model to Study the signaling cost of DH-HIP and HIP. The analytical results show that DH-HIP can reduce the total signaling cost significantly under the scenario of micro-mobility.", "paper_title": "A Novel Location Management Scheme for Minimizing Signaling Costs in Host Identity Protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000263985500004"}
