For this reason, when using time-to-market, components are slow and reusability of the components decreases. Hence, providing the variability of components becomes an important prerequisite for a successful component-based application development project. In this paper, we propose a variability design technique that can satisfy the requirements of many different kinds of domains. This technique addresses a method for designing the variability of the behavior and the workflow in a more detailed manner, and uses an object-oriented mechanism and design patterns. One of the most important goals of this technique is to provide a practical method which can be effectively applied to component-based application development.", "paper_title": "Variability design techniques for enhancing component reusability", "paper_id": "WOS:000239223000006"}
