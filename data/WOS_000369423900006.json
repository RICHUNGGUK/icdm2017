In this method, eddy currents are generated in a conductive material by a changing magnetic field. A defect is detected when there is a disruption in the flow of the eddy current. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new noniterative inversion methodology for detecting degradation (defect characterization) such as cracking, corrosion and erosion from the measurement of the impedance variations. Design/methodology/approach - The methodology is based on multi-output support vector machines (SVM) combined with the adaptive database schema design method (SDM). The forward problem was solved numerically using finite element method (FEM), with its accuracy experimentally verified. The multi-output SVM is a statistical learning method that has good generalization capability and learning performance. FEM is used to create the adaptive database required to train the multioutput SVM and the genetic algorithm is used to tune the parameters of multi-output SVM model. Findings - The results show the applicability of multi-output SVM to solve eddy current inverse problems instead of using traditional iterative inversion methods which can be very time-consuming. With the experimental results the authors demonstrate the accuracy which can be provided by the multi-output SVM technique. Practical implications - The work allows extending the capability of the experimentation ECT defect characterization system developed at LGEP. Originality/value - A new inversion method is developed and applied to ECT defect characterization. This new concept introduces multi-output SVM in the context of ECT. The real data together with estimated one obtained by multi-output SVM model are compared in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the developed technique.", "paper_title": "The combination of adaptive database SDM and multi-output SVM for eddy current testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000369423900006"}
