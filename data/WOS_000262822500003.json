We first argue that the theoretical body developed in film studies is highly relevant to the study of sound/image relationships in mapmaking. We then build on this argument to develop experimental animated and interactive sound maps for the Cybercartographic Atlas of Antarctica that further explore the potential of sound for integrating emotional, cultural and political dimensions in cartography. These maps have been designed to recreate cinematic soundscapes, to provide contrapuntal perspectives on the cartographic image and to generate an aural identity of the atlas. As part of this experimental mapping, an innovative sound infrastructure is being developed to allow complex sound designs to be transmitted over the Internet as part of atlas content. Through this infrastructure the user can select as well as contribute his own Sounds. The overall cartographic message is becoming less predictable, thus opening new perspectives on the way we design, interact with, and modify sounded maps over the Internet.", "paper_title": "Designing sound in cybercartography: from structured cinematic narratives to unpredictable sound/image interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262822500003"}
