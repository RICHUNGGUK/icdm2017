Currently there are hundreds of active space programs around the world that communicate in outer space. However, the concept of an Interplanetary Internet (IPN) is only in its incubation stage. Considerable amount of common standards and research is required before widespread deployment occurs to make IPN feasible. This paper presents a concise picture of the current space networking technologies and architectures. It discusses the Interplanetary Internet and Delay Tolerant Networking (DTN) concepts along with the various space networks that are currently deployed. The paper also identifies the significant areas of space network design and operation that still require extensive research and development.", "paper_title": "Communication Technologies and Architectures for Space Network and Interplanetary Internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000318893100017"}
