However, pervasive environments require strong efforts on all the aspects of information security. Notably, RFID passive tags are exposed to attacks, since strict limitations affect the security techniques for this technology. A critical threat for RFID-based information systems is represented by data tampering, which corresponds to the malicious alteration of data recorded in the tag memory. The aim of this paper is to describe the characteristics and the effects of data tampering in RFID-based information systems, and to survey the approaches proposed by the research community to protect against it. The most important recent studies on privacy and security for RFID-based systems are examined, and the protection given against tampering is evaluated. This paper provides readers with an exhaustive overview on risks and defenses against data tampering, highlighting RFID weak spots and open issues.", "paper_title": "Tampering in RFID: A Survey on Risks and Defenses", "paper_id": "WOS:000278942100004"}
