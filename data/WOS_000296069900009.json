It has been shown that the event-triggered actuation strategy is an effective methodology for designing distributed control of multi-agent systems with limited computational resources. In this paper, a tracking control problem of leader-follower multi-agent systems with/without communication delays is formulated and a distributed dynamic tracking control is designed by employing event-triggered technique. Then, the input-to-state stability of the closed-loop multi-agent system with directed interconnections is analyzed. Finally, a numerical example is given to validate the proposed control.", "paper_title": "DISTRIBUTED EVENT-TRIGGERED TRACKING CONTROL OF LEADER-FOLLOWER MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS WITH COMMUNICATION DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296069900009"}
