This paper presents a novel Cognitive Link State Routing protocol for CR-based tactical ad hoc networks. The proposed scheme provides prompt and reliable routes for Primary User (PU) activity through procedures that incorporate two main functions: PU-aware power adaptation and channel switching. For the PU-aware power adaptation, closer multipoint relay nodes are selected to prevent network partition and ensure successful PU communication. The PU-aware channel switching is proactively conducted using control messages to switch to a new available channel based on a common channel list. Our simulation study based on the ns-3 simulator demonstrates that the proposed routing scheme delivers significantly improved performance in terms of average end-to-end delay, jitter, and packet delivery ratio.", "paper_title": "CLSR: Cognitive Link State Routing for CR-based Tactical Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351719000004"}
