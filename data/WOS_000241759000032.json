The data sets are combined from external exposure and internal stress factors on human health. For deduction of modes of action on human health, external and internal stress factors have to be combined and classified. The approach shown in this paper is based upon clustering algorithms. Relationships between cases ban be obtained by visual inspection of clustering results.", "paper_title": "Visualization of depending patterns in metabonomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000032"}
