We show that the rectilinear 3-center problem is fixed-parameter tractable, by giving an algorithm that runs in O(nlogn) time for any fixed dimension d. On the other hand, we show that this is unlikely to be the case with both the Euclidean and rectilinear k-center problems for any k >= 2 and k >= 4 respectively. In particular, we prove that deciding whether P can be covered by the union of 2 balls of given radius or by the union of 4 cubes of given side length is W[1]-hard with respect to d, and thus not fixed-parameter tractable unless FPT=W[1]. For the Euclidean case, we also show that even an n(o(d))-time algorithm does not exist, unless there is a 2(o(n))-time algorithm for n-variable 3SAT, that is, the Exponential Time Hypothesis fails.", "paper_title": "Geometric Clustering: Fixed-Parameter Tractability and Lower Bounds with Respect to the Dimension", "paper_id": "WOS:000296200900004"}
