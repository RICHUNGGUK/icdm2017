Unfortunately, portability in MPI is only guaranteed for compiling codes; it does not necessarily mean that an MPI program will actually result in the same behavior on different platforms. The MPITEST suite provides a series of micro kernels to test MPT implementations across different systems. All codes of MPITEST conform to the MPI standard; however, their behavior is implementation dependent, potentially leading to unexpected results. In this paper we introduce MPITEST and present examples from the test suite along with their surprising results and consequences on a series of platforms. The goal of this work is to demonstrate this problem in general and to raise awareness in the MPI user community.", "paper_title": "Exploring unexpected behavior in MPI", "paper_id": "WOS:000241591300087"}
