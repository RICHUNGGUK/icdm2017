They study the leader election problem in a distributed mobile environment and they wonder whether there exists an algorithm such that for each distributed mobile environment, it either states that the problem cannot be solved in this environment, or it successfully elects a leader. In this paper, we give a positive answer to this question. We also give a characterization of the distributed mobile environments where the election problem can be solved.", "paper_title": "Election in the qualitative world", "paper_id": "WOS:000239484100008"}
