While E-brokerage has become a significant sector of E-commerce, theory and guidelines for matching the multi-attribute exchange in E-brokerage are sparse. This paper proposes a matching approach to optimize the trade matching in one-shot multi-attribute exchanges with incomplete weight information. Firstly, the new definition of matching degree from both buyers' and sellers' points of view in multi-attribute exchanges is presented. Secondly, based on the definition of matching degree and the representation of incomplete weight information, a bi-objective optimization model is built to maximize the matching degree and trading volume. Then, according to the characteristics of the model which belongs to a class of multi-objective mixed 0-1 integer quadratic programming models, the ideal point method is used to solve it. Finally, an example is employed to illustrate the application of the proposed matching approach.", "paper_title": "A MATCHING APPROACH FOR ONE-SHOT MULTI-ATTRIBUTE EXCHANGES WITH INCOMPLETE WEIGHT INFORMATION IN E-BROKERAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400007"}
