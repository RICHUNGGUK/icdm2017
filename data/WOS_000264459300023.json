Related contents, include: generalized life, vitality, resource, circulation, environs, periodicity, phenology, eco-niche in pansystems space, evolution, intelligence development, philosophy of science, epistemology, psychology, pedagogy and teaching. Design/methodology/approach - The paper is an application of pansystems principles to approach an ecology-styled world outlook and methodology, related topics include: pansystems rediscovery to ecology and the world; generalized relativity, resource, environs, ecology, Circulation, life; pansystems models on evolution, eco-niche, pyramid law, recap law, phenology, management and knowledge rediscovery. Findings - All of the logoi concerned with are reduced to the actualization of pansystems variational principle and related OR-concretion. The pansystems ecology presents a new outlook to world, society, management, methodology, pedagogy and knowledge rediscovery. Originality/value - Provides the framework and concretion principles of pansystems research on generalized resource, circulation, environs, ecology and related applications. They lead to some new comprehension of evolution, psychology, epistemology, society, management.", "paper_title": "Pansystems ecology, management and knowledge rediscovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000264459300023"}
