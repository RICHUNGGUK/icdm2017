We develop a multivariate, tree-based decision system for a new application: the determination of whether a newly launched consumer product should be allowed to continue in a highly competitive market. The system is designed to overcome a shortcoming-the inability to capture multivariate interactions-of traditional decision methods. We apply the proposed method to an instant noodle sales data set that contains 38 million transactions, and compare results across several methods. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
