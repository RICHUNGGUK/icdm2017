The new estimator uses the Pisarenko Harmonic Decomposer (PHD) estimator to get a coarse frequency estimate and then makes use of multiple correlation lags to obtain an adjustment term. For the limited-length single sinusoid, its correlation has the same frequency as itself but with a non-zero phase. We propose to use Taylor series to expand the correlation at the PHD coarse estimated frequency with amplitude and phase of the correlation into consideration. Simulation results show that this new method improves the estimation performance of the PHD estimator. Moreover, when compared with other existing estimator, the mean square frequency error of the proposed method is closer to the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for certain SNR range.", "paper_title": "Closed-Form Real Single-Tone Frequency Estimator Based on Phase Compensation of Multiple Correlation Lags", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300047"}
