For any large-scale implementation project, specific business process and system information is included in the enterprise-solution architecture. To understand the totality of any organization's business processes, managers must define and document all core and support processes. Design/methodology/approach - The examples used in this paper are from large public sector organizations, but the underlying methodology and conceptual basis for the paper apply to any complex organization. Findings - The main conclusion of this paper is that end-to-end (E2E) business process scenarios must be used for defining the requirements for any system implementation project in any organization. If the new system does not align with the E2E-business processes, then management requirements cannot be realized. We also note that E2E scenarios must be considered when implementing enterprise software in a non-enterprise environment. Originality/value - The paper notes that E2E scenarios represent the requirements definition level for composite applications enabled in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). Traditional implementation methodologies that enable standard software modules (or integration scenarios across modules) are not effective in non-enterprise environments.", "paper_title": "End-to-end business process scenarios", "paper_id": "WOS:000248068600009"}
