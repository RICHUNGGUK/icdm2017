The performance of this chart is usually evaluated under the assumption of known parameters. However, in practice, process parameters are estimated from an in-control Phase 1 data set. A modified EWMA control chart is proposed for monitoring the standard deviation when the parameters are estimated. The Run Length properties of this chart are studied and its performance is evaluated by comparing it with the same chart but with process parameters assumed known. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
