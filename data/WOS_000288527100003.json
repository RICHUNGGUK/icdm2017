Also, we show that if we replace Omega by R-N in Problem (P), the generate equation has a weak solution. Finally, it is shown that with some adequate assumptions on f, the Problem (P) has two sequences of solution.", "paper_title": "THE EXISTENCE OF WEAK SOLUTION FOR DEGENERATE Sigma Delta(pi(x))-EQUATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000288527100003"}
