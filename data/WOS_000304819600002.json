On the one hand, the modeling process is inherently abstract, removing the prototyper from details, and letting him or her focus on exploring design alternatives for various aspects of the system. On the other hand, the most popular modeling languages and tools entirely omit the modeling and generating of user interfaces. As a result, the benefit of user interface prototypes as a medium for interaction with the user and customer is lost. This paper presents a model-oriented technology called Umple that can be used for prototyping and also supporting model driven engineering. Umple allows end users to quickly create class and state machine models and to incrementally embed implementation artifacts. At any point in the modeling process, users can quickly generate a fully functional prototype that exposes modeling implications on the user interface, and allows stakeholders to get a feel of how the full system will behave.
