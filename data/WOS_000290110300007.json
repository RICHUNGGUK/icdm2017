In this work, we study the appearance of color under different degrees of edge smoothness. A psychophysical experiment was conducted to quantify the change in perceived lightness, colorfulness, and hue with respect to edge smoothness. We confirm that color appearance, in particular lightness, changes noticeably with increased smoothness. Based on our experimental data, we have developed a computational model that predicts this appearance change. The model can be integrated into existing color appearance models. We demonstrate the applicability of our model on a number of examples.", "paper_title": "Edge-Aware Color Appearance", "paper_id": "WOS:000290110300007"}
