D-Coverage is the coverage provided by a sensor network monitoring an area between two boundaries through which an intruder attempts to penetrates the area. We also study how to measure the quality of D-Coverage. Our first measurement approach is a simple, projection-based one. Our second, more comprehensive approach is based on Markov chains. These approaches can accurately evaluate the quality of D-Coverage as well as provide sound guidelines for sensor network deployment and run-time repair to achieve desired D-Coverage quality.", "paper_title": "Directed Coverage in Wireless Sensor Networks: Concept and Quality", "paper_id": "WOS:000287433400001"}
