The World Wide Web is emerging with a broader variety of resources that include both data and services. Yet, a lot of research work focused on either service discovery or data discovery although they cannot be separated from each other. In addition, the current Network, due to its decentralized nature and weak support for semantic, is still chaotic and lacks of the ability to allow users to discover, extract and integrate information of interest from heterogeneous sources. In this paper, we present a scalable, high performance system for data and service unified discovery, and to increase the success rate, an ontology-based approach is used to describe data and services. As for service, we add quality of service (QoS) information to OWL-S files to get more accurate results for users. Moreover, we also bring JXTA, which is a suitable foundation to build future computer systems on, to our system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
