Previously, the locally twisted cube has been shown to contain a Hamiltonian cycle. The main contribution of this paper is to provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for determining a characterization of permutations of link dimensions constructing Hamiltonian cycles in a locally twisted cube. For those permutations, we propose a linear algorithm for finding a Hamiltonian cycle through a given edge. As a result, we obtain a lower bound for the number of Hamiltonian cycles through a given edge in an n-dimensional locally twisted cube. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
