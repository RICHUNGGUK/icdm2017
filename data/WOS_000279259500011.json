Many-to-many communication is one of the most central issues in various interconnection networks. In this paper, we investigate the problem of many-to-many unpaired n-disjoint path covers in the n-dimensional hypercube Q(n) and obtain the following result. For any two sets S and T of n vertices in different parts, Q(n) has many-to-many unpaired n-disjoint (S, T)-path covers except the case that there exists a vertex v such that N(Qn) (v) = S and v is not an element of T or N(Qn) (v) = T and v is not an element of S.
