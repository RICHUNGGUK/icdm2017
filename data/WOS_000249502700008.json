For macroscopic quantities such as the stress field, however, this counterargument is no longer true. In fact, this paper advertises an averaging technique for a surprisingly improved convergence behavior for nonconvex minimization problems. Similar to a finite volume scheme, numerical experiments on a double-well benchmark example provide empirical evidence of superconvergence phenomena in macroscopic numerical simulations of oscillating microstructures.", "paper_title": "An averaging scheme for macroscopic numerical simulation of nonconvex minimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000249502700008"}
