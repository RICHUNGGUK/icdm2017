Simulations with typical BSIM3V3 parameters of a 0.35 mu m CMOS process have shown a 3.56 GHz gain-bandwidth product under 2.5 V supply voltage. The corresponding total harmonic distortion is equal to 0.46% for 2 V peak-peak differential output voltage. At the same supply voltage, the circuit can provided at each output a voltage swing of 2.25 V peak-peak. From V(DD) = 2 V to V(DD) = 2.5 V the differential transconductance varies from 72 to 108.4 mu Omega(-1). The corresponding common mode rejection ratio and the total power consumption are always lower than -31 dBc and 800 mu W, respectively. Typical application of a biquad filter is proposed to illustrate the circuit capabilities.", "paper_title": "OTA based on CMOS inverters and application in the design of tunable bandpass filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000260550000002"}
