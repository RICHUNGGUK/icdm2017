At the same time, it is not clear whether the concept of relevance developed in information science and implemented for document-based information retrieval can be directly applied to this new, highly dynamic setting. In this study, we analyze the criteria users apply when judging the relevance of geographic entities in a given mobile usage context. Two different experiments have been set up in order to gather users' opinions on a set of possible criteria, and their relevance judgements in a given scenario. The importance ascribed to the criteria in both experiments clearly implies that a new concept of relevance is required when dealing with geographic entities instead of digital documents. This new concept of 'Geographic Relevance' is highly dependent on personal mobility and user's activity, whose understanding may in turn be refined by the assimilation of 'Geographic Relevance' itself.", "paper_title": "Criteria of geographic relevance: an experimental study", "paper_id": "WOS:000306976000008"}
