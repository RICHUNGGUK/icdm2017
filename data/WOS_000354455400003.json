The rationale of this problem is based on the fact that a moving object can result in the changes of received signal strength (RSS) of the wireless links. Existing studies on this problem usually do not consider the impact of dynamic target speed on device-free passive localization. However, the experiments show that the localization performance degrades substantially when an object is moving at dynamic speed. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we propose an adaptive device-free passive localization framework which has three components to detect target speed change and perform adaptive localization. This framework can be easily adapted for existing device-free localization methods which are based on the detection of signal strength changes. As demonstrated in the experiments, the proposed framework can lead to 50 and 30 percent improvement on median and maximum error respectively over the localization algorithms without considering dynamic moving speeds of the target.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Framework Coping with Dynamic Target Speed for Device-Free Passive Localization", "paper_id": "WOS:000354455400003"}
