The framework has been realized in a system (SALT) which captures the citizen behavior and applies three axes of adaptation: based on previously gathered data from the citizen through questionnaires, based on problems encountered by the citizen and based on metadata of the pages visited by the citizen. The comparative evaluation to a similar but static approach, gives evidence to our hypothesis that the proposed framework brings added value to both citizens and public administrations.
