A strategy for multiple removal consists of estimating a model of the multiples and then adaptively subtracting this model from the data by estimating shaping filters. A classical approach of this strategy is the surface-related multiple elimination (SRME) method. In the SRME process, the subtraction stage plays an important role, because there are amplitude, phase, and frequency distortions in the predicted multiple model. Typically, in this stage the primaries are assumed to have minimum energy (l(2)-norm) and the solving method is the least-square errors. Methods using this norm are robust in the presence of noise, but can produce bad results when primaries and multiples interfere. Replacing the l(2)-norm, a sparseness constraint is used in our new approach. The sparseness constraint should give better results because the correct subtraction of the predicted multiples should lead to a primary estimation with a minimum number of events. We also develop a fast gradient method for solving the sparse norm minimization problem. The effective results of the new method are illustrated with the synthetic data in the one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases. It is shown that the sparse norm minimization problem with fast gradient solution methods leads to much improved attenuation of the multiples while the minimum energy assumption is violated. The multiples being subtracted fit the multiples well in the data while preserving the energy of primaries.", "paper_title": "Adaptive surface-related multiple subtraction using sparse norm minimization method", "paper_id": "WOS:000326672400010"}
