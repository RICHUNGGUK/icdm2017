We describe an application to learning rules of a dice game using data from a vision system observing the game being played. In this paper, we experimented with two broad approaches: (i) a predictive learning approach with the Progol system, where explicit concept learning problems are posed and solved, and (ii) a descriptive learning approach with the HR system, where a general theory is formed with no specific problem solving task in mind and rules are extracted from the theory.", "paper_title": "Predictive and descriptive approaches to learning game rules from vision data", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100039"}
