Commencing the analysis with the Primal approach for 100 samples of urban street networks, a great heterogeneity is empirically discovered in their structural properties. Due to the observed morphological complexity, the necessity of a fast abstraction model capturing the complex street patterns is justified. The case study supports the sufficiency of Gabriel graphs for the reproduction of the street networks' basic structural properties such as the average shortest path, the diameter or the average street segment length. The results also demonstrate the sheer superiority of Gabriel graphs for the early estimation of the trenching length of FTTx networks with more than 48 % better accuracy in comparison with the conventional geometric models. Particularly in dense urban areas, the geometric models suffer more serious accuracy shortcomings, whereas the suggested model performs even better.", "paper_title": "Incorporating Gabriel graph model for FTTx dimensioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000351296300008"}
