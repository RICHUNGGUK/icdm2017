This problem occurs, for example, if certain classes of free boundary problems are discretized. We Compute error bounds for approximations (x) over cap to a solution x* of the discretized problems. The error bounds are improved by an iterative method and can be made arbitrarily small. The ideas are illustrated by numerical experiments.", "paper_title": "Error bounds for complementarity problems with tridiagonal nonlinear functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000262730300003"}
