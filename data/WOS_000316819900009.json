The portability of a PASU system makes it an attractive solution for monitoring and understanding the current situation of the personal area around a user. The PASU system allows its user to construct a 3D scene of the environment and view the scene from various vantage points for better understanding of the environment. The paper describes the architecture and implementation of the PASU system addressing limitations of wireless camera sensor networks, such as low bandwidth and limited computational capabilities. The capabilities of PASU are validated with extensive experiments. The PASU system demonstrates the potential of a portable system combining a smart device and a wireless camera sensor network for personal area monitoring and situation understanding.", "paper_title": "PASU: A personal area situation understanding system using wireless camera sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316819900009"}
