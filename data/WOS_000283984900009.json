However, those constraints are often dependent on execution environments that are sometimes revealed in late development phases. In this paper, we propose Timed and Resource-oriented Statecharts (TRoS) to analyze the time and resource-constrained behavior of system in earlier development phases of embedded software development. TRoS extends Statecharts using timed action labeled with resources to represent actions that consume resources. This enables us to describe the competition among processes to use shared resources, and to analyze schedulability of embedded systems. We present a case study of a distance control module that controls train movement to keep the distance between trains for railway control systems.", "paper_title": "Timed and Resource-Oriented Statecharts for Embedded Software", "paper_id": "WOS:000283984900009"}
