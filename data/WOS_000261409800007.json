The key feature of this control scheme is the introduction of extra adjustable free parameters into the design Of sliding surface so that a new sliding mode controller cart be constructed to improve the tracking performance. The validity of the proposed control scheme is verified by means of a practical testing on an experimental liquid level control device. For the cases of single-step, multi-step, and sinusoidal level position command inputs, the experimental results strongly suggest that the proposed control scheme is capable of improving the tracking precision effectively. In addition, the new control scheme seems to be very robust against various set point conditions.", "paper_title": "DESIGN OF A SLIDING MODE CONTROLLER FOR A WATER TANK LIQUID LEVEL CONTROL SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800007"}
