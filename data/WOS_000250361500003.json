Subjects had to cross mazes while the corresponding maps were presented on a hand-held display, two helmet-mounted displays (a retinal scanning and a liquid crystal display) or on paper. The simulated mazes were projected on a backlit screen and the subjects could cross them using a joystick. The displays were compared with regard to subjects' speed when crossing the mazes, experienced task difficulty, visual fatigue and simulator sickness. The results show that speed was lowest with the paper map and experienced task difficulty was highest, whereas no significant differences were found between the electronic displays. Visual fatigue and simulator sickness were low and no significant differences were observed between all displays. The conclusion is drawn that all electronic map displays can be used for short time periods (15 - 30 minutes); however, long term effects have to be analysed in future experimental studies.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of mobile map displays in a geographic orientation task", "paper_id": "WOS:000250361500003"}
