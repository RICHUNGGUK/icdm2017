Especially, a relay mounted in a vehicle is differentiated from nomadic or fixed relay by the restricted distance between the relay and associated mobile station and the variable density of relay deployment in a cell. In this paper, we identify the characteristics of vehicle-mounted mobile relay stations and provide some parameters that highly influence the performance of vehicle-mounted relay. Through simulation, we measure the effect of relay density, zone ratio, relay transmission power, and frame transmission mode on the performance of vehicle-mounted relay. The results show that the performance of vehicle-mounted relay is highly susceptible to the above vehicle-mounted relay-specific parameters.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Vehicle-mounted Mobile Relay in Next Generation Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291360000001"}
