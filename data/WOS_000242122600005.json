The estimation is an inverse problem and is known to be ill-conditioned, in the sense that small errors in the observed images can cause large changes in the reconstruction. The paper discusses application of existing regularization techniques to super-resolution as an intelligent means of stabilizing the reconstruction process. Some most common approaches are reviewed and experimental results for iterative reconstruction are presented.", "paper_title": "Regularization for super-resolution image reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600005"}
