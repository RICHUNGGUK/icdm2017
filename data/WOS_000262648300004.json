This paper presents a real-time Motion-JPEG2000 encoding which is built on a fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) as a single-chip implementation. The design addresses on the system-level design considerations. Among several modules in JPEG2000, Embedded Block Coding with Optimized Truncation (EBCOT) algorithm contains the highest computation complexity and also becomes the bottleneck of JPEG2000. Two speed-improved methods are proposed to significantly reduce the processing time of EBCOT. The fast algorithm is used by processing the three coding passes in sequential and is very suitable to the execution on programming-based processor. For Motion-JPEG2000 implementation, a real-time encoding system is built on the single-chip DSP processor without any extra hardware support. The optimization techniques are also applied to enhance the performance. Due to the contribution on algorithm and implementation issue, the complexity of Motion-JPEG2000 is largely reduced. Simulation results show that the proposed system can process 30 frames per second in CIF size (352 x 288 pixels) with 4:2:0 video sequences. For SDTV size resolution (760 x 480 pixels), the system can achieve near 20 frames per second.", "paper_title": "AN EFFICIENT DESIGN FOR MOTION-JPEG2000 SYSTEM IN REAL-TIME VIDEO ENCODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648300004"}
