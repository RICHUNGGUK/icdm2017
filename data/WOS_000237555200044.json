Instead of using a model based on salient image fragments, we show that object class detection is also possible using only the object's boundary. To this end, we develop a novel learning technique to extract class-discriminative boundary fragments. In addition to their shape, these \"codebook\" entries also determine the object's centroid (in the manner of Leibe et al. [19]). Boosting is used to select discriminative combinations of boundary fragments (weak detectors) to form a strong \"Boundary-Fragment-Model\" (BFM) detector. The generative aspect of the model is used to determine an approximate segmentation. We demonstrate the following results: (i) the BFM detector is able to represent and detect object classes principally defined by their shape, rather than their appearance; and (ii) in comparison with other published results on several object classes (airplanes, cars-rear, cows) the BFM detector is able to exceed previous performances, and to achieve this with less supervision (such as the number of training images).", "paper_title": "A boundary-fragment-model for object detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000237555200044"}
