SVMs have been successfully applied in numerous areas, and have demonstrated excellent performance. However, due to the high dimensionality and nonlinear distribution of the input data, this study employed a kernel graph embedding (KGE) scheme to reduce the dimensionality of input data, and enhance the performance of SVM classifiers. Empirical results indicated that one-vs-one SVM with KGE outperforms other multi-class SVMs and traditional classifiers. Compared with other dimensionality reduction methods the performance improvement owing to KGE is significant. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
