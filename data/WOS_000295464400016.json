The setup times are proportional to the length of jobs that are already scheduled; i.e. p-s-d setup times. The learning effect reduces the actual processing time of a job because the workers are involved in doing the same job or activity repeatedly. Hence, the processing time of a job depends on its position in the sequence. In this study, we consider the total absolute difference in completion times (TADC) as the objective function. This problem is denoted as 1/LE, (Spsd)/TADC in Kuo and Yang (2007) ('Single Machine Scheduling with Past-sequence-dependent Setup Times and Learning Effects', Information Processing Letters, 102, 22-26). There are two parameters a and b denoting constant learning index and normalising index, respectively. A parametric analysis of b on the 1/LE, (Spsd)/TADC problem for a given value of a is applied in this study. In addition, a computational algorithm is also developed to obtain the number of optimal sequences and the range of b in which each of the sequences is optimal, for a given value of a. We derive two bounds b* for the normalising constant b and a* for the learning index a. We also show that, when a < a* or b > b*, the optimal sequence is obtained by arranging the longest job in the first position and the rest of the jobs in short processing time order.", "paper_title": "Single-machine scheduling with past-sequence-dependent setup times and learning effects: a parametric analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000295464400016"}
