This survey reviews 100+ recent articles on content-based multimedia information retrieval and discusses their role in current research directions which include browsing and search paradigms, user studies, affective computing, learning, semantic queries, new features and media types, high performance indexing, and evaluation techniques. Based on the current state of the art, we discuss the major challenges for the future.", "paper_title": "Content-based multimedia information retrieval: State of the art and challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000250871200001"}
