The complete monitoring system involves both hardware and software design perspectives. At the hardware level, we present a T-shirt with a 12-lead ECG system and an embedded inertial sensor for the monitoring of activity and energy expenditure. At the software level, a modular cloud platform performs data processing to detect relevant cardiac events and to provide advanced visualization capabilities. As a case study, we have implemented our system at the Cardiac Rehabilitation program at Donostia University Hospital (Spain). Finally, the validation of the 12-lead ECG recording system is also presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Design and Development of a Mobile Cardiac Rehabilitation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000334039900002"}
