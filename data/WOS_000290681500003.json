Robust optimization problems are formulated for both deterministic and stochastic cases using linear 0-1 programming techniques. Equivalent formulations are developed in terms of cardinality constraints. We conducted numerical case studies and analyzed the performance of optimization solvers on the considered problem instances.", "paper_title": "Robust multi-sensor scheduling for multi-site surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000290681500003"}
