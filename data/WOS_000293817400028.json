A file can be encrypted by different cipher algorithms with diverse parameters through FMCT. We prove that a cryptosystem based on FMCT is reversible, flexible, workable and applicable in modern secure protocols. For high throughput applications based on FMCT cryptosystem, a multi-core scheduling algorithm is also proposed. Since this scheduling algorithm spans a lot of FPGA configuration files from base cipher algorithms, even if the number of base cipher algorithms is limited, a lot of configurations of cipher suits can be generated for cipher change protocol in different session of communications. Therefore, the frequency of the usage of a certain cipher algorithm is effectively reduced. No doubt, this is an alternative way to promote higher security in modern secure protocols.", "paper_title": "FAST MULTI-CIPHER TRANSFORMATION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION FOR MODERN SECURE PROTOCOLS", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400028"}
