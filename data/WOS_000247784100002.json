We use finite difference scheme to reduce the system to an equivalent system of an infinite linear algebraic eigenvalue problem. We give a precise error analysis for the eigenvalues of the approximate system and an error analysis for the continuous system under the condition that vertical bar y(iv)(x)vertical bar is bounded. The theory is applied to compute the eigenvalues when f (x)=x(2) for which explicit solutions are known. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
