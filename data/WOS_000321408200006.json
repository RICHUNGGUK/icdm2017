With flexible direction features and a multi-resolution structure which is similar to wavelet, the application of Shearlet in image processing has been developing. In this paper, based on Shearlets and PCNN, a new algorithm of image fusion is proposed. A shear matrix is used to decompose the source images into several directions. To each direction, we extract the gradient characteristics, make multi-scale decomposition using wavelet, and fuse the high frequency coefficients using PCNN. Experiments show that the algorithm we proposed is effective to image fusion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
