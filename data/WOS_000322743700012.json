This paper studies the opportunistic routing protocols in bus networks to improve the system throughput and reduce the access delay. In this paper, we first propose an end-to-end transmission time (EET)-based opportunistic routing (OR) framework. We then derive 3 EET-based OR protocols, EETOR (EET-based OR), EETMcOR (EET-based OR with MAC contention consideration), and EETCcOR (EET-based OR with congestion control consideration), which consider 3 different EET metrics. EETOR considers the network layer transmission behavior to approximately estimate the EET without the knowledge of the MAC layer; EETMcOR calculates the EET by considering the MAC contention and builds a 3-dimensional Markov chain model to quantize the MAC behavior; and EETCcOR takes the congestion effect into account to evaluate the EET and hence decreases congestion by controlling the MAC layer transmission time. Simulations under a real city environment scenario with a bus mobility model are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our OR protocols.", "paper_title": "End-to-end transmission time-based opportunistic routing protocols for bus networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322743700012"}
