We have been investigating the affect because of its potential application to a handheld, nongrounded, haptic device that can convey a sense of a continuous translational force in one direction. A one-degree-of-freedom haptic device based on a double-layer slider-crank mechanism was constructed based on the results of our previous research. Our results with the new haptic device show that (i) humans perceive directed force sensation by asymmetric oscillation, (ii) 5 counts/s is the best frequency to generate the force sensation, (iii) the ratio of the gross weight of the device and the weight of the reciprocating mass should be at least 16% for effective force perception, and (iv) the force perception is the same with the device held in either hand.
