The solution is obtained by numerically solving the Schrodinger equation. The code supports arbitrary numbers of neutrino flavors including additional sterile neutrinos, CP violation, arbitrary mass hierarchies, matter effects with a configurable continuous Earth model, and takes into account the production height distribution of neutrinos in the Earth's atmosphere.

Computer: IA32/x86-64 compatible. Operating system: All that are supported by SciPy, e.g., Linux, Windows, OS X. RAM: 134217728 bytes Classification: 1.1, 11.1, 11.6. External routines: NumPy (1.5.1 or newer), SciPy (0.8.0 or newer) Nature of problem: Calculation of oscillation probabilities of neutrinos that originate in cosmic-ray interactions in the Earth's atmosphere and propagate through the Earth, for realistic Earth and atmospheric models and multiple flavors (optionally including sterile neutrinos and CP violation). Solution method: Direct solution of the Schrodinger equation for n flavors including matter effects, with sampling of the atmosphere. Restrictions: Energy loss and absorption of neutrinos inside the Earth is not modeled; they have to be handled independently. Unusual features: Completely configurable oscillation parameters (including optional sterile flavors), configurable and realistic Earth model including atmosphere. Running time: Roughly 100 neutrinos per second and CPU core (depends on energy and oscillation parameters). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
