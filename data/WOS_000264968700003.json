The architecture utilizes a collection of context switchable processing elements (PEs). This enables time multiplexing of nodes in the model onto available PEs. A streaming memory system is designed to enable high-throughput computation and efficient use of memory resources. Several scheduling algorithms were examined to efficiently assign network nodes to the PEs. Multiple parallel FPGA-accelerated implementations were evaluated on a Cray XD1. Networks of varying complexity were tested and indicate that hardware acceleration can provide an average throughput gain of 184 times over equivalent parallel software implementations.
