In this paper, we attempt to utilize the unlabeled data to aid plant leaf and palmprint classification task with the limited number of the labeled plant leaf or palmprint data, and propose a semi-supervised locally discriminant projection (SSLDP) algorithm for plant leaf and palmprint classification. By making use of both labeled and unlabeled data in learning a transformation for dimensionality reduction, the proposed method can overcome the small-sample-size (SSS) problem under the situation where labeled data are scant. In SSLDP, the labeled data points, combined with the unlabeled data ones, are used to construct the within-class and between-class weight matrices incorporating the neighborhood information of the data set. The experiments on plant leaf and palmprint databases demonstrate that SSLDP is effective and feasible for plant leaf and palmprint classification. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
