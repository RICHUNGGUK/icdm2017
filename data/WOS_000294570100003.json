An accurate estimation of the background is only possible if we locate the moving objects. Meanwhile, a correct motion detection is achieved if we have a good available background model. The key of our joint approach is to define a single random process that can take two types of values, instead of defining two different processes, one symbolic (motion detection) and one numeric (background intensity estimation). It thus allows to exploit the (spatio-temporal) interaction between a decision (motion detection) and an estimation (intensity reconstruction) problem. Consequently, the meaning of solving both tasks jointly, is to obtain a single optimal estimate of such a process. The intrinsic interaction and simultaneity between both problems is shown to be better modeled within the so-called mixed-state statistical framework, which is extended here to account for symbolic states and conditional random fields. Experiments on real sequences and comparisons with existing motion detection methods support our proposal. Further implications for video sequence inpainting will be also discussed.", "paper_title": "Simultaneous Motion Detection and Background Reconstruction with a Conditional Mixed-State Markov Random Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000294570100003"}
