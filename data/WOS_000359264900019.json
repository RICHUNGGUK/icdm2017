The second heart sound includes aortic (A2) and pulmonic (P2) closure sounds. However, the split detection is obscured due to A2-P2 overlap and low energy of P2. To identify such split, HVD method is used to decompose the S2 into a number of components while preserving the phase information. Further, A2s and P2s are localized using smoothed pseudo Wigner-Ville distribution followed by reassignment method. Finally, the split is calculated by taking the differences between the means of time indices of A2s and P2s. Experiments on total 33 clips of S2 signals are performed for evaluation of the method. The mean +/- standard deviation of the split is 34.7 +/- 4.6 ms. The method measures the split efficiently, even when A2-P2 overlap is <= 20 ms and the normalized peak temporal ratio of P2 to A2 is low (>= 0.22). This proposed method thus, demonstrates its robustness by defining split detectability (SDT), the split detection aptness through detecting P2s, by measuring upto 96 percent. Such findings reveal the effectiveness of the method as competent against the other baselines, especially for A2-P2 overlaps and low energy P2.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Measurement of Split of the Second Heart Sound (S2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000359264900019"}
