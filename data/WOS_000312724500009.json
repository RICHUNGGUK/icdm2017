We show that we are able to define a typing system for the pi-calculus, which guarantees that every well-typed term is strongly normalizing. This typing system is an extension of that presented in [30] since it is able to type more terms than that presented there.", "paper_title": "Strong Normalization in the pi-calculus with Intersection and Union Types", "paper_id": "WOS:000312724500009"}
