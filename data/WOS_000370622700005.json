In order to improve the efficiency and accuracy of service clustering, this paper uses the self-join operation in relational database (RDB) to realize Web service clustering. Based on storing service information, it does the self-join operation towards the Input, Output, Precondition, Effect (IOPE) tables of Web services, which can enhance the efficiency of computing services similarity. The semantic reasoning relationship between concepts and the concept status path are used to do the calculation, which can improve the calculation accuracy. Finally, we use experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Web Service Clustering Using Relational Database Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000370622700005"}
