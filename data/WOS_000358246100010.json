First, an extensive analysis of various methods based on pixel-wise and histogram similarities are conducted on a specific railway route. Then, a fusing stage is introduced which combines least correlated approaches also considering the performance upgrade after fusing. Then, the resulting method is tested on a larger database collected from a different railway route. After observing repeated successes, the method is implemented on NI LabVIEW and run real-time with a high-speed 3-D camera placed under a railway carriage designed for railway quality inspection.", "paper_title": "Railway Fastener Inspection by Real-Time Machine Vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000358246100010"}
