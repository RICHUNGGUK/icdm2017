Compared with the wire-line internet environment, mobile networks have lower bandwidth, longer transmission latency and unreliable connection, and the capability of mobile terminals is restricted by the limited memory size, lower CPU computation capability and inconvenient I/O interface. These limitations restrict the development of the wireless internet applications. In this paper, we design and implement a 'wireless internet remote access platform' (WIRAP). The WIRAP platform interconnects the wireless network and internet to provide mobile users a remote centralized storage and computation environment. A mobile user can store large volume of data and execute complex computations on WIRAP instead of on the mobile terminals. WIRAP supports different network interfaces (e.g. short message service (SMS), wireless markup language (WML) and hyper text markup language (HTML) and users may use terminals (with different network capabilities) to access WIRAP.
