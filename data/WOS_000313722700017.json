Based on the switched-capacitor technique, the circuit offers an advantage in terms of simplicity resulting from the use of only two matched current sources, an operational amplifier with relaxed specifications and a transconductor that is a replica of the filter transconductors. Despite the simplicity of the scheme, the accuracy of the system is less than 1 % of frequency error. The circuit has been designed in a 0.5 mu m CMOS technology with a 3.3 V power supply and simulation results confirm the suitability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Compact SC frequency tuning circuit for continuous-time Gm-C filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700017"}
