Reliability analysis for sequential logic circuits using these methods would be inaccurate because of existence of loops in their architecture. In this paper a new method based on conversion of sequential circuit to combinational one and applying an iterative reliability analysis is developed. A Monte Carlo method-based reliability analysis is introduced for sequential circuits, which is used for first method validation. Experimental results demonstrate good accuracy of the method.", "paper_title": "SEQUENTIAL LOGIC CIRCUITS RELIABILITY ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000308948300005"}
