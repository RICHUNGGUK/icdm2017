It is a reverse process and is very useful especially when that particular object original data is missing without doing any backup. Hence, by doing so, the data can be recollected and can be stored for future purposes. The type of data can be in the form of structure or unstructured points. The accuracy of the reconstructed result should be concerned because if the result is incorrect, hence it will not exactly same like the original shape of the object. Therefore, suitable methods should be chosen based on the data used. Soft computing methods also have been used in the reconstruction field. This papers highlights the previous researches and methods that has been used in the surface reconstruction field.", "paper_title": "Surface reconstruction techniques: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000335980100003"}
