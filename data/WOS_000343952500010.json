In this research, we explored and presented empirical evidence on the key benefits of and barriers to, the use of CPM systems through a survey of 283 organisations across North America and China. We identified three key benefits (strategy execution, process efficiency, and fact-based decision-making) and ten inhibiting barriers under respective project and organisational dimensions. Moreover, we found that in regard to the use of CPM systems, Chinese organisations perceived higher benefits, as well as higher barriers, than did their counterparts in North America. The socio-cultural differences between the two regions explain these issues. The research findings are useful for multinational organisations that are planning, or are in the process of implementing or reviewing their CPM systems, as well as for consulting companies that are assisting with such systems implementation in different regions.", "paper_title": "BENEFITS AND BARRIERS TO CORPORATE PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000343952500010"}
