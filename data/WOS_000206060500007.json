The objective is to maximize the network capacity, i.e. maximize the number of messages routed successfully by the network without any knowledge of future disjoint path connection request arrivals and generation rates. Specifically, in this paper we first present two centralized on-line algorithms for the problem. One is based on maximizing local network lifetime, which aims to minimize the transmission energy consumption, under the constraint that the local network lifetime is no less than gamma times of the optimum after the realization of each disjoint path connection request, where gamma is constant with 0 < gamma <= 1. Another is based oil the exponential function of energy utilization at nodes, and the competitive ratio of this latter algorithm is also analyzed if admission control mechanism is employed. We then conduct extensive experiments by simulations to analyze the performance of the proposed algorithms, in terms of network capacity, network lifetime, and the transmission energy consumption for each disjoint path connection request. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms outperform those existing algorithms that do not take into account the power load balancing at nodes in terms of maximizing the network capacity.
