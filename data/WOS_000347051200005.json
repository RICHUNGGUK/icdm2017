In particular, the graph is disconnected if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues equal to zero. Cheeger's inequality and its variants provide an approximate version of the latter fact; they state that a graph has a sparse cut if and only if there are at least two eigenvalues that are close to zero. It has been conjectured that an analogous characterization holds for higher multiplicities: There are k eigenvalues close to zero if and only if the vertex set can be partitioned into k subsets, each defining a sparse cut. We resolve this conjecture positively. Our result provides a theoretical justification for clustering algorithms that use the bottom k eigenvectors to embed the vertices into R-k, and then apply geometric considerations to the embedding. We also show that these techniques yield a nearly optimal quantitative connection between the expansion of sets of size nI k and 4, the kth smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian, where n is the number of vertices. In particular, we show that in every graph there are at least k/2 disjoint sets (one of which will have size at most 2n/k), each having expansion at most O(root lambda(k) logk). Louis, Raghavendra, Tetali, and Vempala have independently proved a slightly weaker version of this last result. The root log k bound is tight, up to constant factors, for the \"noisy hypercube\" graphs.
