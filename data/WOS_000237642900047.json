Observing the fact that the previous approaches of neighbor search may possibly sample severely biased neighbors in a set of unevenly distributed points, an elliptic Gabriel graph has recently been proposed. By extending the influence region from a circle to an ellipse, the elliptic Gabriel graph generalizes the ordinary Gabriel graph. Hence, the skewness in the sampled neighbors is rather reduced. In this paper, we present a simple observation which allows to compute the correct elliptic Gabriel graph efficiently by reducing the search space.", "paper_title": "Efficient computation of elliptic Gabriel graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900047"}
