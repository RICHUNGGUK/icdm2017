However, due to their increasing popularity, P2P live streaming systems may be the target of user opportunistic actions and malicious attacks, which may greatly reduce streaming rate or even stop it completely. In this article, we focus on a specific type of attack called content pollution, in which malicious peers tamper or forge media data, introducing fake content before uploading it to their partners in the overlay network. Specifically, we present a new decentralized reputation system, named SimplyRep, that quickly identifies and penalizes content polluters, while incurring in low overhead in terms of bandwidth consumption. We evaluate our method with both simulation and experiments in PlanetLab, comparing it against two previously proposed approaches, namely, a centralized black list and a distributed reputation system, in various scenarios. Our results indicate that SimplyRep greatly outperforms the two alternatives considered. In particular, both black list and the distributed reputation method perform poorly when polluters act jointly in a collusion attack, reaching a data retransmission overhead (triggered by polluted chunks received) of 70% and 30%, respectively, whereas the overhead experienced by SimplyRep is at most 2%. Our results also show that SimplyRep is able to quickly isolate almost all polluters under a dissimulation attack, being also somewhat robust to a whitewashing attack, although the latter remains a challenge to effective P2P streaming.
