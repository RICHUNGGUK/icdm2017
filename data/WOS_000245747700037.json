In this model, the management implication of high precision setting involving in the Six Sigma- Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve and Control ( DMAIC) processes is employed to construct the evaluation framework. The original 2-tuple fuzzy linguistic representation model is modified as the proposed model to provide the aggregation algorithm toward ensuring the consistent property. In this study, the Delphi method is used to precisely integrate the experts' opinions on criterion selection, weighting identification and performance appraisal that are realistically expressed by fuzzy linguistic variables. The modified 2-tuple FLC technique is formed by utilizing a geometric operator and a couple of new symbol translation functions to aggregate precisely the 2-tuple terms involved. Finally, in the case verification, two representatives of the mechanical firms in Taiwan are selected as the target firms to verify the capability of the proposed model. To show the superiority, a comparative analysis on the results obtained using the modified model and the original model is presented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
