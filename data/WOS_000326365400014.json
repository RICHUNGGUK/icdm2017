Our method differentiates from other related algorithms mainly on the following three aspects. Firstly, our algorithm sufficiently utilizes the point information around the considered hole for each prediction by constructing point correspondences on both sides of the boundary curve of the hole; secondly, the missing points in the hole region are predicted by the algorithm of differential evolution (DE), which is used to obtain the topological and geometrical structures of the mesh in the hole region; thirdly, operations of mesh optimization are adopted for improving the quality of the obtained triangulation mesh. Numerical results on kinds of holes with complex shape and large curvature, and a comparison with two recently proposed algorithms verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, further experiments on the noisy data points illustrate the robustness of the algorithm against noise.
