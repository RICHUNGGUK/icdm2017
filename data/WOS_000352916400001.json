Namely, the package includes routines that perform emulation, calibration and validation of this type of models. The methodology is Bayesian and is essentially that of Bayarri, Berger, Paulo, Sacks, Cafeo, Cavendish, Lin, and Tu (2007). The package is available through the Comprehensive R Archive Network. We illustrate its use with a real data example and in the context of a simulated example.", "paper_title": "SAVE: An R Package for the Statistical Analysis of Computer Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000352916400001"}
