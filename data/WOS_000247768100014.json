This formulation is an extension of the non-linear GBT recently derived by the authors, which was valid for uniformly compressed members only. In order to illustrate the application of the proposed non-linear GBT, a beam finite element is formulated and some numerical results are presented and discussed. These results concern rectangular plates and thin-walled hat-section beams. The material instantaneous elastic moduli are determined on the basis of both the well known J(2)-flow and J(2)-deformation small strain plasticity theories.
