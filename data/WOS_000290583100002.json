GPS positioning errors occur from the cumulative effects of receiver, satellite and atmosphere, and also due to the U. S. military intentionally such as Selective Availability (SA). In order to improve the accuracy of positions provided by GPS additional correction information may be used, such as Differential GPS (DGPS) or other sensors to enhance position reliability. The DGPS has the problem of slow updates. To overcome this limitation, DGPS corrections prediction has been proposed. The ability of Neural Networks (NNs) to discover nonlinear relationships in input data makes them ideal for modeling nonlinear dynamic systems. The Wavelet Neural Network (WNN) employing nonlinear wavelet basis function, which are localized in both the time and frequency space, has been developed as an alternative approach to nonlinear fitting problem. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a global optimization method, is used to train the WNN. In this paper, a WNN trained by a PSO algorithm is proposed for DGPS corrections prediction in single-frequency GPS receivers. Experimental results show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method. The results are analyzed and compared with WNN trained by Back Propagation (BP) algorithm. The experimental results show that WNN, trained by the PSO algorithm, is able to reduce RMS errors to less than 1 m with SA on and 0.6 m with SA off.", "paper_title": "Wavelet Neural Network for Corrections Prediction in Single-Frequency GPS Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000290583100002"}
