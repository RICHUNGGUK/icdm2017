The preamplifier is based on a resistive shunt-feedback topology, is power-optimized and employs two different frequency compensation techniques, phantom zeros and shunt-peaking. The circuit is designed in a 1.8 V 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. Experimental results report a transresistance of 58 dB Omega and a bandwidth of 1.5 GHz, respectively. Eye diagrams obtained at 2.5 Gb/s show a total jitter of 18 ps and a bit error rate (BER) of 10(-12) when the input current amplitude (I(in)) is equal to or higher than 8.5 mu A. Higher bit rates up to 3 Gb/s also have been tested achieving a BER of 10(-12) when I(in) >= 9.5 mu A. The power consumption and die active area are 23.7 mW and 0.017 mm(2), respectively.", "paper_title": "2.5 Gb/s CMOS preamplifier for low-cost fiber-optic receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000287319400005"}
