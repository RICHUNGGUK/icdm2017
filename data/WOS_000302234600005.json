This paper addresses the problem of blind channel identification in (2 x 1) Alamouti coded systems. Under the assumption of independent symbol substreams, the channel can be estimated from the eigendecomposition of matrices composed of second- or higher-order statistics (cumulants) of the received signal. The so-called joint approximate diagonalization of eigenmatrices (JADE) method for blind source separation via independent component analysis is optimal in that it tries to simultaneously diagonalize a full set of fourth-order cumulant matrices. To reduce computational complexity, we perform the eigenvalue decomposition of a single cumulant matrix, which is judiciously chosen by maximizing its expected eigenvalue spread. Simulation results show that the resulting technique outperforms existing blind Alamouti channel estimation methods and achieves a performance close to JADE's at a fraction of the computational cost.
