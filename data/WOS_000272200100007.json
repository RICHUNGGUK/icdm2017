By an extension of the Lyapunov method, we are able to include neural systems with multiple nonnegative periodic solutions and nonexponential convergence rate in our model and also include the Lotka-Volterra system, an important prototype of competitive neural networks, as a special case. The stability criteria for autonomous systems then follow as a corollary. Two numerical examples are provided to show that the limiting equilibrium or periodic solution need not be positive.", "paper_title": "Asymptotic Behavior of Periodic Cohen-Grossberg Neural Networks with Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000272200100007"}
