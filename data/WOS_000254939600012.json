Only authors associated with monographs are treated. So, author productivity of monographs that has not been widely researched is empirically examined to determine conformity or nonconformity to Lotka's law. A random sample of 1.600 Slovenian authors is drawn from the authority file CONOR. Next, the authors are searched in COBIB and each attributed the number of monographs. Using the formula: x(n) y = c, the values of the exponent n and the constant c are computed and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test is applied. The paper shows that the author productivity distribution predicted by Lotka also holds for the occurrences of personal name headings in COBIB.", "paper_title": "Personal name headings in COBIB: Testing Lotka's Law", "paper_id": "WOS:000254939600012"}
