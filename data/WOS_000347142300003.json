Such explicit input from customers suffers from several types of bias, which directly affect the quality of the resulting recommender system. Recent research has identified sequential bias to be present in online customer reviews. However, to our knowledge, no study to date has confirmed its existence in this context. Given the nature of sequential bias, confirming its existence necessitates a controlled experimental study, which is lacking in extant published literature. We attempt to address this gap. Results from our study show evidence for the existence of sequential bias. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
