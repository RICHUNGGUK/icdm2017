Their analysis and editing can lead to vivid appearance of shapes and better understanding of the underlying geometry for shape processing and analysis. Traditional mesh smoothing techniques mainly focus on noise filtering and they cannot distinguish different scales of features well, even mixing them up. We present an efficient method to process different scale geometric features based on a novel rolling-guidance normal filter. Given a 3D mesh, our method iteratively applies a joint bilateral filter to face normals at a specified scale, which empirically smooths small-scale geometric features while preserving large-scale features. Our method recovers the mesh from the filtered face normals by a modified Poisson-based gradient deformation that yields better surface quality than existing methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method on a series of geometry processing tasks, including geometry texture removal and enhancement, coating transfer, mesh segmentation and level-of-detail meshing.", "paper_title": "Rolling Guidance Normal Filter for Geometric Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000363671200010"}
