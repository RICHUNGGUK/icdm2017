We give tight lower bounds on the round and communication complexities of any fully black-box reduction of a statistically hiding commitment scheme from one-way permutations and from trapdoor permutations. As a corollary, we derive similar tight lower bounds for several other cryptographic protocols, such as single-server private information retrieval, interactive hashing, and oblivious transfer that guarantees statistical security for one of the parties. Our techniques extend the collision-finding oracle due to Simon [Advances in Cryptology-EUROCRYPT'98, Lecture Notes in Comput. Sci. 1403, Springer, Berlin, 1998, pp. 334-345] to the setting of interactive protocols and the reconstruction paradigm of Gennaro and Trevisan [Proceedings of the 41st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), IEEE Press, Piscataway, NJ, 2000, pp. 305-313].", "paper_title": "FINDING COLLISIONS IN INTERACTIVE PROTOCOLS-TIGHT LOWER BOUNDS ON THE ROUND AND COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITIES OF STATISTICALLY HIDING COMMITMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000353967100007"}
