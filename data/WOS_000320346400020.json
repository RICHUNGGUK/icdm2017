This work presents an integrative tool, called GREMET, for the prediction of alterations in gene splicing regulation inferred by mutations of the human genome. GREMET supports the characterization of mutations either single-point or indels with respect to their effect on the splicing potential of the neighboring sequences and the binding strength of auxiliary cis-acting splicing enhancers. In addition, GREMET identifies possible consequences of mutations on the DNA methylation through the disruption or creation of CpG sequences. Besides locus-specific mutations, GREMET performs the analyses on newly identified mutations and provides an easy-to-use Web interface helping researchers to save time in routine mutation analyses.
