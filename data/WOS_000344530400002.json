Our method relies on the use of the satisfiability modulo theory (SMT) solver to search for alternative implementations that are mathematically equivalent but require a smaller bit-width, or implementations that use the same bit-width but have a larger error-free dynamic range. Our systematic search of the bounded implementation space is based on a new inductive synthesis procedure, which is guaranteed to find a valid solution as long as such solution exists. Furthermore, we propose an incremental optimization procedure, which applies the synthesis procedure only to small code regions-one at a time-as opposed to the entire program, which is crucial for scaling the method up to programs of realistic size and complexity. We have implemented our new method in a software tool based on the Clang/LLVM compiler frontend and the Yices SMT solver. Our experiments, conducted on a set of representative benchmarks from embedded control and digital signal processing applications, show that the method is both effective and efficient in optimizing arithmetic computations in embedded software code.", "paper_title": "An SMT Based Method for Optimizing Arithmetic Computations in Embedded Software Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000344530400002"}
