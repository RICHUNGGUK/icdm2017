In this paper, we compiled the performance statistics of each network in terms of TCP and UDP throughput, delay jitters, packet loss rate, and round trip time. Our conclusions show that, in a real large-scale network environment, a minor degradation in the throughput of the TCP, a slightly higher throughput of the UDP, a somewhat emerging frequency of the delay jitter, a lower packet loss rate, and a slightly longer round trip time happens when we compare the IPv6 network to the IPv4 network.
