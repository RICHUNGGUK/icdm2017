In this paper, a human head model extracted from thermal infrared images is examined in terms of its applicability to specific absorption rate (SAR) calculations. Since thermal scans are two-dimensional (2D) representation of surface temperature, this allows researchers to overcome the extensive computational demand associated with 3D simulation. The numerical calculations are performed using the finite-difference time-domain method with mesh sizes of 2 mm at 900 MHz plane wave irradiation. The power density of the incident plane wave is assumed to be 10W/m(2). Computations were compared with a realistic anatomical head model. The results show that although there were marked differences in the local SAR distribution in the various tissues in the two models, the 1 g peak SAR values are approximately similar in the two models.", "paper_title": "New head models extracted from thermal infrared (IR) images for dosimetry computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000299433600009"}
