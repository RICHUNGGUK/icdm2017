In all cases, we have to deal with bimodal optimization. The nonlinear system of differential equations is solved numerically. A first integral (Hamiltonian) is used to monitor the accuracy of integration. New numerical results are obtained, and comparison with some previously known cases is given, showing efficiency and accuracy of the suggested method.", "paper_title": "Application of Pontryagin's principle to bimodal optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000260784200001"}
