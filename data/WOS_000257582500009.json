Basically, this comparison process combines a widely accepted interpretation of fuzzy sets together with the uncertain characteristics inherent in the representation of fuzzy numbers. The proposed comparison relation is then applied to the issue of ranking fuzzy numbers using fuzzy targets in terms of target-based evaluations. Some numerical examples are used to illuminate the proposed ranking technique as well as to compare with previous methods. More interestingly, according to the interpretation of the new comparison relation on fuzzy numbers, we provide a fuzzy target-based decision model as a solution to the problem of decision making under uncertainty, with which an interesting link between the decision maker's different attitudes about target and different risk attitudes in terms of utility functions can be established. Moreover, an application of the proposed comparison relation to the fuzzy target-based decision model for the problem of fuzzy decision making with uncertainty is provided. Numerical examples are also given for illustration.", "paper_title": "A probability-based approach to comparison of fuzzy numbers and applications to target-oriented decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000257582500009"}
