For accurate 3D mapping even in GPS-denied environments, we have designed a lightweight 3D laser scanner specifically for the application on MAVs. Similar to other custom-built 3D laser scanners composed of a rotating 2D laser range finder, it exhibits different point densities within and between individual scan lines. When rotated fast, such non-uniform point densities influence neighborhood searches which in turn may negatively affect local feature estimation and scan registration. We present a complete pipeline for 3D mapping including pair-wise registration and global alignment of such non-uniform density 3D point clouds acquired in-flight. For registration, we extend a state-of-the-art registration algorithm to include topological information from approximate surface reconstructions. For global alignment, we use a graph-based approach making use of the same error metric and iteratively refine the complete vehicle trajectory. In experiments, we show that our approach can compensate for the effects caused by different point densities up to very low angular resolutions and that we can build accurate and consistent 3D maps in-flight with a micro aerial vehicle.
