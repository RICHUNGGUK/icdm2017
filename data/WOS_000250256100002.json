For a location x, the value of the new objective function is the ordered weighted average of the absolute deviations from the average distance from the facilities to the location x. Several kinds of networks are studied: cyclic, tree and path networks and, for each of them, the properties of the objective function are analyzed in order to identify a finite dominating set for optimal locations. Polynomial-time algorithms are proposed for these problems, and the corresponding complexity is discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
