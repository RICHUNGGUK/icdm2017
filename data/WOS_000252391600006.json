By enabling local inspection information to be used beyond local supplier decisions and by integrating it with other suppliers' inspection information, an enterprise can garner better sub-assembly and supplier-matching decisions. An inspection information exchange architecture that enables best-matching has been developed. A parallel computer-based simulation using the teamwork integration evaluator (TIE 1.1) showed that a multiple-file-input logic had a relatively shorter processing time, exchange and handling time, than the pairwise-file-input logic for best-matching processes. The information exchange architecture enabled the comparison of suppliers based on quality of parts and cost to manufacture and aided in selecting the supplier, which better meets the needs of the customer. An Information Exchange Protocol: (1) enables better information exchange among manufacturing functions and (2) provides a decision-making tool for part dimensionality control. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
