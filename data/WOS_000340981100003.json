Different types of tractability have been used, such as polynomial tractability and weak tractability and others. These tractability types, however, do not express the complexity with respect to the number of bits of accuracy. We introduce two new tractability types, polylog tractability and In-kappa -weak tractability. A problem is polylog tractable if its complexity is polynomial in d and in ln epsilon(-1), while a problem is In-kappa -weakly tractable iff its complexity is not exponential in d and ln(kappa) epsilon(-1), for some kappa >= 1. We study general multivariate problems and multivariate tensor product problems. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the respective tractability types. Moreover, we show that a multivariate tensor product problem cannot be polylog tractable and cannot be ln(1) -weakly tractable (i.e., with kappa = 1) unless it is trivial. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
