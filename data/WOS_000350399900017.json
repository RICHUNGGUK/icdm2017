A characterization of the class of sample points for which the theorem holds is given. Such points are given the name of Doob random points. It is shown that a point is Doob random if its tail is computably random in a certain sense. Moreover, Doob randomness is strictly weaker than computable randomness and is incomparable with Schnorr randomness.", "paper_title": "ALGORITHMIC RANDOMNESS FOR DOOB'S MARTINGALE CONVERGENCE THEOREM IN CONTINUOUS TIME", "paper_id": "WOS:000350399900017"}
