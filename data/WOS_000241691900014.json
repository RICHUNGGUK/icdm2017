We describe a uniform (and complete) translation of these problems into distributed games problems. We prove the correctness of this translation and we also obtain, in this setting, a characterization of distributed architectures with decidable synthesis problems. It shall be noted that, as opposed to former approaches, zero-delay semantics requires a specific treatment for modeling instantaneous value propagation. Moreover, cyclic dependencies with zero-delay semantics involve equations with potentially many solutions. Accordingly, several variants of the distributed synthesis problem are proposed and studied.", "paper_title": "On distributed program specification and synthesis in architectures with cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000241691900014"}
