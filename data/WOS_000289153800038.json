Firstly a convex combination of every quantum state rho in terms of a state C-rho with the same rank and another one E-rho with lower rank is perfomed, with weights 1 - lambda(rho) and lambda(rho), respectively. Secondly a scalar lambda(rho)* is computed. Then rho is separable if, and only if, lambda(rho) <= lambda(rho)*. The computation of lambda(rho)* has been undergone under the simplest choice for C-rho as a product matrix and E-rho being a pure state, valid for any bipartite and multipartite system in arbitrary dimensions. A necessary condition is also formulated when E-rho is not pure in the bipartite case.", "paper_title": "SEPARABILITY: A NEW APPROACH FROM THE CONIC STRUCTURE OF POSITIVE OPERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289153800038"}
