In this paper, we give detailed mathematical analysis on two versions of the restart algorithms. By deriving analytic expressions of the expected convergence time and the success rate, we illustrate why the restart algorithms work well and gain insights into the proper use of restarting. Numerical simulations are performed on the XOR problem, symmetry detection, parity problem and Arabic numeral recognition. We show the effectiveness of the restart algorithms, and compare them with simulated annealing. The analysis can also be applied to many other fields. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
