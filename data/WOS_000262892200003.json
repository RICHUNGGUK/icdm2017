As such a mechanism, skyline queries have recently attracted a lot of attention for its intuitive query formulation. This intuitiveness, however, has a side effect of retrieving too many results, especially for high-dimensional data. This paper is to support personalized skyline queries as identifying \"truly interesting\" objects based on user-specific preference and retrieval size k. In particular, we abstract personalized skyline ranking as a dynamic search over skyline subspaces guided by user-specific preference. We then develop a novel algorithm navigating on a compressed structure itself, to reduce the storage overhead. Furthermore, we also develop novel techniques to interleave cube construction with navigation for some scenarios without a priori structure. Finally, we extend the proposed techniques for user-specific preferences including equivalence preference. Our extensive evaluation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms on both real-life and synthetic data. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
