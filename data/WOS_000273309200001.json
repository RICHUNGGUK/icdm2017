Models of these processes have contributed to understand excitability self-sustained oscillations and synchronization in arrays of oscillators. Integrate-and-fire (I+F) models are popular minimal fill-and-flush mathematical models. They are used in neuroscience to study spiking and phase locking in single neuron membranes, large scale neural networks, and in a variety of applications in physics and electrical engineering. We show here how the classical first-order I+F model fits into the theory of nonlinear oscillators of van der Pol type by demonstrating that a particular second-order oscillator having small parameters converges in a singular perturbation limit to the I+F model. In this sense, our study provides a novel unfolding of such models and it identifies a constructible electronic circuit that is closely related to I+F.", "paper_title": "Unfolding an electronic integrate-and-fire circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000273309200001"}
