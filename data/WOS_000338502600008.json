Yet, ArchiMate currently lacks (1) expressivity in modelling an enterprise from a value exchange perspective, and (2) rigour and guidelines in modelling business processes that realize the transactions relevant from a value perspective. To address these issues, we show how to connect e value, a technique for value modelling, to ArchiMate via transaction patterns from the DEMO methodology. Using ontology alignment techniques, we show a transformation between the meta models underlying e value, DEMO and ArchiMate. Furthermore, we present a step-wise approach that shows how this model transformation is achieved and, in doing so, we also show the of such a transformation. We exemplify the transformation of DEMO and e value into ArchiMate by means of a case study in the insurance industry. As a proof of concept, we present a software tool supporting our transformation approach. Finally, we discuss the functionalities and limitations of our approach; thereby, we analyze its and practical applicability.", "paper_title": "Bridging value modelling to ArchiMate via transaction modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000338502600008"}
