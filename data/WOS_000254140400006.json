Based on formulations originally proposed in the 1960s for combining decision rules and problem constraints, such as the surrogate constraint method, scatter search uses strategies for combining solution vectors that have proved effective in a variety of problem settings. We present a scatter-search implementation designed to find high-quality solutions for the 3D image-registration problem, which has many practical applications. This problem arises in computer vision applications when finding a correspondence or transformation between two computer images obtained under different conditions. Our implementation goes beyond a simple exercise on applying scatter search, by incorporating innovative mechanisms to combine and improve solutions and to create a balance between intensification and diversification in the reference set. Furthermore, heuristic information taken from a preprocessing of the images is incorporated into the algorithm to improve its performance. Our computational experimentation tackling two different medical registration applications establishes the effectiveness of scatter search in relation to different approaches usually applied to solving the problem. We have considered both simulated magnetic resonance images and real-world computerized tomography images as data sets. To measure the robustness of our proposal, the image data sets are intentionally selected for addressing registration environments with the presence of noise, anatomical lesions, and occlusions between images.", "paper_title": "Scatter search for the point-matching problem in 3D image registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000254140400006"}
