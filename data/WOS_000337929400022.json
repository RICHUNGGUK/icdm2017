present an extended version of GLISSANDO, a Monte-Carlo generator for Glauber-like models of the initial stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The increased functionality of the code incorporates a parametrization of shape of nuclei, including light nuclei needed in the NA61 experiment, the nuclear deformation, a possibility of using correlated distributions of nucleons in nuclei read from external files, an option of overlaying distributions of produced particles dependent on the space time rapidity, the inclusion of the core corona effect, or the output of the source distributions that can be used in event-byevent hydrodynamics. Together with other features, such as incorporation of various variants of Glauber models, or the implementation of a realistic NN collision profile, the generator offers a realistic and practical approach to describe the early phase of the collision in 3+1 dimensions; the predictions may later be used in modeling the intermediate evolution phase, e.g., with hydrodynamics. The software is integrated with the ROOT platform. The supplied scripts compute and plot numerous features of the distributions, such as the multiplicity distributions and centrality classes, harmonic asymmetry coefficients and their correlations, forward backward correlations, etc. The code can also be used for the proton nucleus and deuteron nucleus collisions. Program summary Program title: GLISSANDO 2 ver. 2.702 Catalog identifier: AEBS_v2_0 Program summary URL: http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/summaries/AEBS_v2_0.html Program obtainable from: CPC Program Library, Queen's University, Belfast, N. Ireland Licensing provisions: Standard CPC license, http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 41067 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 454358 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: C++ with the ROOT libraries. Computer: Any computer with a C++ compiler and the ROOT environment (optionally with doxygen), tested with Intel Xeon X5650, 2.67 GHz, 2 GB RAM. Operating system: Linux Ubuntu 7.04-12.04 (gcc 4.1.3-4.6.3), Scientific Linux CERN 5.10 (gcc 4.1.2), ROOT ver. 5.28-5.34/09. RAM: Below 120 MB Classification: 17.8. Catalog identifier of previous version: AEBS_v1_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput Phys. Comm. 180(2009)69 External routines: ROOT (http://root.cern.ch/drupal/) Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes, however the functionality of GLISSANDO 2 and the format of the input and output files is down-compatible with the original version. Nature of problem: Glauber models of the initial state in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Solution method: Glauber Monte-Carlo simulation of collision events, analyzed with ROOT. Reasons for new version: This is an updated and largely enhanced version of the program GLISSANDO. The structure of the C++ code has been simplified and the organization of the package is restructured. Summary of revisions: The new features implemented in GLISSANDO 2 include: \" Parametrization of shape of all typical nuclei, including light nuclei. This is useful in applications for the NA61 experiment, where the mass-number scan will be carried out. o Inclusion of the deformation of the colliding nuclei. In particular, the deformation effects are relevant for the collisions involving the deformed Au and U nuclei recently used at RHIC. o Possibility of using correlated distributions of nucleons in nuclei, which may be read-in from external files prepared earlier with other codes. Certainly, the two-body correlations are important, as they influence the fluctuations. o Generalization of the NN collision profile a shape which interpolates between the step function and a Gaussian profile. Such an extension is relevant for the collisions at the LHC energies, allowing reproduction of the measured values of both the total and elastic NN cross sections. \" Inclusion of the negative binomial overlaid distribution (in addition to the Poissonian and Gamma distributions). \" Possibility of overlaying distributions of the produced particles which depend on the space-time rapidity. This feature extends the model into a fully 3 + 1 dimensional tool. \" Inclusion of the core-corona effect. \" A doxygen-generated reference manual is available, which is useful for those who wish to alter the code for their needs. Additional comments: Optional software doxygen (http://www.stack.nl/climitri/doxygen/) Running time: 80 s/10,000 events for the wounded-nucleon model and 100 s/10,000 events for the mixed model with the r distribution, minimum-bias Pb + Pb collisions and hard-sphere wounding profile. A typical highstatistics \"physics\" run with 500,000 events takes about 1 h. The use of the Gaussian wounding profile increases the time by about a factor of 2.
