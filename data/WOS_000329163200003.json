In this study, a low-voltage power cable is tested under 2 different environments, air and water, and the variations in temperature are measured for the conductor, the sheath parts of the cable, and the environment. The recorded test data are analyzed using such as coherence analysis. This in turn provides the means to determine the relationship among the sheath, conductor, and the environment. In conclusion, high correlated peaks in the frequency domain are used to determine the temperature effect.", "paper_title": "Coherence analysis on thermal effect for power cables under different environmental conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000329163200003"}
