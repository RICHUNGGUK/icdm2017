Currently, introducing native support for XML data in relational database management systems (RDBMs) has attracted considerable interest with a view to leveraging the powerful and reliable data management services provided by RDBMs. Although there is a rich literature on XML-to-relational storage, none of the existing solutions satisfactorily addresses the problem of storing fuzzy XML data in RDBMs. In this paper, we study the methodology of storing and querying fuzzy XML data in relational databases. In particular, we present an edge-based approach to shred fuzzy XML data into relational data. The unique feature of our approach is that no schema information is required for our data storage. On this basis, we present a generic approach to translate path expression queries into SQL for processing XML queries.", "paper_title": "Storing and querying fuzzy XML data in relational databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000323278500011"}
