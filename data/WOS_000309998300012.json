The conceptual framework consists of a combination of three components, namely, gestalt-based electroacoustic composition techniques (sound), user and body-centered spatial exploration (body), and corporeal mediation technology (tools), which are brought together within an existing paradigm of embodied music cognition. The implementation of the conceptual framework is based on an iterative process that involves the development of several use cases. Through this methodology, it is possible to investigate new approaches for structuring and to interactively explore multivariable data through sound.", "paper_title": "An embodied music cognition approach to multilevel interactive sonification", "paper_id": "WOS:000309998300012"}
