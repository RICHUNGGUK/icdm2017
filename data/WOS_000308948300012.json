With respect to the state of the art the co-design of the on-chip antenna with the LNA, and the fast ADC architecture realized as a time-interleaved array of threshold-configuring SAR channels, represent new solutions optimized in terms of power consumption. Complexity and performance results in a 65-nm CMOS SOI technology, suitable also for digital systems integration, are presented. The performance and complexity results of the designed antenna, LNA and ADC are integrated in a system level simulator with those obtained by adopting known solutions for other receiver blocks (mixer, IF and baseband amplifiers and filters, frequency synthesizer) thus estimating the performance achievable with a whole 60GHz receiver and digitization sub-system macrocell. The system-level estimated performances confirm the feasibility of a full-integrated receiver supporting short-range High Definition (HD) connectivity of several Gb/s with a Signal-to-Noise-Ratio compliant with WiGig and Wireless HD new standardization initiatives.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATED 60 GHZ ANTENNA, LNA AND FAST ADC ARCHITECTURE FOR EMBEDDED SYSTEMS WITH WIRELESS GBIT CONNECTIVITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000308948300012"}
