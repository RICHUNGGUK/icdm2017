Thirty chemicals containing a cyclic moiety were profiled for reactivity using the OECD and Optimised Approach based on Structural Indices Set (OASIS) protein binding profilers. The profiling results identified 22 of the chemicals as being reactive towards proteins. Analysis of the experimentally data showed 19 of these chemicals to be reactive. Subsequent analysis allowed refinements to be suggested to improve the applicability domain of the structural alerts investigated. The accurate definition of the applicability domain for structural alerts within in silico profilers is important due to their use in chemical category in predictive and regulatory toxicology.", "paper_title": "Experimental verification of structural alerts for the protein binding of cyclic compounds acting as Michael acceptors", "paper_id": "WOS:000327514800002"}
