A total least squares (TLSs) algorithm is developed by a linear closed-form solution for this problem, and the uncertainty of the sensor location is formulated as a perturbation. The sensitivity of the TLS solution is also analyzed. Simulation results show its improved performance against the classic least squares approaches.", "paper_title": "Total Least Squares Method for Robust Source Localization in Sensor Networks Using TDOA Measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000295644300001"}
