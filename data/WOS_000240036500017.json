This platform-composed of a 8-bit MCU that handles the program flow and a dynamically reconfigurable FPGA that synthesizes an evolvable slave coprocessor to speed up the calculus-provides a balanced control-computing architecture to efficiently process functions as sin(z), cos(z), atan(y/x) and sqrt(x(2)+y(2)). This approach reaches significant area-time optimizations over other traditional software-oriented solutions inspired on powerful stand-alone microprocessors.", "paper_title": "Trigonometric computing embedded in a dynamically reconfigurable CORDIC system-on-chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500017"}
