This paper addresses the issue by combining advanced data mining techniques with the novel application of systems biology t o study axonal regeneration and neurogenesis. To obtain the data for analysis, a series of biological experiments are conducted, in which the rat pheochromocytoma cell PC-12 was used as an appropriate model for neuronal differentiation. The resulting DNA microarray data set is studied using a combination of methods - a statistical procedure for feature selection together with a dimensionality reduction technique. First, we apply feature selection, which can be based either on the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or on the two-sample t-test, depending on the statistical properties of the data. Next, we utilized an efficient dimensionality reduction procedure called correspondence analysis to obtain a two-dimensional projection of the data, which allows us to perform a visual exploration of the patterns as well as to select the features corresponding to the top down-regulated and up-regulated genes.", "paper_title": "Application of the data mining techniques to the systems biology of neuritogenesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000242550300015"}
