These restrictions are based on the synchronized insertion operation, which serves as a model for the gene rearrangement function in certain unicellular organisms. We investigate the classes of circle plus-codes and circle times-codes from a theoretical perspective, examine their relationships with traditional code classes and consider related decidability problems.
