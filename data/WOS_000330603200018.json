The models describe the interaction of the HIV with two classes of target cells, CD4(+) T cells and macrophages. The incidence rate of virus infection is given by the Beddington-DeAngelis functional response. The models have two types of discrete time delay or distributed delay describing the time needed for infection of cell and virus replication. The basic reproduction number R-0 is identified which completely determines the global dynamics of the models. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functionals, we have proven that if R-0 <= 1 then the uninfected steady state is globally asymptotically stable (GAS), and if R-0 > 1 then the infected steady state exists and it is GAS.", "paper_title": "Global dynamics of two target cells HIV infection model with Beddington-DeAngelis functional response and delay-discrete or distributed", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603200018"}
