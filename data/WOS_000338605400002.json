The following list of requirements are taken into account during the definition and setup phase. First, the test case should be geometrically simple which is realized by a classical cylinder flow configuration extended by a flexible structure attached to the backside of the cylinder. Second, clearly defined operating and boundary conditions are a must and put into practice by a constant inflow velocity and channel walls. The latter are also evaluated against a periodic setup relying on a subset of the computational domain. Third, the material model should be widely used. Although a rubber plate is chosen as the flexible structure, it is demonstrated by additional structural tests that a classical St. Venant-Kirchhoff material model is sufficient to describe the material behavior appropriately. Fourth, the flow should be in the turbulent regime, Choosing water as the working fluid and a medium-size water channel, the resulting Reynolds number of Re = 30,470 guarantees a sub-critical cylinder flow with transition taking place in the separated shear layers. Fifth, the test case results should be underpinned by a detailed validation process. Methods: For this purpose complementary numerical and experimental investigations were carried out. Based on optical contactless measuring techniques (particle-image velocimetry and laser distance sensor) the phase-averaged flow field and the structural deformations were determined. These data were compared with corresponding numerical predictions relying on large-eddy simulations and a recently developed semi-implicit predictor-corrector FSI coupling scheme. Outcome: Both results were found to be in close agreement showing a quasi-periodic oscillating flexible structure in the first swiveling FSI mode with a corresponding Strouhal number of about St(FSI) = 0.11.
