In this article, we further the introduction of the CaRBS technique with the development of new measures that quantify the evidential contribution of input variables in terms of the belief that can be assigned to objects being associated with a hypothesis and not-the-hypothesis. The analysis described in the article utilises CaRBS to explore an important management issue: intra-organizational consensus on strategic priorities. Results depicting the contribution of organizational structure, process and environment to the relative degree of strategic consensus within a large public service organization are derived. The efficacy of the introduced measures is then illustrated through comparisons with results from a series of logistic regression and neural network models. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
