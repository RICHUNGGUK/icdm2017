Currently available databases, however, lack query support for multi-level drug information and thus are not designed to support drug repositioning studies. DrugMap Central (DMC), an online tool, is developed to help fill the gap. DMC enables the users to integrate, query, visualize, interrogate, and download multi-level data of known drugs or compounds quickly for drug repositioning studies all within one system.", "paper_title": "DrugMap Central: an on-line query and visualization tool to facilitate drug repositioning studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000321747800027"}
