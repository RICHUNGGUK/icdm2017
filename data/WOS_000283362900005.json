A maximum principle is proved for this kind of partially observable optimal control problems and the corresponding adjoint processes are characterized by the solutions of certain forward-backward stochastic differential equations in finite-dimensional spaces. One partially observed recursive linear-quadratic (LQ) optimal control example is also given to show the application of the obtained maximum principle. An explicit observable optimal control is obtained in this example.", "paper_title": "A maximum principle for partially observed optimal control of forward-backward stochastic control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283362900005"}
