In this paper, an approach to multiresolutional similarity assessment and retrieval of solid models is presented. First the dilation based multiresolutional skeleton of a solid model is defined, which is adopted as the shape descriptor of solid models in the approach; Then the detailed algorithm of generating the proper DBMS of a solid model through multiresolutional dilation is described; After that the methods of multiresolutional matching based on the DBMS graph and the multiresolutional similarity assessment and retrieval of solid models based on multiresolutional matching are presented; Finally some preliminary test results are given.
