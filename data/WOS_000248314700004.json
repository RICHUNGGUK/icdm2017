In these systems, latency is crucial for providing an acceptable quality of service (QoS), since it determines how fast client computers are reported about changes in the shared virtual scene produced by other client computers. This paper presents in a unified manner a partitioning approach for providing a latency below a threshold to the maximum number of users as possible in DVE systems. This partitioning approach searches the assignment of avatars, which represents the best trade-off among system latency, system throughput, and partitioning efficiency when solving the partitioning problem. Evaluation results show that the proposed approach not only maximizes system throughput, but also allows the system to satisfy, if possible, any specific latency requirement needed for providing QoS. This improvement is achieved without decreasing either image resolution or quality of animation, and it can be used together with other techniques already proposed. Therefore, it can contribute to provide QoS in DVEs.", "paper_title": "A latency-aware partitioning method for distributed virtual environment systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314700004"}
