Without compromising the flexibility of workflow, this model can effectively enhance the security control of the user access to the workflow system. Specifically, it provides the corresponding mechanism to maintain the constraint consistency in dynamic management of workflow. We present the basic design and the integrated architecture of the model and discuss an application system that has implemented this new model to manage the business processes of property rights exchange in a government organization in China.", "paper_title": "Flexible workflow incorporated with RBAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800053"}
