The null distribution is usually estimated through a parametric bootstrap. Although very easy to implement, the parametric bootstrap can become very computationally expensive as the sample size, the number of parameters or the dimension of the data increase. It is proposed to approximate the null distribution through a weighted bootstrap. The method is studied both theoretically and numerically. It provides a consistent estimator of the null distribution. In the numerical examples carried out, the estimated type I errors are close to the nominal values. The asymptotic properties are similar to those of the parametric bootstrap but, from a computational point of view, it is more efficient. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
