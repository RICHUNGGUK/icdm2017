Here we address the problem considering material nonlinear behavior. More specifically, we concentrate on hyperelastic models, such as the ones by Hencky, Saint-Venant, Neo-Hookean and Ogden. A unified approach is adopted using the total potential energy concept, i.e., the total potential is used both in the objective function of the optimization problem and also to obtain the equilibrium solution. We proof that the optimization formulation is convex provided that the specific strain energy is strictly convex. Some representative examples are given to demonstrate the features of each model. We conclude by exploring the role of nonlinearities in the overall topology design problem.", "paper_title": "Convex topology optimization for hyperelastic trusses based on the ground-structure approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350897000002"}
