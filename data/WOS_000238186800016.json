Both these models allow the adversary to commit to a set of identities and in the challenge phase choose any one of the previously committed identities. Two constructions of HIBE are presented which are secure in the two models. One of the HIBE constructions supports an unbounded number of levels, i.e., the maximum number of levels does not need to be specified during the set-up. Further, we show that this HIBE can be modified to obtain a multiple receiver IBE which is secure in the selective-ID model without the random oracle assumption.", "paper_title": "Generalization of the selective-ID security model for HIBE protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000238186800016"}
