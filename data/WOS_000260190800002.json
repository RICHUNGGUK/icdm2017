Our algorithm is derived by first introducing the concept of a plain basis for a co-clone and then identifying natural plain bases for every co-clone in Post's lattice. In the process, we also give a quadratic algorithm for the problem of finding the smallest co-clone containing a Boolean relation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
