In this framework, users can conduct data mining using their private information by storing them in their local storage. After the computation, they obtain only the mining result without disclosing private information to others. In most cases, the number of parties that can join conventional privacy-preserving data mining has been assumed to be only two. In our framework, we assume large numbers of parties join the protocol; therefore, not only scalability but also asynchronism and fault-tolerance is important. Considering this, we propose a k-mean algorithm combined with a decentralized cryptographic protocol and a gossip-based protocol. The computational complexity is O(log n) with respect to the number of parties n, and experimental results show that our protocol is scalable even with one million parties.", "paper_title": "Large-scale k-means clustering with user-centric privacy-preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000283510200004"}
