In this paper, we find some disadvantages in their scheme and thereafter propose such an improved scheme that overcomes all those disadvantages existing in their scheme while the merits are left unchanged. Our scheme provides more guarantees in security as follows: (1) our scheme combines two factors to protect its authentication mechanism. (2) our scheme can safely provide mutual authentication and key agreement with more desirable properties. (3) our scheme can provide anonymity for the user's identity. (4) our scheme carries the rigorous proof of the security. And yet, our scheme is simpler and more efficient than Yang et al.'s scheme. Therefore the end result is more practical for the users of mobile devices.", "paper_title": "Practical Remote Mutual Authentication with Key Agreement Scheme for Mobile Devices on Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000305576900004"}
