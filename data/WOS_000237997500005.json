This method consists of two main steps: on the one hand, the recognition and resolution of the temporal expressions that can be transformed on a date, and therefore these dates establish an order between the events that contain them. On the other hand, the detection of temporal signals, for example after, that can not be transformed on a concrete date but relate two events in a chronological way. This event ordering method can be applied to Natural Language Processing systems, for example: Summarization, Question Answering, etc. It is important to emphasize that the event ordering method is based on a multilingual temporal information resolution system. Moreover, this multilinguality has been automatically obtained from a monolingual system (Spanish). The evaluation of the multilingual system is also shown in this paper, achieving a precision of 88% for Spanish and 77% for English. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
