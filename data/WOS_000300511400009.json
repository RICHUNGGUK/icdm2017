The features of the theory presented here are mathematically formulated, and selected illustrative examples demonstrate possible applications of the theory. The proposed methodology represents an original approach that emerges from defined assumptions like single-valuedness, the resonance principle, etc. From these simple assumptions, a set of principles of quantum cybernetics can be derived, e.g., quantization, spin, and entanglement.", "paper_title": "Wave Probabilistic Functions for Quantum Cybernetics", "paper_id": "WOS:000300511400009"}
