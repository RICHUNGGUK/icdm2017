The main goal on this paper is to propose and discuss a methodology for the design and implementation of knowledge-based systems founded on knowledge artifacts. We advocate that the systems built according to this methodology can be effective to convey the flow of knowledge between different communities of practice. Our methodology has been developed from the ground up, i.e. we have built some concrete systems based on the abstract notion of knowledge artifact and synthesized our methodology based on reflections upon our experiences building these systems. In this paper, we also describe the most relevant systems we have built and how they have guided us to the synthesis of our proposed methodology. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
