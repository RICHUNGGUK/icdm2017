The lack of doctors and the increase of the medical cost is becoming a big problem. Therefore, IT-based information systems should be implemented to help solve this problem. In this paper, we present the experimental results and evaluation of the SmartBox stimulation device for medical applications using a P2P system which is based on JXTA-Overlay. The SmartBox is integrated with our P2P system as a useful tool for monitoring and controlling patients activities. We found by experimental results that by SmartBox we can check the patient's situation. We carried out experiments with a patient in the bed and changed the temperature of the room. From the experimental results, we conclude that the use of SmartBox is an effective way for medical applications.", "paper_title": "Application of SmartBox end-device for medical care using JXTA-Overlay P2P system", "paper_id": "WOS:000325127200007"}
