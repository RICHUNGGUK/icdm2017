The method is validated using two separate implementations: a simulation using J-sim and an implementation for the T-mote Sky sensor using TinyOS. This paper also introduces a new sensor network attack called an Interest Cache Poisoning Attack and investigates how the DCA can be applied to detect this attack in a series of experiments.", "paper_title": "Detecting interest cache poisoning in sensor networks using an artificial immune algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000273846100001"}
