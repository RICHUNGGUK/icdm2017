In this letter, we propose a new CDMA serial link architect that allows an arbitrary number of transmitters to transmit data over the same channel while keeping the voltage spacing between adjacent logic states of the transmitted data to be the same as that of 4 pulse-amplitude-modulation serial link transmmitters. The effectiveness of the proposed architect is validated using the simulation results of a serial link with four transmitters designed in an IBM 130 nm 1.2 V CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "A new power-efficient CDMA-based transmitter for high-speed serial links", "paper_id": "WOS:000302812400022"}
