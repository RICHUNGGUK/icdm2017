We use normative multiagent systems to model both the contracts and the interactions. In particular, we formalize contracts as systems of regulative and constitutive norms within a larger rule-governed setting and, using recursive modeling, we develop a game theory wherein agents make contracts. We show how agents can modify the behavior of normative systems by means of constitutive rules in the contract changing these systems, and we illustrate how agents use the game theory within contract negotiation in organizations.", "paper_title": "A game theoretic approach to contracts in multiagent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235899000007"}
