In this paper, two designs of STBC are proposed for any number of transmit antennas that can obtain full diversity when a PIC group decoding (with a particular grouping scheme) is applied at receiver. With the PIC group decoding and an appropriate grouping scheme for the decoding, the proposed STBC are shown to obtain the same diversity gain as the ML decoding, but have a low decoding complexity. The first proposed STBC is designed with multiple diagonal layers and it can obtain the full diversity for two-layer design with the PIC group decoding and the rate is up to 2 symbols per channel use. With PIC-SIC group decoding, the first proposed STBC can obtain full diversity for any number of layers and the rate can be full. The second proposed STBC can obtain full diversity and a rate up to 9/4 with the PIC group decoding. Some code design examples are given and simulation results show that the newly proposed STBC can well address the rate-performance-complexity tradeoff of the MIMO systems.", "paper_title": "Two Designs of Space-Time Block Codes Achieving Full Diversity With Partial Interference Cancellation Group Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000300246900017"}
