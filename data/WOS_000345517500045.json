Due to the variability of the characteristics in different COPs, no single algorithm performs consistently over a range of practical problems. To design and refine an algorithm, numerous trial-and-error runs are often performed in order to choose a suitable search operator and the parameters. However, even by trial-and-error, one may not find an appropriate search operator and parameters. In this paper, we have applied the concept of training and testing with a self-adaptive multi-operator based evolutionary algorithm to find suitable parameters. The training and testing sets are decided based on the mathematical properties of 60 problems from two well-known specialized benchmark test sets. The experimental results provide interesting insights and a new way of choosing parameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
