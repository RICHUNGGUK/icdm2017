Aggregating and monitoring these resources, and discovering suitable resources for the applications become a challenging issue. This is partially due to the representation of Grid metadata supported by the existing Grid middleware which offers limited scope for matching the job requirements that directly affect scheduling decisions. This paper proposes a semantic component in conventional Grid architecture to support ontology-based representation of Grid metadata and facilitate context-based information retrieval that complements Grid schedulers for effective resource management. Web Ontology language is used for creating Grid resource ontology and Algernon inference engine has been used for resource discovery. This semantic component has been integrated with conventional Grid schedulers. Several experiments have also been carried out to investigate the performance overhead that arises while integrating this component with Grid schedulers.
