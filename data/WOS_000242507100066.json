Different from the Hadamard factorization scheme, we propose a more general case to obtain a set of doubly stochastic matrices according to decomposition of the fundaments of Jacket matrices. From order-2(n) and order-2n Jacket matrices, we always have the orthostochastoc case, which is the same as that of the Hadamard matrices, if the eigenvalue lambda(1) = 1, the other ones are zeros. In the case of doubly stochastic, the eigenvalues should lead to nonnegative elements in the probability matrix. The results can be applied to stochastic signal processing, pattern analysis and orthogonal designs.", "paper_title": "Doubly stochastic processing on jacket matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100066"}
