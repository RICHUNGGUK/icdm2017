Although literature in innovation management has discussed the notions of OIM, an organization-wide OIM framework has not yet been developed and validated. This project is thus carried out to develop and validate an organization-wide OM framework. Design/methodology/approach - From an extensive review of literature, core values and concepts of an OIM conceptual system are developed. Then, OIM critical factors are identified and validated by questionnaires and interviews in the HK/PRD manufacturing industry. Findings - The OIM critical factors are validated by examining the importance of OIM critical factors and the relationship between company accomplishment in individual factors and performance in organizational innovation. Also an organization-wide OIM hierarchical framework is formulated based on the OIM factors, with an evaluation of the HK/PRD manufacturing industry. Research limitations/implications - Although the identified critical OIM factors and the developed OIM framework could cover all types of industries, this research has only been done in the electronics and electrical consumer products manufacturing industry in HK/PRD region. Practical implications - The developed organization-wide OIM hierarchical framework builds a foundation for a comprehensive study in OIM. It provides a useful reference for managers to understand critical success factors of OIM. Furthermore, this framework can be further applied for any other organization-wide OIM-based management, such as OIM improvement programmes and OIM assessment systems. Originality/value An organization-wide OIM framework is developed and validated.", "paper_title": "Organizational innovation management: An organization-wide perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000251461600003"}
