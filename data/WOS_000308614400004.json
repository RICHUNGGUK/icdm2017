This article argues that many elements for a general theory of complexity now exist and briefly reviews the main features. First, the universal nature of network model of complexity provides a suitable foundation for a general theory. A brief summary of the network model is followed by a discussion of related issues, including simulation, dynamics and self-organisation. Gaps identified include the need for formal methods to describe complexity and to identify structural equivalence. Finally, some important lessons from biology are summarised.", "paper_title": "Elements of a network theory of complex adaptive systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308614400004"}
