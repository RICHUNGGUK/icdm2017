This case relies on the use of the so-called imaging rule for probabilistic dynamics as a substitute for conditionalization. It is argued that the imaging rule is the appropriate one for dealing with belief change in Sleeping Beauty and that under natural assumptions, this rule results in the double-halfer position.
