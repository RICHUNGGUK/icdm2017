It plays a fundamental role in running efficiently all Internet application, such as web browsing, email, multimedia applications and other projects. However, using the technique of the DNS cache poisoning attack, an attacker can effectively introduce forged DNS information to the cache memory of the domain name resolvers, with the goal of manipulating the resolver data so as to make then unavailable or divert traffic to the wrong destination, which is considered a real threat to Internet users today. Thus, in this paper, we present a new prevention methodology called Adaptive-Cache of DNS (ACDNS). Our proposed solution relies on a caching mechanism to prevent these kinds of attacks. Conversely, domain name system security extension has been presented as a conclusive solution to overcome weaknesses in the DNS protocol, but from that time up to now it still has not been deployed on a large scale. ACDNS is designed to be backward compatible with the current standards of DNS and completely appropriate with the basic protocol processes and infrastructure. In particular, our modifications are only in caching-timing in case of the need to store a new mapping. To this end, we design and implement a novel protocol for extensively simulating our approach. At the same time, we compare the performance of the ACDNS with the DNS. We show that our methodology completely protects domain name resolvers against cache-poisoning attacks.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Caching Approach to Prevent DNS Cache Poisoning Attack", "paper_id": "WOS:000359137500035"}
