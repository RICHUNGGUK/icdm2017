To cover wide current range due to variable coefficients in different modes, the programmable SI-DAC architecture with 2-bit digital controlled unit cells is proposed. Implemented in 65 nm CMOS, the simulated results verify that the proposed scheme solves the gate-leakage issue and the modulator achieves tremendously high performance of 84.5 dB SQNDR and 94.6 dB SFDR with almost 14 and 19 dB improvement in SQNDR and SFDR, respectively.", "paper_title": "Gate-leakage compensation scheme for programmable SI-DAC of I I\" pound modulator in deep sub-micron", "paper_id": "WOS:000320888500016"}
