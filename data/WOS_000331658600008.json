In this paper, we propose to solve this problem using a memetic algorithm that includes a crossover operation, a mutation operation, a local search involving three neighborhood operators, and a population selection strategy that maintains population diversity. Our approach generates the best known solutions for 131 out of 138 benchmark instances, improving on the previous best solutions for 24 of them, and exhibits more advantages on large benchmark instances when compared with the best existing approach. Additionally, all existing algorithms for this problem in literature assume that the underlying graph of the problem instance satisfies the triangle inequality rule; our approach does not require this assumption. We also generated a new set of 36 larger test instances based on a digital data service network price structure to serve as a new benchmark data set for future researchers.", "paper_title": "A memetic algorithm for the capacitated m-ring-star problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000331658600008"}
