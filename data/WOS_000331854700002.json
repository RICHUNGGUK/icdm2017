This work shows that the k-OPF is equivalent to the k-NN classifier when all training samples are used as prototypes. Simulations comparing the accuracy results, the decision boundaries and the processing time of the classifiers are presented to experimentally validate our hypothesis. Also, we prove that OPF using the max cost function and the NN supervised classifiers have the same theoretical error bounds. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
