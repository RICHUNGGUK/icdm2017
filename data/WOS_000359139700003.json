In mobile terminals, energy efficiency optimization is one of the most important issues due to battery power limitations, resource constraints and quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Considering the timely delivery, network load and terminal diversity, this paper proposes an adaptive message push strategy (AMPS) for energy efficiency optimization in mobile terminals. In AMPS, running parameters including energy parameter, operating system (OS) version and connection/polling cost in mobile terminal are first acquired and sent to the server together with the requisition data, and then the dispatching module will automatically choose a message pushing mode between polling-based and connection-based ones. The AMPS was tested in real environments using mobile phones with different OSs. Experiment results show that AMPS can efficiently optimize energy exploitation with dynamic tradeoff between terminal using time and QoS performance in comparison with polling-based and connection-based message push strategies.", "paper_title": "AMPS: An Adaptive Message Push Strategy for the Energy Efficiency Optimization in Mobile Terminals", "paper_id": "WOS:000359139700003"}
