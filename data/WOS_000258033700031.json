However, in present experimental demonstrations, the secret key can be distilled only under very small loss rates. Here, by calculating explicitly the computational complexity with the channel transmission, we show that under high loss rate it is hard to distill the secret key in present continuous variable scheme and one of its advantages, the potential of providing high secret key rate, may therefore be limited.", "paper_title": "Computational complexity of continuous variable quantum key distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000258033700031"}
