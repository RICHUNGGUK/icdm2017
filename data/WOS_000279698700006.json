A set of new features is presented and evaluated based on sinusoidal modeling of audio signals. The new feature set, including variance of the birth frequencies and duration of the longest frequency track in sinusoidal model, as a measure of the harmony and signal continuity, is introduced and discussed in detail. These features are used and compared to typical features as inputs to an audio classifier. Performance of these sinusoidal model features is evaluated through classification of audio into speech and music using both the GMM (Gaussian Mixture Model) and the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifiers. Experimental results show that the proposed features are quite successful in speech/music discrimination. By using only a set of two sinusoidal model features, extracted from 1-s segments of the signal, we achieved 96.84% accuracy in the audio classification. Experimental comparisons also confirm superiority of the sinusoidal model features to the popular time domain and frequency domain features in audio classification.", "paper_title": "Improvement to speech-music discrimination using sinusoidal model based features", "paper_id": "WOS:000279698700006"}
