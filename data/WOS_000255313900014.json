In successive generations, the number of individuals grows exponentially, leading to an unworkable amount of space required in the horizontal direction for 2D displays. In addition, it is not always possible to place closely related individuals near each other due to the lack of space in 2Ds. To address these issues we have developed three-dimensional (3D) pedigree drawing techniques to enable clearer visualization of extended pedigrees. Currently no other methods are available for displaying extended pedigrees in 3Ds. We have made freely available a software toolCelestial3Dthat implements these novel techniques.
