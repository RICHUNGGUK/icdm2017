It is a hybrid method combining a multiuser-interference-cancellation-based decision feedback equalizer using error feedback filter (MIMO MIC DFE-EFF) and a differential algorithm. The proposed method, termed 'MIMO MIC DFE-EFF with a differential algorithm' for short, has a multiuser feedback structure. We describe the schemes of MIMO MIC DFE-EFF and MIMO MIC DFE-EFF with a differential algorithm, and compare their minimum mean square error (MMSE) performance and computational complexity. Simulation results show that a significant performance gain can be achieved by employing the MIMO MIC DFE-EFF detection algorithm in the context of a multiuser MIMO-OFDM system over frequency selective Rayleigh channel. MIMO MIC DFE-EFF with the differential algorithm improves both computational efficiency and BER performance in a multistage structure relative to conventional DFE-EFF, though there is a small reduction in system performance compared with MIMO MIC DFE-EFF without the differential algorithm.", "paper_title": "A novel differential multiuser detection algorithm for multiuser MIMO-OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000282324700007"}
