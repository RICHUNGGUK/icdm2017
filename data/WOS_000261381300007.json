Based on MMSE extension of V-BLAST with sorted QR decomposition, an intuitional performance analysis of each sub-stream for MMSE V-BLAST transmission is done, and a new solution to the transmit antenna selection problem is suggested. Unlike most of the existing works, the proposed algorithm synthetically considers the impacts of detection order, interference cancellation, and noise amplification. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed algorithm achieves well both in outage capacity and in symbol error rate performance with low computational complexity.", "paper_title": "TRANSMIT ANTENNA SELECTION FOR V-BLAST MIMO SYSTEM BASED ON EXTENDED CHANNEL MATRIX ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261381300007"}
