To simplify the hardware architecture and provide programmability, we propose four new techniques: a new group-based VLD with efficient memory (NG-VLDEM) for Coeff_token decoder, a novel combined architecture (NCA) for level decoder, a new group-based VLD with memory access once (GMAO) for Total_zeros decoder and a new VLD architecture based on multiplexers instead of searching memory (MISM) for Run_before decoder. With the above four techniques, the proposed CAVLC decoder can decode every syntax element within one clock cycle. Synthesis result shows that the hardware cost is 3,3 10 gates with 0.18 mu m CMOS technology at a clock constrain of 125 MHz. Therefore, the proposed design is satisfied for real-time applications, such as H.264/AVC HD1080i video decoding.", "paper_title": "A novel cost-effective and programmable VLSI architecture of CAVLC decoder for H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000253828300004"}
