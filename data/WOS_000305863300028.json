In this paper, optic disc localization is achieved by a novel illumination correction operation, and contour segmentation is completed by a supervised gradient vector flow snake (SGVF snake) model. Conventional GVF snake is not sufficient to segment contour due to vessel occlusion and fuzzy disc boundaries. In view of this reason, the SGVF snake is extended in each time of deformation iteration, so that the contour points can be classified and updated according to their corresponding feature information. The classification relies on the feature vector extraction and the statistical information generated from training images. This approach is evaluated by means of two publicly available databases, Digital Retinal Images for Vessel Extraction (DRIVE) database and Structured Analysis of the Retina (STARE) database, of color retinal images. The experimental results show that the overall performance is with 95% correct optic disc localization from the two databases and 91% disc boundaries are correctly segmented by the SGVF snake algorithm.
