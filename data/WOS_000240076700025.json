In this correspondence, it is shown that C can be represented by a 4-cycle-free Tanner graph only if: [GRAPHICS] where p = n - k and d(perpendicular to) is the minimum distance of C-perpendicular to. By applying this result, it is shown that 4-cycle-free Tanner graphs do not exist for many classical binary linear block codes.", "paper_title": "Which codes have 4-cycle-free tanner graphs?", "paper_id": "WOS:000240076700025"}
