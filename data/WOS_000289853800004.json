The effects of rung coupling on fidelity susceptibility, entanglement entropy, and quantum phase transition are analyzed. It is found that the quantum phase transition between two different XY phases can be well-characterized by the fidelity susceptibility. Although the quantum phase transition from XY phase to rung singlet phase can be hardly detected by fidelity susceptibility, it can be predicted by the first derivative of the entanglement entropy of the system.", "paper_title": "FIDELITY AND ENTANGLEMENT CLOSE TO QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITION IN A TWO-LEG XXZ SPIN LADDER", "paper_id": "WOS:000289853800004"}
