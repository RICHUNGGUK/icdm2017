They make detection and extraction of the embedded watermark difficult or even impossible by destroying the synchronization between the watermark reader and the embedded watermark. In this paper, we propose a blind content-based image watermarking scheme against geometric distortions. Firstly, the MSER detector is adopted to extract a set of maximally stable extremal regions which are affine covariant and robust to geometric distortions and common signal processing. Secondly, every original MSER is fitted into an elliptical region that was proved to be affine invariant. In order to achieve rotation invariance, an image normalization process is performed to transform the elliptical regions into circular ones. Finally, watermarks are repeatedly embedded into every circular disk by modifying the wavelet transform coefficients. Experimental results on standard benchmark demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust to geometric distortions as well as common signal processing.", "paper_title": "Geometric attack resistant image watermarking based on MSER", "paper_id": "WOS:000316261500011"}
