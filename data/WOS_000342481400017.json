This task can be formalized as an optimization problem that, given a graph and a query model specifying the information returned by a query at a node, asks for finding a minimum-size subset of nodes to be queried so as to univocally identify the graph. This problem has been studied with respect to different query models, assuming that a node had some global knowledge about the network. Here, we propose a new query model based on the local knowledge a node instead usually has. Quite naturally, we assume that a query at a given node returns the associated routing table, i.e., a set of entries which provides, for each destination node, a corresponding (set of) first-hop node(s) along an underlying shortest path.
