Most existing subgraph isomorphism algorithms are based on a backtracking framework which computes the solutions by incrementally matching all query vertices to candidate data vertices. However, we observe that extensive duplicate computation exists in these algorithms, and such duplicate computation can be avoided by exploiting relationships between data vertices. Motivated by this, we propose a novel approach, BoostIso, to reduce duplicate computation. Our extensive experiments with real datasets show that, after integrating our approach, most existing subgraph isomorphism algorithms can be speeded up significantly, especially for some graphs with intensive vertex relationships, where the improvement can be up to several orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Vertex Relationships in Speeding up Subgraph Isomorphism over Large Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000362280300015"}
