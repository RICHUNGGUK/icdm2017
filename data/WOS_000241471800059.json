This paper addresses the two problems simultaneously by providing an efficient fault-tolerant digital signature scheme. The proposed scheme can be used to verify the authorized sender and check the integrity of transmitted messages. Furthermore, in order to achieve fault tolerance, our scheme is able to detect the errors and then recover from that errors to correct ones by directly using the signature scheme. It does not require any extra mechanism, such as checkpoints, to achieve the property of fault tolerance. In particular, previous schemes have some security flaws while ours does not.", "paper_title": "An efficient fault-tolerant digital signature scheme based on the discrete logarithm problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800059"}
