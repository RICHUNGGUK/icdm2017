The task is formulated as a problem of graph-based transductive classification. Specifically, given an image window, the color of each pixel in it will be reconstructed linearly with those of the remaining pixels in this window. The optimal reconstruction weights will be kept unchanged to linearly reconstruct their class labels. The label reconstruction errors are estimated in each window. These errors are further collected together to develop a learning model. Then, the class information about the user specified foreground and background pixels are integrated into a regularization framework. Under this framework, a globally optimal labeling is finally obtained. The computational complexity is analyzed, and an approach for speeding up the algorithm is presented. Comparative experimental results illustrate the validity of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Interactive Image Segmentation With Multiple Linear Reconstructions in Windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000288661800015"}
