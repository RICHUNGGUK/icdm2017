The model enables simple service dislocation and addition of new functionalities in Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) network. Presented architectural organization supports new service-oriented network entities in addition to standard IEEE 1451 smart transducers. The entities such as-particular transducer services and functionalities, processing applications and algorithms, and set of I/O devices are supported in the form of service providers managed by a central server. The entities are modeled as virtual transducers incorporated in the service-oriented network, and analysis on how this architectural change affects the smart transducer design constraints is given. The case study of a smart transducer network design in form of automated configuration and data exchange between ARM-based smart transducer interface module, central server and dislocated virtual transducer is presented.
