RC2DPCA can compress image in row and column direction. RC2DPCA needs fewer coefficients for image representation than 2DPCA. The experimental results on the ORL and FERET face database show that RC2DPCA works well and surpasses 2DPCA, BDPCA, and GPCA.", "paper_title": "Sequential Row-Column 2DPCA for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000022"}
