Our contribution focuses on two matters: first, a discussion about selecting the best features for a machine learning NER system. Second, an error study of this system which lead us to the creation of a set of general post-processing rules. These issues are explained in detail and then evaluated. The selection of features provides an improvement of around 2.3% over the results of our previous system while the application of the set of post-processing rules provides an increment of performance which is around 3.6%, reaching finally 83.37% f-score.", "paper_title": "Fine tuning features and post-processing rules to improve named entity recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000238573100016"}
