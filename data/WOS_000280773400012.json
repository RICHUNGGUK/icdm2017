In this paper we relate the partial-order semantics of shared-memory systems to Mazurkiewicz trace languages by means of a new refinement construction. We show that a set of labeled partial orders is recognized by some unambiguous shared-memory system if and only if it is definable in monadic second-order logic and media-bounded.", "paper_title": "UNAMBIGUOUS SHARED-MEMORY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280773400012"}
