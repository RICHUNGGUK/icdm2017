The present paper investigates reconfigurable matching by measurements of a CMOS Impedance Tuning Unit (ITU) designed for Digital Video Broadcasting for Handheld devices (DVB-H). The ITU consists of switched capacitors arranged in three capacitor banks, with inductors between them, thus creating a reconfigurable ladder matching network. It is demonstrated that any mismatch up to VSWR = 8 can be transformed to a mismatch better than VSWR = 2, that IIP2 = 7 dBm and IIP3 = 0.5 dBm, and that loss is 2.1 dB.", "paper_title": "Characterization of a CMOS impedance tuning unit for DVB-H", "paper_id": "WOS:000249967200002"}
