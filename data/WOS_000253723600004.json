BG/L has led the last four Top500 lists with a Unpack rate of 280.6 Tflop/s for the full machine installed at LLNL and is expected to remain the fastest computer in the next few editions. However, the real value of a machine such as BG/L derives from the scientific breakthroughs that real applications can produce by successfully using its unprecedented scale and computational power. In this paper, we describe our experiences with eight large scale applications on BG/L from several application domains, ranging from molecular dynamics to dislocation dynamics and turbulence simulations to searches in semantic graphs. We also discuss the challenges we faced when scaling these codes and present several successful optimization techniques. All applications show excellent scaling behavior, even at very large processor counts, with one code even achieving a sustained performance of more than 100 Tflop/s, clearly demonstrating the real success of the BG/L design.", "paper_title": "Bluegene/L applications: Parallelism on a massive scale", "paper_id": "WOS:000253723600004"}
