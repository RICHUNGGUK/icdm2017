On such a system, the information retrieval (IR), including the development of scalable infrastructures for indexing, becomes more complicated due to a huge increase on the amount of information and rapid information change. To keep the systems on MP2P networks more reliable and consistent, the index structures need to be updated frequently. For a semantic IR system, the index structure is even more complicated than a classic IR system and generally has higher update cost. The most well-known indexing technique used in semantic IR systems is Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), of which the index structure is generated by singular value decomposition (SVD). Although LSI performs well, updating the index structure is not easy and time consuming. In an MP2P environment, which is fully distributed and dynamic, the update becomes more challenging. In this work, we consider how to update the sematic index generated by LSI and keep the index consistent in the whole MP2P network. The proposed Concept Space Update (CSU) protocol, based on distributed 2-Phase locking strategy, can effectively achieve the objectives in terms of two measurements: coverage speed and update cost. Using the proposed effective synchronization mechanism with the efficient updates on the SVD, re-computing the whole index on the P2P overlay can be avoided and the consistency can be achieved. Simulated experiments are also performed to validate our analysis on the proposed CSU protocol. The experimental results indicate that CSU is effective on updating the concept space with LSI/SVD index structure in MP2P semantic IR systems.", "paper_title": "A Mobile P2P Semantic Information Retrieval System with Effective Updates", "paper_id": "WOS:000358994900014"}
