Each individual is assigned a weight that is proportional to the power of its degree, where the power exponent alpha is an adjustable parameter. Interestingly, it is found that there exists an optimal value of alpha leading to the shortest consensus time for scale-free networks, random networks and small-world networks. Other quantities, such as the probability that an individual's initial opinion becomes the final opinion as a function of degree, the evolution of the number of opinion clusters, as well as the relationship between average consensus time and the network size, are also studied. Our results are helpful for understanding the role of heterogeneous influence in the opinion dynamics.", "paper_title": "EFFECTS OF HETEROGENEOUS INFLUENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ON THE GLOBAL CONSENSUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281194100004"}
