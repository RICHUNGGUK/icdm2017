Mining, retrieving and sharing these data raises the need for rich geographical place name resources that record spatial and thematic elements of geographical places. Here, possible services offered at a place and human activities that can be practised there are considered useful concepts to discover and encode in place name resources. Recognising this dimension of place description can enhance information retrieval tasks by extending the range of possible queries and search criteria that relate to different place instances. This work proposes an automatic approach for the identification and extraction of service and activity-related concepts from multiple resources of textual descriptions of geographical place types. Frequent affordance patterns are identified and then applied to a corpus of resources to extract service and activity types associated with specific geographical place types. The evaluation experiments undertaken demonstrate the potential value of the approach.", "paper_title": "What can I do there?
