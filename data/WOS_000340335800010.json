Our formula leads to a stable and high-order numerical scheme that permits the evaluation of the solution at an arbitrary target, without the use of a spatial grid and without numerical dispersion error. In the process, we correct some errors in the analytic literature concerning the asymptotic behavior of the logarithmic derivative of the spherical modified Hankel function. We illustrate the performance of the method with several numerical examples. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
