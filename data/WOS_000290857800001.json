In fact, subsequent uses of the same quantum transmission resource can be significantly correlated. In this paper we review two Hamiltonian models describing memory effects in a purely dephasing spin-boson channel and in a channel with damping visualized by a micromaser system, respectively. In both cases, we show that the quantum information transmission rates are higher than in the memoryless limit.", "paper_title": "HAMILTONIAN MODELS FOR QUANTUM MEMORY CHANNELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290857800001"}
