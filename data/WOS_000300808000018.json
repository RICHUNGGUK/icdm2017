For the different values of threshold, the probability density functions of the return intervals for both Shanghai composite index and the simulation data are analyzed and described by the computer computations and simulations, and the trends of the corresponding distributions are also studied by the empirical research. Further, according to the randomness and the nonlinear nature of return interval, the artificial neural network which has the strong non-linear approximation capability is introduced to train and forecast the fluctuations of the return intervals for the real and the simulative data.
