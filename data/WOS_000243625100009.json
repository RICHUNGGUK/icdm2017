There are two objectives in this paper. Firstly, we propose a new ranking method and compare our method with other methods by many examples. The second objective is applying the proposed method to rank the best self-propelled Howitzers and main battle tanks.", "paper_title": "Selecting weapon system using relative distance metric method", "paper_id": "WOS:000243625100009"}
