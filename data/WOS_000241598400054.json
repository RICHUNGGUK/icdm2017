We used MAM at the transformation stage of image coding, thereby replacing the traditional methods such as Discrete Cosine Transform or Wavelet Transform. After applying the MAM, the informative image data are concentrated in a minimum of values. The next stages of image coding can be obtained by taking advantage of this new representation of the image. The main advantage offered by the MAM with respect to the traditional methods is the speed of processing, whereas the compression rate and the obtained signal to noise ratios compete with the traditional methods.", "paper_title": "Image compression algorithm based on morphological associative memories", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400054"}
