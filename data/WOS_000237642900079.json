The potential energy curves of the ground and the first three excited states have been calculated, and a double well potential has been obtained for the ground state. The effect of dynamical correlation was found to be crucial for a quantitative description of this system. Our results also indicate the usefulnes of a local-orbital description of bistable systems.", "paper_title": "Ab-initio multi-reference study of a bistable spiro molecule", "paper_id": "WOS:000237642900079"}
