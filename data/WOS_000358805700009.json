This paper surveys, explores, and informs researchers regarding the landscape of multipath routing by providing the motivation behind multipath routing deployment. Subsequently, this paper analyzes the security requirements and common attacks in wireless sensor networks. Also, we provide a classification of secure multipath routing protocols on the basis of nature of defense against the WSN attacks. According to the classification, we investigate the existing secure multipath routing protocols within the WSN domain by discussing their strengths and limitations. A comparative study of the suggested classification is presented based upon the multipath technique, additional security infrastructure, security requirements, corresponding attacks, and efficiency analysis in pursuit of effective secure routing in wireless sensor networks.
