ECMs are uncertain-graph structures for representing causal reasoning through the combination of cognitive maps and Dempster Shafer evidence theory. The framework of ECMs is developed in detail and an application to socio-economic model is used to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
