With these algorithms we are able to compute the exact values of the dimension of all subfield subcodes up to q a parts per thousand currency sign 32 and length up to 2(15). We show that some of the subfield subcodes of Hermitian codes are at least as good as the previously known codes, and we show the existence of good long codes.", "paper_title": "On the subfield subcodes of Hermitian codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200015"}
