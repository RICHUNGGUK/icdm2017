Based on the piecewise quadratic Lyapunov function (PQLF), the piecewise fuzzy observer-based controllers are designed for T-S fuzzy bilinear systems. It is shown that the stability for discrete T-S fuzzy bilinear system can be established if there exists a PQLF can be constructed and the fuzzy observer-based controller can be obtained by solving a set of nonlinear minimization problem involving linear matrix inequalities(LMIs) constraints. An iterative algorithm making use of sequential linear programming matrix method (SLPMM) to derive a single-step LMI condition for fuzzy observer-based control design. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the results proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "OBSERVER-BASED FUZZY CONTROL DESIGN FOR DISCRETE-TIME T-S FUZZY BILINEAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000320617600006"}
