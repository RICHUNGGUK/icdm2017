Packet-based MIMO-OFDM imposes a considerable throughput requirement on the matrix inversion because of strict timing in frame structure and subcarrier-by-subcarrier basis processing. Pipeline processing oriented algorithms are preferable to tackle this issue. We propose a pipelined MMSE detector using Strassen's algorithms of matrix inversion and multiplication. This circuit achieves real-time operation which does not depend on numbers of subcarriers. The designed circuit has been implemented to a 90-nm CMOS process and shows a potential for providing a 2.6-Gbps transmission speed in a 160-MHz signal bandwidth.", "paper_title": "VLSI implementation of a complete pipeline MMSE detector for a 4 x 4 MIMO-OFDM receiver", "paper_id": "WOS:000257990300027"}
