Different collaborative strategies such as quick response (QR), efficient consumer response (ECR), vendor managed inventory (VMI) or collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR) have already been proposed. The key to ensuring that the supply chain partners are progressing on the right track of creating the best-in-class practice lays in their ability to choose the appropriate strategy. The current paper proposes a framework, based on analysis grids and graphical representations, which help to better characterize these strategies. The analysis grids use several characterization criteria to express the collaboration nature and its extent. For a better understanding, this framework is then applied to the CPFR strategy.", "paper_title": "Supply chain management: a framework to characterize the collaborative strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000257069100009"}
