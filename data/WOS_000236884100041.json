Reference models support the configuration of these systems. Existing reference models use rather traditional languages. For example, the SAP reference model uses Event-driven Process Chains (EPCs). Unfortunately, traditional languages like EPCs do not capture the configuration-aspects well. Consider for example the concept of \"choice\" in the control-flow perspective. Although any process modeling language, including EPCs, offers a choice construct (e.g., the XOR connector in EPCs), a single construct will not be able to capture the time dimension, scope, and impact of a decision. Some decisions are taken at run-time for a single case while other decisions are taken at build-time impacting a whole organization and all current and future cases. This position paper discusses the need for configurable process models as a basic building block for reference modeling. The focus is on the control-flow perspective.", "paper_title": "Configurable process models as a basis for reference modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100041"}
