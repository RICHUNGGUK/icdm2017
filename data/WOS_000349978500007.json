However, they inevitably deteriorate during their service lives. Therefore, methods capable of assessing conditions and identifying damage in a structure timely and accurately have drawn increasing attention. Recently, compressive sensing (CS), a significant breakthrough in signal processing, has been proposed to capture and represent compressible signals at a rate significantly below the traditional Nyquist rate. Due to its sound theoretical background and notable influence, this methodology has been successfully applied in many research areas. In order to explore its application in structural damage identification, a new CS-based damage identification scheme is proposed in this paper, by regarding damage identification problems as pattern classification problems. The time domain structural responses are transferred to the frequency domain as sparse representation, and then the numerical simulated data under various damage scenarios will be used to train a feature matrix as input information. This matrix can be used for damage identification through an optimization process. This will be one of the first few applications of this advanced technique to structural engineering areas. In order to demonstrate its effectiveness, numerical simulation results on a complex pipe soil interaction model are used to train the parameters and then to identify the simulated pipe degradation damage and free-spanning damage. To further demonstrate the method, vibration tests of a steel pipe laid on the ground are carried out. The measured acceleration time histories are used for damage identification. Both numerical and experimental verification results confirm that the proposed damage identification scheme will be a promising tool for structural health monitoring.", "paper_title": "Damage Identification Scheme Based on Compressive Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000349978500007"}
