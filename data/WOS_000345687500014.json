In this paper, we propose a new feature descriptor named Local Directional Texture Pattern (LDTP) that is versatile, as it allows us to distinguish person's expressions, and different landscapes scenes. In detail, we compute the LDTP feature, at each pixel, by extracting the principal directions of the local neighborhood, and coding the intensity differences on these directions. Consequently, we represent each image as a distribution of LDTP codes. The mixture of structural and contrast information makes our descriptor robust against illumination changes and noise. We also use Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimension of the multilevel feature set, and test the results on this new descriptor as well. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
