This new class of optimization problems arise, for example, as reformulations of bilevel models used to describe competition in electricity markets. The convergence results of Steffensen and Ulbrich (2010) [31] are extended to parameterized MPECs and then further used to prove the convergence of the associated method for EPECs. Moreover, the proposed relaxation scheme is used to introduce and discuss a new relaxed sequential nonlinear complementarity method to solve EPECs. Both approaches are numerically tested and compared to existing diagonalization and complementarity approaches on a randomly generated test set. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
