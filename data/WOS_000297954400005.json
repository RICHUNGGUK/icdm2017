In a network with n vertices and m arcs a set F of arcs (parametrized arcs) is given. The task is to find a flow of a given size such that the maximum of flow values along the arcs from F is minimized. This problem can be solved by a sequence of maximum flow computations in modified networks where the capacities of the parametrized arcs are successively set to an increasing sequence of target parameter values. We show that it suffices to consider at most O(vertical bar F vertical bar) different target values and so this approach leads to a strongly polynomial algorithm consisting of at most O(vertical bar F vertical bar) maximum flow computations.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZATION OF AN SMD PLACEMENT MACHINE AND FLOWS IN PARAMETRIC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297954400005"}
