This model has the advantages of both global and local models. The expected error of the model is also estimated that helps to qualify the reliability of the predictions. It is described how different potential errors in QSAR model generation and prediction were averted and how the method was applied in an industrial environment.", "paper_title": "Global or Local QSAR: Is There a Way Out?", "paper_id": "WOS:000269223200015"}
