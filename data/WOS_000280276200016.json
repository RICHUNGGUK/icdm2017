We show how such problems can be described in terms of homomorphism dualities involving trees of bounded pathwidth and in algebraic terms. For this, we introduce a new parameter for trees that closely approximates pathwidth and can be characterised via a hypergraph searching game. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
