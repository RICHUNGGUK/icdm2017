We also evaluate the affect of the policies of Japanese government. Methods: The status of HIS adoption in Japan from 2002 to 2011 was investigated using reports from complete surveys of all medical institutions conducted by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). HIS-related budgets invested by the Japanese government from 2000 to 2008 were surveyed mainly using literatures and administrative documents of the Japanese government (MHLW and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry). Results: The rates of HIS adoption in Japan in 2011 were: 20.9% for the rate of EMR adoption in clinics, 20.1% for the rate of EMR adoption and 36.6% for the rate of CPOE adoption in hospitals. In hospitals, the rate of EMR and CPOE adoption were 51.5% and 78.6% in 822 large hospitals (400 or more beds), 27.3% and 52.1% in 1832 medium hospitals (200-399 beds), and 13.5% and 26.0% in 5951 small hospitals (less than 200 beds), respectively. Japan has a large number of medical institutions (99,547 clinics and 8605 hospitals) with a low rate of EMR adoption in clinics and a high rate of HIS adoption in hospitals. The national budget to expand HIS use was implemented for medium and large hospitals mainly. The policy target of New IT Reform Strategy was not achieved. Conclusion: The rate of HIS adoption in Japanese medium and large hospitals is high compared to small hospitals and clinics, and this is attributable to the fact that the Japanese government placed the target for HIS adoption on key hospitals with a large number of beds and concentrated budget investment in those hospitals. Besides, legal approval of EMR and the introduction of Diagnostic Procedure Combination system facilitated EMR adoption. There is less financial support for small hospitals than medium and large hospitals. The low rate of EMR adoption in clinics stems from the facts that there was little subsidies or incentives in the national remuneration for medical services, lack of cooperation from medical associations, and a failed attempt to mandate computerization of medical accounting (medical billing). Giving financial incentives is an effective means of raising EMR adoption rate. For wide usage of HIS, more financial support and incentive may be necessary for small hospitals and clinics.
