To address this challenging issue, in this paper, a graph-cut based multiple depth maps integration approach is proposed to obtain smooth and watertight surfaces. First, confidence maps for the depth images are estimated to suppress noise, based on which reliable patches covering the object surface are determined. These patches are then exploited to estimate the path weight for 3D geodesic distance computation, where an adaptive regional term is introduced to deal with the \"shorter-cuts\" problem caused by the effect of the minimal surface bias. Finally, the adaptive regional term and the boundary term constructed using patches are combined in the graph-cut framework for more accurate and smoother 3D modelling. We demonstrate the superior performance of our algorithm on the well-known Middlebury multi-view database and additionally on real-world multiple depth images captured by Kinect. The experimental results have shown that our method is able to preserve the object protrusions and details while maintaining surface smoothness.", "paper_title": "Multiple Depth Maps Integration for 3D Reconstruction Using Geodesic Graph Cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000359322900004"}
