The representation is normally constrained to small structures, or parts of a larger structure, to prevent a preponderance of invalid designs. This work uses a grammar based representation to generate large scale pylon designs. It removes invalid designs from the search space, but still allows complex and large scale constructions. In order to show the suitability of this method to real world design problems, we apply it to the Royal Institute of British Architects pylon design competition. This work shows that a combination of a grammar representation with real world constraints is capable of exploring different design configurations while evolving viable and optimised designs.
