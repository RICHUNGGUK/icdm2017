In this paper, we propose a handoff control scheme called Computing Powerless Handoff (CP-Handoff) for devices without computation capability, such as the lightweight Bluetooth (LW-BT) headset. The main concern of the CP-Handoff is that the client device doesn't have the computation capability. The main function of the computing powerless client device is to send/receive signals and play the audio data. Thus, how to have the handoff control when a computing powerless client device is switched from one access point to another access point becomes a problem to be resolved. A typical example is in the BT wireless network environment. The LW-BT headset is dedicated for audio applications and doesn't have extra computation capability. The CP-Handoff puts all handoff computation overhead on the master BT device, such that the LW-BT headset is unaware of the handoff. Based on the proposed CP-Handoff control scheme, a Ubiquitous Audio Access Platform (UAAP) is proposed and developed to allow users to access audio files using the LW-BT headset in the digital home network when they are roaming. The evaluation results show that the proposed CP-Handoff only needs 1.17 s to prepare the AVDTP session hancloff and 0.38 s for the AVDTP session handoff. The transmission of audio packets to the LW-BT headset is only suspended for 0.38 s. The audio packet buffering scheme and retransmission mechanism ensure that the LW-BT headset can resume lost audio packets during handoff. Crown copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
