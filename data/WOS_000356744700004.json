Based on data collected from two communities in China, we found that independent construal had a stronger positive direct effect on the intention to participate than did interdependent construal. The effect of independent construal on intention was attenuated by community reward and public self-consciousness. In comparison, the effect of interdependent construal on intention was enhanced by public self-donsciousness, but this strengthening effect did not exist for community rewards. A significant association between intention and actual participation was also found. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
