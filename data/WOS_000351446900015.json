To choose the best partner, the agent can rely on prior information he knows about the candidates. However, to improve his decision, he can request additional information from information sources. Nonetheless, acquiring information from external information sources about candidates may be biased due to different personalities of the agent searching for a partner and the information source. In addition, information may be costly. Considering the bias and the cost of the information sources, the optimization problem addressed in this article is threefold: (1) determining the necessary amount of additional information, (2) selecting information sources from which to request the information, and (3) choosing the candidates on whom to request the additional information. We propose a heuristic to solve this optimization problem. The results of experiments on simulated and real-world domains demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Choosing a Candidate Using Efficient Allocation of Biased Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000351446900015"}
