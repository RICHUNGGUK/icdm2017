Building on the compute-and-forward (C&F) relaying strategy of Nazer and Gastpar, who demonstrated its asymptotic gain using information-theoretic tools, an algebraic approach is taken to show its potential in practical, nonasymptotic, settings. A general framework is developed for studying nested-lattice-based PNC schemes-called lattice network coding (LNC) schemes for short-by making a direct connection between C&F and module theory. In particular, a generic LNC scheme is presented that makes no assumptions on the underlying nested lattice code. C&F is reinterpreted in this framework, and several generalized constructions of LNC schemes are given. The generic LNC scheme naturally leads to a linear network coding channel over modules, based on which noncoherent network coding can be achieved. Next, performance/complexity tradeoffs of LNC schemes are studied, with a particular focus on hypercube-shaped LNC schemes. The error probability of this class of LNC schemes is largely determined by the minimum intercoset distances of the underlying nested lattice code. Several illustrative hypercube-shaped LNC schemes are designed based on Constructions A and D, showing that nominal coding gains of 3 to 7.5 dB can be obtained with reasonable decoding complexity. Finally, the possibility of decoding multiple linear combinations is considered and related to the shortest independent vectors problem. A notion of dominant solutions is developed together with a suitable lattice-reduction-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "An Algebraic Approach to Physical-Layer Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100038"}
