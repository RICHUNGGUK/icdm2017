Generally, they are beneficial to data representation. However, if data have a complicated structure, these techniques would be unsatisfying for clustering. In this paper, we propose a new clustering method based on the deep auto-encoder network, which can learn a highly non-linear mapping function. Via simultaneously considering data reconstruction and compactness, our method can obtain stable and effective clustering. Experimental results on four databases demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve promising performance in terms of normalized mutual information, cluster purity and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Deep auto-encoder based clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000347782000006"}
