We investigate to what extent a generalized inverse can serve as a left inverse and as a right inverse, and how an inverse of an inverse relates to the identity mapping. The generalized inverses and quotients are then used to create a convenient formalism for dilations and erosions as well as for cleistomorphisms (closure operators) and anoiktomorphisms (kernel operators).
