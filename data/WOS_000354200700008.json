This paper addresses the security concern and proposes to achieve covert orthogonal frequency division multiplexing transmission using cyclic delay diversity featured multiple-input multiple-output technology. Particularly, our physical layer security scheme takes the advantage of cyclic delay diversity formed periodical frequency selective channel and utilizes uneven comb pilots to confuse unauthorized receivers and benefit authorized receivers. We conduct simulation study to evaluate the impact of different cyclic delay, antenna number, and interpolation algorithms on our scheme. Numerical results show that our scheme can provide authorized users with significant advantage over eavesdroppers without complicated upper-layer encryption and decryption. Moreover, the scheme has flexible choice of parameters and thus can be easily deployed in a variety of wireless networks with different requirements.
