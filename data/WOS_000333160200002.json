The method of finite-difference time-domain is employed for the analysis of the forward scattering part, while the inverse scattering problem is transformed into optimization one. The DDE algorithm and the APSO are applied to reconstruct the permittivities distribution of a 2D inhomogeneous dielectric cylinder. Both techniques have been tested in the case of simulated measurements contaminated by additive white Gaussian noise. Numerical results indicate that the APSO algorithm outperforms the DDE in terms of reconstruction accuracy and convergence speed. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
