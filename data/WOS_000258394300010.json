The restoration is separately considered as identification and deconvolution problems. In the proposed identification process, an identification difficulty is introduced to rank an order of blur identification. A blurred image with the lowest identification difficulty is initially identified by using a single-image-based scheme. Then, other images are identified based on a cross convolution relation between each pair of blurred images. In addition, an iterative feedback scheme is applied to improve the identification results. For the deconvolution process, a spatial adaptive scheme using regional optimal terminating points is modified from a conventional iterative deconvolution scheme. The images are decomposed into sub-regions based on smoothness. The regional optimal terminating points are independently assigned to suppress a noise in smooth regions and sharpen the image in edgy regions. The optimal terminating point for each region is decided by considering a discrepancy error. Restoration examples of simulated and real world blurred images are experimented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Multiple-image-based restoration for motion blur with non-uniform point spread function", "paper_id": "WOS:000258394300010"}
