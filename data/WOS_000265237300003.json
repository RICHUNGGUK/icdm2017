For quench temperatures just below the transition temperature the phase ordering occurs by simple coarsening under the action of surface tension. For sufficient low temperatures however the straightening of the interface between domains drives the system toward a metastable disordered state, identified as a glassy state. Escaping from this state occurs, if the quench temperature is nonzero, by a thermal activated dynamics that eventually drives the system toward the equilibrium state. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
