In this paper, we proposed a hybrid model method for automatic segmentation of Mandarin text-to-speech corpus. The boundaries of acoustic units are categorized into eleven phonetic groups. For a given phonetic group of boundaries, the proposed method selects an appropriate model from initial-final monophone-based HMM, semi-syllable monophone-based HMM and initial-final triphone-based HMM. The experimental results show that the hybrid model method can achieve better performance than the single model method, in terms of error rate and time shift of boundaries.", "paper_title": "Hybrid model method for automatic segmentation of mandarin TTS corpus", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300112"}
