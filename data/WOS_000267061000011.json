Each new node of the network gets attached to the ith existing node with the probability similar to k(i)(beta()t)e(-alpha tau i), where k(i) is the degree of the ith node and tau(i) is its age at time t. beta denotes attraction factor and alpha represents aging intensity. It is found that the network shows scaling behaviors such as scale-free and exponential distribution of degree. Moreover, the phase diagram in the beta - alpha plane is observed, in which there are three regions plotted by two boundaries.", "paper_title": "SCALING PROPERTIES OF AN EVOLVING NETWORK MODEL WITH AGING MECHANISM", "paper_id": "WOS:000267061000011"}
