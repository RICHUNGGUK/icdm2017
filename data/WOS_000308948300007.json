A new approach is used in order to design full-swing full adder with low number of transistors. The proposed full adder is implemented in MOSFET-like Carbon nanotube technology and the layout is provided based on standard 32 nm technology from MOSIS. The simulation results using HSPICE show that, there are substantial improvements in both power and performance of the proposed circuit compared to latest designs. In addition, the proposed circuit has been implemented in conventional 32nm process to estimate the advantages of using carbon-based transistors in digital designs over conventional silicon technology. The proposed circuit can be applied in ultra low power and very high speed applications.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF A NOVEL FULL ADDER DESIGNED FOR IMPLEMENTING IN CARBONE NANOTUBE TECHNOLOGY", "paper_id": "WOS:000308948300007"}
