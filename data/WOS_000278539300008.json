Yet technologies for both of them are expensive and not scalable. Also it is important to tune the monitoring system parameters for different species to adapt their behavior and gain the best result of monitoring. In this paper, we propose using wireless sensor networks to build both short term and long term wildlife and ecological monitoring systems. For the short term system, everything used is off-the-shelf and can be easily purchased from the market. We suggest that before establishing a large scale wildlife/ecological monitoring network, it is worthwhile to first spend a short period of time constructing a rapid prototype of the targeted network. Through verifying the correctness of the prototype network, ecologists can find potential problems, avoid total system failure, and use the best-tuned parameters for the long-term monitoring network.", "paper_title": "Rapid Prototyping for Wildlife and Ecological Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000278539300008"}
