The fixed-rate and fixed-distortion universal lossy coding schemes based on the complexity of the sequence are proposed. The obtained coding theorems reveal that the optimal distortion (resp. rate) attainable by the fixed-rate (resp. fixed-distortion) lossy coding is equal to the optimal average distortion (resp. rate) with respect to the overlapping empirical distribution of the given sequence. Some connections with the lossy coding problem of ergodic sources are also investigated.", "paper_title": "Universal lossy coding for individual sequences based on complexity functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000025"}
