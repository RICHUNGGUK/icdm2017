For feature extraction in the wavelet domain, the energies of subbands are usually extracted for texture classification. However, the energy of one subband is just a specific feature. In this paper, we propose an efficient feature extraction method for texture classification. In particular, feature vectors are obtained by c-means clustering on the contourlet domain as well as using two conventionally extracted features that represent the dispersion degree of contourlet subband coefficients. The c-means clustering algorithm is initialized via a nonrandom initialization scheme. By investigating these feature vectors, we employ a weighted L-1-distance for comparing any two feature vectors that represent the corresponding subbands of two images and define a new distance between two images. According to the new distance, a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier is utilized to perform texture classification, and experimental results show that our proposed approach outperforms five current state-of-the-art texture classification approaches.
