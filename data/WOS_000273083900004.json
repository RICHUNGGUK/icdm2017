From a complexity-theoretic point of view, we show that the problems underlying those schemes are equivalent. We then present a reaction attack on one of the schemes, thus easily transposed to the other. The attack, besides its efficiency, permits to recover an equivalent secret key.", "paper_title": "Security analysis of word problem-based cryptosystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273083900004"}
