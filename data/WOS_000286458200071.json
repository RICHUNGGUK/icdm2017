Since the normal distribution occurs frequently in economic and financial modeling, one often needs a method to transform low-discrepancy sequences from the uniform distribution to the normal distribution. Two well known methods used with pseudorandom numbers are the Box-Muller and the inverse transformation methods. Some researchers and financial engineers have claimed that it is incorrect to use the Box-Muller method with low-discrepancy sequences, and instead, the inverse transformation method should be used. In this paper we prove that the Box-Muller method can be used with low-discrepancy sequences, and discuss when its use could actually be advantageous. We also present numerical results that compare Box-Muller and inverse transformation methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
