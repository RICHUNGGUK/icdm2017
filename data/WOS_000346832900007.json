This study analyzed the data collected from the experiments made by a lean production simulation laboratory at a university in Taiwan, so as to investigate whether production optimization results of the enterprises can promote the overall performance of production and service. This study first compared the data envelopment analysis (DEA) with the experimental data, so as to evaluate whether the optimized production can improve the performance. It then analyzed main factors influencing the income with decision tree, and established the optimized production performance detection model respectively using three data mining technologies, namely the GABPN, BPN and decision tree. The analytic results showed that the output through optimized production does improve the overall performance of production and service. The main factors affecting the technical efficiency include the time consumed from serving all dishes on the table to leaving the table and the time consumed from leaving the table to paying the bill. Among these three data mining technologies, GABPN has the best detection ability.", "paper_title": "Establishment of the Optimized Production Performance Detection Model with the Combination of GA and BPN", "paper_id": "WOS:000346832900007"}
