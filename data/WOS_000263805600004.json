Here a modified self-organizing feature map neural network is used. Each spatial position of the input image corresponds to a neuron in the output layer and the number of neurons in the input layer is equal to the number of features of the input patterns. The network is updated depending on sonic threshold value and when the network converges, status of output neurons depict a change-detection map. To select a suitable threshold of the network, a correlation based and ail energy based criteria are suggested. The proposed change-detection technique is unsupervised and distribution free. Experimental results, carried out oil two multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
