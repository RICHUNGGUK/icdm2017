We formulate a co-scheduling problem of sampling of the plant's outputs, execution of control tasks, and the routing of data transmissions in the network. Several constraints on control tasks and data transmission are described by logical formulae. By using a SAT solver, we obtain a scheduling satisfying the constraints. Through simulation, we investigate the relationship between the computation time in the SAT solver and the number of nodes in the network.", "paper_title": "Co-scheduling of Communication and Control of Multi-Hop Control Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085600006"}
