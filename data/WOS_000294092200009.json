Gaussian fuzzy membership functions are used in conjunction with the least-squares principle for modeling and control. Based on the dynamic fuzzy neural network (DFNN) modeling, an adaptive backstepping controller is devised, which works through structure and parameter-learning phases for adaptation. The DFNN implements Takagi-Sugeno-Kang fuzzy systems based on extended radial basis function (RBF) neural networks. The design procedure is illustrated by using the multiscroll chaotic attractors as an example, on which simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
