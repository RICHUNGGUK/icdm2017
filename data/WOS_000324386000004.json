SimSketch, an integrated drawing and modeling tool, allows students to create sketches and apply behaviors to elements of their drawing. A multiagent simulation engine interprets and executes the model, thus building an intuitively usable and motivating learning environment to build and explore simulations of scientific phenomena.", "paper_title": "SimSketch: Multiagent Simulations Based on Learner-Created Sketches for Early Science Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000324386000004"}
