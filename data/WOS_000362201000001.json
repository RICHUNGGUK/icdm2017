The main idea behind the subject is to design a new quaternion based proportional derivative approach, which is realized along with the linear quadratic regulator method. In a word, the control technique proposed here is organized based upon an inner closed loop control to handle the angular rates in the three axes and the corresponding outer closed loop to handle the rotational angles in the same three axes, as well. It aims us to cope with the present complex and complicated systems, in the productive and constructive manner, in a number of programmed space missions such as orbital, communicational, thermal and so on maneuvers. It can be shown that the proposed cascade control strategy is organized in association with a set of pulse-width pulse-frequency modulators to drive a number of on-off reaction thrusters. It should be noted that these ones could significantly be increased w.r.t. the investigated control efforts, in order to provide overall accurate performance of the present space systems. There is currently a control allocation realization to complete the process of the approach presentation and organization. At last, the investigated results are presented in comparison with some potential benchmarks to guarantee and verify the approach performance.", "paper_title": "High-precision full quaternion based finite-time cascade attitude control strategy considering a class of overactuated space systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000362201000001"}
