We define complexity classes of uniform families of recognizer SN P systems with and without input, in a way which is standard in P systems theory. Then we study properties of the resulting complexity classes, extending previous results on SN P systems. We demonstrate that the computational power of several variants of confluent SN P systems, under polynomial time restriction, is characterized by classes ranging from P to PSPACE.", "paper_title": "POLYNOMIAL TIME-BOUNDED COMPUTATIONS IN SPIKING NEURAL P SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000317874800004"}
