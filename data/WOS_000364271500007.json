There have also been many studies regarding movie playing and other types of entertainment that uses olfactory displays or smell generators. These devices are capable of generating a considerable number of different odors with different intensities yet still have some limitations and are not ready for commercial use. In this study, a complete solution is presented for a user to experience olfactory sensations with a displayed video on a PC with auditory and 3D visual effects using a novel olfactory display device based on a micro-porous piezoelectric film that is capable of digitally producing fine particles of scent material with precision, quantity and speed.
