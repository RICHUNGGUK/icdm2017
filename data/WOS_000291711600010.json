The intelligent RFID fall notification system provides real-time monitoring and identification features for the elderly either at home or in nursing facilities. Once the fall accidents happen, the medical personnel or the users' family are informed through the system so that they can take immediate action and seek adequate emergency care. We adopt dual-band RFID protocols in the system, in which the high-frequency (HF) band of 13.56 MHz is for the identification of personnel and the microwave band of 2.45 GHz for fall detection, emergency voice communication and temperature sensing. The multi-functions of personal identification, fall detection, voice communication and temperature sensing are achieved by the intelligent fall notification system through the integration of RFID platform and wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "AN INTELLIGENT RFID FALL NOTIFICATION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600010"}
