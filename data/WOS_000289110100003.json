The coding tool library has been written in a dataflow/actor-oriented language named CAL. Each coding tool (actor) can be represented with an extended finite state machine and the data communication between the tools are described as dataflow graphs. This paper proposes an approach to model the CAL actor network with Parameterized Synchronous Data Flow and to derive a quasi-static multiprocessor execution schedule for the system. In addition to proposing a scheduling approach for RVC, an extension to the well-known permutation flow shop scheduling problem that enables rapid run-time scheduling of RVC tasks, is introduced.", "paper_title": "Quasi-Static Scheduling of CAL Actor Networks for Reconfigurable Video Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000289110100003"}
