In this work, starting from a scientific literature analysis in the area of KiPs and from three real-world domains and application scenarios, we provide a precise characterization of KiPs. Furthermore, we devise some general requirements related to KiPs management and execution. Such requirements contribute to the definition of an evaluation framework to assess current system support for KiPs. To this end, we present a critical analysis on a number of existing process-oriented approaches by discussing their efficacy against the requirements.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-Intensive Processes: Characteristics, Requirements and Analysis of Contemporary Approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000356015700003"}
