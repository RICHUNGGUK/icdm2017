The proposed error amplifier has ultrawide swing to extend the high-gain region so that the size of power transistor can be reduced. Experimental results show that the required power transistor size is reduced by 25% to achieve similar performance in load regulation. Moreover, extra power consumption and increase of silicon area are not significant.", "paper_title": "A Chip-Area Efficient Voltage Regulator for VLSI Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000284546000013"}
