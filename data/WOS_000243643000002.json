It is well known that various hybrid logics without binders are decidable, but decision procedures are usually not based on tableau systems, a kind of formal proof procedure that lends itself to computer implementation. In this article, we give four different tableau-based decision procedures for a very expressive hybrid logic including the universal modality; three of the procedures are based on different tableau systems, and one procedure is based on a Gentzen system. The decision procedures make use of so-called loop-checks, which is a standard technique used in connection with tableau systems for other logics, namely, prefixed tableau systems for transitive modal logics as well as for certain description logics. The loop-checks used in our four decision procedures are similar, but the four proof systems on which the procedures are based constitute a spectrum of different systems: prefixed and internalized systems, tableau and Gentzen systems.", "paper_title": "Tableau-based decision procedures for hybrid logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000243643000002"}
