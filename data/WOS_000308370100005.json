We present a linear time algorithm for deduction for interiors and show that deduction is coNP-complete for exteriors. Under model-based representation, we show that the deduction problem for interiors is NP-complete while the one for exteriors is coNP-complete. As for Horn envelopes of exteriors, we show that it is linearly solvable under model-based representation, while it is coNP-complete under formula-based representation. We also discuss polynomially solvable cases for all the intractable problems.", "paper_title": "Deductive Inference for the Interiors and Exteriors of Horn Theories", "paper_id": "WOS:000308370100005"}
