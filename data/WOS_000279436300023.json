Scenarios are considered where the fraction of flow re-injected is held constant, and where it varies as a function of link volume. The model is solved completely in the case of a constant inflow,with constant fractional re-injection, and an algorithm for dealing with general inflows is stated. Numerical solutions for a selection of inflow profiles are presented and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
