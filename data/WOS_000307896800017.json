In this paper, we model a nonlinear regularization method based on multiscale morphology for edge-preserving super resolution (SR) image reconstruction. We formulate SR image reconstruction as a deblurring problem and then solve the inverse problem using Bregman iterations. The proposed algorithm can suppress inherent noise generated during low-resolution image formation as well as during SR image estimation efficiently. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed regularization and reconstruction method for SR image.", "paper_title": "Super Resolution Image Reconstruction Through Bregman Iteration Using Morphologic Regularization", "paper_id": "WOS:000307896800017"}
