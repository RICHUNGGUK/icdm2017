The conditional qth quantile and expectation of the random discrepancy on the given sample are chosen as test statistics. Simulation results of powers against various alternatives are illustrated under the normal and exponential hypotheses for moderate sample size. The proposed tests, especially the qth quantile tests with a small or large q, are shown to be more powerful than other prominent goodness-of-fit tests in most cases.", "paper_title": "Goodness-of-fit tests for location-scale families based on random distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000336834100003"}
