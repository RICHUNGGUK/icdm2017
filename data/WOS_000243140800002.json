Such an inverse problem is to modify the weights with bound constraints so that a given feasible solution becomes an optimal solution of a min-max (or max-min) network problem, and the deviation of the weights, measured by the weighted l(1) norm or weighted 1(infinity) norm, is minimum. In this paper, we present strongly polynomial time algorithms to solve the inverse min-max spanning tree problem and the inverse maximum capacity path problem.", "paper_title": "Some inverse min-max network problems under weighted l(1) and l(infinity) norms with bound constraints on changes", "paper_id": "WOS:000243140800002"}
