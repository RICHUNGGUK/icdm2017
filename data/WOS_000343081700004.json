The analytical results show that the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the normalized Laplacian matrices are continuous. Therefore, clustering algorithms can be designed according to the special properties of the normalized Laplacian matrices in the ideal case and the method can be extended to the general case based on the continuity of the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the normalized Laplacian matrices. The numerical results are consistent with the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Perturbation analysis for the normalized Laplacian matrices in the multiway spectral clustering method", "paper_id": "WOS:000343081700004"}
