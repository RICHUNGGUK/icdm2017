The strength, ductility and energy absorption capabilities of reinforced concrete (RC) columns subjected to cyclic loading have been estimated by many researchers. These characteristics are not normally inherent in plain concrete but can be achieved by effectively confining columns through transverse reinforcement. An extensive experimental program, in which performance of four RC columns detailed according to provisions of ACI-318-08 was studied in contrast with that of four columns confined by a new proposed technique. This paper presents performance of columns reinforced by standard detailing and cast with 25 and 32 MPa concrete. The experimentally achieved load-displacement hysteresis and backbone curves of two columns are presented. The two approaches which work in conjunction with Response 2000 have been suggested to draw analytical back bone curves of RC columns. The experimental and analytical backbone curves are found in good agreement. This investigation gives a detail insight of the response of RC columns subjected to cyclic loads during their service life. The suggested analytical procedures will be available to the engineers involved in design to appraise the capacity of RC columns.", "paper_title": "Computer based estimation of backbone curves for hysteretic Response of reinforced concrete columns under static cyclic lateral loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000344577800006"}
