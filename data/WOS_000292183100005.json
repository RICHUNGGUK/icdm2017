The technique of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) was applied to the set of 95 amines to extract concepts and, in general, knowledge about the relationship between structural attributes and mutagenicity. HDT may be useful as a general tool for the comparison of different classes of QSAR models. FCA turns out to be a novel mathematical technique for seeking for relationships between molecular structure and activity.", "paper_title": "Comparison of QSARs and Characterization of Structural Basis of Bioactivity Using Partial Order Theory and Formal Concept Analysis: A Case Study with Mutagenicity", "paper_id": "WOS:000292183100005"}
