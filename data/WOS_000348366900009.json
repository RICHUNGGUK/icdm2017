In this paper, dynamics of 2DTORA system is modeled and written in general affine form. And we apply fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis to design a state feedback controller to stabilize the system with partial information about dynamics by using only a linguistic description. The designed state feedback controller is nonlinear which can be simplified as the classic linear state feedback controller. The globally stability of the closed-loop system is proofed according to the second Lyapunov theorem and LaSalle's stability theorem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed controller and advantages in comparison with a previously designed linear controller for the 2DTORA system.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Lyapunov synthesis control of an underactuated 2DTORA system", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366900009"}
