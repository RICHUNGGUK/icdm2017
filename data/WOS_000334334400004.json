Two simple prediction models, one based on similarity to historical trajectories and one on Monte Carlo simulation, are presented. The prediction models generate temporal probability density fields starting from a known situation. We use contours to visualize spatio-temporal zones of these density fields. Predictions are split into a configurable number of segments for which we render one or more contours. Users, investigating and exploring the possible development of a situation, can see where a vessel will be in the near future according to a given prediction model. Through a number of real-world use cases and a discussion with users, we show our methods can be used in monitoring traffic for collision avoidance, and detecting illegal activities, like piracy or smuggling. By applying our methods to pedestrian movements, we show that our methods can also be applied to a different domain.", "paper_title": "Contour based visualization of vessel movement predictions", "paper_id": "WOS:000334334400004"}
