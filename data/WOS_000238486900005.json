In the development of security-critical applications, system developers must consider both the technical and the social parts. To achieve this, security issues must be considered during the whole development life-cycle of an information system. This paper presents an approach that allows developers to consider both the social and the technical dimensions of security through a structured and well defined process. In particular, the proposed approach takes the high-level concepts and modelling activities of the secure Tropos methodology and enriches them with a low level security-engineering ontology and models derived from the UMLsec approach. A real case study from the e-commerce sector is employed to demonstrate the applicability of the approach.", "paper_title": "Towards a comprehensive framework for secure systems development", "paper_id": "WOS:000238486900005"}
