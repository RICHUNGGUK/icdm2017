So far, a number of schemes have been developed to address this challenge. However, a main shortcoming of these schemes is that their use of sensor resources is not properly balanced. This has motivated us to propose a new lightweight scheme to rectify the problem. The scheme only employs symmetric cryptosystems for its design. It takes advantage of the hierarchical clustering feature of a HWSN to deliver a novel way of building vertical key shareability before sensor deployment to enable horizontal key shareability after the deployment for authentic shared key establishment. The scheme evaluation shows that it offers strong authenticity and resilience against various security threats, and is more resource-efficient, flexible and scalable than related work.
