The model uses the trajectorial architecture theory of optimisation to predict the remodelling of material microstructure and structural organisation under mechanical loading. We used the proposed model to calculate the density distribution of proximal femur in the frontal plane. The loading considered was the hip joint contact forces and muscular forces at the attachment sites of the muscles to the bone. These forces were estimated from a separate finite element calculation using a heterogeneous three-dimensional model of the proximal femur. The density distributions obtained by this procedure has a qualitative similarity with in vivo observations. Solutions displayed the characteristic high-density channels that are evident in the Dual X-ray Absorptiometry scan. There is also evidence of the intramedullary canal, as well as low-density regions in the femoral neck. Several parametric studies were carried out to highlight the advantages of the proposed method, which includes fast convergence and low-computational cost. The potential applications of the proposed method in predicting bone structural remodelling in cancer are also briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of load-induced bone structural remodelling using stress-limit criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000343814400005"}
