We show that, for omega-regular linear-time properties and finite-memory schedulers, qualitative model-checking is decidable. The techniques extend smoothly to questions where fairness restrictions are imposed on the schedulers. The symbolic procedure underlying our decidability proofs has been implemented and used to study a simple protocol handling two-way transfers in an unreliable setting.", "paper_title": "Symbolic verification of communicating systems with probabilistic message losses: Liveness and fairness", "paper_id": "WOS:000241691900017"}
