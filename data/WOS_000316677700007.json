New types of queries namely directions and velocity queries (DV queries), are to be supported and covered. The TPR-tree and its successors are efficient indexes that support spatio-temporal queries for moving objects. However, neither of them support the new DV queries. In this paper, we propose a new index for moving objects based on the TPR*-tree, named Direction and Velocity of TPR*-tree or DV-TPR*-tree, in order to build data a structure based on the spatial, direction and velocity domains. DV-TPR*-tree obtains an ideal distribution that supports and fulfils the new query types (DV queries). Extensive performance studies show that the query performance of DV-TPR*-tree outperforms the TPR-tree and its successors.", "paper_title": "Indexing moving objects for directions and velocities queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677700007"}
