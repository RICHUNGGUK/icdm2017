A transformation of a 2D text into the form of a tree is presented. It preserves the context of each element of the 2D text. The tree can be linearised using the prefix notation into the form of a string (a linear text) and the pattern matching is performed in this text. Pushdown automata indexing the 2D text are constructed over the tree representation. They allow to search for 2D prefixes, 2D suffixes, and 2D factors of the 2D text in time proportional to the size of the representation of a 2D pattern. This result achieves the properties analogous to the results obtained in tree pattern matching and string indexing.", "paper_title": "TREE-BASED 2D INDEXING", "paper_id": "WOS:000299094200010"}
