In this paper we propose a notion of system factorisation expressed in terms of pullback decomposition. To ensure coherence of the local views and completeness of the diagnosis, data exchange among the unfolders needs to be specified with care. We introduce interleaving structures as a format for data exchange between unfolders and we propose a distributed algorithm for computing local views of the unfolding for each system component. The theory of interleaving structures is developed to prove correctness of the distributed unfolding algorithm.", "paper_title": "Distributed unfolding of Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000237082000009"}
