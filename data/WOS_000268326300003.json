In this paper we perform analyses of behavioural diversity, the size and shape of starting populations, the effects of purely semantic program initialisation and the importance of tree shape in the context of program initialisation. To achieve this, we create four different algorithms, in addition to using the traditional ramped half and half technique, applied to seven genetic programming problems. We present results to show that varying the choice and design of program initialisation can dramatically influence the performance of genetic programming. In particular, program behaviour and evolvable tree shape can have dramatic effects on the performance of genetic programming. The four algorithms we present have different rates of success on different problems.", "paper_title": "Semantic analysis of program initialisation in genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000268326300003"}
