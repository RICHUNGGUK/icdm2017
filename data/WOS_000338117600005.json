In this paper, we study proper circulant matrices with n = p(2) where p is an odd prime divisor of v. For p >= 5, it turns out that to search for such circulant matrices leads us to two group ring equations and by studying these two equations, we manage to prove that no proper CW(pw, p(2)) exists when p = 3 (mod 4) or p = 5.", "paper_title": "Proper circulant weighing matrices of weight p(2)", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600005"}
