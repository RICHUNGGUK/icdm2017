In this paper, we propose another technique of that kind, called dependent binary relevance (DBR) learning. DBR combines properties of both, chaining and stacking. We provide a careful analysis of the relationship between these and other techniques, specifically focusing on the underlying dependency structure and the type of training data used for model construction. Moreover, we offer an extensive empirical evaluation, in which we compare different techniques on MLC benchmark data. Our experiments provide evidence for the good performance of DBR in terms of several evaluation measures that are commonly used in MLC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
