The available tools for the analyses of the use of such terminals offer insufficient support for decision-making on the location and design of these terminals from the sustainability perspective. New approaches are needed. This article contributes to satisfy this need, triggered by the planning of a new Barge Terminal in the Dutch city of Tilburg (BTT). Presently, the existing terminal in Tilburg is operating near full capacity and the construction of a new terminal is considered the best strategy to cope with steady growth. The main question concerns the optimal design of the new barge terminal to offer a high operational performance, however without exceeding the environmental quality standards, in particular noise. The article presents a simulation approach to assist in the process of finding a balance between the operational performance and the noise effects of alternative designs of the new terminal.
