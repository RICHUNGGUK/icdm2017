Optimal local bases are a set of basis derived by reinforcement learning to represent the face space locally. The reinforcement signal is designed to be correlated to the recognition accuracy. The optimal local bases are derived then by finding the most discriminant features for different parts of the face space, which represents either different individuals or different expressions, orientations, poses, illuminations, and other variants of the same individual. Therefore, unlike most of the existing approaches that solve the recognition problem by using a single basis for all individuals, our proposed method benefits from local information by incorporating different bases for its decision. We also introduce a novel classification scheme that uses reinforcement signal to build a similarity measure in a non-metric space. Experiments on AR, PIE, ORL and YALE databases indicate that the proposed method facilitates robust face recognition under pose, illumination and expression variations. The performance of our method is compared with that of Eigenface, Fisherface, Subclass Discriminant Analysis, and Random Subspace LDA methods as well.", "paper_title": "Optimal Local Basis: A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000262401600007"}
