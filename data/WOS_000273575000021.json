The outage probability is derived and its tight closed-form lower bound is presented. Asymptotic analysis indicates that the proposed scheme can achieve both spatial and multipath (frequency) diversity. The theoretical analysis of the proposed STF coded scheme is further implemented by the distributed group STF block coding (D-GSTFBC) scheme based on the subcarrier grouping technique. Simulation results confirm the previously introduced theoretical analysis.", "paper_title": "Distributed space-time-frequency coding for cooperative OFDM systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273575000021"}
