In this article, we extend a previous study of the impact of additive STDP in a recurrent network that is driven by spontaneous activity (no external stimulating inputs) from a fully connected network to one that is only partially connected. The asymptotic state of the network is analyzed, and it is found that the equilibrium and stability conditions for the firing rates are similar for both full and partial connectivity: STDP causes the firing rates to converge toward the same value and remain quasi-homogeneous. However, when STDP induces strong weight competition, the connectivity affects the weight dynamics in that the distribution of the weights disperses more quickly for lower density than for higher density. The asymptotic weight distribution strongly depends upon that at the beginning of the learning epoch; consequently, homogeneous connectivity alone is not sufficient to obtain homogeneous neuronal activity. In the absence of external inputs, STDP can nevertheless generate structure in the network through autocorrelation effects, for example, by introducing asymmetry in network topology.", "paper_title": "Emergence of network structure due to spike-timing-dependent plasticity in recurrent neuronal networks III: Partially connected neurons driven by spontaneous activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000272176000007"}
