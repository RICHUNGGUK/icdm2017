Detecting such kind of attacks is important and difficult because of intruders' evasion to detection, such as time perturbation, and chaff perturbation. In this paper, we propose a clustering algorithm to detect stepping-stone intrusion based on TCP packet round-trip time to estimate the downstream length of an interactive terminal session and give its resistibility to intruders' evasion. The analysis and simulation results show that this algorithm can detect stepping-stone intrusion without false alarm, and low misdetection. It can resist to intruders' time perturbation completely, as well as chaff perturbation to a certain extent.", "paper_title": "Resistance analysis to intruders' evasion of detecting intrusion", "paper_id": "WOS:000240592800028"}
