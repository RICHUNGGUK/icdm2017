The data quality is obviously of essential significance for a data-driven soft sensor. Therefore, preprocessing procedures for process measurements are described in detail. First, a template is defined based on one or more key process variables to handle missing data related to severe operation interruptions. Second, a univariate, followed by a multivariate principal component analysis (PCA) approach, is used to detect outlying observations. Then, robust regression techniques are employed to derive an inferential model. A dynamic partial least squares (DPLS) model is implemented to address the issue of auto-correlation in process data and thus to provide smoother estimation than using a static regression model. The proposed methodology is illustrated through applications to a cement kiln system for estimation of variables related to product quality, i.e., free lime, and to emission quality, i.e., nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission. The case studies reveal the effectiveness of the systematic framework in deriving data-driven soft sensors that provide reasonably reliable one-step-ahead predictions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
