This fact is routinely exploited by parents, teachers, textbook writers, and coaches. From driving, to music, to science, there hardly exists a complex skill that is not learned by gradations. Natarajan's model of \"learning from exercises\" captures this kind of learning of efficient problem solving skills using practice problems or exercises (Natarajan 1989). The exercises are intermediate subproblems that occur in solving the main problems and span all levels of difficulty. The learner iteratively bootstraps what is learned from simpler exercises to generalize techniques for solving more complex exercises. In this paper, we extend Natarajan's framework to the problem reduction setting where problems are solved by reducing them to simpler problems. We theoretically characterize the conditions under which efficient learning from exercises is possible. We demonstrate the generality of our framework with successful implementations in the Eight Puzzle, symbolic integration, and simulated robot planning domains illustrating three different representations of control knowledge, namely, macro-operators, control rules, and decision lists. The results show that the learning rates for the exercises framework are competitive with those for learning from problems solved by the teacher.", "paper_title": "LEARNING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS FROM EXERCISES", "paper_id": "WOS:000260527900002"}
