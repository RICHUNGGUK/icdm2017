The key characteristic of this software is that, when dragging certain elements of the configuration, the geometric properties of the construction are preserved. In this paper, we describe an educational web-based application that complements standard dynamic geometry programs in a mathematically sound manner. We put the focus on computing the geometric locus of distinguished points in linkages and other geometric constrained configurations, since knowing the equations of such loci is a typical engineering task.
