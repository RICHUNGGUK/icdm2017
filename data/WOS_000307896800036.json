However, the existing algorithms or systems work well only under some controlled conditions. There are still many challenges for license plate detection in an open environment, such as various observation angles, background clutter, scale changes, multiple plates, uneven illumination, and so on. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to automatically locate license plates by principal visual word (PVW), discovery and local feature matching. Observing that characters in different license plates are duplicates of each other, we bring in the idea of using the bag-of-words (BoW) model popularly applied in partial-duplicate image search. Unlike the classic BoW model, for each plate character, we automatically discover the PVW characterized with geometric context. Given a new image, the license plates are extracted by matching local features with PVW. Besides license plate detection, our approach can also be extended to the detection of logos and trademarks. Due to the invariance virtue of scale-invariant feature transform feature, our method can adaptively deal with various changes in the license plates, such as rotation, scaling, illumination, etc. Promising results of the proposed approach are demonstrated with an experimental study in license plate detection.", "paper_title": "Principal Visual Word Discovery for Automatic License Plate Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000307896800036"}
