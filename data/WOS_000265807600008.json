By means of the principle of virtual work and the concept of link Jacobian matrices, the inverse dynamic model of the redundant parallel manipulator is set up. It consists of six linear consistent equations with eight unknown quantities. Then, the optimum solution of the actuating torques is achieved by employing the Moore-Penrose inverse matrix. It is with minimum norm and least quadratic sum among the possible actuating torque vectors. A series of new dynamic performance indices with obvious physical meanings have been proposed in the paper. By decoupling the inverse dynamics in the exhaustive way, a novel dynamic performance index combining the acceleration, velocity and gravity terms of the dynamic equations has been presented to evaluate the dynamic characteristic of the redundant parallel manipulator. With the index, it is possible to control the performance in the different direction. The index has been applied to the dynamic characteristic evaluation of the redundant parallel manipulator in the simulation. It is general and can be used for the dynamic performance evaluation of other types of parallel manipulators. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
