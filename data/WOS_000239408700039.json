We make use of this construction to prove the existence of so-called balanced cyclic half Gray sequences. Furthermore, we discuss a specific type of counting sequences, called maximum counting sequences, and we prove a conjecture of Robinson and Cohn with respect to the existence of balanced maximum counting sequences.", "paper_title": "Balanced maximum counting sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700039"}
