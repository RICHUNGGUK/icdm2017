This paper describes a few self-organizing and self-optimizing techniques to manage and reduce this inter-cell interference. These self-optimizing network (SON)-based techniques are inter-cell interference coordination (ICIC) and uplink (UL) interference over thermal (IoT) control. Simulation results are presented showing the improvements that can be obtained with the use of such techniques in interference limited operating scenarios.
