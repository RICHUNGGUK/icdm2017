In this paper, we present an automatic image orientation detection algorithm based on low-level features: color moments; Harris corner; phase symmetry; edge direction. histogram. Support vector machines, statistical classifiers, parzen window classifiers are used in our approach: we use Borda Count as combination rule for these classifiers. Large amounts of experiments have been conducted, on a database of more than 6000 images of real photos, to validate our approach. Discussions and future directions for this work are also addressed at the end of the paper. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
