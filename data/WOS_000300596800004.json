In order to perform seamless handover between heterogeneous wireless networks, IEEE group proposed the \"IEEE 802.21 standard\" and defined a middleware function called \"media independent handover function (MIHF)\" to smooth the handover. In this paper, a dynamic playback control for multicasting streaming based on IEEE 802.21 is proposed to reduce the influence of handover between heterogeneous networks. In addition, we evaluate three different rate modes for seamless multicasting streams. The simulation results show that different playback frame rate modes, including the usual, incremental and linear modes, can achieve different video quality and can extend the playing time for handover video playback.
