Recently more and more researchers have attempted to solve the problems of partial retrieval in the domain of computer graphics, vision, CAD, and multimedia. Unfortunately, in the literature, there is little comprehensive discussion on the state-of-the-art methods of partial shape retrieval. In this article we focus on reviewing the partial shape retrieval methods over the last decade, and help novices to grasp latest developments in this field. We first give the definition of partial retrieval and discuss its desirable capabilities. Secondly, we classify the existing methods on partial shape retrieval into three classes by several criteria, describe the main ideas and techniques for each class, and detailedly compare their advantages and limits. We also present several relevant 3D datasets and corresponding evaluation metrics, which are necessary for evaluating partial retrieval performance. Finally, we discuss possible research directions to address partial shape retrieval.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Partial Retrieval of 3D Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000324661300010"}
