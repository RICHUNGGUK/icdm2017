We have studied the structural characters, growth behaviors, electronic and magnetic properties of NbnAl by the density functional theory calculations. Unlike the previous literature reported on Al-doped systems where ground state structures undergo a structural transition from the Al-capped frame to Al-encapsulated structure, we found that Al atom always occupies the surface of NbnAl clusters and structural transition does not take place until n = 10. Note that the fragmentation proceeds preferably by the ejection of an aluminum atom other than niobium atom. According to the natural population analysis, charges always transfer from aluminum to niobium atoms. Furthermore, the magnetic moments of the NbnAl clusters are mainly located on the 4d orbital of niobium atoms, and aluminum atom possesses very small magnetic moments.", "paper_title": "Structural, electronic and magnetic effects of Al-doped niobium clusters: a density functional theory study", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900010"}
