First, a non-linear neural-network(NN)-based identification model that includes a prior knowledge about the plant dynamics is discussed by using the approximation capabilities of NNs. Then, the adaptive non-linear compensation controller is developed to produce the desired tracking performance. The proposed controller based on the NN can reduce the effect of modelling uncertainties and provide the time-delay compensation, while stability of the closed-loop system is guaranteed. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is demonstrated through the application to the control of a continuous stirred tank reactor.", "paper_title": "Adaptive non-linear compensation control based on neural networks for non-linear systems with time delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000272497400007"}
