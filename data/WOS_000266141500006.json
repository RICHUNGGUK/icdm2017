A graph-based representation of deadlocks is provided in this study, and deadlocks are prevented by imposing constraints in vehicle movements. Such constraints are embedded in the software controller by attaching control nodes. The simulation results show that the operational performances of container terminals may significantly be improved by the proposed controller.", "paper_title": "Ubiquitous software controller to prevent deadlocks for automated guided vehicle systems in a container port terminal environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000266141500006"}
