The result of a location-dependent query depends on the current location of the mobile client which has generated the query as well as the locations of the moving objects on which the query has been issued. When a location-dependent query is specified to be continuous, the result of the query can continuously change. In order to provide accurate and timely query results to a client, the location of the client as well as the locations of moving objects in the system has to be closely monitored. Most of the location generation methods proposed in the literature aim to optimize utilization of the limited wireless bandwidth. The issues of correctness and timeliness of query results reported to clients have been largely ignored. In this paper, we propose an adaptive monitoring method (AMM) and a deadline-driven method (DDM) for managing the locations of moving objects. The aim of our methods is to generate location updates with the consideration of maintaining the correctness of query evaluation results without increasing location update workload. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed methods as compared to a well-known location update generation method, the plain dead-reckoning (pdr).
