Clustering is one of the most promising. In this paper, we propose a new clustering technique whose goal is that of producing both intracluster graphs and intercluster graph with desired topological properties. We formalize this concept in the (X, Y)-clustering framework, where Y is the class that defines the desired topological properties of intracluster graphs and X is the class that defines the desired topological properties of the intercluster graph. By exploiting this approach, hybrid visualization tools can effectively combine different node-link and matrix-based representations, allowing users to interactively explore the graph by expansion/contraction of clusters without loosing their mental map. As a proof of concept, we describe the system Visual Hybrid (X, Y)-clustering (VHYXY) that implements our approach and we present the results of case studies to the visual analysis of social networks.", "paper_title": "Visual Analysis of Large Graphs Using (X, Y)-Clustering and Hybrid Visualizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000294556000005"}
