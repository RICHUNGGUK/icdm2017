In this paper, we propose a novel approach for these 2 problems: (1) deploying a deformable centerline, combined with medial representation method instead of the traditional linear elastic model, to simulate large motion and global deformation of a 3D tube like object; (2) applying a simplified algorithm which reconstructs the soft tissue surface by the medial representation method and reduces the complexity of a 3D problem.", "paper_title": "Real-time simulation for global deformation of soft tissue using deformable centerline and medial representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239565100008"}
