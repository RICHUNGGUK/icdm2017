Usually, the frequency of performing a maintenance task is considered, in the optimization process, as a constant value but a certain range of variation from such value is observed in real practice. Thus, to obtain a more realistic approach, a certain degree of uncertainty should be considered in the decision variables. This paper presents two examples of maintenance optimization using Particle Swarm as optimization technique and a tolerance interval based approach to address uncertainty, one is focused on a safety component and the other considers a nuclear power plant safety system.
