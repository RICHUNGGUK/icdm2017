Two workload allocation strategies, the Optimized mean Response Time (ORT) and the Optimized mean Miss Rate (OMR), are developed by establishing and numerically solving two optimization equation sets. The ORT strategy achieves an optimized mean response time for non-real-time jobs, while the OMR strategy obtains an optimized mean miss rate for soft real-time jobs over multiple clusters. Both strategies take into account average system behaviors (such as the mean arrival rate of jobs) in calculating the workload proportions for individual clusters and the workload allocation is updated dynamically when the change in the mean arrival rate reaches a certain threshold. The effectiveness of both strategies is demonstrated through theoretical analysis. These strategies are also evaluated through extensive experimental studies and the results show that when compared with traditional strategies, the proposed workload allocation schemes significantly improve the performance of job scheduling in multiclusters, both in terms of the mean response time (for non-real-time jobs) and the mean miss rate (for soft real-time jobs).", "paper_title": "Allocating non-real-time and soft real-time jobs in multiclusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000234122000002"}
