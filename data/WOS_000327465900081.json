A possible solution to reduce the overhead is to notify the analog value of the CSI, which is also known as analog channel feedback. It however only allows nodes to overhear an imperfect channel information. While some previous studies have theoretically analyzed the performance of analog channel feedback, this work aims at addressing issues of realizing it in practice and empirically demonstrating its effectiveness. Our prototype implementation using USRP-N200 shows that analog channel feedback produces a small error comparable to that of estimating CSI using reciprocity, but however can be applied to more general scenarios.", "paper_title": "An Empirical Study of Analog Channel Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900081"}
