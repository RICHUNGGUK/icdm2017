The idea is based on the overwhelming robust trajectory control of a ground robot on a flexible foundation and robust foundation disturbance compensation presented elsewhere. No external jets/thrusters are required or used in the scheme. An example of a three-link robot mounted on a free-floating space platform is considered for demonstrating the efficacy of the control scheme. Bond graph technique has been used for the purpose of modeling and simulation. Robustness of the control scheme is guaranteed since the controller does not require the knowledge of the manipulator parameters. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
