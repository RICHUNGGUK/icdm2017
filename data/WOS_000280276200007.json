We are given a set of items, where each item has a (non-negative) size and a color. We are also given an integer parameter k, and the goal is to partition the items into a minimum number of subsets such that for each subset S in the solution, the total size of the items in S is at most 1 (as in the classical bin packing problem) and the total number of colors of the items in S is at most k (which distinguishes our problem from the classical version). We follow earlier work on this problem and study the problem in both offline and online scenarios. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
