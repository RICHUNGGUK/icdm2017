The logic has two operators: EF phi, which says \"in some proper descendant phi holds\", and F(-1)phi, which says \"in some proper ancestor phi holds\". We present an algorithm for deciding if a regular language of unranked finite trees can be expressed in EF+F(-1). The algorithm uses a characterization expressed in terms of forest algebras.", "paper_title": "TWO-WAY UNARY TEMPORAL LOGIC OVER TREES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271784800005"}
