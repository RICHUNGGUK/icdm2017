The reservation CSMA/CA protocol is based on a hierarchical approach consisting of two sublayers. The lower sublayer of the protocol is designed to support asynchronous data traffic using CSMA/CA, while the upper sublayer is designed for QoS support by making a slot reservation via the three-way handshake. The bandwidth efficiency can be maximized with the slot reuse as much as possible. The proposed protocol has been validated using the ns network simulator with wireless and mobility extensions. The simulation results show that the reservation CSMA/CA offers the higher throughput with the higher load for real-time periodic traffic compared to the IEEE 802.11 standard, while providing deterministic delay performance.", "paper_title": "Reservation CSMA/CA for QoS support in mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100029"}
