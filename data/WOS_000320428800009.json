Each channel is characterized by an availability probability unknown to the SUs. We apply population game theory to model the spectrum access problem and develop distributed spectrum access policies based on imitation, a behavior rule widely applied in human societies consisting of imitating successful behaviors. We develop two imitation-based spectrum access policies based on the basic Proportional Imitation (PI) rule and the more advanced Double Imitation (DI) rule given that a SU can only imitate the other SUs operating on the same channel. A systematic theoretical analysis is presented for both policies on the induced imitation dynamics and the convergence properties of the proposed policies to the Nash equilibrium. Simple and natural, the proposed imitation-based spectrum access policies can be implemented distributedly based on solely local interactions and thus is especially suited in decentralized adaptive learning environments as cognitive radio networks.
