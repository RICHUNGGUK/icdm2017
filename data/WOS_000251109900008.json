Today, the need for desktop videoconferencing is experiencing robust growth in both business and consumer markets. However, the synchronous delivery of high-volume media content is still a big challenge under a current heterogeneous Internet environment. In this paper, we present a multiparty videoconferencing system based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) solution. The contribution of our paper is twofold. On the one hand, we design an application-level multicast scheme which intends to tolerate the heterogeneity in videoconferencing applications. Design tradeoffs are analyzed and our decisions are made based on extensive experimentation. On the other, we design a five-layer architecture for implementing a multiparty videoconferencing system. This architecture makes a clear-cut distinction between different functional modules and therefore provides rich flexibility in feature adaptation. We believe that our work can be a helpful reference in other efforts on building desktop videoconferencing systems.", "paper_title": "A multiparty videoconferencing system over an application-level multicast protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000251109900008"}
