But their approach is not efficient for situations in which some or all variables are restricted to lie within fuzzy lower and fuzzy upper bounds. In this paper, by a natural extension of their approach we obtain some new results leading to a new method to overcome this shortcoming.", "paper_title": "BOUNDED LINEAR PROGRAMS WITH TRAPEZOIDAL FUZZY NUMBERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279875900003"}
