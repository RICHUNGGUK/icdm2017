This study proposes novel features to describe leaf edge variation. The Bayes theorem is used to calculate the maximal matching score for rotary matching. The Viterbi training algorithm is then applied to find the model parameters of rotary matching. The experimental results show that the top one of 13-tuple reaches 94.4% and the first two can also achieve 100% in the test set. The results have verified that the proposed features are invariant to translation, rotation and size. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
