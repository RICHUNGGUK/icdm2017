A more general coupled nonlinearity is considered as perturbations of the network, while a serious faulty network named deteriorated network is also proposed to be further study. For the sake of eliminating these adverse impacts for synchronization, indirect adaptive schemes are designed to construct controllers and adjusters on pinned nodes and nonuniform couplings of un-pinned nodes, respectively. According to Lyapunov stability theory, the proposed adaptive strategies are successful in ensuring the achievement of asymptotic synchronization of the complex network even in the presence of perturbed and deteriorated networks. The proposed schemes are physically implemented by circuitries and tested by simulation on a Chua's circuit network.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Pinning Control of Deteriorated Nonlinear Coupling Networks With Circuit Realization", "paper_id": "WOS:000308965800001"}
