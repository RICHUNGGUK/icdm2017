We disprove this conjecture. A good cover is a collection of open sets in a\"e (d) such that the intersection of every subcollection is either empty or homeomorphic to an open d-ball. A simplicial complex is d-collapsible if it can be reduced to an empty complex by repeatedly removing a face of dimension at most d-1 which is contained in a unique maximal face.", "paper_title": "A Counterexample to Wegner's Conjecture on Good Covers", "paper_id": "WOS:000299057200003"}
