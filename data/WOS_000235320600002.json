This paper presents our work on bio-edutainment. Playing X games not only allows low age students to learn bio-molecular structure but also enables better understand complicated structure of bio-molecules. Immersive and interactive games may potentially motivate students to develop their interest to explore the wonder of life science. Based on our core Virtual Reality technology, the bio-edutainment system developed consists of mainly three components of visualization, modeling and interaction. Enabling technology includes also GPU technology, Networking, sensor technology and so on. The system was exhibited in Singapore Science Center. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
