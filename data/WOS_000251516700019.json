It is known that linear CPC grammar systems are more powerful than regular CPC grammar systems and that CPC grammar systems with context-free components are more powerful than linear CPC grammar systems. Here, the intermediate model of metalinear CPC grammar systems is studied. This is a CPC grammar system where the master is allowed to use metalinear rules whereas the remaining components are restricted to use linear rules only. It turns out that metalinear CPC grammar systems are more powerful than linear CPC grammar systems and less powerful than CPC grammar systems with context-free components. Furthermore, it is shown that all languages generated by metalinear CPC grammar systems are semilinear.", "paper_title": "On metalinear parallel communicating grammar systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516700019"}
