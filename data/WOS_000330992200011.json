In this paper we study the following problem: given an integer array , is there a word w over an arbitrary alphabet I pound such that for all i? Moreover, what is the minimum cardinality of I pound required? We give an elementary and self-contained time algorithm for this problem, thus improving the previously known solution (Duval et al. in Conference in honor of Donald E. Knuth, 2007), which had no polynomial time bound. Using both deeper combinatorial insight into the structure of pi' and advanced algorithmic tools, we further improve the running time to O(n).", "paper_title": "Validating the Knuth-Morris-Pratt Failure Function, Fast and Online", "paper_id": "WOS:000330992200011"}
