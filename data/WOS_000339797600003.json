In such applications, the noise and the dynamic range play very important roles, as the former dictates the minimum input signal level and the latter defines the maximum input signal level that can be applied to a system. This work concentrates on both of these specifications. The amplifier consists of a transimpedance amplifier followed by a voltage gain stage implemented using a current feedback amplifier. It is designed and fabricated using a 180 nm CMOS process. A noise figure of 3 dB is measured for a CMUT model with 10-30 MHz frequency range. The amplifier shows a dynamic range of 50 dB with 0.8 % total harmonic distortion for the full scale input current of 7 A mu A peak-to-peak.", "paper_title": "An in-probe receiver amplifier with 3 dB noise figure and 50 dB dynamic range for medical ultrasound imaging using CMUTs", "paper_id": "WOS:000339797600003"}
