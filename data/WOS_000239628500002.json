Bi-directional data communication metrics, hitherto dominated largely by text-based formats, has attained substantial up-gradation whereby global access vis-a-vis exchange of technical data has become a boon for the Internet users at large. However, presence of a common web-server in the communication loop has been indispensable till date. The present work reports a novel technique, whereby the web-server is bypassed and the web-enability is ensured by means of peer-to-peer socket communication between the client and the host in situ. The paper delineates algorithm of a new protocol and developmental semantics of the end-hardware for web-enabled communication in order to successfully orchestrate various domains of traditional client-server handshaking in a meaningful and synergistic manner. The developed protocol encompasses programming semantics of web-enabled applets, formulation logistics and portability issues over the Internet. The paper presents the real-life testing sequences for remote activation of a table-top robotic manipulator successively in a Local Area Network (LAN) and also in a Wide Area Network (WAN) and finally through the Internet, using a dedicated web-site.", "paper_title": "A distributed generic architecture for user-interactive Internet-based remote activation towards manoeuvring mechatronic systems in tandem", "paper_id": "WOS:000239628500002"}
