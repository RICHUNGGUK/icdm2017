The disconnected loops are also computed using stochastic methods with several noise reduction techniques. Various dilution schemes as well as the truncated solver method are studied. We make a comparison of these stochastic techniques to the exact results and show that the number of noise vectors depends on the operator insertion in the fermion loop. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
