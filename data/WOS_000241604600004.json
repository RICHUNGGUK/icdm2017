The proposed transceiver is suitable for communications with electronic devices that are powered through an inductive link. The circuit has been designed to be compatible with the communication standards ISO 14443. It operates at 13.56 MHz with a communication speed from 200 kHz up to 847 kHz. In modulation mode of operation, a solution based on programmable CMOS inverters is proposed to control the modulation depth in the range [0-100%]. The demodulator has been designed using versatile current rectifier and a simple operational transconductance amplifier stage. The proposed transceiver was implemented in a standard 0.5 mu m CMOS process. The circuit covers an area of 2 mm(2) and the total DC power consumption is lower than 5.3 mW under 4V DC supply voltage.", "paper_title": "13.56 MHz CMOS transceiver for RFID applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241604600004"}
