In the first scan, our proposed method first scans every fourth image line, and processes the scan line and its two neighbor lines. Then, it processes the remaining lines from top to bottom one by one. Our method decreases the average number of times that must be checked to process a foreground pixel will; thus, the efficiency of labeling can be improved.", "paper_title": "A New First-Scan Method for Two-Scan Labeling Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000308261400012"}
