In this paper Z(2)Z(4)-additive codes are studied. Their corresponding binary images, via the Gray map, are Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes, which seem to be a very distinguished class of binary group codes. As for binary and quaternary linear codes, for these codes the fundamental parameters are found and standard forms for generator and parity-check matrices are given. In order to do this, the appropriate concept of duality for Z(2)Z(4)-additive codes is defined and the parameters of their dual codes are computed.", "paper_title": "Z(2)Z(4)-linear codes: generator matrices and duality", "paper_id": "WOS:000273310600006"}
