In this paper, the MI series is proved to be chaotic, where its Hurst index is calculated to be 0.9391, and the maximum Lyapunov exponent is 0.1560. Then, the phase space of the MI series is reconstructed through Cao's method based on the obtained chaotic characteristics, and a novel MI, prediction model, Chaos-LSSVM, is proposed based on least squares support vectors (LSSVM) and chaos theory. Furthermore, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of LSSVM, and an optimal prediction model, PSO-Chaos-LSSVM, is thereby developed. Research on these proposed models is carried out with the data from a real industrial polypropylene plant, and the prediction results show that the performance of this prediction model is much better than the pure LSSVM model without chaotic theory.
