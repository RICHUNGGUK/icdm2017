This is a characteristic property of aperiodic order, for a non-repulsive tiling has arbitrarily large locally periodic patterns. We consider a non-periodic, repetitive tiling T of , with finite local complexity. From a spectral triple built on the discrete hull of T and its Connes distance, we derive two metrics and on . We show that T is repulsive if and only if and are Lipschitz equivalent. This generalises the previous works on subshifts by J. Kellendonk, D.
