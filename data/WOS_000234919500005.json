Deterioration due to fungal attack is believed to have a significant effect on the displacement and capacity performance of light-frame shearwalls. Some studies have shown that fungi tend to degrade properties of nailed connections common in light-frame structures, however, the effect on shearwall assemblies has not yet been quantified. The effect of biological deterioration (due to fungal attack) on cyclic performance of light-frame shearwalls was evaluated in this study by, first, fitting sets of hysteretic model parameters to single fastener sheathing-to-framing connections exposed to different levels of decay from brown rot fungi. Next, these model parameters were used as an input to a numerical model used to evaluate the cyclic behavior of complete shearwall assemblies. Finally, the output from this model was used in a nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis to evaluate displacement response of the shearwalls subject to a suite of ground motion records. The results were presented in the form of peak displacement distributions and fragility curves.", "paper_title": "The effect of biological deterioration on the seismic performance of woodframe shearwalls", "paper_id": "WOS:000234919500005"}
