These characteristics enable the combination of fingerprint recognition systems with template protection schemes that require as an input a fixed-length feature vector. Based on the spectral minutiae features, this paper introduces two feature reduction algorithms: the Column Principal Component Analysis and the Line Discrete Fourier Transform feature reductions, which can efficiently compress the template size with a reduction rate of 94%. With reduced features, we can also achieve a fast minutiae-based matching algorithm. This paper presents the performance of the spectral minutiae fingerprint recognition system and shows a matching speed with 125 000 comparisons per second on a PC with Intel Pentium D processor 2.80 GHz and 1 GB of RAM. This fast operation renders our system suitable as a preselector for a large-scale fingerprint identification system, thus significantly reducing the time to perform matching, especially in systems operating at geographical level (e.g., police patrolling) or in complex critical environments (e.g., airports).", "paper_title": "A Fast Minutiae-Based Fingerprint Recognition System", "paper_id": "WOS:000274019100005"}
