Both strategies are based on a reduction of the search space size of the metaheuristics. The first strategy that we introduce is a compression-expansion strategy, where the terms are arranged into sets of a given size. The second strategy we consider is the so-called restricted search, where the number of terms in the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing encodings is fixed to be a given number m. We describe the implementation of the strategies and analyze when they can be successful, and the main drawbacks associated with them. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
