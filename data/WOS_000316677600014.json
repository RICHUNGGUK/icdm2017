This study presents the quantitative results of Monte Carlo simulations of Li-doped silicon carbide nanotubes and its nucleic acid base complexes in water. Each species was first modeled by quantum mechanical calculations and then Monte Carlo simulations were applied to study their properties in aqueous solution. Solvation free energies were computed to indicate the solvation behavior of these compounds. The computations show that solvation free energies of the complexes of DNA bases with Li-doped SiC nanotubes are in the order: thymine > cytosine > adenine > guanine. The results of complexation free energies were also used to study the stability of related structures, which indicate that thymine-Li-doped SiC nanotubes produce the most stable compound among the four DNA base complexes.", "paper_title": "Study of DNA base-Li doped SiC nanotubes in aqueous solutions: a computer simulation study", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600014"}
