As a consequence, packet marking schemes can also be devised to differentiate packets belonging to a same TCP flow, with the goal of improving the performance experienced. This paper presents an analytical model for an adaptive packet marking scheme proposed in our previous work. The model combines three specific sub-models aimed at describing (i) the TCP sources aggregate, (ii) the marker, and (iii) the network status. Preliminary simulation results show quite accurate predictions for throughput and average queue occupancy. Besides, the research suggests new interesting guidelines to model queues fed by TCP traffic. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
