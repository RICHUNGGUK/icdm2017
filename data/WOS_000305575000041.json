Solving a system of differential equations called covariance evolution, one can obtain the scaling parameter. However, the covariance evolution has not been analytically solved. In this paper, we present the analytical solution of the covariance evolution for irregular LDPC code ensembles.", "paper_title": "Analytical Solution of Covariance Evolution for Irregular LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000305575000041"}
