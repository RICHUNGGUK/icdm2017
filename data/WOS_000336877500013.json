Therefore, a useful web service discovery approach for data and knowledge discovery process in the complex network environment is a very significant issue. Using the traditional keyword-based search method, users find it difficult to choose the best web services from those with similar functionalities. In addition, in an untrustworthy real world environment, the QoS-based service discovery approach cannot verify the correctness of the web services' Quality of Service (QoS) values, since such values guaranteed by a service provider are different from the real ones. This work proposes a trustworthy two-phase web service discovery mechanism based on QoS and collaborative filtering, which discovers and recommends the needed web services effectively for users in the distributed environment, and also solves the problem of services with incorrect QoS information. In the experiment, the theoretical analysis and simulation experiment results show that the proposed method can accurately recommend the needed services to users, and improve the recommendation quality.
