Two elemental forms of multi-input lower-triangular systems are proposed. Then, using the theory of singular distributions, the necessary and sufficient conditions under which multi-input nonlinear systems are locally feedback equivalent to these two lower-triangular systems are established. Furthermore, algorithms are provided to describe how to realize these equivalent transformations via state feedbacks and coordinate conversions.", "paper_title": "Geometric characterization of multi-input lower-triangular forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000293465200009"}
