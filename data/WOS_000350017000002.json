However, railways are changing due to rail networks being upgraded to include high speed lines. Therefore, to allow for the integration of high speed lines with current conventional railways there is a prevalent need for railway interchanges to be redesigned. The scope of this paper is to conduct a study to design a railway yard of the future, which will be able to facilitate an interchange between a high speed railway and a conventional railway. The design method implemented in this study is a progressive approach, which is based upon a simulation with subsequent evaluations and revisions. The final designs given in this study have been proven through evaluation to be a promising stream of rail research. The designs have also allowed for a discussion to be carried out on the economic benefits, which can be achieved for the United Kingdom's High Speed Two (HS2) project by utilising the railway interchanges designed in this study between the new high speed line and the current conventional rail network.
