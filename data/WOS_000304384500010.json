The proposed particle packing algorithm allows a drastic reduction of the numerical noise due to particle resettlement during the early stages of the flow evolution. Moreover, thanks to its structure, it can be easily derived starting from whatever SPH scheme and applies under the hypotheses that the fluid is weakly-compressible or incompressible as well. A broad range of numerical test cases proved this tool to be fast, robust and reliable also for complex geometrical configurations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
