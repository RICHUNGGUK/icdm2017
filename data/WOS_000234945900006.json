To define the structure of the model different t-norms and t-conorms are proposed. The fuzzification and the defuzzification phases are then added to the model so that we can consider the model like a controller. A learning algorithm to time the parameters that is based on a back-propagation algorithm and a recursive pseudoinverse matrix technique is introduced. Different experiments on synthetic and benchmark data are made. Several results using the UCl repository of Machine learning database are showed for classification and approximation tasks. The model is also compared with some other methods known in literature. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
