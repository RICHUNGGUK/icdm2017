The role of participants' subjective knowledge is also evaluated. The experimental results suggest that message framing, which describes a product's attribute in positive or negative terms, significantly influences participants' attitude toward and their intention to buy the product. In addition, participants' willingness to pay was significantly influenced by the presentation of anchors embedded in banner advertisements. Further, a significant interaction effect for message framing and anchor points indicate that their congruence enhances the effects of information presentation on people's responses. Specifically, describing a product attribute in positive terms along with a high anchor point induces more favorable response than any other framing and anchoring combinations. Finally, online shoppers who are low in product knowledge are more susceptible to framing and anchoring influences. The findings provide guidance for designing appropriate product and price cues to induce Internet consumer responses that favor online retailers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
