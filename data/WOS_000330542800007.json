The computation of isomer networks is computationally expensive with respect to both run time and memory. Accordingly, this paper focuses on the design of algorithms to compute isomer networks and their analysis on structurally diverse subsets of isomers of nicotine, tyrosine, and phenmetrazine generated using molecular quantum number nearest neighbors. An analysis correlating isomer networks to extended connectivity fingerprints is also provided.", "paper_title": "Social Network of Isomers Based on Bond Count Distance: Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000330542800007"}
