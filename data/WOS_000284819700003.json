In general, the grid workflow scheduling is a complex optimization problem which requires considering various scheduling criteria so as to meet a wide range of QoS requirements from users. Traditional researches into grid workflow scheduling mainly focus on the optimization constrained by time and cost. The key requirements for reliability, availability and security are not considered adequately. The main contribution of this study is to propose a new approach for trustworthy workflow scheduling in a large-scale grid with rich service resources, and present the RCPSO algorithm to optimize the scheduling performance in a multi-dimensional complex space. Experiments were done in two grid applications with at most 120 candidate services supplied to each task of various workflows. The results show better performance of the RCPSO in solving trustworthy scheduling of grid workflow problems as compared to GA, ACO and other recent variants of PSO. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
