We developed an opinion supernetwork model with social, environmental, psychological and keyword subnetworks. This model integrated a combination of external and internal factors which influence opinion formation. From a different perspective, we applied superedge prediction, which is a novel link prediction method based on the supernetwork model, to analyze emerging superedges in the opinion supernetwork model. Comparing the predicted network with actual network, we revealed a fair amount of consistency between them. In addition, based on the predicted opinion supernetwork model, we investigated opinion dynamics, which shed some light on public opinion governance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
