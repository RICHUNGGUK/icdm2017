Image analysis is used to extract useful information from the images. A clear problem when analyzing digital mammograms is that there is not a direct method to interpret pixel values. In this paper a method is presented that, performs the estimation of the amount of glandular tissue in digital mammograms. This contribution also shows how this knowledge about the pixels allows performing a segmentation of the breast region in its constituent parts; and if present, microcalcifications may be detected.", "paper_title": "A method for interpreting pixel grey levels in digital mammography", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600052"}
