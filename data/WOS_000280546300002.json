Here we show the converse implication, thus answering an open question posed by Cook and Krajicek. We obtain this result by formalizing in PV a hard/easy argument of Buhrman et al. [2003]. In addition, we continue the investigation of propositional proof systems using advice, initiated by Cook and Krajicek. In particular, we obtain several optimality results for proof systems using advice. We further show that these optimal systems are equivalent to natural extensions of Frege systems.", "paper_title": "A Tight Karp-Lipton Collapse Result in Bounded Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000280546300002"}
