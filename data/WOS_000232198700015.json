A meaningful concept of solution for the underlying population games will necessarily include robustness against any possible unilateral deviation undertaken by a single player. By excluding the invisible hand of mutation we obtain a purely deterministic population model. The resulting process of cellular transformation is then analyzed for chicken and stag-hunt type cellular games and finally compared with the outcomes of more prominent evolutionary models. Special emphasis is given to an exhaustive combinatorial description of the different basins of attraction corresponding to stable stationary states. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
