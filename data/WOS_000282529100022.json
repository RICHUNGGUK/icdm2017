Experiments show that FDA works well on the complete set of 1500 instances proposed by Bischoff, Ratcliff and Davies. Especially for the 800 difficult strongly heterogeneous instances among them, FDA outperforms other algorithms with an average volume utilization of 91.91%, which to our knowledge is 0.45% higher than current best result just reported in 2010.
