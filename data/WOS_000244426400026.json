The issue here is how to model a combination of complex situations among agents where there are disagreements leading to a conflict situation, and there is a need for an acceptable set of agreements. Conflict situations also result due to different sets of view points about issues under negotiation. The solution to this problem stems from pioneering work on this subject by Zdzislaw Pawlak, which provides a basis for a complex conflict model encapsulating a decision system with complex decisions. Several approaches to the analysis of conflicts situations are presented in this paper, namely, conflict graphs, approximation spaces and risk patterns. An illustrative example of a requirements scope negotiation for an automated lighting system is presented. The contribution of this paper is a rough set-based requirements scope determination model and assessment mechanisms using a complex conflict model.", "paper_title": "Approaches to conflict dynamics based on rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000244426400026"}
