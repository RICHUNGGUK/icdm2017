Let nu(F0) (H) denote the maximum size vertical bar F vertical bar of an F-0-packing of H. Already in the case of graphs, computing nu(F0) (H) is NP-hard for most fixed F-0 (Dor and Tarsi [6]). In this paper, we consider the case when F-0 is a fixed linear k-graph. We establish an algorithm which, for zeta > 0 and a given k-graph H, constructs in time polynomial in vertical bar V(H)vertical bar an F-0-packing of H of size at least nu(F0) (H) - zeta vertical bar V(H)vertical bar(k). Our result extends one of Haxell and Rodl, who established the analogous algorithm for graphs.", "paper_title": "Constructive Packings by Linear Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000325645400002"}
