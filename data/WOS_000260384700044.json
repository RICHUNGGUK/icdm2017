First, there are few proven methods to flexibly and concisely define general temporal patterns for visualization. Second, with large time-dependent data sets, as typical with today's large-scale simulations, scalable and general solutions for handling the data are still not widely available. In this work, we have developed a textual pattern matching approach for specifying and identifying general temporal patterns. Besides defining the formalism of the language, we also provide a working implementation with sufficient efficiency and scalability to handle large data sets. Using recent large-scale simulation data from multiple application domains, we demonstrate that our visualization approach is one of the first to empower a concept driven exploration of large-scale time-varying multivariate data.", "paper_title": "Visualizing Temporal Patterns in Large Multivariate Data using Textual Pattern Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000260384700044"}
