Faced with massive mobile services, a top priority of mobile information systems is how to find the best services and compose them into new value-added services (e.g., location-based services). Hence, service selection is one of the most fundamental operations in mobile information systems. Traditional implementation of service selection suffers from the problems of a huge number of services and reliability. We present an efficient approach to service selection based on computing QoS uncertainty that achieves the best solution in two senses: (1) the time cost for finding the best services is short and (2) the reliability of the selected services is high. We have implemented our approach in experiments with real-world and synthetic datasets. Our results show that our approach improves on the other approaches tested.", "paper_title": "Efficient Service Selection in Mobile Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357476300001"}
