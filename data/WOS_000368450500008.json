However, it is still challenging to implement soft-in soft-output detectors for MIMO systems due to heavy burden in computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a soft detection algorithm for MIMO systems which performs close to the full dimensional joint detection, yet offers significant complexity reduction over the existing detectors. The proposed algorithm, referred to as soft-input soft-output successive group (SSG) detector, detects a subset of symbols (called a symbol group) successively using a deliberately designed preprocessing to suppress the inter-group interference. In fact, the proposed preprocessor mitigates the effect of the interfering symbol groups successively using a priori information of the undetected groups and a posteriori information of the detected groups. Simulation results on realistic MIMO systems demonstrate that the proposed SSG detector achieves considerable complexity reduction over the conventional approaches with negligible performance loss.", "paper_title": "Iterative Group Detection and Decoding for Large MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000368450500008"}
