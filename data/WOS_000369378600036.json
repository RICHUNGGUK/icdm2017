Meanwhile, an inevitable problem is how to evaluate and preserve the consistency of multi-scale spatial data. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of homonymous points and homonymous entities based on innate characteristics of spatial data and put forward a seamless constraint model of multi-scale representation of geographic information that involves time, geometry, spatial relations and semantic characteristics. According to this model, a consistency assessment method has been implemented by computing similarities between vector data at three different scales. The main contributions of this paper are the proposal of a consistency constraint model and assessment system of multi-scale spatial data.", "paper_title": "A Seamless Constraint Model of Multi-Scale Representation of Geographical Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000369378600036"}
