Distribution automation systems need decision making regarding the responsibilities being performed by operators. On the other hand, there is the possibility of incorrect decision making by operators due to the large volume of information and decision making time shortage during automation steps which can be created by incorrect information received from the network and consequently causes the incorrect control command sending to distribution network devices. Also, introducing the Distributed Generations (DGs) in the protection system of distribution network, it is possible for the protective devices to have an incorrect operation which affects the operators' decisions performed by the automation system. In this paper, a new Petri-Net modeling method is used to make the distribution network monitoring and automation possible and also to help the operator in correct decision making. In addition, the protective devices' operation is determined more reliably using the attained data from the automation system.", "paper_title": "Automation and monitoring of the distribution network in presence of distributed generations by using Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000362627100032"}
