Time discretization is done fully implicit using backward differentiation formulae (BDF) of varying order from 1 to 4. We show that the original equation for the pressure correction can be modified by using an equivalent operator stemming from the symmetric interior penalty (SIP) method leading to a reduced stencil size.To assess the accuracy as well as the stability and the performance of the scheme, three different test cases are carried out: the Taylor vortex flow, the Orr-Sommerfeld stability problem for plane Poiseuille flow and the flow past a square cylinder. (1) Simulating the Taylor vortex flow, we verify the temporal accuracy for the different BDF schemes. Using the mixed-order formulation, a spatial convergence study yields convergence rates of k + 1 and k in the L-2-norm for velocity and pressure, respectively. For the equal-order formulation, we obtain approximately the same convergence rates, while the absolute error is smaller. (2) The stability of our method is examined by simulating the Orr-Sommerfeld stability problem. Using the mixed-order formulation and adjusting the penalty parameter of the symmetric interior penalty method for the discretization of the viscous part, we can demonstrate the long-term stability of the algorithm. Using pressure stabilization the equal-order formulation is stable without changing the penalty parameter. (3) Finally, the results for the flow past a square cylinder show excellent agreement with numerical reference solutions as well as experiments.
