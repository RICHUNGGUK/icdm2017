Two commodities are incompatible if they cannot be transported together into the same vehicle. Vehicles are allowed to perform several trips during the working day. The objective is to minimize the number of used vehicles. We propose an Iterated Local Search that outperforms the previous algorithm designed for the problem. Moreover, we conduct an analysis on the benefit that can be obtained introducing the multi-trip aspect at the fleet dimensioning level. Results on classical VRPTW instances show that, in some cases, the fleet can be halved. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
