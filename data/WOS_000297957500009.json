Recently, many approaches based on the idea of \"learning to rank\" have been proposed for doing ranking. Most of them consider all the documents of the training queries to build a static, query-independent ranking model. In this paper, we propose an adaptive, query-dependent framework for learning to rank based on a distributional similarity measure for gauging the similarity between queries. For each training query, one individual ranking model is learned from its associated set of documents. When a new query is consulted, the individual trained models of those training queries most similar to the new query are obtained and combined into a joint model which is then used to rank the documents retrieved for the new query. Experimental results show that our proposed approach works very well compared with other methods.", "paper_title": "RANKOM: A QUERY-DEPENDENT RANKING SYSTEM FOR INFORMATION RETRIEVAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500009"}
