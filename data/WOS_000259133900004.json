GMC is an extension of the Budgeted Maximum Coverage Problem, and it has important applications in wireless OFDMA scheduling. We use a variation of the greedy algorithm to produce a ((2e - 1)1(e - 1) + epsilon)-approximation for every epsilon > 0, and then use partial enumeration to reduce the approximation ratio to e/(e - 1) + epsilon.
