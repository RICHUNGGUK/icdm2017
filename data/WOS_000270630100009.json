An Improved Primal Simplex algorithm for degenerate linear programs. SIAM journal of Optimization, submitted for publication] is a dynamic constraint reduction method particularly effective on degenerate linear programs. It is able to achieve a reduction in CPU time of over a factor of three on some problems compared to the commercial implementation of the simplex method CPLEX. We present a number of further improvements and effective parameter choices for IPS. On certain types of degenerate problems, our improvements yield CPU times lower than those of CPLEX by a factor of 12. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
