Here we introduce Bio-Community, an open-source, collaborative toolkit that extends BioPerl. Bio-Community interfaces with commonly used programs using various file formats, including BIOM, and provides operations such as rarefaction and taxonomic summaries. Bio-Community will help bioinformaticians to quickly piece together custom analysis pipelines and develop novel software. Availability an implementation: Bio-Community is cross-platform Perl code available from http://search. cpan. org/dist/Bio-Community under the Perl license. A readme file describes software installation and how to contribute.", "paper_title": "The Bio-Community Perl toolkit for microbial ecology", "paper_id": "WOS:000339121900020"}
