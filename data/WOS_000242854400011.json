Beyond 3G will introduce reconfiguration capabilities to flexibly and dynamically (i.e., during operation) adapt the wireless protocol stacks to better meet the ever-changing service requirements. For the dynamic reconfiguration of protocol stacks during runtime operation to become a practical capability of mobile communication systems, it is necessary to establish a software architecture that functionally supports reconfiguration. In the present paper, a generic architecture and respective mechanisms to achieve protocol stack and component based protocol layer reconfiguration are proposed.", "paper_title": "Generic architecture and mechanisms for protocol reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000242854400011"}
