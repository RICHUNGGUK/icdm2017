In our former work, we presented a pre-filter solution for multiuser reconstruction in ICA based MIMO-OFDM systems [1,2]. Here, based on the structure of the system and former pre-filter solution, an optimization problem has been designed to give us the optimum pre-filter. The designed problem is based on minimization of the estimation error of ambiguities inherent to ICA in reconstruction of the data after separation. The optimization problem is mathematically solved and a set of optimized coefficients are obtained. Among the obtained set as optimum coefficients, optimum coefficients are acquired in a way not only minimize the estimation error of multiuser data reconstruction, but also lead the least error probability in detection of demodulated symbols.", "paper_title": "AN OPTIMUM PRE-FILTER FOR ICA BASED MULTI-INPUT MULTI-OUTPUT OFDM SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711600033"}
