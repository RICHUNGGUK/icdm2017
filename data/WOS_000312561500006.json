Several ways to control the capacity market are analyzed. For each way, the equilibrium state of the model for the rational behavior of producers is matched to the solution to the problem on the optimal configuration of the generating equipment. The results are used to state propositions on optimal capacity market structure.", "paper_title": "Game-theoretical control models for electric power and capacity market", "paper_id": "WOS:000312561500006"}
