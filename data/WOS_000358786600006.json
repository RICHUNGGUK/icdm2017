As generic frame fields ( with arbitrary anisotropy, orientation, and sizing) can be regarded as cross fields in a specific Riemannian metric, we tackle frame field design by first computing a discrete metric on the input surface that is compatible with a sparse or dense set of input constraints. The final frame field is then found by computing an optimal cross field in this customized metric. We propose frame field design constraints on alignment, size, and skewness at arbitrary locations on the mesh as well as along feature curves, offering much improved flexibility over previous approaches. We demonstrate the advantages of our frame field generation through the automatic quadrangulation of man-made and organic shapes with controllable anisotropy, robust handling of narrow surface strips, and precise feature alignment. We also extend our technique to the design of n-vector fields.", "paper_title": "Frame Field Generation through Metric Customization", "paper_id": "WOS:000358786600006"}
