At the same time, Business Process Management (BPM) tools are being increasingly used in the modeling of organizations' business practices and processes, but their life cycle has shown to have some shortages (as the possibility to obtain context-dependent plan instances). In this paper we present a methodology and software framework to translate Business Process Models into HTN P&S domains, in order to cover some of these deficiencies.", "paper_title": "From business process models to hierarchical task network planning domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000318629400005"}
