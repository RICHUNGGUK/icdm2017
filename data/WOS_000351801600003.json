The time-varying delay and actuator fault are first taken into account for the IT2 fuzzy discrete-time systems. The novel IT2 state-feedback controller and the IT2 fuzzy model share different lower and upper membership functions. The fault-tolerant controller is designed to compensate for the effect of faults by stabilizing the closed-loop system under the actuator failures. Furthermore, the standard 112 state-feedback controller is designed such that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable and has an H infinity performance. The obtained conditions of the fault-tolerant controller and the standard IT2 controller can be expressed by the convex optimization problems. A numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
