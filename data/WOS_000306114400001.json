Methods: Qualitative usability study methods were used, including the use of scenario walk-throughs, contextual inquiries, thematic interviews and inspection-based expert reviews in the users' clinical contexts. Results: The nursing process model was shown to be feasible in nursing practice but the national nursing classification was considered too detailed, multi-layered and difficult to use and understand. The four evaluated nursing documentation systems had many usability problems which resulted in them being difficult to use and produced extra documentation workload. Generally, electronic nursing documentation improves patients' and health professionals' legal protection and makes nursing care more transparent; however, the documentation systems did not provide good support for multi-professional care and information exchange. Conclusions: Nursing models should comply better with nursing practices and support nurses in patient care and interventions. An essential improvement in practice would be the use of specific templates that are easy to apply in specific situations with homogeneous patient groups. Collaborative care aspects and better utilization of information require that the nursing model is designed to support not just documentation but also information utilization.
