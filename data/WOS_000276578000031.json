Previous works have used circularity to describe the shape feature for different objects. However, the circularity is insensitive to some objects, especially the objects with similar shape. In this paper, we propose an alternative shape feature, roundness curve, to represent the shape of object. The roundness curve is generated by applying the central projection method to binary images. First of all, centroid of each object is calculated. Then, the centroid projects radiate to acquire projection value in pre-defined directions. The roundness curve in an orthogonal coordinate system is established by the projection values and their indices on its two axes respectively. We use the proposed method in classification of kinds of microscopic cell images. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and robustness of our method, it outperforms the conventional circularity.", "paper_title": "ROUNDNESS CURVE OF SHAPE AND APPLICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000276578000031"}
