In a realistic setting - with non-orthogonal grid, and anisotropic, heterogeneous permeability - special discretization techniques are required. Mixed finite element (MFE) and multipoint flux approximation (MPFA) are two methods that can handle such situations. Previously, a framework for analytical comparison of MFE and MPFA in special cases has been suggested. A comparison of MFE and MPFA-O (one of two main variants of MPFA) for isotropic, homogeneous permeability on a uniformly distorted grid was also performed. In the current paper, we utilize the suggested framework in a slightly different manner to analyze and compare MFE, MPFA-O and MPFA-U (the second main variant of MPFA). We reconsider the case previously analyzed. We also consider the case of generally anisotropic, homogeneous permeability on an orthogonal grid.", "paper_title": "Analysis and comparison of mixed finite element and multipoint flux approximation methods for homogeneous media", "paper_id": "WOS:000244447400005"}
