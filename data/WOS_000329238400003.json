Sleep monitoring by itself is a difficult problem due to both privacy and technical considerations. The proposed system uses a combination of non-invasive sensors to assess and report sleep patterns: a contact-based pressure mattress and a non-contact 3D image acquisition device, which can complement each other. To evaluate our system, we used real data collected in Heracleia Lab's assistive living apartment. Our system uses Machine Learning techniques to automatically analyze the collected data and recognize sleep patterns. It is non-invasive, as it does not disrupt the user's usual sleeping behavior and it can be used both at the clinic and at home with minimal cost.", "paper_title": "Non-invasive analysis of sleep patterns via multimodal sensor input", "paper_id": "WOS:000329238400003"}
