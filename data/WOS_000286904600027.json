The literature review indicates that meta-heuristics may be used for combinatorial decision-making problem in FMS and simple genetic algorithm (SGA) is one of the meta-heuristics that has attracted many researchers. This novel approach combines KB (which uses the power of tacit and implicit expert knowledge) and inherent quality of SGA for searching the optima simultaneously. In this novel approach, the knowledge has been used on four different stages of SGA: initialization, selection, crossover, and mutation. Two objective functions known as throughput and mean flow time, have been taken to measure the performance of the FMS. The usefulness of the algorithm has been measured on the basis of number of generations used for achieving better results than SGA. To show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, a numerical example of scheduling data set has been tested. The KBGA was also tested on 10 different moderate size of data set to show its robustness for large sized problems involving flexibility (that offers multiple options) in FMS. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
