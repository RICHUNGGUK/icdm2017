This paper developed a hybrid control strategy for the laminar cooling process that integrates Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks and Case-Based Reasoning (CBR). The spraying pattern and the first activated headers are found by a case-based reasoner, while the number of activated headers is calculated in real time by RBF networks. Experimental studies using production data from a hot strip mill show the superior performance of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Hybrid intelligent control strategy of the laminar cooling process", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300125"}
