This article seeks to solve point (2) by using a method (OM, Ontology Merging), with its algorithm and implementation, to fuse two ontologies (coming from Web documents) without human intervention, producing a third ontology, taking into account the inconsistencies, contradictions and redundancies between them, thus delivering an answer close to reality. Results of OM working on ontologies extracted from Web documents are shown. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
