The method automatically analyzes a circuit netlist to generate sizing constraints. These sizing constraints are considered during a subsequent numerical optimization. It is the first method that computes symmetry constraints for sizing, based on the hierarchical structure of the circuit and a qualitative signal flow. As a unique feature, the method is capable of handling multiple signal and feedback paths, leading to multiple symmetry axes. It can be applied to linear and nonlinear circuits and any available sizing algorithm. Experimental results show that the runtime of analog sizing, as well as of result quality, are greatly improved.", "paper_title": "MARS: Matching-Driven Analog Sizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000306595100001"}
