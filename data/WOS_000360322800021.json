CXCR2 and its ligand, CXCL8, are implicated in a number of inflammation-mediated diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and cancer. Though the development of CXCR2-specific small-molecule inhibitors as anti-inflammatory agents has been pursued by pharmaceutical companies within the past decade, there are currently no clinically approved CXCR2 inhibitors. A pharmacophore model based on previously reported CXCR2 antagonists was developed to screen a database of commercially available compounds. Small-molecule compounds identified from the pharmacophore screening were selected for in vitro screening in a cell-based CXCR2-mediated beta-arrestin-2 recruitment assay and further characterized in several cell-based assays and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung inflammation studies in mice. CX compounds identified from pharmacophore modeling inhibited cell migration, lung and colon cancer cell proliferation, and colony formation. Mechanistic studies of CX4152 showed that this compound inhibits CXCR2 signaling through downregulation of surface CXCR2. Additionally, CX4152 significantly inhibits CXCL8-mediated neutrophil migration and LPS-induced lung inflammation in mice. Using a CXCR2-inhibitor-based pharmacophore model, we identified a novel set of sulfonamides from a diverse library of small molecules. These compounds inhibit CXCR2/beta-arrestin-2 association, cell migration and proliferation, and acute inflammation in mouse models. CX compounds identified from our pharmacophore models are potential leads for further optimization and development as anti-inflammatory and anticancer agents.", "paper_title": "Discovery of Novel CXCR2 Inhibitors Using Ligand-Based Pharmacophore Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000360322800021"}
