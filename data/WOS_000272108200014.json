In this paper, we consider the problem of embedding cycles and paths into faulty 3-ary n-cubes. Let F be a set of faulty nodes and/or edges, and n >= 2. We show that when vertical bar F vertical bar <= 2n - 2, there exists a cycle of any length from 3 to vertical bar V(Q(n)(3) - F)vertical bar in Q(n)(3) - F. We also prove that when vertical bar F vertical bar <= 2n - 3, there exists a path of any length from 2n - 1 to vertical bar V(Q(n)(3) - F)vertical bar - 1 between two arbitrary nodes in Q(n)(3) - F. Since the k-ary n-cube is regular of degree 2n. the fault-tolerant degrees 2n - 2 and 2n - 3 are optimal. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
