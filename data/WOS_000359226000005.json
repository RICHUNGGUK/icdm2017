Pairwise constraints (PC) are used to specify the types (intra-or inter-class) of points with labels. Since the number of labeled data is typically small in SSL setting, the core idea of this framework is to create and enrich the PC sets using the propagated soft labels from both labeled and unlabeled data by special label propagation (SLP), and hence obtaining more supervised information for delivering enhanced performance. We also propose a Two-stage Sparse Coding, termed TSC, for achieving adaptive neighborhood for SLP. The first stage aims at correcting the possible corruptions in data and training an informative dictionary, and the second stage focuses on sparse coding. To deliver enhanced inter-class separation and intra-class compactness, we also present a mixed soft-similarity measure to evaluate the similarity/dissimilarity of constrained pairs using the sparse codes and outputted probabilistic values by SLP. Simulations on the synthetic and real datasets demonstrated the validity of our algorithms for data representation and image recognition, compared with other related state-of-the-art graph based semi-supervised techniques.", "paper_title": "Graph Based Constrained Semi-Supervised Learning Framework via Label Propagation over Adaptive Neighborhood", "paper_id": "WOS:000359226000005"}
