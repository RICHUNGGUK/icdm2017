A spin gas consists of a (large) number of interacting particles whose random motion is described classically while their internal degrees of freedom are described quantum- mechanically. We determine the entanglement that occurs naturally in such systems for specific types of quantum interactions. At the same time, these systems provide microscopic models for non-Markovian decoherence: the interaction of a group of particles with other particles belonging to a background gas are treated exactly, and differences between collective and non-collective decoherence processes are studied. We give quantitative results for the Boltzmann gas and also for a lattice gas, which could be realized by neutral atoms hopping in an optical lattice. These models can be simulated effciently for systems of mesoscopic sizes (N similar to 10(5)).", "paper_title": "Entanglement and decoherence in spin gases", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175600004"}
