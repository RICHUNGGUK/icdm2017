First, we give a new and quantitative proof of the fact that a single-hidden layer wavelet neural network with n + 1 hidden neurons can interpolate n + 1 distinct samples with zero error. Then, without training, we constructed a wavelet neural network X (a) (x, A), which can approximately interpolate, with arbitrary precision, any set of distinct data in one or several dimensions. The given wavelet neural network can uniformly approximate any continuous function of one variable.", "paper_title": "Constructive approximation to real function by wavelet neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649100003"}
