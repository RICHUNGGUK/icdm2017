We say an object is finite if it has a finite number of M-subobjects. In this paper, we show that in finitary M-adhesive categories we not only have all the well-known HLR properties of weak adhesive HLR categories, which are already valid for M-adhesive categories, but also all the additional HLR requirements needed to prove classical results including the Local Church-Rosser, Parallelism, Concurrency, Embedding, Extension and Local Confluence Theorems, where the last of these is based on critical pairs. More precisely, we are able to show that finitary M-adhesive categories have a unique epsilon-M factorisation and initial pushouts, and the existence of an M-initial object implies we also have finite coproducts and a unique epsilon'-M pair factorisation. Moreover, we can show that the finitary restriction of each M-adhesive category is a finitary M-adhesive category, and finitarity is preserved under functor and comma category constructions based on M-adhesive categories. This means that all the classical results are also valid for corresponding finitary M-adhesive transformation systems including several kinds of finitary graph and Petri net transformation systems. Finally, we discuss how some of the results can be extended to non-M-adhesive categories.", "paper_title": "Finitary M-adhesive categories", "paper_id": "WOS:000343644000003"}
