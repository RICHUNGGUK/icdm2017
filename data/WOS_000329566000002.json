The winner of the existential k-pebble game on two given finite structures can be determined in time O(n(2k)) by dynamic programming on the graph of game configurations. We show that there is no O(n((k-3)/12))-time algorithm that decides which player can win the existential k-pebble game on two given structures. This lower bound is unconditional and does not rely on any complexity-theoretic assumptions. Establishing strong k-consistency is a well-known heuristic for solving the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). By the game characterization of Kolaitis and Vardi [14] our result implies that there is no O(n((k-3)/12))-time algorithm that decides if strong k-consistency can be established for a given CSP-instance.", "paper_title": "LOWER BOUNDS FOR EXISTENTIAL PEBBLE GAMES AND k-CONSISTENCY TESTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000329566000002"}
