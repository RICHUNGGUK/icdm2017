A distortionless selected mapping (SLM) has been proposed to reduce the PAPR, but a high computational complexity prohibits its application to an OFDM system with a large number of subcarriers. Recently, we proposed OFDM combined with time division multiplexing (OFDM/TDM) using minimum mean square error frequency-domain equalization (MMSE-FDE) to improve the bit error rate (BER) performance of conventional OFDM with a lower PAPR. The PAPR problem, however, cannot be completely eliminated. In this paper, we present an SLM combined with symbol re-mapping for OFDM/TDM using MMSE-FDE. Unlike the conventional OFDM, where SLM is applied over subcarriers in the frequency domain, we exploit both time and frequency dimensions of OFDM/TDM signal to improve the performance with respect to PAPR and BER. A mathematical model for PAPR distribution of OFDM/TDM with SLM is presented to complement the computer simulation results. It is shown that proposed SLM can further reduce the PAPR without sacrificing the BER performance with the same or reduced computational complexity.
