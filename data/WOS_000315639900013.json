Power and ground distribution network noise produced during SLEEP to ACTIVE mode transitions is an important reliability concern in MTCMOS circuits. Sleep signal slew rate modulation techniques for suppressing mode-transition noise are explored in this paper. A triple-phase sleep signal slew rate modulation (TPS) technique with a novel digital sleep signal generator is proposed. Reactivation time, mode-transition energy consumption, leakage power consumption, and layout area of different MTCMOS circuits are characterized under an equal-noise constraint. Influences of within-die and die-to-die parameter variations on the reactivation noise, time, and energy consumption of sleep signal slew rate modulated MTCMOS circuits are evaluated with a process imperfections aware robustness metric. The proposed triple-phase sleep signal slew rate modulation technique enhances the tolerance to process parameter fluctuations by up to 183.1x as compared to various alternative MTCMOS noise suppression techniques in a UMC 80-nm CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Reactivation Noise Suppression With Sleep Signal Slew Rate Modulation in MTCMOS Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900013"}
