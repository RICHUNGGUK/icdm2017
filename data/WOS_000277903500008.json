We show that Homily polynomials of the whole family of even polyhedral links can be obtained from the Tutte polynomial of the 1-skeleton of the polyhedron by special parametrizations. As applications, by using computer algebra (Maple) techniques, Homily polynomials of even Platonic polyhedral links are calculated.", "paper_title": "The Homfly Polynomial for Even Polyhedral Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000277903500008"}
