In fact, human error, low performance, drowsiness and distraction may account for a majority in all the accident causation. Active safety systems are unaware of the context and driver status, so these systems cannot improve these figures. Therefore, this study proposes a 'context and driver aware' (CDA) AVS system structure as a first step in realizing robust, human-centric and intelligent active safety systems. This work develops, evaluates and combines three sub-modules all employing a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)/Universal Background Model (UBM) and likelihood maximization learning scheme: biometric driver identification, maneuver recognition, and distraction detection. The resultant combined system contributes in three areas: (1) robust identification: a speaker recognition system is developed in an audio modality to identify the driver in-vehicle conditions requiring robust operation; (2) narrow the available information space for fusion: maneuver recognition system uses estimated driver identification to prune the selection of models and further restrict search space in a novel distraction detection system; (3) response time and performance: the system quickly produces a prediction of driver's distracted behaviour for possible use in accident prevention/avoidance. Overall system performance of the combined system is evaluated on the UTDrive Corpus, confirming the suitability of the proposed system for critical imminent accident cases with narrow time windows.
