Our approach incorporates geographic location and a transportation model into our existing region-based, closed-world EpiGraph simulator to model a more realistic movement of the virus between different geographic areas. This paper describes the MPI-based implementation of this simulator, including several optimization techniques such as a novel approach for mapping processes onto available processing elements based on the temporal distribution of process loads. We present an extensive evaluation of EpiGraph in terms of its ability to simulate large-scale scenarios, as well as from a performance perspective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
