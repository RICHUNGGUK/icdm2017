The performance of these algorithms is ranked in terms of the improvement they contribute to the speech recognition accuracy, when compared to the baseline performance, i.e. without speech enhancement. The experiments on the MoveOn motorcycle speech and noise database indicated that there is no equivalence between the ranking of algorithms based on the human perception of speech quality and the speech recognition performance. The Multi-band spectral subtraction method was observed to lead to the highest speech recognition performance.", "paper_title": "SPEECH ENHANCEMENT FOR ROBUST SPEECH RECOGNITION IN MOTORCYCLE ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000276978900003"}
