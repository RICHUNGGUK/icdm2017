We use all the web pages from Jan 1st 2005 to Dec 31st 2005, and detect new events by using incremental TF-IDF model and incremental cluster algorithm. Based on analysis of the attributes of events, we propose a method to measure the activity of events, then filter and sort the event according to the activity of events; finally a hot event list can be derived.", "paper_title": "Semi-automatic hot event detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200110"}
