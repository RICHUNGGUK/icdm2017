This study intends to integrate PSOA with K-means to cluster data. It is shown that PSOA can be employed to find the centroids of a user-specified number of clusters. The proposed PSOA is evaluated using four data sets, and compared to the performance of some other PSOA-based methods and K-means method. Computational results show that the proposed method has much potential. A real-world problem for order clustering also illustrates that the proposed method is quite promising.", "paper_title": "An application of particle swarm optimization algorithm to clustering analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000287451000011"}
