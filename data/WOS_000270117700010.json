The self-diagnosis problem of hypermesh, emerging potential optical interconnection networks for multiprocessor systems, is solved in this paper. We derive that the precise one-step diagnosability of k(n)-hypermesh is n(k - 1). Based on the principle of cycle decomposition, a one-step t-fault diagnosis algorithm for k(n)-hypermesh which runs in O(k(n)n(k - 1)) time also is described. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
