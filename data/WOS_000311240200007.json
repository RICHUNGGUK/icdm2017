Any passenger information system depends on several underlying heterogeneous information systems; ranging from the management of transport infrastructure networks, public transport infrastructure objects, public passenger transport services, and public transport processes and regulations. Public transport service providers have their own local information systems that should be vertically interoperable with their national passenger information system. In the future, a trans-national interoperability system is anticipated for national passenger information systems when journey-planning across Europe. This paper explores the interoperability of passenger information systems and any appropriate ITS standards. An existing information system for the management of public passenger transport is described, and a proposal put forward for implementing sustainable interoperability requirements. Finally, a European Passenger Information System - EPIS is proposed as a new solution for the possible sustainable trans-national interoperability of passenger information systems across Europe.
