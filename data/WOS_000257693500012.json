Both Lipschitz continuous activation function and monotone nondecreasing activation function are considered. Globally delay-dependent stability criteria are derived in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) through the use of Leibniz-Newton formula and relaxation matrices. Moreover, the constraint that derivative of time-varying delays must be smaller than one is released for the proposed control scheme. Finally, two numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed criterion.", "paper_title": "A delay-dependent approach to stability for static recurrent neural networks with mixed time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500012"}
