(a negotiation support system) based on the Kansei of group members using SOM. Firstly, we evaluate commodities in the real world by Kansei scores in Kansei Engineering. Secondly, we make a SOM map based on the Kansei scores of both the commodities in the real world and ideal commodities of the group members. If the Kansei scores of the ideal commodities of,members are far away from each other on the SOM map, the system shows some compromises to each member for negotiation and makes a request to members for a Small change of Kansei scores. Thirdly, when the Kansei scores of their compromised commodities gather into a small area on the SOM map, the system judges that the compromise has been completed and then shows some commodities in the real world nearest to the area as a negotiation result of members. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed system is verified by satisfaction ratings of the members with the output results of the system comparing with no negotiation cases.", "paper_title": "A PROPOSAL OF GROUP DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR KANSEI COMMODITY PURCHASE USING SOM AND ITS APPLICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000018"}
