It is natural to wonder how 'close' to intersecting a family of size greater than 2(n-1) can be. Katona, Katona and Katona introduced the idea of a 'most probably intersecting family'. Suppose that A is a family and that 0 < p < 1. Let A(p) be the (random) family formed by selecting each set in A independently with probability p. A family A is most probably intersecting if it maximizes the probability that A(p) is intersecting over all families of size vertical bar A vertical bar. Katona, Katona and Katona conjectured that there is a nested sequence consisting of most probably intersecting families of every possible size. We show that this conjecture is false for every value of p provided that n is sufficiently large.", "paper_title": "Probably Intersecting Families are Not Nested", "paper_id": "WOS:000312036300010"}
