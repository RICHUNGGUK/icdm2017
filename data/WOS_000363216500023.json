This makes automatic synthesis of handwriting characters and paragraphs very challenging. In this paper, we propose a method for synthesizing handwriting texts according to a writer's handwriting style. The synthesis algorithm is composed by two phases. First, we create the multidimensional morphable models for different characters based on one writer's data. Then, we compute the cursive probability to decide whether each pair of neighboring characters are conjoined together or not. By jointly modeling the handwriting style and conjoined property through a novel trajectory optimization, final handwriting words can be synthesized from a set of collected samples. Furthermore, the paragraphs' layouts are also automatically generated and adjusted according to the writer's style obtained from the same dataset. We demonstrate that our method can successfully synthesize an entire paragraph that mimic a writer's handwriting using his/her collected handwriting samples.", "paper_title": "Data-driven Handwriting Synthesis in a Conjoined Manner", "paper_id": "WOS:000363216500023"}
