Semi-stable semantics is quite close to traditional stable semantics in the sense that every stable extension is also a semi-stable extension. One of the advantages of semi-stable semantics is that for finite argumentation frameworks there always exists at least one semi-stable extension. Furthermore, if there also exists at least one stable extension, then the semi-stable extensions coincide with the stable extensions. Semi-stable semantics can be seen as a general approach that can be applied to abstract argumentation, as well as to fields like default logic and answer set programming, yielding an interpretation with properties very similar to those of paraconsistent logic, including the properties of crash resistance and backward compatibility.", "paper_title": "Semi-stable semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000309469900011"}
