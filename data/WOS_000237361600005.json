Ideally, a designer would try all possible system configurations and choose the best one regarding specific system requirements. Unfortunately, such an approach is not possible because of the tremendous number of design parameters with sophisticated effects on system properties. Consequently, good search techniques are needed to find design alternatives that best meet constraints and cost criteria. In this paper, we present a compositional design space exploration framework for system optimization and exploration using SymTA/S, a software tool for formal performance analysis. In contrast to many previous approaches pursuing closed automated exploration strategies over large sets of system parameters, our approach allows the designer to effectively control the exploration process to quickly find good design alternatives. An important aspect and key novelty of our approach is system optimization with traffic shaping.", "paper_title": "A framework for modular analysis and exploration of heterogeneous embedded systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237361600005"}
