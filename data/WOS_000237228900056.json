Combining human evaluation with an optimization system for engineering design enables us to embed domain specific knowledge which is frequently hard to describe, subjective criteria and preferences in engineering design. We introduce IGA technique to extend previous approaches with sequential single objective GA and multi-objective GA. We also introduce parallel IGA newly. Experimental results show that (1) the multi-objective IGA and the parallel IGA clearly provide better results than the sequential IGA, and (2) the multi-objective IGA provides more diverse results and faster convergence for a floor planning task although the parallel IGA provides better fitness convergence.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of sequential, multi-objective, and parallel interactive genetic algorithms for multi-objective floor plan optimisation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900056"}
