Since 1996, the U.S. health care system has been grappling with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA; Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996), which is designed to provide those handling personal health information with standardized, definitive instructions as to the protection of data. In this work, the authors briefly discuss the present situation of privacy policies about library use data, outline the HIPAA guidelines to understand parallels between the two, and finally propose methods to create a de-identified library data warehouse based on HIPAA for the protection of user privacy.", "paper_title": "Using lessons from health care to protect the privacy of library users: Guidelines for the de-identification of library data based on HIPAA", "paper_id": "WOS:000247078400011"}
