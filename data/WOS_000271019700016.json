The channel under consideration has two users, each user has a finite set of possible realizations. The transmitter transmits two messages, one for each user, in such a manner that regardless of the actual realizations, both users will be able to decode their messages correctly. An alternative view of this channel is that of a broadcast channel with two common messages, each common message is intended to a different set of users. The degradedness order between the two sets of realizations/users is defined through an additional, fictitious, user whose channel is degraded with respect to all realizations/users from one set while all realizations/users from the other set are degraded with respect to him.", "paper_title": "The Capacity Region of the Degraded Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Compound Broadcast Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700016"}
