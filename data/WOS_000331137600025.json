It follows the research on the properties of the lower and upper approximations of the new multi-granulation fuzzy rough set models. Then it can be found that the Pawlak rough set model, fuzzy rough set model and multi-granulation rough set models are special cases of the new one from the perspective of the considered concepts and granular computing. The notion of rough measure and (alpha, beta)-rough measure which are used to measure uncertainty in multi-granulation fuzzy rough sets are introduced and some basic properties of the measures are examined. The construction of the multi-granulation fuzzy rough set model is a meaningful contribution in the view of the generalization of the classical rough set model.", "paper_title": "Multi-granulation fuzzy rough sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000331137600025"}
