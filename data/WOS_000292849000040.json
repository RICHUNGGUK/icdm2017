Such a polygon always exists and is unique in the general case. It is computed from a given digital curve in linear-time using well-known routines: adding a point at the front of a digital straight segment and removing a point from the back of a digital straight segment. It may helps to extract perceptually meaningful parts of shape outlines or lines. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
