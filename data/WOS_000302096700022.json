However, the singular problem of the positive within-class scatter and the Gaussian distribution assumption for positive samples are two main obstacles impeding the performance of BDA RF for CBIR. To avoid both of these intrinsic problems in BDA, in this paper, we propose a novel algorithm called generalized BDA (GBDA) for CBIR. The GBDA algorithm avoids the singular problem by adopting the differential scatter discriminant criterion (DSDC) and handles the Gaussian distribution assumption by redesigning the between-class scatter with a nearest neighbor approach. To alleviate the overfitting problem, GBDA integrates the locality preserving principle; therefore, a smooth and locally consistent transform can also be learned. Extensive experiments show that GBDA can substantially outperform the original BDA, its variations, and related support-vector-machine-based RF algorithms.", "paper_title": "Generalized Biased Discriminant Analysis for Content-Based Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000302096700022"}
