Prior methods either suffer from a spurious numerical surface tension artifact or drift away from the mass conservation constraint, and do not capture realistic cohesion of liquid to solids. Our Ghost SPH scheme resolves this with a new particle sampling algorithm to create a narrow layer of ghost particles in the surrounding air and solid, with careful extrapolation and treatment of fluid variables to reflect the boundary conditions. We also provide a new, simpler form of artificial viscosity based on XSPH. Examples demonstrate how the new approach captures real liquid behaviour previously unattainable by SPH with very little extra cost.", "paper_title": "Ghost SPH for Animating Water", "paper_id": "WOS:000308250300037"}
