This structure, after being homogenized and mixed, offers a set of possible solutions that, probably, could be improved. The purpose of this article is to show a search process for improved optimal solutions by implementing Evolutionary Algorithms - EA (Genetic Algorithms - GA). Afterward, according to the user's priorities, a unique optimal solution is chosen. Subsequently, such holistic improved SOE is stored as an experienced decision, feeding a knowledge repository of Decisional DNA that would be a useful technology within many different intelligent systems and platforms, including the Knowledge Supply Chain System (KSCS).", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithms for decisional DNA: Solving sets of experience knowledge structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000247602600003"}
