A challenging problem is to provide simple yet effective control over captured and simulated crowds to synthesize intended group motions. We present a new method that blends existing crowd data to generate a new crowd animation. The new animation can include an arbitrary number of agents, extends for an arbitrary duration, and yields a natural-looking mixture of the input crowd data. The main benefit of this approach is to create new spatio-temporal crowd behavior in an intuitive and predictable manner. It is accomplished by introducing a morphable crowd model that allows us to encode the formations and individual trajectories in crowd data. Then, its original spatiotemporal behavior can be reconstructed and interpolated at an arbitrary scale using our morphable model.", "paper_title": "Morphable Crowds", "paper_id": "WOS:000284943000004"}
