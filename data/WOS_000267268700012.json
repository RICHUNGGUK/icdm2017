WINNER has devised an OFDMA-based system concept with excellent system-level performance for flexible deployments in a wide variety of operating conditions. The WINNER system provides a significant step forward from current 3G systems. Key innovations integrated into the system concept include flexible spectrum usage and relaying, adaptive advanced antenna schemes and pilot design, close to optimal link adaptation, hierarchical control signaling, and a highly flexible multiple access scheme. The end-to-end performance assessment results demonstrate that the WINNER concept meets the IMT-Advanced requirements.", "paper_title": "KEY TEICHNOLOGIES FOR IMT-ADVANCED MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000267268700012"}
