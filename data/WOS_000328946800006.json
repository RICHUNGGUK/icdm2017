Generally, weights for experts or criteria are considered in linguistic aggregation processes. In this paper, we provide a method to discovery new forms to compute weights and new interpretations in the linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator. In linguistic decision analysis, it can be noticed that some of initial linguistic values used by experts have priority over others linguistic values in evaluation processes. We formalize the priority over initial linguistic values as weights for linguistic values, by considering weights for linguistic values as well as weights for experts, we provide an alternative method to discovery weights information of the linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator, its properties show that such linguistic aggregation operator is extensions of the 2-tuple arithmetic mean, the 2-tuple weighted aggregation operator and the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging operator. By an illustrative example, we compare the linguistic aggregation operator with the 2-tuple weighted aggregation operator and the 2-tuple ordered weighted averaging operator in a decision making problem. From the practical point of view, we provide an optimization model to obtain such weights information in linguistic aggregation processes, examples show the linguistic aggregation operator as an alternative linguistic ordered weighted averaging operator in practice.", "paper_title": "A LINGUISTIC AGGREGATION OPERATOR INCLUDING WEIGHTS FOR LINGUISTIC VALUES AND EXPERTS IN GROUP DECISION MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000328946800006"}
