In this paper, we investigate the concept of active memory operation which is an active data processing operation performed on the memory side. Utilizing the active memory operation, we can replace multiple transactions of memory accesses over the on-chip network and related computations on the processor side with a smaller number of high-level transactions and computations on the memory side. To realize the concept, we have designed a special-purpose processor called active memory processor which is tightly coupled with the memory and executes the active memory operations. In our case studies, we have applied the concept to five real-world applications (parallelized JPEG, FFT, text indexing for data mining, histogram, and eikonal equation solver) running on a 36-tile architecture with 64 cores and four memory tiles and found that the proposed approach can improve performance by 20.5 similar to 259.3 percent.", "paper_title": "Active Memory Processor for Network-on-Chip-Based Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000301800000003"}
