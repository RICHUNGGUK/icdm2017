Security risk analysis can be time consuming and expensive, hence, it is of great importance that involved parties quickly understand the risk picture. Risk analysis methods often make use of brainstorming sessions to identify risks, threats and vulnerabilities. These sessions involve system users, developers and decision makers. They typically often have completely different backgrounds and view the system from different perspectives. To facilitate communication and understanding among them, we have developed a graphical approach to document and explain the overall security risk picture. The development of the language and the guidelines for its use have been based on a combination of empirical investigations and experiences gathered from utilizing the approach in large scale industrial field trials. The investigations involved both professionals and students, and each field trial was in the order of 250 person hours.", "paper_title": "A graphical approach to risk identification, motivated by empirical investigations", "paper_id": "WOS:000241450700040"}
