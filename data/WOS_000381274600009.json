We examine syllabi of introductory PhD seminars offered across North America to identify and rank scholars and scholarly works most often called on in shaping future scholar's minds and careers. These rankings can also be used, along with available IS scholar ranking, to better recognize active and influential scholars in the IS field.", "paper_title": "An IS Scholar and Scholarship Ranking Based on Contributions to Doctoral Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000381274600009"}
