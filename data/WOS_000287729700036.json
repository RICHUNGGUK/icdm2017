The main idea of cross-efficiency is to use data envelopment analysis in peer evaluation, instead of only a self evaluation. However, in the cross-efficiency method, optimal weights corresponding to evaluation of decision-making units may not be unique. In this research with modifying the cross-efficiency method we are going to overcome this problem. Then with regard to the changes and using the TOPSIS method we present a new super-efficient method to rank all decision-making units. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to the case that data are intervals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
