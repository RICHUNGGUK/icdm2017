We used existing object oriented metrics and complexity software metrics as proposed for Business Tier code(1,3). We use a set of metrics for the Data Access Tier that has been proposed in our previous study(2). The primary aim of the implementation of the metric extraction and analyzer tool is to facilitate generation of software metrics which are used as independent variables in software quality prediction models. A secondary goal is to gather and present information on the attributes of source code to assist the programmers in managing the software projects. This tool is able to generate the principal components correlation analysis report and descriptive statistics report. These analysis reports are essential reports for the study of software measurement and software quality management.", "paper_title": "An implementation of metrics extraction and analyzer tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000250844200007"}
