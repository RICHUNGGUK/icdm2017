A novel multi-restriction manipulator joint velocity vector control algorithm, based on fuzzy reasoning theory, is presented. The task executed by the redundant manipulator is broken into a series of sub-tasks expressed with vectors. The subordinate task is executed in the redundancy space of executing the primary task. The conventional joint velocity vector algorithm is combined with fuzzy reasoning theory so that every subordinate task is best optimized. Singular gesture and arithmetic singularity are avoided. The multi-restriction redundant manipulator joint velocity vector control problem is solved. The algorithm validity is proved by the numerical simulation results.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy reasoning application in redundant manipulator movement regulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300005"}
