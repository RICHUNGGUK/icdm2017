We used Pygr ( The Python Graph Database Framework for Bioinformatics) to query intervals from multigenome alignments, which gives us less than a millisecond access to any intervals of any genome within multigenome alignments. PRIMER3 was used to extract optimal primers from a gene of interest. QPRIMER creates an electronic genomic PCR image from a set of conserved primers as well as summary pages for primer alignments and products. QPRIMER supports human, mouse, rat, chicken, dog, zebrafish and fruit fly.
