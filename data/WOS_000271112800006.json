The context is mass and targeted attacks, taking account of strategic interactions between end users and attackers. For both mass and targeted attacks. facilitating end-user precautions reduces, the expected loss of end users. However, the impact of enforcement oil expected loss depends oil the balance between deterrence and Slackening of end-user precautions. Facilitating end-user precautions is more effective than enforcement against. attackers when the cost of precautions and the cost of atacks are lower. With targeted attacks, facilitating end-user precautions is more effective for users with relatively high valuation of information security, while enforcement against attackers is more effective for users with relatively low valuation of security", "paper_title": "Information Security: Facilitating User Precautions Vis-a-Vis Enforcement Against Attackers", "paper_id": "WOS:000271112800006"}
