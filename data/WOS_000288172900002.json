To solve the problem of longitudinal attitude control of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase, a new intelligent controller is proposed in this paper. This new controller is based on the fuzzy dynamic characteristic modeling method. The fuzzy logic is introduced into the characteristic modeling by dividing the whole restriction range into several subspaces. Simulations show that this modification greatly improves the performance of the original method. With the same whole restriction range the fuzzy dynamic characteristic modeling decreases the time of convergence, and at the same time makes the attitude angle tracing more precise and robust. Since the sub-model is a characteristic model that has stronger adaptiveness than a fixed local model, the number of fuzzy rules is greatly reduced. Our model sharply reduces the complexity in constructing a fuzzy dynamic model. Finally, simulation results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in dealing with the attitude control problem of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy dynamic characteristic model based attitude control of hypersonic vehicle in gliding phase", "paper_id": "WOS:000288172900002"}
