Recent discussions in this field state that DM does not contribute to business in a large-scale. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the importance of business insiders in the process of knowledge development to make DM more relevant to business. Design/methodology/approach - This paper proposes a blog-based model of knowledge sharing system to support the DM process for effective BI. Findings - Through an illustrative case study, the paper has demonstrated the usefulness of the model of knowledge sharing system for DM in the dynamic transformation of explicit and tacit knowledge for BI. DM can be an effective BI tool only when business insiders are involved and organizational knowledge sharing is implemented. Practical implications - The structure of blog-based knowledge sharing systems for DM process can be practically applied to enterprises for BI. Originality/value - The paper suggests that any significant DM process in the BI context must involve data miner centered DM cycle and business insider centered knowledge development cycle.", "paper_title": "A knowledge management approach to data mining process for business intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000258447100004"}
