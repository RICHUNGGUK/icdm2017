Specifically, the information messages corresponding to each user are encoded independently and the OR of these two encoded streams is transmitted. Nonlinear turbo codes that provide a controlled distribution of ones and zeros are used to demonstrate a low-complexity scheme that operates close to the optimal boundary.", "paper_title": "Optimal transmission strategy and explicit capacity region for broadcast Z channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000258913400030"}
