Unicast flows are usually congestion-controlled with protocols like TCP. However, there are no such protocols for multicast flows in wireless ad hoc networks, and multicast flows can therefore cause severe congestion and throttle TCP-like flows in these environments. Based on a cross-layer approach, this paper proposes a completely localized scheme to prevent multicast flows from causing severe congestion and the associated deleterious effects on other flows in wireless ad hoc networks. The proposed scheme combines the layered multicast concept with the routing-based congestion avoidance idea to reduce the aggregated rate of multicast flows when they use excessive bandwidth on a wireless link. Our analysis and extensive simulations show that the fully localized scheme proposed in this paper is effective in ensuring the fairness of bandwidth sharing between multicast and unicast flows in wireless ad hoc networks.", "paper_title": "Multicasting with Localized Control in Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889600005"}
