It can implement fuzzy operation, and generate learning behaviour. The model firstly applies fuzzy membership function of the observed information to establish the posterior probabilities of original assumptions in Bayesian classification space, the classified results of all input information then are worked out. Across the calculation, the positive and reverse instances of all observed information are fully considered. The best classification result is acquired by incorporating with all possible classification results. The whole classifier adopts a hybrid four-layer forward neural network to implement. Fuzzy operations of input information are performed using fuzzy logic neurons. The investigation indicates that the proposed method expands the application scope and classification precision of Bayesian optimal classifier, and is an ideal patter classifier. In the end, an experiment in transformer insulation fault diagnosis shows the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "A hybrid Bayesian optimal classifier based on neuro-fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600049"}
