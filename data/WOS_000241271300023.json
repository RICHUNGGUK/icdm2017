IndexToolkit includes user-friendly tools and an Application Programming Interface (API) to facilitate indexing, storage and retrieval of protein sequence databases. As open source, it provides a sequence-retrieval developing framework, which is easily extensible for high-speed-request proteomic applications, such as database searching or modification discovering. We applied IndexToolkit to database searching engine pFind to demonstrate its effect. Experimental studies show that IndexToolkit is able to support significantly faster searches of protein database.", "paper_title": "IndexToolkit: an open source toolbox to index protein databases for high-throughput proteomics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241271300023"}
