Data were collected from students enrolled in 28 online courses via content analysis with online interaction transcripts, structural equation modeling with the learning-experience survey responses, and interviewing. The interaction-transcript analysis did not indicate a significant advantage or disadvantage in terms of the quality and quantity of online interaction participation for students of non-traditional age or minority status. However, the structural equation modeling of the survey results indicated that students' minority status was associated with more favorable perception of the learner-to-instructor interaction but lower satisfaction with the web-based distance education.
