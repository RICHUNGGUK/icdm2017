We take this task as a two-class pattern classification problem, The system first applies histogram color model to detect the skin regions, then extracts color, texture, shape features from skin regions, after that, the features is fed to a SVM to determine whether the input image is benign or not. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve a satisfactory classification performance with high speed, which is suitable for real-world applications.", "paper_title": "Filtering objectionable image based on image content", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500127"}
