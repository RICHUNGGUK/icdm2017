This paper presents a system for computing the brachial artery diameter in real-time by analyzing B-mode ultrasound images. The method is based on a robust edge detection algorithm which is used to automatically locate the two walls of the vessel. The measure of the diameter is obtained with subpixel precision and with a temporal resolution of 25 samples/s, so that the small dilations induced by the cardiac cycle can also be retrieved. The algorithm is implemented on a standalone video processing board which acquires the analog video signal from the ultrasound equipment. Results are shown in real-time on a graphical user interface. The system was tested both on synthetic ultrasound images and in clinical studies of flow-mediated dilation. Accuracy, robustness, and intra/inter observer variability of the method were evaluated.", "paper_title": "A system for real-time measurement of the brachial artery diameter in B-mode ultrasound images", "paper_id": "WOS:000244726300011"}
