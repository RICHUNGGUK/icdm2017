The antenna is designed and printed on the top surface of an IC package and fed by a single coaxial line, while the transceiver is implemented on the opposite side of the package, through the separation of a common ground plate. This \"cavity-down\" arrangement minimizes the electromagnetic interference between the antenna and transceiver, and satisfies the miniaturization of the design. The study consists of numerical computations, which are performed through an in-house computer solver based on the nonuniform finite-difference time-domain (NU-FDTD) method and experimental measurements. Together with the data computed using the high-frequency structure simulator (HFSS) software, the results show excellent agreement between the numerical and experimental data, and the proposed structure is deemed as a useful application in the area of highly integrated wireless transceivers.
