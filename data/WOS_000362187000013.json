The algorithm comes from a two-step optimization on the basic of original ICP. First, aiming at original ICP algorithm's time consuming in searching for corresponding point, we present a novel solution to search for the corresponding point based on STL (STereo Lithography) triangular mesh in CAD model. The solution makes full use of the advantages of STL file which consists of lists of facet data and vector information of triangular mesh to search for point cloud's corresponding points. Second, aiming at the algorithm's very slow iterative process, we put forward a kind of dynamic adjustment factor the factor of dynamically adjusting the rigid transformation parameters which can make point cloud over-travel by rigid transformation along original trend in each iteration. When adding dynamic adjustment factor, the algorithm could search more effective corresponding points in next iteration, thus reducing the number of iterations and speeding up the registration. Experiments show that the modified ICP can effectively reduce time consuming in registration of point cloud and CAD model, meanwhile iinproving the registration accuracy. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
