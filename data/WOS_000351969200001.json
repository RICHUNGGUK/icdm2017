Nowadays, users demand more tools, more e-learning platforms, and fewer dependencies among these platforms. To deal with these requirements the Virtual Campus Advanced Architecture project has defined multitier software architecture for VC based on the SOA integration of e-learning platforms. This solution defines a set of interfaces that standardizes the core functions of learning management systems (LMSs), so decoupling VC from LMSs and promoting its evolution towards the SaaS model. Simplicity and viability have been key issues in the development of these interfaces that have been implemented for Blackboard Learn, Moodle and Sakai. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
