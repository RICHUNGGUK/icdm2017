In this paper, we presented our approach for the fluid simulation in column chromatography by the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). To simulate the monolithic column system, the calculation domain was modeled by the 3D channel flow through sphere obstacles. Several types of porous structure were used, with uniform and nonuniform pores. Based on the simulations results, we discussed fluid flow and pressure variation for the optimization of the suitable structure for HPLC system.", "paper_title": "NUMERICAL SIMULATION ON FLOW IN COLUMN CHROMATOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000327313200003"}
