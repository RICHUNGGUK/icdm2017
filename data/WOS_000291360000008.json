The proposal is specially designed to enhance TCP performance over satellite networks. In our scheme, the source introduces a degree of redundancy and transmits a random linear combination of TCP packets. Since the redundant packets are utilized to mask packet loss over satellite links, the degree of redundancy is determined by the link error rates. Through a simple and effective method, ATCS estimates link error rates in real time and then dynamically adjusts the redundant factor. Consequently, ATCS is adaptable to a wide range of link error rates by coding TCP segments with a flexible redundancy factor. Furthermore, the scheme is compatible with traditional TCP variants. Simulation results indicate that the proposal improves TCP performance considerably.", "paper_title": "ATCS: An Adaptive TCP Coding Scheme for Satellite IP Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291360000008"}
