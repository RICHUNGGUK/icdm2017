Three perspectives were investigated to achieve this purpose. Firstly, the overall research interactions were analyzed to identify the dominant driving forces in advancing the development of N&N. Secondly, the knowledge diffusion intensity between N&N and nano-related subjects was investigated to determine the areas most closely related to N&N. Thirdly, the diffusion speed was identified to detect the time distance of knowledge diffusion between N&N and nano-related subjects. The analysis reveals that driving forces from the outside environment rather than within N&N itself make the foremost contributions to the development of N&N. From 1998 to 2007, Material Science, Physics, Chemistry, N&N, Electrical & Electronic and Metallurgy & Metallurgical Engineering are the key contributory and reference subjects for N&N. Knowledge transfer within N&N itself is the quickest. And the speed of knowledge diffusion from other subjects to N&N is slower than that from N&N to other subjects, demonstrating asymmetry of knowledge diffusion in the development of N&N. The results indicate that N&N has matured into a relatively open, diffuse and dynamic system of interactive subjects.", "paper_title": "Characterizing knowledge diffusion of Nanoscience & Nanotechnology by citation analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000278267100008"}
