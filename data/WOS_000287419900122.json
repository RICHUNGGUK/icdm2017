Firms in this sector vary widely in their levels of service quality-considered the key to increasing resident satisfaction and reducing resident complaints. This work explores service quality constructs and associated indicators that are useful for assessing service performance, as well as the relationships between resident satisfaction and service quality in the condominium management service sector. This investigation adapts the procedures from the popular measuring instrument SERVQUAL for exploring quality indicators. Additionally, the structure equation analysis confirms \"service team competence\" and \"service performance reliability\" are two primary quality dimensions that relate to condominium management. This study concludes that both constructs significantly and positively affect resident satisfaction for condominium service businesses. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
