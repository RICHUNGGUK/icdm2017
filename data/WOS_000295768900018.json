The software, written in IDL 7.1, allows estimation of the channel central wavelength and the full width at half maximum of a selected spectrometer at several wavelengths across the VNIR range (350-1050 nm). This is achieved through comparison of the position and width of specific solar and terrestrial absorption features, as observed in the measured data, with those observed in simulated MODTRAN4 irradiance data. SpecCal is operated from a user-friendly graphical user interface that allows semiautomatic application of the spectral calibration algorithm at several wavelengths. The proposed software may be exploited as a useful in situ vicarious spectral calibration tool for field spectrometers operating in the VNIR range, which makes it possible to quickly analyze the spectral characteristics of the instruments and their possible variations with time.
