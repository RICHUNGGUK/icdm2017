Fuzzy hybrid quantum artificial immune algorithm can be developed with some of the advantages of information processing where there is a certain amount of indeterminism with qubits, i.e. quantum bits, replacing classical neurons having deterministic states and also in place of the classical artificial immune algorithm with quantum operators. The fuzzy combinatorial fuzzy hybrid quantum artificial immune clustering algorithm (C-FHQAI) is more expressive than the other fuzzy theories and methods. Finally, numerical examples show that the clustering effectiveness of the C-FHQAI algorithm is fast convergence and improves the accuracy of the fuzzy calculation. We find that the C-FHQAI clustering algorithm has the perspective of widespread application. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
