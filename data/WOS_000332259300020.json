Although some excellent applications are available and widely used, their performance leaves room for improvement. Results: We developed orthAgogue: a multithreaded C application for high-speed estimation of homology relations in massive datasets, operated via a flexible and easy command-line interface.", "paper_title": "orthAgogue: an agile tool for the rapid prediction of orthology relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000332259300020"}
