In this paper, this bound on the redundancy is proven without requiring the conjecture to be true. To do so, we use two known sufficient conditions for the existence of binary fix-free codes to derive an improved upper bound on the redundancy of an optimal fix-free code in terms of the largest symbol probability.", "paper_title": "The Redundancy of an Optimal Binary Fix-Free Code Is Not Greater Than 1 bit", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600036"}
