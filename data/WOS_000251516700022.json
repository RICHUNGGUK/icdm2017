We introduce a measure of ambiguity for restarting automata which recognizes a language as a projection of its characteristic language (containing also auxiliary-noninput-symbols) into its input alphabet. Based on this measure we define an ambiguity measure of languages. This measure can be considered as a measure of non-determinism of languages. We show that there is an infinite hierarchy with respect to the degree of ambiguity even inside linear languages and that there are linear languages with a linear ambiguity.", "paper_title": "Ambiguity by restarting automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000251516700022"}
