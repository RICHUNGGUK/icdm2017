The present work aims to correlate input process parameters with various responses of a plasma spray coating process. Statistical regression analysis had been carried out previously for this process based on the data collected through central composite design of experiments to establish input-output relationships in forward direction. However, the said relationships could not be accurately determined in reverse direction using the obtained regression equations due to the presence of a non-square transformation matrix. Soft computing-based approaches had been developed to model the process in both forward as well as reverse directions. The performances of the developed approaches had been tested on different cases obtained through real experiments. A comparative study had been made of these developed approaches in terms of accuracy in predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
