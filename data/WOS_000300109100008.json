The theory of regions has been applied to address this problem, enabling the derivation of a Petri net whose language includes a set of traces. However, when dealing with real-life systems, the available tool support for performing such a task is unsatisfactory, due to the complex algorithms that are required. In this paper, the theory of regions is revisited to devise a novel technique that explores the space of regions by combining the elements of a region basis. Due to its light space requirements, the approach can represent an important step for bridging the gap between the theory of regions and its industrial application. Experimental results show that there is improvement in orders of magnitude in comparison with state-of-the-art tools for the same task.", "paper_title": "Light Region-based Techniques for Process Discovery", "paper_id": "WOS:000300109100008"}
