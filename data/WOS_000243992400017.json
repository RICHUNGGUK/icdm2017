Conversely, from a small-molecule point of view, we explore the extent to which structural similarities between small molecules correlate to protein binding profiles. Results: The comparison of binding site structural similarities and small-molecule binding profiles shows that proteins with similar small-molecule binding profiles tend to have a higher degree of binding site similarity but the latter is not sufficient to predict small-molecule binding patterns, highlighting the difficulty of predicting small-molecule binding patterns from sequence or structure. Likewise, from a small-molecule perspective, small molecules with similar protein binding profiles tend to be topologically similar but topological similarity is not sufficient to predict their protein binding patterns. These observations have important consequences for function prediction and drug design.", "paper_title": "Analysis of binding site similarity, small-molecule similarity and experimental binding profiles in the human cytosolic sulfotransferase family", "paper_id": "WOS:000243992400017"}
