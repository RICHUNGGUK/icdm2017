The network architecture based on trees is proposed. Based on the architecture, the hierarchical IPv6 address structure is created and the address configuration algorithm is proposed. During the address configuration process, the trees are also established simultaneously. Based on the hierarchical address structure, the routing algorithm is proposed. In the algorithm, the routing can be performed automatically through the trees in the link layer. The paper analyzes the scheme's performance parameters and the data results show that the performance of the scheme is better. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
