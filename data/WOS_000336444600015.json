Frequency-hopping sequences are needed in FH-CDMA systems. In this paper, a construction of optimal sets of frequency-hopping sequences using cyclotomy and the Chinese remainder theorem is introduced. It generalizes some earlier constructions, and produces new optimal sets of frequency-hopping sequences.", "paper_title": "New sets of frequency-hopping sequences with optimal Hamming correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336444600015"}
