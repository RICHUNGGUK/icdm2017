Daily generation refers to as mean, maximum and minimum daily wind speed. The library is made available as software component, inclusive of hypertext help file. allowing the development of language-independent clients under Windows operating systems. The component includes advanced features for re-use in custom developed applications, and it allows independent extensions by third parties without requiring its re-compilation. Illustrative examples on how to extend and re-use the library are provided as C# code projects. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
