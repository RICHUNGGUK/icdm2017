We denote by U(2n) the set of all unicyclic graphs of order 2n with a perfect matching. Let B(2n) = {G is an element of U(2n)vertical bar the length of the unique cycle of G is divisible by 4} and A(2n) = U(2n) \\ B(2n). W. Wang, in the paper \"Ordering of unicyclic graphs with perfect matchings by minimal energies\", MATCH Commun. Math. Comput. Chem. 66 (2011) 927-942, [1], posed a conjecture about ordering of graphs in A(2n) by minimal energies. We now characterize the graphs in U(2n) with the first seven minimal energies and offer an answer to the conjecture.", "paper_title": "On Minimal Energies of Unicyclic Graphs with Perfect Matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443000009"}
