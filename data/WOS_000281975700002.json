Design/methodology/approach - The proposed RRN method has been applied to solve Problem No. 7 of the International TEAM Workshops. The induced currents in the conductive plate with an asymmetrically situated \"hole\" have been analysed. The RRN equations have been formed by means of the finite element method using the Magnetic vector potential A and the electric vector potentials T and To. The block relaxation method combined with the Cholesky decomposition procedure has been applied to solve the resultant RRN equations. Findings - Comparison with results published in literature has demonstrated high accuracy of the proposed RRN computational scheme while offering significant savings in computing times. Originality/value - A novel formulation of the RRN approach has been proposed and demonstrated to be computationally efficient.", "paper_title": "Inducted currents analysis in multiply connected conductors using reluctance-resistance networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000281975700002"}
