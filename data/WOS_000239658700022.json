This portion of the web is usually known as the Hidden Web. To be able to deal with this problem, it is necessary to solve two tasks: crawling the client-side and crawling the server-side hidden web. In this paper we present an architecture and a set of related techniques for accessing the information placed in web pages with support for client-side dynamism, dealing with aspects such as JavaScript technology, non-standard session maintenance mechanisms, client redirections, pop-up menus, etc. Our approach leverages current browser ARI's and implements novel crawling models and algorithms.", "paper_title": "Crawling web pages with support for client-side dynamism", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700022"}
