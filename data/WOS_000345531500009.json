Contrary to what is commonly practiced today in various recognition applications where dimensionality reduction and classification are independently treated, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction method appropriately combined with a classification algorithm. The proposed method called maximum margin projection pursuit, aims to identify a low dimensional projection subspace, where samples form classes that are better discriminated, i.e., are separated with maximum margin. The proposed method is an iterative alternate optimization algorithm that computes the maximum margin projections exploiting the separating hyperplanes obtained from training a support vector machine classifier in the identified low dimensional space. Experimental results on both artificial data, as well as, on popular databases for facial expression, face and object recognition verified the superiority of the proposed method against various state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction algorithms.", "paper_title": "Maximum Margin Projection Subspace Learning for Visual Data Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000345531500009"}
