A 0/1 matrix is balanceable if its nonzero entries can be signed +/- 1 so that the resulting matrix is balanced. A signing algorithm due to Camion shows that the problems of recognizing balanced 0/ +/- 1 matrices and balanceable 0/1 matrices are equivalent. Conforti, Cornuejols, Kapoor and Vuikovic gave an algorithm to test if a 0/ +/- 1 matrix is balanced. Truemper has characterized balanceable 0/1 matrices in terms of forbidden submatrices. In this paper we give an algorithm that explicitly finds one of these forbidden submatrices or shows that none exists.", "paper_title": "Recognizing balanceable matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000233867100002"}
