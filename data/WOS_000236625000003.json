Stochastic constraint programs contain both decision variables, which we can set, and stochastic variables, which follow a discrete probability distribution. We provide a semantics for stochastic constraint programs based on scenario trees. Using this semantics, we can compile stochastic constraint programs down into conventional (non-stochastic) constraint programs. This allows us to exploit the full power of existing constraint solvers. We have implemented this framework for decision making under uncertainty in stochastic OPL, a language which is based on the OPL constraint modelling language (Van Hentenryck, P., Michael, L., Perron, L., & Regin, J.-C. (1999) Constraint programming in OPL. In G. Nadathur, (Ed.), Principles and practice of declarative programming, LNCS 1702, (pp. 97-116). Springer-Verlag). To illustrate the potential of this framework, we model a wide range of problems in areas as diverse as portfolio diversification, agricultural planning and production/inventory management.", "paper_title": "Stochastic constraint programming: A scenario-based approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000236625000003"}
