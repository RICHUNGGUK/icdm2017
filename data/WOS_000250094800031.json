However, recognizing various kinds of decorative character images is still a challenging problem in the field of document image analysis. Since appearances of such decorative characters are complicated, most general character recognition systems cannot give good performances on decorative characters. In this paper, an algorithm that recognizes decorative characters by structural analysis using a graph-matching technique is proposed. Character structure is extracted by using topographical features of multi-scale images, and the extracted structure is represented by a graph. A character image is recognized by matching graphs of the input and standard patterns. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Decorative character recognition by graph matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000250094800031"}
