The proposed method differs from the conventional aspect graph representation in that we utilize transitions as well as aspects. The process of generating the Aspect-Transition Descriptor is as follows: First, uniformly sampled views of a 3-D model are separated into a stable and an unstable view sets according to the local variation of their 2-D shape. Next, adjacent stable views and unstable views are grouped into clusters and we select the characteristic aspects and transitions by finding the representative view from each cluster. The 2-D descriptors of the selected characteristic aspects and transitions are concatenated to form the 3-D descriptor. Matching the Aspect- Transition Descriptors is done using a modified Hausdorff distance. To evaluate the proposed 3-D descriptor, we have evaluated the retrieval performance on the Princeton benchmark database [3] and found that our method outperforms other retrieval techniques.", "paper_title": "A new 3-D model retrieval system based on Aspect-Transition Descriptor", "paper_id": "WOS:000237557400042"}
