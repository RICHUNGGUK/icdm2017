The imbalance of a vertex v(i) is the absolute value of the difference between the number of neighbors to the left and right of v(i). The problem is also known as the BALANCED VERTEX ORDERING problem and it finds many applications in graph drawing. We show that this problem is fixed parameter tractable and provide an algorithm that runs in time 2(O (b log b)) . n(O (1)). This resolves an open problem of Kara et al.
