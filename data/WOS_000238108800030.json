Here arises the problem that when an agent does not know another agent very much then there is no way to notice such ambiguity. This paper shows a new protocol in which an agent can notice that ambiguity using the notion of statistics, and illustrates the facility of designing agents' algorithms as well as existing reputation systems.", "paper_title": "A novel protocol for communicating reputation in P2P networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238108800030"}
