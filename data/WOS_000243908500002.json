We derive also the \"dual counterpart\" of the outlined representation, which expresses the possibility of positive semidefinite completion of a well-structured partially defined symmetric matrix in terms of positive semidefiniteness of a specific bunch of fully defined submatrices of the matrix. Using the representations, we then reformulate well-structured large-scale semidefinite problems into smooth convex-concave saddle point problems, which can be solved by a Prox-method developed in [6] with efficiency O(epsilon(-1)). Implementations and some numerical results for large-scale Lovsz capacity and MAXCUT problems are finally presented.", "paper_title": "Large-scale semidefinite programming via a saddle point Mirror-Prox algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000243908500002"}
