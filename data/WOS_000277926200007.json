We define the handle or the natural grasping component of an object as the part chosen by humans to pick up this object. When humans reach out to grasp an object, it is generally in the aim of accomplishing a task. Thus, the chosen grasp is quite related to the object task. Our approach learns to identify object handles by imitating humans. In this paper, a new sufficient condition for computing force-closure grasps on the obtained handle is also proposed. Several experiments were conducted to test the ability of the algorithm to generalize to new objects. They also show the adaptability of our strategy to the hand kinematics. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
