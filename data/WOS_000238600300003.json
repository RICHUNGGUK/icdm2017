Dynamic service discovery requires the provision of rich and flexible metadata that is not supported by current registry services such as UDDI. We present a framework to facilitate reputation-based service selection in Semantic Grids. Our framework has two key features that distinguish it from other work in this area. First, we propose a dynamic, adaptive, and highly fault-tolerant reputation-aware service discovery algorithm. Second, we present a service-oriented distributed reputation assessment algorithm. In this paper, we describe the main components of our framework and report on our experience of developing the prototype.
