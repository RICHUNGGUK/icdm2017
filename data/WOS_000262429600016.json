The tests that can be performed at a certain point in time during the integration phase depend on the modules that are integrated and, therefore, on the preceding integration sequence. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model to describe an overall integration and test sequencing problem, and we propose an algorithm to solve this problem. The method is a combination of integration sequencing and test sequencing. Furthermore, we introduce several strategies that determine when test phases should start. With a case study within the development of a software release that is used to control an ASML lithographic machine, we show that the described method and strategies can be used to solve real-life problems.", "paper_title": "Integration and Test Sequencing for Complex Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429600016"}
