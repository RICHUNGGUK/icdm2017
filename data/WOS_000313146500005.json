In this paper, a generalized framework for online fuzzy weighting is presented, which incrementally calculates the membership of each incoming sample by taking into account the membership grades of previous samples in a pairwise manner. The advocated pairwise-distance based scheme can not only identify possible outliers, but also show good adaptation to the sequentially received samples in the online setting. We apply it to online Passive-Aggressive (PA) algorithm in a direct way. The resulting Fuzzy Passive-Aggressive (FPA) algorithm achieves comparable classification accuracy with benchmark incremental SVM, while still enjoying the time efficiency of simple PA, which is a Perceptron-like algorithm. Besides, FPA exhibits the best performance among PA family, which makes it a robust and efficient alternative to PA, in order to deal with unavoidable outliers in large-scale or high-dimensional real datasets. The study is supported by a series of experiments with IDA benchmark repository, as well as two real-world problems namely place recognition and radar emitter recognition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
