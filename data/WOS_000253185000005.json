In the Approximate Matching in the L-infinity metric problem the output is, for every text location i, the L-infinity distance between the pattern and the length m substring of the text starting at i, i.e., Max(j=0)(m-1)vertical bar t(i+j) -p(j)vertical bar. We consider the Approximate k-L-infinity distance problem. Given text T and pattern P as before, and a natural number k the output of the problem is the L-infinity distance of the pattern from the text only at locations i in the text where the distance is bounded by k. For the locations where the distance exceeds k the output is phi. We show an algorithm that solves this problem in O(n(k + log(min(m, vertical bar Sigma vertical bar))) log m) time.
