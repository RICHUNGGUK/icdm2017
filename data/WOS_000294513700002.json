How to bound the effects of a fault and how to tackle them into a dynamic system is still an open field. In here an approach to tackle this problem is presented. The use of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy logic structure is given in order to accomplish two challenges, the presence of local faults and the respective time delays within a real-time distributed system. This approach is pursued as reconfigurable strategy according to communication time delays within a real-time distributed system. This approach is pursued as reconfigurable strategy according to communication delays.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Logic Control for a Class of Nonlinear System considering Communication Time Delays on Peripheral Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000294513700002"}
