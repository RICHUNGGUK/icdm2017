In this paper, the security challenges in intrusion detection and authentication are identified and the different types of attacks are discussed. We propose a two-phase detection procedure of nodes that are not authorized for specific services and nodes that have been compromised during their operation in MANET. The detection framework is enabled with the main operations of ad hoc networking, which are found at the link and network layers. The proposed framework is based oil zero knowledge techniques, which are presented through proofs. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
