The interfaces for each type of algorithm are kept simple and algorithms strictly follow their respective interface. Comparing different classifiers or clustering algorithms is therefore straightforward, and implementing new algorithms is also easy. The implementations of the algorithms are clearly written, properly documented and can thus be used as a reference. The library is written in Java and is available from http://java-ml.sourceforge.net/under the GNU GPL license.", "paper_title": "Java-ML: A Machine Learning Library", "paper_id": "WOS:000270824600005"}
