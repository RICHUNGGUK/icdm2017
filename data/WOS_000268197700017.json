To avoid the missing fundamental problem, we adopted the greatest common divisor method and modified it with a weighted-and-voting technique that can reveal more information of strong partials in the target signal. Moreover, a frame-based correction method with consideration of the performing aspects of the instruments is also proposed to emendate possible misjudgments in the transition from one note to the next note. Experimental results showed that the proposed strategy is superior to three popular methods for a pitch extraction/tracking task. The proposed method was also tested when the sound source is reverberant and the results were compared with other methods, too.", "paper_title": "Pitch Detection/Tracking Strategy for Musical Recordings of Solo Bowed-String and Wind Instruments", "paper_id": "WOS:000268197700017"}
