First, sensitivity analysis of modal parameters and their derivatives is carried out. Next, the hypothesis that the CFMSS value of the damaged storey of a shear building is greater than zero in single damage situations is proved. Then, an iterative algorithm for damage localization is developed. Finally, the magnitudes of damages are quantified using the modified CFMSS values. The validity of the method is demonstrated using an eight-storey numerical example and a three-storey experimental model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
