However, these new technologies introduce new constraints for designing innovative architectures and assessing their dependability. This article presents the Safe-SADT formalism, an extension of the structured analysis and design technique (SADT), for dependability studies and a computer-aided design (CAD) tool/software for modeling and comparing several architecture design choices early on in the design process. Its originality is based on operational architecture composed of function entities executed by material entities. A Monte Carlo approach allows simulation of possible life history and points out design's weaknesses using sensitivity analysis. We illustrate the tool functionalities with a temperature system. Possibilities for future research in terms of software development and industrial applications are provided.", "paper_title": "SYSTEMIC MODELING OF INTEGRATED SYSTEMS FOR DECISION MAKING EARLY ON IN THE DESIGN PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000313032600001"}
