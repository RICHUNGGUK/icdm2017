A mathematical and computational model for simulating the multi-dimensional soil-structure interaction is developed using the ADINA FEA program and validated using data obtained from laboratory and centrifuge tests. Subsequently, the FEA model is used to quantify the spatial variability effect on the bearing stiffness of the deep foundation. Using geostatistical principles, a relationship is derived between deterministic and probabilistic end bearing stiffnesses of the rock conditions.
