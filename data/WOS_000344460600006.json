However, modern cognitive psychology has revealed that human decisions could not follow the rules of classical probability theory, because humans cannot process large amounts of data in order to make judgments. Consequently, the inferences performed are based on limited data coupled with several heuristics, leading to violations of the law of total probability. This means that probabilistic graphical models based on classical probability theory are too limited to fully simulate and explain various aspects of human decision making. Quantum probability theory was developed in order to accommodate the paradoxical findings that the classical theory could not explain. Recent findings in cognitive psychology revealed that quantum probability can fully describe human decisions in an elegant framework. Their findings suggest that, before taking a decision, human thoughts are seen as superposed waves that can interfere with each other, influencing the final decision. In this work, we propose a new Bayesian Network based on the psychological findings of cognitive scientists. In Computer Science, to the best of our knowledge, there is no quantum like probabilistic system proposed, despite their promising performances. We made experiments with two very well known Bayesian Networks from the literature. The results obtained revealed that the quantum like Bayesian Network can affect drastically the probabilistic inferences, specially when the levels of uncertainty of the network are very high (no pieces of evidence observed). When the levels of uncertainty are very low, then the proposed quantum like network collapses to its classical counterpart. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
