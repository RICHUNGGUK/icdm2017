A novel delay partition approach is developed to derive a delay-dependent condition guaranteeing the existence of a desired state estimator for the delayed neural networks. The design of the gain matrix of the state estimator can be achieved by solving a linear matrix inequality, where no slack variable is involved. A numerical example is finally provided to show the advantage of the proposed approach over some existing results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
