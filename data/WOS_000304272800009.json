This is particularly convenient for sparsely observed or rather peaked distributions. Moreover, in a few models, prior knowledge of a marginal distribution is available. We adapt local polynomial estimators to include this partial information about the underlying distribution and give explicit representations for the proposed estimators. An application to a set of anthropological data is included.", "paper_title": "Local smoothing with given marginals", "paper_id": "WOS:000304272800009"}
