The proposed method, involving Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), utilizes prior information regarding the sensor bias, firstly, to reduce errors in the fused location estimate, and secondly, to produce a fused covariance matrix that better reflects the expected location error. Simulations are used to evaluate performance, relative to other techniques, such as the covariance union (CU) method. A passive geolocation application involving an airborne electronic support (ES) system is considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
