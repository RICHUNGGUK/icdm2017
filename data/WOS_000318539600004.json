One domain where this is prominent is related to a problem of question answering. When it comes to giving the answers, especially those that do not explicitly exist in the text corpus, the advantages of a human expert are abilities such as explaining, combining complex answers, and abstract reasoning. This paper represents a survey of the existing research in the domain of intelligent question routing. The survey starts from an original presentation paradigm that generalizes the essence of approaches found in the open literature. The presentation paradigm includes three basic processing stages related to the three major problems of system implementation: question analysis, question forwarding, and users' knowledge profiling. Various research efforts use different approaches for implementation of each one of the basic processing stages. Each particular approach is described here using the same template. All these approaches are enlisted, discussed, and presented within a table, for easier comparison. The outcome of this analysis is a proposal for a new approach that tackles identified problems.", "paper_title": "A Survey and Evaluation of State-of-the-Art Intelligent Question Routing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000318539600004"}
