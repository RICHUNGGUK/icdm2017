Specially, configuration cache is the main component in CGRA that provides distinct feature for dynamic reconfiguration in every cycle. However, frequent memory-read operations for dynamic reconfiguration cause much power consumption. Thus, reducing power in configuration cache has become critical for CGRA to be more competitive and reliable for its use in embedded systems. In this paper, we propose dynamically compressible context architecture for power saving in configuration cache. This power-efficient design of context architecture works without degrading the performance and flexibility of CGRA. Experimental results show that the proposed approach saves up to 39.72% power in configuration cache with negligible area overhead (2.16%).", "paper_title": "Dynamic Context Compression for Low-Power Coarse-Grained Reconfigurable Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000273092000002"}
