However, recent advances in syntax-based NLP model design are unsuitable for these toolkits. To combat this problem, we introduce a weighted finite-state tree automata toolkit, which incorporates recent developments in weighted tree automata theory and is useful for natural language applications such as machine translation, sentence compression, question answering, and many more.", "paper_title": "Tiburon: A weighted tree automata toolkit", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312700011"}
