That model would compute an index of the quality of the solution reached by the algorithm as a function of run-time. Conversely, if we fix an index of quality for the solution, the model would give the number of iterations to be expected. In this work, we develop a statistical model to describe the performance of PBIL and CHC evolutionary algorithms applied to solve the root identification problem. This problem is basic in constraint-based, geometric parametric modeling, as an instance of general constraint-satisfaction problems. The performance model is empirically validated over a benchmark with very large search spaces.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Performance of Evolutionary Algorithms on the Root Identification Problem: A Case Study with PBIL and CHC Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000287273700005"}
