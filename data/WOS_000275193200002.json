To foster practice with complex concepts in the classroom and to give teachers immediate feedback about student in-class mastery of core material, use of an audience participation system within the classroom may be useful. This article reports the implementation of a classroom performance system and the results of a program evaluation project designed to capture the system's impact on student and faculty satisfaction and student learning outcomes. Project results and implications for further work are presented.", "paper_title": "Classroom Performance System Use in an Accelerated Graduate Nursing Program", "paper_id": "WOS:000275193200002"}
