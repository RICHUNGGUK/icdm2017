Estimators may be any stopping times eta with respect to the observation process Y. Two cases of the process Y are considered: a noisy version of X and a process X with delay d. For a given loss function f(x), in both cases we find exact asymptotics of the minimal possible risk E f((eta - tau (A) )/r) as A, d -> a, where r is a normalizing coefficient. The results are extended to the corresponding continuous-time setting where X and Y are Brownian motions with drift.", "paper_title": "Sequential estimation of a threshold crossing time for a Gaussian random walk through correlated observations", "paper_id": "WOS:000306338300004"}
