Recently, studies have shown the strong limitation of the common availability metrics for measuring the user's quality of experience. In this article a joint specification of QoS definitions with a sophisticated service resilience characterization is proposed, and a concept called quality of resilience is defined. In this unified performance metric, the frequency and length of service interruption are evaluated. It can be used as a tool for characterization of network reliability, as well as comparison and selection of recovery methods, Additionally, by including it in service level agreements, new and more complex requirements of commercial applications can be guaranteed.", "paper_title": "Quality of Resilience as a Network Reliability Characterization Tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000264629300003"}
