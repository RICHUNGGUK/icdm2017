For the case of causal side information, i.e., l = 0, we find that the penalty of causality is the omission of the subtracted mutual information term in the Wyner-Ziv rate distortion function. For l > 0, we derive a computable \"infinite-letter\" expression for the rate distortion function. When specialized to the near-lossless case, our results characterize the best achievable rate for the Slepian-Wolf source coding problem with finite side information looka-head, and have some surprising implications. We find that side information is useless for any fixed C when the joint probability mass function (PMF) of the source and side information satisfies the positivity condition P(x, y) > 0 for all (x, y). More generally, the optimal rate depends on the distribution of the pair X, Y only through the distribution of X and the bipartite graph whose edges represent the pairs x, y for which P(x, y) > 0. On the other hand, if side information look-ahead is allowed to grow faster than logarithmic in the block length, then H(X vertical bar Y) is achievable. Finally, we apply our approach to derive a computable expression for channel capacity when state information is available at the encoder with limited look-ahead.", "paper_title": "Source coding with limited-look-ahead side information at the decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000242503300003"}
