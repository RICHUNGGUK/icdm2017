Efficient grooming of traffic can not only effectively reduce the network's cost but also optimize its performance. To deal with the grooming of changing traffic in SONET/WDM rings, we classified it into the following two types: (1) reconfigurable grooming of deterministic dynamic traffic (REGDT); (2) reconfigurable grooming of non-deterministic dynamic traffic (REGNT). Two types of REGNT are studied, and two cases (best-fit and full-fit) for handling it were proposed in this paper. Further more, two heuristic algorithms, GA1 and GA2, which combine genetic algorithm with traffic-splitting heuristics, were developed to deal with each case. Computer simulations showed that the algorithms proposed in this paper can achieve much better results than previous ones for these two cases.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable grooming of dynamic traffic in SONET/WDM ring networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251722600003"}
