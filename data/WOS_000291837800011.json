Attempts have been made to model this complex behaviour computationally, using a variety of machine learning algorithms, a.o. non-negative matrix factorization (NMF). In this paper, we replace NMF in a vocabulary learning setting with a conceptually similar algorithm, probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA), which can learn word representations incrementally by Bayesian updating. We further show that this learning framework is capable of modelling certain cognitive behaviours, e.g. forgetting, in a simple way. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
