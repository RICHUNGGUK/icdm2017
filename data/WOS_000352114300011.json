For this objective, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm has a competitive ratio better than . We also analyze several classical algorithms for two special cases and show that some algorithms do have a competitive ratio of and hence optimal. Consequently, we conjecture that any metric space allows for a deterministic -competitive -server algorithm with max-distance objective.", "paper_title": "The online k-server problem with max-distance objective", "paper_id": "WOS:000352114300011"}
