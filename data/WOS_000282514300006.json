Fuzzy CARIN integrates the management of fuzzy logic into the non-recursive CARIN language. We introduce the decision problems of answering to conjunctive queries, unions of conjunctive queries and the existential entailment problem and provide a sound and complete algorithm that permits reasoning with the DL fuzzy ALCNR extended with non-recursive Horn rules. This extension is most useful in realistic applications that handle uncertain or imprecise data such as multimedia processing and medical applications.", "paper_title": "Expressive reasoning with horn rules and fuzzy description logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000282514300006"}
