For this NP-hard combinatorial problem, only constructive types of heuristics have been suggested in the literature. In this paper we propose a new heuristic based on variable neighborhood search metaheuristic rules. This procedure uses a new local search developed by us. Extensive numerical results that include graphs with up to 5,000 vertices are reported. It appears that VNS outperforms all previous methods.", "paper_title": "Local and variable neighborhood search for the k-cardinality subgraph problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000259142300006"}
