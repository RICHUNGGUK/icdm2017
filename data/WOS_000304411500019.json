The basic idea is to compute an accurate atmosphere veil that is not only smoother, but also respect with depth information of the underlying image. We firstly obtain an initial atmosphere scattering light through median filtering, then refine it by guided joint bilateral filtering to generate a new atmosphere veil which removes the abundant texture information and recovers the depth edge information. Finally, we solve the scene radiance using the atmosphere attenuation model. Compared with exiting state of the art dehazing methods, our method could get a better dehazing effect at distant scene and places where depth changes abruptly. Our method is fast with linear complexity in the number of pixels of the input image; furthermore, as our method can be performed in parallel, thus it can be further accelerated using GPU, which makes our method applicable for real-time requirement.", "paper_title": "Fast image dehazing using guided joint bilateral filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000304411500019"}
