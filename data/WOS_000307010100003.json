The function l(p) with domain the set of all finite sequences defined by l(p)(pi) = {x: x is a p-value of pi} is called the l(p)-function on X. The l(p)-functions with p = 1 and p = 2 are the well-studied median and mean functions respectively. In this article, the l(p)-function on finite trees is characterized axiomatically.
