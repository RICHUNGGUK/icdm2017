We identify the elements of End(Z(p) x Z(p)2) with elements in a new set, denoted by E-p, of matrices of size 2x2, whose elements in the first row belong to Z(p) and the elements in the second row belong to Z(p)2; also, using the arithmetic in Z(p) and Z(p)2, we introduce the arithmetic in that ring and prove that the ring End(Z(p) x Z(p)2) is isomorphic to the ring E-p. Finally, we present a Diffie-Hellman key interchange protocol using some polynomial functions over E-p defined by polynomials in Z[X].", "paper_title": "On the arithmetic of the endomorphisms ring End(Z(p) x Z(p)(2))", "paper_id": "WOS:000297221500001"}
