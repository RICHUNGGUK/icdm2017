The web-based systems included in this study were MIcromachining System (MIMS) and SmartFab. In the MIMS architecture, a 3D model in STL format was read using the web browser, the hie was sent to the web server where toolpath planner was located, and the NC code was reviewed by the designer through the web connection. in the SmartFab system, SolidWorks was used as the design interface with modified menus that support input parameters for micromachining. This additional function was available by SolidWorks API that provided links to the same toolpath planner as MIMS. In the commercial CAD/CAM case, without using any web connection, SolidWorks and CATIA were used for design, and PowerMill was used as a CAM tool. For each system, accessibility, user-friendliness, toolpath-reliability, and processing time were compared. Total of 91 students tested these systems in an undergraduate CAD class, and the user's feedback showed better performance of the web-based system in accessibility, user-friendliness, and processing time. However, reliability of the web-based system should be improved to be more useful design and manufacturing system.
