Necessary and sufficient conditions are proven for the existence of nodal approximations to the first derivative with the SBP property. It is proven that the positive-definite norm matrix of each SBP operator must be associated with a quadrature rule; moreover, given a quadrature rule there exists a corresponding SBP operator, where for diagonal-norm SBP operators the weights of the quadrature rule must be positive. The generalized framework gives a straightforward means of posing many known approximations to the first derivative as SBP operators; several are surveyed, such as discontinuous Galerkin discretizations based on the Legendre-Gauss quadrature points, and shown to be SBP operators. Moreover, the new framework provides a method for constructing SBP operators by starting from quadrature rules; this is illustrated by constructing novel SBP operators from known quadrature rules. To demonstrate the utility of the generalization, the Legendre-Gauss and Legendre-Gauss-Radau quadrature points are used to construct SBP operators that do not include one or both boundary nodes.
