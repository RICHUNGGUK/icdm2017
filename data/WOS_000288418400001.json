In particular, we propose an algorithm to check the coherence of a partial unconditional assessment which is based on propositional satisfiability. For the conditional case, we firstly prove a new characterization of coherent conditional assessments that allows us to define an algorithm again based on propositional satisfiability. The extension problem, in both settings, is solved by means of a search algorithm which relies on the corresponding coherence procedure. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
