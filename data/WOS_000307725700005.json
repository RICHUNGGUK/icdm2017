The system performance parameters including saturation throughput, packet drop probability, drop time, and average delay are derived using the new Markov model. By comparing the numerical results with simulation results, the model is proved to be more accurate than previous work. The numerical results show that the channel bit error rate has a significant impact not only on system performance, but also on the sensitivity of other system parameters including network scale, channel data rate, and packet length.
