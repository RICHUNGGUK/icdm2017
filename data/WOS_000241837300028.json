In the proposed framework, three aspects are presented. The first is the proposal of an iterative sampling technique. The second is adopting divide-conquer-merge strategy to incorporate the iterative sampling technique and subspace analysis method. The third is that the essence of 2D PCA is further explored. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional algorithms. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
