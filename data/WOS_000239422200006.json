We instantiate the approach using timing properties, and construct a heterogeneous untimed model in which time is abstracted away, so that we can verify timing properties in an untimed framework. The correctness of property-oriented model construction is ensured by the conformance of semantic and syntactic mappings.", "paper_title": "Constructing property-oriented models for verification", "paper_id": "WOS:000239422200006"}
