As the production and use of ENMs increase, we are approaching the point at which it is impossible to individually assess the toxicity of a vast number of ENMs. Therefore, it is desirable to use time-effective computational methods, such as the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models, to predict the toxicity of ENMs. However, the accuracy of the nano-(Q)SARs is directly tied to the quality of the data from which the model is estimated. Although the amount of available nanotoxicity data is insufficient for generating robust nano-(Q)SAR models in most cases, there are a handful of studies that provide appropriate experimental data for (Q)SAR-like modelling investigations. The aim of this study is to review the available literature data that are particularly suitable for nano-(Q)SAR modelling. We hope that this paper can serve as a starting point for those who would like to know more about the current availability of experimental data on the health effects of ENMs for future modelling purposes.", "paper_title": "Current situation on the availability of nanostructure-biological activity data", "paper_id": "WOS:000349147300001"}
