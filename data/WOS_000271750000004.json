Boolean selection is too restrictive when users do not use or even know the data structure precisely, e.g. when queries are written based on a summary rather than on a schema. In this paper we describe a XML querying framework, called FuzzyXPath, based on Fuzzy Set Theory, which relies on fuzzy conditions for the definition of flexible constraints on stored data. A function called \"deep-similar\" is introduced to replace XPath's typical \"deep-equal\" function. The main goal is to provide a degree of similarity between two XML trees, assessing whether they are similar both structure-wise and content-wise. Several query examples are discussed in the field of XML based metadata for e-learning.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy extension of the XPath query language", "paper_id": "WOS:000271750000004"}
