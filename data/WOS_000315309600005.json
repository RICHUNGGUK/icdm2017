On the other hand hypergraphs are a well-known and useful generalization of graphs. In this article, we present an algorithm able to factorize into its prime factors any bounded-rank and bounded-degree hypergraph in O(nm), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of hyperedges of the hypergraph. First the algorithm applies a graph factorization algorithm to the 2-section of the hypergraph. Then the 2-section factorization is used to build the factorization of the hypergraph via the factorization of its L2-section. The L2-section is a recently introduced way to interpret a hypergraph as a labeled-graph. The graph factorization algorithm used in this article is due to Imrich and Peterin and is linear in time and space. Nevertheless any other such algorithm could be extended to a hypergraph factorization algorithm similar to the one presented here. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
