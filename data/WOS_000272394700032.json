The HSGP exploits multiple learning nodes (LNs) which are connected in a hierarchical structure, e.g., a binary tree. Each LN runs conventional evolutionary process to evolve its own population, and sends the evolved Population into the connected higher-level LN. The lower-level LN evolves the population with a smaller subset of training data. The higher-level LN then integrates the evolved population from the connected lower-level LNs together, and evolves the integrated population further by using a larger subset of training data. In HSGP, evolutionary processes are sequentially executed from the bottom-level LNs to the top-level LN which evolves with the entire training data. In the experiments, we adopt conventional GPs and the HSGPs to evolve image recognition programs for given training images. The results show that the use of hierarchical structure learning can significantly improve learning speed of GPs. To achieve the same performance, the HSGPs need only 30-40% of the computation cost needed by conventional GPs.", "paper_title": "Acceleration of Genetic Programming by Hierarchical Structure Learning: A Case Study on Image Recognition Program Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394700032"}
