In this paper, we propose and compare a wide variety of bound handling techniques for particle swarm optimization. By examining their performance on flat landscapes, we show that many bound handling techniques introduce significant search bias. Furthermore, we compare the performance of many bound handling techniques on a variety of test problems, demonstrating that the bound handling technique can have a major impact on the algorithm performance, and that the method recently proposed as the standard does not, in general, perform well.", "paper_title": "Experimental Analysis of Bound Handling Techniques in Particle Swarm Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000317002200009"}
