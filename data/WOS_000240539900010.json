After the output neurons generate their pairs of spikes, the system eventually halts. We give characterizations of sets definable by partially blind multicounter machines in terms of k-output SNPs operating in a sequential mode. Slight variations of the models make them universal.", "paper_title": "On spiking neural P systems and partially blind counter machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000240539900010"}
