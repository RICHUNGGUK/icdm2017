Let be a field. The graphical arrangement in is the arrangement . An arrangement is supersolvable if the intersection lattice of the cone contains a maximal chain of modular elements. The second author has shown that a graphical arrangement is supersolvable if and only if is a chordal graph. He later considered a generalization of graphical arrangements which are called -graphical arrangements. He conjectured a characterization of the supersolvability and freeness (in the sense of Terao) of a -graphical arrangement. We provide a proof of the first conjecture and state some conditions on free -graphical arrangements.", "paper_title": "Supersolvability and Freeness for -Graphical Arrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000353895400016"}
