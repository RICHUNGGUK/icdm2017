We provide an explicit solution to the functional equation that must be satisfied by the workload distribution, when the system reaches steady state. We use this solution to derive explicit expressions for the loss ratio and the sojourn time distribution. Finally, we compare this loss ratio with that of a similar system operating without admission control, in the cases of some common distributions of the relative deadline.", "paper_title": "Analysis of an queue operated under the FCFS policy with exact admission control", "paper_id": "WOS:000325265600004"}
