We show that for many instances of the SPP, the introduction of some of these cutting planes into the standard SPP model enables a commercial solver such as CPLEX to compute optimal solutions more efficiently.", "paper_title": "Valid Inequalities and Separation Algorithms for the Set Partitioning Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000364790100003"}
