In cloud computing, service requests from users go through numerous provider-specific steps from the instant it is submitted to when the requested service is fully delivered. Quantitative performance analysis is not an easy task because of the complexity of cloud provisioning control flows and the increasing scale and complexity of real-world cloud infrastructures. This work proposes a probabilistic queuing network-based model for the performance analysis of cloud infrastructures. It considers expected task completion time and rejection probability as the performance metrics. Experimental performance data suggest the correctness of the proposed model.
