The proposed MDAC eliminates the explicit common-mode feedback circuit which is required in fully-differential configurations without any power penalty. Furthermore, a new class-AB gain-boosting inverter is proposed to be used in PD MDAC structures for further power saving. This inverter provides dynamic load current with no significant static power consumption and achieves high DC gain using a new gain-boosting technique. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed circuits, they are utilized in the realization of a 1.5-bit/stage 10 bit 100 MS/s pipelined ADC.", "paper_title": "A pseudo-differential MDAC with a gain-boosting inverter for pipelined ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000333611000007"}
