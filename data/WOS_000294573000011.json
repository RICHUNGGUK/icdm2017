Due to the hardware limitations, the mobile user cannot support the heavy encryption and decryption. This investigation adjusts the entity in the roaming scenario that selects the session key to be used to different types of authentication schemes in GLOMONET and presents two provably secure and efficient authentication protocols for roaming services. One protocol is based on synchronized clocks, while the other uses random numbers. Compared to related approaches, the proposed authentication protocols not only reduce the number of transmissions, but also diminish the computational cost involved in encryption and decryption. Thus, they are more suitable for GLOMONET. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
