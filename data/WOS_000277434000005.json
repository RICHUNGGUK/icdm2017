The concepts of Information Power and significant proximity of the measure of information and knowledge could enable upgrading these analogies for solving important tasks from the area of Systems Engineering. This attempt seems to be attractive, as it could help in using the well-established and proved methodologies from the classical areas of electricity or mechanics.", "paper_title": "TOWARDS INFORMATION CIRCUITS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277434000005"}
