We shall consider the stabilizing effects of impulses when the corresponding impulse-free DHNN is even not asymptotically stable. The obtained results characterize the aggregated effects of impulses and deviation of the impulse-free DHNN from its equilibrium point on the exponential stability of the whole system. It is shown that, because of effects of impulses, the impulsive discrete-time DHNN may be exponentially stable even if the evolution of impulse-free component deviates from its equilibrium point exponentially.", "paper_title": "Stabilizing Effects of Impulses in Discrete-Time Delayed Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287097500013"}
