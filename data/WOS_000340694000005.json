Equivalently, a set graph is the underlying graph of the digraph representation of a hereditarily finite set. In this paper, we continue the study of set graphs and related topics, focusing on computational complexity aspects. We prove that set graph recognition is NP-complete, even when the input is restricted to bipartite graphs with exactly two leaves. The problem remains NP-complete if, in addition, we require that the extensional acyclic orientation be also slim, that is, that the digraph obtained by removing any arc from it is not extensional. Our approach in fact allows us to also show that the counting variants of the above problems are #P-complete, and prove similar complexity results for problems related to a generalization of extensional acyclic digraphs, the so-called hyper-extensional digraphs, which were proposed by Aczel to describe hypersets. Our proofs are based on reductions from variants of the HAMILTONIAN PATH problem. We also consider a variant of the well-known notion of a separating code in a digraph, the so-called open-out-separating code, and show that it is NP-complete to determine whether an input extensional acyclic digraph contains an open-out-separating code of given size.
