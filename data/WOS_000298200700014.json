In this article we apply the graph theoretic measures to brain functional networks based on the resting EEGs of fourteen schizophrenic patients in comparison with those of fourteen matched control subjects. The networks were extracted from common-average-referenced EEG time-series through partial and unpartial cross-correlation methods. Unpartial correlation detects functional connectivity based on direct and/or indirect links, while partial correlation allows one to ignore indirect links. We quantified the network properties with the graph metrics, including mall-worldness, vulnerability, modularity, assortativity. and synchronizability. The schizophrenic patients showed method-specific and frequency-specific changes especially pronounced for modularity, assortativity, and synchronizability measures. However, the differences between schizophrenia patients and normal controls in terms of graph theory metrics were stronger for the unpartial correlation method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
