While most edge detectors rely on the presence of strong intensity gradients, this criteria can limit robustness in many real world cases. In this work we propose a scheme which makes use of a combination of both global and local segmentation methods to capture the boundary of target objects in low contrast images. This approach has several advantages: the globally convex segmentation scheme is immune from initial conditions and is easily adapted to the data. The addition of a segmentation scheme based on local curve evolution produces a solution which is shown to help preserve topology between the initial and target shape, a property lacking in globally convex segmentation schemes. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves enhanced performance compared to classical data-driven segmentation schemes proposed in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.
