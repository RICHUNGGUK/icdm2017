As a first general approach, the well-known logistic model and a modified version are used. As a second approach, a theta-logistic type model with delay is adopted. Finally, a modified version of this delay model is proposed and compared with the others. The results are illustrated using computer simulations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
