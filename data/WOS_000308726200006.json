This multilevel analysis is used to optimize the coefficients in the semi-implicit Runge-Kutta smoother, such that the spectral radius of the multigrid error transformation operator is minimal under properly chosen constraints. The Runge-Kutta coefficients for a wide range of cell Reynolds numbers and a detailed analysis of the performance of the hp-MGS algorithm are presented. In addition, the computational complexity of the hp-MGS algorithm is investigated. The hp-MGS algorithm is tested on a fourth order accurate space-time discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the advection-diffusion equation for a number of model problems, which include thin boundary layers and highly stretched meshes, and a non-constant advection velocity. For all test cases excellent multigrid convergence is obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
