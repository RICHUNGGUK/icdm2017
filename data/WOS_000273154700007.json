This analysis is based on the coherent control for the quantum system and a hypothesis that the probe can be prepared in specified initial states. The results show that a quantum system can be manipulated by probe state-dependent coherent control. In this sense, the present analysis provides a new control scheme which combines the coherent control and state preparation technology.", "paper_title": "INDIRECT QUANTUM CONTROL FOR FINITE-DIMENSIONAL COUPLED SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273154700007"}
