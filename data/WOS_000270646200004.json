A document is represented by undirected and directed graph, respectively. Then terms and vectorized graph connectionists are extracted from the graphs by employing several feature extraction methods. This hybrid document feature representation more accurately reflects the underlying semantics that are difficult to achieve from the currently used term histograms, and it facilitates the matching of complex graph. in application level, we develop a document retrieval system based on self-organizing map (SOM) to speed up the retrieval process. We perform extensive experimental verification, and the results suggest that the proposed method is computationally efficient and accurate for document retrieval. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
