Once a node is physically captured, it can be reprogrammed and replicated into a large number of replicas, and thus maliciously occupying the network. Although until now various schemes have been proposed to detect replicas, most of them suffer from high energy costs and additional device such as a global positioning system. In this paper, we introduce the efficient replica detection framework without the need of additional device. The framework consists of key establishment and replica detection protocols. The proposed replica detection protocol is executed on the proposed key establishment protocol. Furthermore, through simulation experiments, we show that the proposed replica detection protocol provides high replica detection ratio, faster replica detection, and higher energy saving than existing protocols.", "paper_title": "Low-priced and efficient replica detection framework for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700035"}
