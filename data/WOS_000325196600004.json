The problem is to find a closed shortest path in a polygonal map such that all goals are visited. The proposed solution is based on a self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm for the traveling salesman problem. Neurons' weights are considered as nodes inside the polygonal domain and connected nodes represent a path that evolves according to the proposed adaptation rules. In addition, a reference algorithm based on the solution of the traveling salesman problem and the consecutive touring polygons problem is provided to find high quality solutions of the created set of problems. The problems are designed to represent various inspection and patrolling tasks and can form a kind of benchmark set for multi-goal path planning algorithms. The performance of the algorithms is examined in this problem set, which includes an instance of the watchman route problem with restricted visibility range. The proposed SOM based algorithms provide a unified approach to solve various visibility based routing problems in polygonal maps while they provide a competitive quality of solutions to the reference algorithm with significantly lower computational requirements.
