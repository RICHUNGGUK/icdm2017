In this paper, a novel optimization method has been developed for the synthesis of intensified heat exchanger networks with a simple mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model under retrofit scenario, and a robust solution strategy based on two iteration loops has been proposed. The new method has distinctive advantages over existing design methods, as the new MILP model can effectively and significantly reduce computational difficulties associated with nonlinear formulation in existing HEN retrofit formulations. Three cases have been tested to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the proposed approach, which requires very short computational times to obtain optimal solutions when energy saving or profit is to be maximised through retrofit.
