A conceptual model is proposed with four factors: perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness (from technology acceptance model), perceived risk and information, which impact e-payment use. Beyond these factors, the adaptor's personal innovativeness in technology is used as a key moderator. The sample consists of 676 Vietnamese and Taiwanese banking services users accessed through a survey. Results confirm the effects of the above determinants on customers' choices for e-payment use and reveal the role of personal innovativeness as a moderator. Practical guidelines are provided to bank managers on how to push up the process of adopting or adapt technology in new market. A comparison between Vietnamese and Taiwanese customers' perception brings a valuable reflection for investors or managers when targeting Vietnam or Taiwan market.", "paper_title": "EXPLORING E-PAYMENT ADOPTION IN VIETNAM AND TAIWAN", "paper_id": "WOS:000294037500005"}
