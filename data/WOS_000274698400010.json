It is highly desirable to retain the basic OSPF model of reliable flooding, especially when large quantities of external, rarely-changing routing data must be carried across the radio network. However, it is not easy to implement reliable flooding, and improper implementations may cause excessive message control overheads. An existing patent method proposes an expanding ring algorithm to build adjacency graph for reliable flooding. We first analyze this method and show the message complexity of reliable flooding could be O(n) times of optimum. We then show that a slight modification on this method can generate an adjacency graph, called ER-CDS, which supports reliable flooding with message complexity O(1) of optimum. However, the construction cost based on the patent method is still high and does not adapt to network topology changes well. Finally, we propose a localized splash merging algorithm to construct ER-CDS, and then conducted extensive simulations to evaluate its performance.", "paper_title": "Distributed Topology Control for Efficient OSPF Routing in Mufti-hop Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274698400010"}
