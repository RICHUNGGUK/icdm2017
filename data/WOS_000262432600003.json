To achieve high sampling linearity the circuit utilizes improved bootstrapped input switches. The fully differential design relaxes the trade-off between sampling speed and the sampling precision. The circuit design of major building blocks is described in detail. A prototype circuit in a 0.35-mu m CMOS process is integrated and experimental results are presented. The sample-and-hold circuit operates up to 250 MHz of sampling frequency with less than -70 dB of total harmonic distortion corresponding to 11 bits for an input 60.8 MHz sinusoidal amplitude of 1.8 V (pp) at a 3 V supply. The total harmonic distortion measurement reflects the held values as well as the tracking components of the output waveform. In these conditions, a differential hold pedestal of less than 0.8 mV, 0.8 ns acquisition time at 1.8 V step input, and 1.8 V (pp) full-scale differential input range are achieved. The circuit dissipates 22 mW with a 3 V power supply.", "paper_title": "A 250 MHz 11 bit 22 mW CMOS low-hold-pedestal fully differential sample-and-hold circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000262432600003"}
