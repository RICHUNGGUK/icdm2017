Without additional agents, the built-in and self-organized diagnosis mechanism can monitor each node in real time and identify faulty nodes. As the diagnosis is operated within a cluster of nodes, it can reduce power consumption and communication traffic. We present a modeling of the diagnosis algorithm for WSNs, with a probabilistic analysis of the local and global performances of our approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
