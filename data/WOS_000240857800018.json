The business logic acts as a mediator between the data and the user, therefore playing a central role in any spatial information system. The component is used in service-oriented architectures to foster the reuse of existing geodata inventories. Based on a geoscientific case study of groundwater vulnerability assessment and mapping, the demands for such architectures are identified with special regard to software engineering tasks. Methods are derived from the field of applied Geosciences (Hydrogeology), Geoinformatics, and Software Engineering. In addition to the development of a business logic component, a forthcoming Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) specification is introduced: the OGC Web Processing Service (WPS) specification. A sample application is introduced to demonstrate the potential of WPS for future information systems. The sample application Geoservice Groundwater Vulnerability is described in detail to provide insight into the business logic component, and demonstrate how information can be generated out of distributed geodata. This has the potential to significantly accelerate the assessment and mapping of groundwater vulnerability. The presented concept is easily transferable to other geoscientific use cases dealing with distributed data inventories. Potential application fields include web-based geoinformation systems operating on distributed data (e.g. environmental planning systems, cadastral information systems, and others).
