Its structure and components are specified, based on an analysis of three types of requirements: infrastructure providers, service providers and end users. These considerations have led us to formulate a new infrastructural model, offered to end users as a collection of Virtual Machines (VM) connected by a. dedicated Virtual Private Network (VPN) with QoS guarantees. The role of repositories in cloud provisioning systems is specified along with the relevant data acquisition processes. The applicability of the proposed system is illustrated by practical usage scenarios.", "paper_title": "FLEXIBLE ORGANIZATION OF REPOSITORIES FOR PROVISIONING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000309328000003"}
