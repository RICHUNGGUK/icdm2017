All optical tracking device is used to track and collect discrete data from an individual's chewing movements. Accurate registration between the optical tracking system and the upper and lower dental casts is performed by Use of a specially-designed tracking plate. A personalized occlusal surface is built front the extracted coupler points according to registered rigid body movements. The proposed theory-based Modelling outcome provides crucial information for customized false teeth fabrication and, with his-her analysis, could be used for diagnosis and biomechanical studies. The presented system overcomes many of the deficiencies and provides all alternative tool of the widely used conventional mechanical articulators in present-day dental clinics. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
