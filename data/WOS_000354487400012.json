However, traditional production scheduling in the MTO environment considers only similarity of due dates but little process similarity. Different from traditional scheduling, aggregating the similarities of due dates and production processes, a group-based production scheduling approach is proposed. Group-based production scheduling takes order groups as scheduling units and part groups as scheduling objects to minimize the total manufacturing lead time in a planning period. Besides, a group based matrix and a production capacity constraint estimation method are proposed for formulating scheduling constraints. To ensure the quality result, a tabu search based algorithm of production scheduling is proposed. Results of a case study reveal that the group-based method can reduce the manufacturing lead time because of the reducing of processing set-up efforts.", "paper_title": "Group-based production scheduling for make-to-order production", "paper_id": "WOS:000354487400012"}
