This improves on the best previous result. The best result so far gave 2((log n)1/2-epsilon) factor hardness by Rossner and Seifert [C. Rossner, J.P. Seifert, On the hardness of approximating shortest integer relations among rational numbers, Theoret. Comput. Sci. 209 (1-2) (1998) 287-297], where epsilon > 0 is an arbitrarily small constant. By the improved result of SIR infinity, we also improve on the inapproximability factor of Good Diophantine Approximations in l(infinity) norm (GDA(infinity)) to n(c)/(log) (logn).
