The convexity constraint is transformed via the Fejer-Riesz theorem on positive trigonometric polynomials into a semidefinite programming problem. Several problems such as the minimization of the area in the class of constant-width planar bodies, rotors and space bodies of revolution are revisited. The approach seems promising to investigate more difficult optimization problems in the class of three-dimensional convex bodies.", "paper_title": "Semidefinite programming for optimizing convex bodies under width constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000306841500009"}
