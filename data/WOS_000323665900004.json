In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive technical platform to support such adaptations. Dynamic and low disruptive software updating techniques for multi-grained abstractions, namely objects, processes/workflows, components and coordinated systems, are proposed toward a seamless adaptation experience. The platform integrates all the techniques organically to support the practical adaptation scenarios that need the synergy of multiple techniques. We implement the platform in accordance with industrial standards with its feasibility and efficiency demonstrated and hope the platform can be a stepping stone for future technical research for the Internetware paradigm.", "paper_title": "Toward a seamless adaptation platform for Internetware", "paper_id": "WOS:000323665900004"}
