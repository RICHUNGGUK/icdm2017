Aiming at parallel implementation of Montgomery multiplication, this brief presents an improved task partitioning of the Montgomery multiplication algorithm for the multicore platform with area-efficient processors. Several multicore platforms are designed to verify the efficiency of parallelization. The fastest platform takes 3460 cycles to finish a 1024-b Montgomery multiplication, which is six times faster than a single MIPS processor and three times faster than the pSHS parallelization based on a platform with eight MicroBlaze cores.", "paper_title": "Parallelization of Radix-2 Montgomery Multiplication on Multicore Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000326107500015"}
