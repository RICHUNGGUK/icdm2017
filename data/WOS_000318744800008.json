We propose a general method for automatic diagnostic assessment of the pronunciation of nonnative speakers based on models of the human auditory periphery. Considering each phoneme class separately, the geometric shape similarity between the native auditory domain and the non-native speech domain is measured. The phonemes that deviate the most from the native pronunciation for a set of L2 speakers are detected by comparing the geometric shape similarity measure with that calculated for native speakers on the same phonemes. To evaluate the system, we have tested it with different non-native speaker groups from various language backgrounds. The experimental results are in accordance with linguistic findings and human listeners' ratings, particularly when both the spectral and temporal cues of the speech signal are utilized in the pronunciation analysis.
