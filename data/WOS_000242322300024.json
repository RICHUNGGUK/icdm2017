This model involves a system of three ordinary differential equations. Design/methodology/approach - Parameters identification leads to the minimization of an error functional given by the sum of variations between measured variables and calculated variables obtained by solving the system of differential equations. We assume that the quantity of healthy cells CD4 + T and the viral load contents in the blood are measured. Findings - The identification was realized by applying the combined Adomian/Alienor method allowing to reduce the problem to a minimization problem in dimention one. Practical implications - Simulation results are given for illustration. Originality/value - Application to parameter identification in an HIV model-compatible, results to other methods.", "paper_title": "Parameter identification of an HIV model by the combined Adomian/Alienor method", "paper_id": "WOS:000242322300024"}
