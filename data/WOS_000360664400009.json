The development of the bivariate and bifrequency theory for autonomous dynamic systems and circuits are reviewed. The two-dimensional Laplace transform techniques make it possible to characterize a large class of analytic systems and analog linear time-varying systems and circuits. The bifrequency theory and corresponding analysis techniques are outlined.
