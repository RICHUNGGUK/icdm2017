Our method, EBV (Exponent Based Verifier), can verify a batch of signatures and identify a bad signature using one modular exponentiation and 2n +3 root n-/2 modular multiplications where n is the number of signatures in the batch instances. Simulation results also show the proposed method reduces considerably the number of modular multiplications compared with the existing methods.", "paper_title": "Efficient batch verification for RSA-type digital signatures in a ubiquitous environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300034"}
