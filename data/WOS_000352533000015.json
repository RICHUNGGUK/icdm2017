However, current algorithms are likely to fail in real-world scenarios for several reasons. For example, surveillance cameras are typically mounted high above the ground plane, causing serious perspective changes. Also, most algorithms approach matching across images using the same descriptors, regardless of camera viewpoint or human pose. Here, we introduce a re-identification algorithm that addresses both problems. We build a model for human appearance as a function of pose, using training data gathered from a calibrated camera. We then apply this \"pose prior\" in online re-identification to make matching and identification more robust to viewpoint. We further integrate person-specific features learned over the course of tracking to improve the algorithm's performance. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and compare it to several state-of-the-art algorithms, demonstrating superior performance on standard benchmarking datasets as well as a challenging new airport surveillance scenario.", "paper_title": "Viewpoint Invariant Human Re-Identification in Camera Networks Using Pose Priors and Subject-Discriminative Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000352533000015"}
