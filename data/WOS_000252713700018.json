The obtained satisfactory binding structures and 3D-QSAR models strongly suggest that the 3D structural model of mPGES-1 is reasonable for study of mPGES-1 binding with inhibitors and for future design of novel mPGES-1 inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Human microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) binding with inhibitors and the quantitative structure-activity correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252713700018"}
