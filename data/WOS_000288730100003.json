Our complexity bounds count field operations and inequality checks, and are quadratic in n and the logarithm of a certain condition number. For the special case of n-variate (n + 2)-nomials with integer exponents, the log of our condition number is sub-quadratic in the sparse size. The best previous complexity bounds were exponential in the sparse size, even for n fixed. Along the way, we partially extend the theory of Viro diagrams and A-discriminants to real exponents. We also show that, for any fixed delta > 0, deciding whether the supremum of an n-variate (n + n(delta))-nomial exceeds a given number is NP(R)-complete.
