Wavelet analysis of borehole data has provided an effective way of mitigating noise and delineating relevant boundaries. We extend wavelet analysis by providing a complete set of code and functions that will objectively block a geophysical trace based on a derivative operator algorithm that searches for inflection points in the bore log. Layer boundaries detected from the operator output are traced back to a zero-width operator so that boundaries are consistently and objectively detected. Layers are then classified based on importance and analysis is completed by selecting either total number of layers, a portion of the total number of layers, selection of minimum layer thickness, or layers detected by a specified minimum operator width. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the layer blocking technique by applying it to a case study for alluvial aquifer detection in the Gascoyne River area of Western Australia.
