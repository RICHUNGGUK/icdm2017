By using the Ito formula, Lyapunov function, and Halanay inequality, we established several mean-square stability criteria from which we can estimate the feasible bounds of impulses, provided that parameter uncertainty and stochastic perturbations are well-constrained. Moreover, the present method can also be applied to general differential systems with stochastic perturbation and impulses.", "paper_title": "Robust Exponential Stability of Uncertain Delayed Neural Networks With Stochastic Perturbation and Impulse Effects", "paper_id": "WOS:000306522200002"}
