In such systems, unintentional design faults might result in injury or even death to human beings. To avoid such mishaps, we need to verify safety-critical systems thoroughly and formal verification techniques such as model checking are a very promising approach. However, modeling the systems formally is a challenging task, which is further aggravated by the necessity to model faults and automatic repairs in safety-critical systems. Currently, there is no automatic technique in formal veri. cation that can aid system designers in formally modeling the faults and repairs. This work contributes by proposing an extension to the Safecharts model so that faults and repairs are easily modeled and then the Safecharts are transformed into semantically equivalent Extended Timed Automata models that can be directly model checked. In this way, automatic failure analysis techniques are integrated into the SGM model checker. Application examples show the feasibility and benefits of the proposed model-driven verification of safety-critical systems.", "paper_title": "Automatic failure analysis using Safecharts", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862700004"}
