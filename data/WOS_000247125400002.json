The expert system monitors sensor data collected by local monitoring stations and reasons about the current level of water suitability for various aquatic uses, such as swimming and piscicultures. The aim of the expert system is to help the authorities in the decision-making process in the battle against pollution of the aquatic environment, which is vital for public health and the economy of northern Greece. The expert system determines, using fuzzy logic, when certain environmental parameters exceed certain pollution limits, which are specified either by the authorities or by environmental scientists, and flags up appropriate alerts.", "paper_title": "Monitoring water quality through a telematic sensor network and a fuzzy expert system", "paper_id": "WOS:000247125400002"}
