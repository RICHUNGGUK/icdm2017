To this end, this paper removes some of the constraints of the improved minimax disparity (MD) model and obtains its optimal simplex tableau in the general case (i.e., for any level of orness and n), and then for the desired n introduces n-1 optimal basic feasible solutions of the model. The study also presents the weights of the preference ranking aggregation system without solving any model and suggests a secondary goal model for selecting a unique preference ranking aggregation weights through the alternative optimal weights of the improved MD model. The usefulness of the proposed methods is indicated by using an application to rank Ph.D. candidates.", "paper_title": "The OWA Weights of Improved Minimax Disparity Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000353982300001"}
