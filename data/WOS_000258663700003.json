Then novel adaptive schemes for time-varying anticipating synchronization of certain or uncertain chaotic dynamical systems are designed based on the Lyapunov function and invariance principle. The update gain of coupling strength can be automatically adapted to a suitable strength depending on the initial values and can be properly chosen to adjust the speed of achieving synchronization, so these schemes are analytical and simple to implement in practice. A classical chaotic dynamical system is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed adaptive schemes with or without parameter uncertainties. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
