In this coding problem, there are two encoders and a decoder. An encoder outputs an action that affects the state of the channel. Then, the other encoder outputs a codeword of the message into the channel by using the channel state. The decoder receives a noisy observation of the codeword, and reconstructs the message. In this paper, we show an exponential error bound for channels with action-dependent states based on the random coding argument.", "paper_title": "Random-Coding Exponential Error Bounds for Channels with Action-Dependent States", "paper_id": "WOS:000329006900002"}
