The proposed methodology consists of two parts: (i) AFS (Axiomatic Fuzzy Set) clustering method (Liu, Wang, & Chai, 2005) has been studied further to effectively evaluate logistics center location, and (ii) TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)-based final selection. The criteria, which are relevant in the selection of logistics center site, have been analyzed and identified, and the logistics center site evaluation system is built by using modern principles of town planning and logistics. A case fifteen regional logistics center cities and thirteen criteria are studied and the numerical results show that the proposed evaluation framework is reasonable to identify logistics center location, and it is effective to determine the optimal logistics center location even with the interactive and interdependent criteria/attributes.
