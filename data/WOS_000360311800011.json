However, in the practice, there exist many elastic transmission elements, which may cause vibration to reduce system performance, moreover, the vibration possibly damage the mechanical transmission elements. In this paper, a modified internal model controller (MIMC) for the speed regulation of the drive part with elastic joints in robotic system is proposed, where control structure is composed of an internal model controller (IMC) and a feedback controller. In order to improve the performance of the motor speed, the parameters of controller are set based on the rule that the settle time is shorter and vibration can be efficiently suppressed. The experiment on the two-mass test platform with one motor speed transducer has been done to verify effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Modified Internal Model Control Scheme for the Drive Part with Elastic Joints in Robotic System", "paper_id": "WOS:000360311800011"}
