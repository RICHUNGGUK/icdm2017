It is therefore highly important for OLAP tools to consider the security rules defined at early stages of the development lifecycle. By following the MDA approach we have created an architecture with which to develop secure Data Warehouses, and in this paper we complete this architecture, thus obtaining secure multidimensional code in SQL Server Analysis Services from our secure multidimensional conceptual model (SECDW) by using QVT transformations. We focus on automatically obtaining code for the security constraints defined at upper abstraction levels.", "paper_title": "Applying QVT in Order to Implement Secure Data Warehouses in SQL Server Analysis Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000267833400005"}
