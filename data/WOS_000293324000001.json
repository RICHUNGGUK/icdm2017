Let P be a system of n linear differential polynomial parametric equations in n - 1 differential parameters, with implicit ideal ID. Given a nonzero linear differential polynomial A in ID, we give necessary and sufficient conditions on A for P to be n - 1 dimensional. We prove the existence of a linear perturbation P(phi) of P, so that the linear complete differential resultant partial derivative CRes(phi), associated to P(phi), is nonzero. A nonzero linear differential polynomial in ID is obtained, from the lowest degree term of partial derivative CRes(phi), and used to provide an implicitization for P. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
