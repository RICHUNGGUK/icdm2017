Here we introduce a computational scheme to process 3D multicell time-lapse images as they are produced in large-scale RNAi experiments. We describe an approach to automatically segment, track, and classify cell nuclei into different mitotic phases. This enables automated analysis of the duration of single phases of the cell life cycle and thus the identification of cell cultures that show an abnormal mitotic behavior. Our scheme proves a high accuracy, suggesting a promising future for automating the evaluation of high-throughput experiments.", "paper_title": "Automated analysis of the mitotic phases of human cells in 3D fluorescence microscopy image sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300103"}
