The aim of this study is to extend a previous work of Roy et al. [1], in order to estimate optimal feet forces and joint torques of the six-legged robot generating wave-gaits with four different duty factors and deal with its stability issues. Two different approaches are developed to determine optimal feet forces. In the first approach, minimization of the norm of feet forces is carried out using a least square method, whereas minimization of the norm of joint torques is performed in the second approach. The second approach is found to be more energy efficient compared to the first one. The maximum values of feet forces and joint torques are seen to decrease with the increase of duty factor. The effects of walking parameters, namely velocity, stroke and duty factors have been studied on energy consumption and stability of the robot. The variations of average power consumption and specific energy consumption with the velocity and stroke are compared for four different duty factors. Wave gait with a low duty factor is found to be more energy-efficient compared to that with a high duty factor at the highest possible velocity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
