These reactions show very low activation energies and complete endo selectivity, in agreement with the experimental data. For a dienic steroid model, the reaction presents an a-facial selectivity. Analysis of reactivity indices explains the superelectrophilic character of TADs, and low activation energy. The substituent and solvent effects are also evaluated.", "paper_title": "Understanding the high reactivity of triazolinediones in Diels-Alder reactions.
