The SU can get the transmission opportunity to achieve its own data traffic by providing the secrecy guarantee for the PU with artificial noise. Different from the existing works, which adopt the instantaneous secrecy rate as the performance metric, with only the statistical channel state information (CSI) of the eavesdroppers, we maximize the secrecy throughput of the PU by designing and optimizing the beamforming, rate parameters of the wiretap code adopted by the PU, and power allocation between the information signal and the artificial noise of the SU, subjected to the secrecy outage constraint at the PU and a throughput constraint at the SU. We propose two design strategies: 1) non-adaptive secure transmission strategy (NASTS) and 2) adaptive secure transmission strategy, which are based on the statistical and instantaneous CSIs of the primary and secondary links, respectively. For both strategies, the exact rate parameters can be optimized through numerical methods. Moreover, we derive an explicit approximation for the optimal rate parameters of the NASTS at high SNR regime. Numerical results are illustrated to show the efficiency of the proposed schemes.", "paper_title": "On the Secrecy Throughput Maximization for MISO Cognitive Radio Network in Slow Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000357825000005"}
