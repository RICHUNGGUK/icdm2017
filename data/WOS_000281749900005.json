Under this context, device authentication must be considered as a key security issue, complementary and of equal importance to user authentication, in today's wireless and forthcoming ubiquitous realms. This paper classifies and analyses possible major solutions proposed until now towards solving the device authentication issue. We constructively argue on each solution presented examining its advantages and disadvantages. A qualitative comparative analysis for the device authentication schemes in question is also offered, probing its applicability for both infrastructure and ad-hoc deployments. Inter-domain device authentication, where applicable, and users' privacy as a side-effect are investigated as well.", "paper_title": "DEVICE AUTHENTICATION IN WIRELESS AND PERVASIVE ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000281749900005"}
