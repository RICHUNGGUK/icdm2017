Novel memristive systems continue to attract growing attention since their reported physical realization by HP in 2008. Unique characteristics like non-volatility, re-configurability, and analog storage properties make memristors a very promising candidate for the realization of artificial neural systems. In this work, we propose a memristor-based design of bidirectional transmission excitation/inhibition synapses and implement a neuromorphic computing system based on our proposed synapse designs. The robustness of our system is also evaluated by considering the actual manufacturing variability with emphasis on process variation.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable Neuromorphic Computing System with Memristor-Based Synapse Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000351176000002"}
