We will reveal that under some conditions, the space R(n) can be divided into 2(n) subsets, and in each subset, the delayed n-neuron neural network has a locally stable almost-periodic solution. Furthermore, we also investigate the attraction basins of these almost-periodic solutions. We reveal that the attraction basin of almost-periodic trajectory is larger than the subset, where the corresponding almost-periodic trajectory is located. In addition, several numerical simulations are presented to corroborate the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Multistability and New Attraction Basins of Almost-Periodic Solutions of Delayed Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270949900005"}
