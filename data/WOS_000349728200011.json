Firstly, a new discrete event-triggered transmission protocol (DETTP) is proposed to reduce the utilization rate of communication bandwidth. The main features of the proposed protocol involve three aspects: (I) it allows the presence of external disturbances and multiplicative noise; (2) it is more general than some existing event-triggered transmission schemes in the deterministic setting; and (3) the minimum inter-event time is implicity defined and is naturally given by the sampling period chosen for the plant. Secondly, under the DETTP, a new closed-loop stochastic networked control system model is established. Remarkably, to facilitate theoretical analysis, the resultant event-based stochastic networked control system is further transformed into a system with two successive delay components in the state, considering the effects of network-induced delays, multiplicative noise and DETTP in a unified framework. By using stochastic system theory, sufficient conditions on the existence of the desired event-based H infinity state feedback controller are derived such that the resultant event-based stochastic networked control system is exponentially stable in the mean square sense with a prescribed H infinity performance while reducing the number of sampled-state transmission along the feedback link as much as possible. Thirdly, a co-design algorithm for determining the parameters of the DETTP and the state feedback controller gain matrix are also proposed. Finally, two practical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness and advantage of the proposed method over some existing results in the literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
