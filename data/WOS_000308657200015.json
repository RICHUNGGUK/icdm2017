However, the software layer in such systems introduces non-negligible overheads which affect performance and user experience. Hence, reducing DBT/DBO overheads is of paramount importance. In addition, reduced overheads have interesting collateral effects in the rest of the software layer, such as allowing optimizations to be applied earlier. A cost-effective solution to this problem is to provide hardware support to speed up the primitives of the software layer, paying special attention to automate DBT/DBO mechanisms and leave the heuristics to the software, which is more flexible. In this work, we have characterized the overheads of a DBO system using DynamoRIO implementing several basic optimizations. We have seen that the computation of the Data Dependence Graph (DDG) accounts for 5%-10% of the execution time. For this reason, we propose to add hardware support for this task in the form of a new functional unit, called DDGacc, which is integrated in a conventional pipeline processor and is operated through new ISA instructions. Our evaluation shows that DDGacc reduces the cost of computing the DDG by 32x, which reduces overall execution time by 5%-10% on average and up to 18% for applications where the DBO optimizes large code footprints.", "paper_title": "DDGacc: Boosting Dynamic DDG-based Binary Optimizations through Specialized Hardware Support", "paper_id": "WOS:000308657200015"}
