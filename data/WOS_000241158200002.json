However, these approaches often fail in providing mechanisms to univocally and automatically derive a logical representation of the MD conceptual model. To overcome this limitation, we present an approach to align the MD modeling of the DW repository with the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) by formally defining a set of Query/View/Transformation (QVT) transformation rules which allow us to obtain a logical representation of the MD conceptual model in an automatic way. Finally, we show how to implement our approach in an MDA-compliant commercial tool.", "paper_title": "Applying transformations to model driven data warehouses", "paper_id": "WOS:000241158200002"}
