Our data structure is adaptive in the sense that it gives improved search performance for data that is better than the worst case (Demaine et al., 2000) [8]; in this case, data with more inherent sortedness. Given n points on the plane, the linear space data structure can answer range queries in O(log n + k + m) time, where m is the number of points in the output and k is the minimum number of monotonic chains into which the point set can be decomposed, which is O(root n) in the worst case. Our result matches the worst-case performance of other optimal-time linear space data structures, or surpasses them when k = o(root n). Our data structure can be made implicit, requiring no extra space beyond that of the data points themselves (Munro and Suwanda, 1980) [16], in which case the query time becomes O(k log n + m). We also present a novel algorithm of independent interest to decompose a point set into a minimum number of untangled, similarly directed monotonic chains in O(k(2)n + n log n) time.
