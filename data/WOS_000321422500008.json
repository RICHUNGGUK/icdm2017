If the set of newly added edges is inclusion-minimal among all possibilities, we say that H is a minimal interval completion of G. We give an O(n(2))-time algorithm to obtain a minimal interval completion of an arbitrary graph. This improves the previous O(nm) time bound for the problem and lowers this bound for the first time below the best known bound for minimal chordal completion. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
