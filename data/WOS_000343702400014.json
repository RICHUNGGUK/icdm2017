Manifold learning algorithms have recently emerged as alternatives to traditional linear dimension reduction techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel projection method that can be combined with any manifold learning methods to improve their dimension reduction performance when applied to high-dimensional data with a high level of noise. The method first builds a dispersion function that describes the distribution of dispersed manifold where the data lie. It then projects the noisy data onto a region wrapping the true manifold sufficiently close to it by applying a dynamical projection system associated with the constructed dispersion function. The effectiveness of the proposed projection method is validated by applying it to some real-world data sets with promising results.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Dynamic Projection for Noise Reduction of Dispersed Manifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000343702400014"}
