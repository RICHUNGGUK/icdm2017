Based on these formulations, Semidefinite Programming relaxations are derived for finding good lower bounds to these fractional programs, which can be used in a global optimization branch-and-bound approach. Applications of the CFQP and StFQP, related with the correction of infeasible linear systems and eigenvalue complementarity problems are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Copositivity and constrained fractional quadratic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884700012"}
