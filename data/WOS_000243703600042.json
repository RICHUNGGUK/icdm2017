Deciding the local converging directions of the contour points is essential for correctly extracting the boundary of a moving deformable object. Thus, a new energy function for a parametric active contour model is proposed based on the addition of a directional energy term using a frame difference map to the greedy snake. The frame difference map is used to obtain motion information on an object with fast and non-rigid motion. Plus, updating rules for the frame difference map are also developed to encourage the stable convergence of the contour points. Experiments on a set of synthetic and real image sequences show that the proposed method could fully track a speedy deformable object while exactly extracting the boundary of the object in every frame.", "paper_title": "Motion-based boundary tracking of moving object using parametric active contour model", "paper_id": "WOS:000243703600042"}
