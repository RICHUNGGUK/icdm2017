However, this kind of multicast routing that only addresses the transmission radius coverage might not be able to meet the bandwidth requirement of the users. As a result, additional transmissions are required to incur more energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions that make existing algorithms not applicable to bandwidth constrained applications. In this paper, for the first time, we address the bandwidth aware minimum power multicast routing problem in wireless networks where the objective function is to minimize the total power consumption subject to the users' bandwidth requirements. This problem is a challenging cross-layer design problem that requires seamless and sophisticated integrated design in the network layer (multicast routing) and physical layer (bandwidth-aware wireless transmission and power control). We first formulate this problem as a mixed integer linear programming problem and then propose a Lagrangian relaxation based algorithm to solve this problem. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach is a sound green networking algorithm that outperforms the existing power efficient multicast routing approaches under all tested cases, especially in large bandwidth request, fine radius granularity, large group size and sparse network.", "paper_title": "A novel optimization-based bandwidth-aware minimum power multicast routing algorithm in green wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310428700003"}
