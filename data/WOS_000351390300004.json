This paper proposes an image-based controller which allows the joint structure guidance when its number of degrees of freedom is greater than the required for the developed task. In this case, the controller solves the redundancy combining two different tasks: the primary task allows the correct guidance using image information, and the secondary task determines the most adequate joint structure posture solving the possible joint redundancy regarding the performed task in the image space. The method proposed to guide the joint structure also employs a smoothing Kalman filter not only to determine the moment when abrupt changes occur in the tracked trajectory, but also to estimate and compensate these changes using the proposed filter. Furthermore, a direct visual control approach is proposed which integrates the visual information provided by this smoothing Kalman filter. This last aspect permits the correct tracking when noisy measurements are obtained. All the contributions are integrated in an application which requires the tracking of the faces of Asperger children.", "paper_title": "Control of Redundant Joint Structures Using Image Information During the Tracking of Non-Smooth Trajectories", "paper_id": "WOS:000351390300004"}
