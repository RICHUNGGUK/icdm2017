The linear system resulting from the discretization is solved using a special solver that takes advantage of the structure of the coefficient matrix. Part of the system corresponding to the field equation is solved exactly while the part corresponding to the boundary relations is solved in the least squares sense. This process permits use of a larger number of constraints to enforce the boundary conditions along the complex flow boundaries. A significant expansion of the range of geometries that can be handled accurately using the new implementation has been documented. Furthermore, a significant acceleration of computations as well as a significant reduction of memory requirements have been demonstrated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
