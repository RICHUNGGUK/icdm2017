Atomic-bound systems, also called big-stepped probabilities, allow qualitative reasoning with probabilities, aiming at bridging the gap between qualitative and quantitative argumentation and providing a model for the nonmonotonic reasoning system P. By using Goguen and Burstall's notion of institutions for the formalization of logical systems, we elaborate precisely which formal connections exist among big-stepped probabilities, standard probabilities, and qualitative logics. Based on our investigations, we also develop two variants of conditional objects, one of them having a simpler semantics while still providing a model for system P.", "paper_title": "Semantical investigations into nonmonotonic and probabilistic logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000309867200003"}
