The tag anti-collision is a significant issue for fast identifying tags due to the shared wireless channel between tags and the reader during communication. The EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 which uses Q algorithm for the anti-collision is widely used in many applications such as consumer electronic device and supply chain. However, the increasing application of EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 which requires the dynamic environment makes the efficiency decrease critically. Furthermore, its frame length (size) determination and frame termination lead to the suboptimal efficiency. A new anti-collision algorithm is proposed to deal with the two problems for large-scale RFID systems. The algorithm has higher performance than the Q algorithm in the dynamic environment. Some simulations are given to illustrate the performance.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Anti-collision Algorithm for the EPCglobal Class-1 Generation-2 System under the Dynamic Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000348047900020"}
