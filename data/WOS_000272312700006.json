In this work, we propose a sub-pixel structure with two common electrodes of a multi-domain vertical alignment (MVA) mode. The sub-pixel is divided into two sub-areas and different common electrode voltages are applied to it. The optimal voltage difference of the common electrodes between sub-area 1 and sub-area 2 is proposed. The simulated results on the plotted displays and the voltage-transmittance property of the LCD, which has 1: 1 sub-area ratio, have been carried out. The results show that the structure can form MVA liquid crystal display mode, such as 8-domain VA mode. It can improve the V-T property at large oblique viewing angle and make the transmittance difference between the normal direction and the oblique direction viewing angle less than that of conventional 4-domain MVA mode.
