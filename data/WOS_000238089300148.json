Students interact with molecules in either desktop or immersive configuration. In the latter case, visual immersion is achieved through the use of a large rear-projected stereoscopic screen. In both configurations motion parallax is provided using a camera-based head tracking technique. Both desktop and large-scale fan-based devices that allow real-time smell diffusion are used.", "paper_title": "Using olfactive virtual environments for learning organic molecules", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300148"}
