Warehousing systems play a crucial role in providing efficiency and customer satisfaction. The warehouse design entails a wide set of decisions, which involve layout constraints and operative issues that seriously affect the performances and the overall logistics costs. This study presents an original decision-support system (DSS) for the design, management, and control of warehousing systems. Specifically, the proposed DSS implements a top-down methodology that considers both strategic warehouse design and operative operations management. The DSS can simulate the logistics and material handling performances of a warehousing system. Heuristic methods and algorithms address several critical warehouse issues, such as the order picking process, which is responsible for 55% of the overall costs in a distribution centre. The benefits due to the adoption of the proposed decision-support system are summarised as a dashboard of key performance indicators (KPIs) of space and time efficiency that allow logistics providers, practitioners, and managers as well as academicians and educators to face real-world warehousing instances and to find useful guidelines for material handling.
