The applications of the primary health information system (PHIS) in primary health care have rapidly influenced the care service delivery. Improved understanding of critical antecedents leading the PHIS usage can serve as a foundation for practice to develop implementation strategies and enhance system use for nurses. In accordance with the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this study aims to investigate the antecedents that influence nurses to use the PHIS, and to incorporate a framework of technology acceptance by individual professionals to improve the IT attitude in the health care setting. A total of 768 valid questionnaires were completed by primary health care nurses. The results indicated that compatibility has a positive influence on the perceived usefulness and perceived trust in the PHIS. If primary health care nurses perceive the PHIS to be trustworthy then they are more likely to consider it to be useful. In addition, when the PHIS is seen as both trustworthy and useful, then nurses are more likely to have a positive attitude toward using it. These findings have valuable implications for technology management practice promoting PHIS usage by primary health care nurses. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
