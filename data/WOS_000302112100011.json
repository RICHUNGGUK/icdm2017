Design/methodology/apporach - Derivation of the modal equations can be based on the Trefftz variational method developed by the authors in a previous paper. Describing the coupled dynamics utilizes Lukovsky' formulas for the resulting hydrodynamic force and moment due to liquid sloshing. Findings - The so-called Stokes-Joukowski potentials can be found by using the Trefftz method from the authors' previous paper with the same polynomial-type functional basis. coupling the modal equations with the global dynamic equations becomes a relatively simple task facilitated by Lukovsky's formulas. Using the linear multimodal method can be an efficient alternative to traditional numerical an analytical tools employed for studying the coupled vibrations of a tower with a conical rigid tank on the tower top. Practical implications - The derived modal equations are equipped by tables with the computed non-dimensional hydrodynamic coefficients. Interested readers (engineers) can incorporate the modal equations into the global dynamic equations of a whole mechanical system without new computations of these coefficients. Originality/value - The multimodal method can be an alternative to traditional numerical tools. Using the derived modal equations simplifies analytical studies and provides efficient calculations of the coupled dynamics of a mechanical system carrying a rigid tapered conical tank with a liquid.", "paper_title": "Multimodal method for linear liquid sloshing in a rigid tapered conical tank", "paper_id": "WOS:000302112100011"}
