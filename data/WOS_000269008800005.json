In order to niche multiple species for the MMFO tasks, the overlapping population replacement is surely needed because the offspring population most probably does not inherit all of the genetic information contained in its parental population, and the basic procedure for niching genetic algorithms with overlapping population replacement is presented. Then four niching schemes, the nearest neighbors replacement crowding (NNRC), the species conservation technique (SCT), the HFC-I (implicit hierarchical fair competition), and the CPE (clearing procedure with elitist) are investigated. These niching schemes are characterized with regard to different niching strategies and parameterizations, and the corresponding niching procedures are outlined. Finally, experiments are carried out on a suite of test functions to compare different niching strategies regarding niching efficiency and scalability. Experimental results illustrate the intrinsic difference of the four niching schemes. The NNRC and HFC-I have a mechanism of multiple species coevolution via adapting multiple species to different niches, while the SCT and CPE tend to make use of a mandatory mechanism to conserve species just like the grid searching over the solution space based on species distance or clearing radius. All niching methods are able to deal with complex MMFO problems, while the NNRC and HFC-I show a better performance in terms of niching efficiency and scalability, and are more robust regarding the algorithm parameterization.", "paper_title": "An investigation on niching multiple species based on population replacement strategies for multimodal functions optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000269008800005"}
