Emphasis is put on the improvement of the receiving water quality and the overall management of river-basins, which is a core element of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) as well. Typically, it is not necessary to model the whole variety of effects on the receiving water but to focus on the few dominating ones. Only pollutants and processes that have a direct and significant influence on the selected impacts need to be described quantitatively, whereas all other processes can be neglected. Hence, pragmatism is required to avoid unnecessary complexity of integrated models. This is as well true for software being used in daily engineering work, requiring simplicity in handling and a certain flexibility to be adjusted for different scenarios. CITY DRAIN (c) was developed to serve these needs. Therefore it was developed in the Matlab/Simulink (c) environment, enabling a block wise modelling of the different parts of the urban drainage system (catchment, sewer system, storage devises, receiving water, etc.). Each block represents a system element (subsystem) with different underlying modelling approaches for hydraulics and mass transport. The different subsystems can be freely arranged and connected to each other in order to describe an integrated urban drainage system. The open structure of the software allows to add own blocks and/or modify blocks (and underlying models) according to the specific needs. The application of CITY DRAIN is shown within the integrated modelling case study Vils/Reutte. Further additional applications for CITY DRAIN, including batch simulations, real time control (RTC) and model based predictive control (MBPC) are presented and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
