Given a segment of stereo signal, we first compute the discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) of the two sound channels, which yields two sets of DFT coefficients. The DFT coefficients corresponding to certain frequency range are divided into multiple subsegment pairs and a criterion is proposed to select those suitable for watermark embedding. Then a watermark is embedded into the selected subsegment pairs by modifying their DFT coefficients. The exact way of modification is determined by a secret key, the watermark to be embedded, and the DFT coefficients themselves. In the decoding process, the subsegment pairs containing watermarks are identified by another criterion. Then the secret key is used to extract the watermark from the watermarked subsegments. Compared to the existing patchwork methods for audio watermarking, the proposed method does not require knowledge of which segments of the watermarked audio signal contain watermarks and is more robust to conventional attacks.", "paper_title": "Robust patchwork-based watermarking method for stereo audio signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000339891300017"}
