The compiler structure is designed to support autotuning, which employs empirical techniques to evaluate a set of alternative mappings of computation kernels and select the mapping that obtains the best performance. This article introduces a Transformation Strategy Generator, a meta-optimizer that generates a set of transformation recipes, which are descriptions of the mapping of the sequential code to parallel CUDA code. These recipes comprise a search space of possible implementations. This system achieves performance comparable and sometimes better than manually tuned libraries and exceeds the performance of a state-of-the-art GPU compiler.", "paper_title": "A Script-Based Autotuning Compiler System to Generate High-Performance CUDA Code", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800008"}
