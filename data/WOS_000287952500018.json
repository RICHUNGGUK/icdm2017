GIS software was used to register geographic coordinates of detected points, and to develop a specific database in which information useful for the positioning phase are stored. The final product is a digital map accessible via mobile or desktop systems that represents the \"virtual vineyard\". In this digital representation, each grapevine plant marked by RFID can be selected, viewed and edited. Free-to-use software was implemented for use by consumers. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
