In particular, it is very hard to construct the quantum MDS codes with relatively large minimum distance. So far, except for some sparse lengths, all known q-ary quantum MDS codes have minimum distance <= q/2 + 1. In this paper, we provide a construction of the quantum MDS codes with minimum distance >q/2 + 1. In particular, we show the existence of the q-ary quantum MDS codes with length n = q(2) + 1 and minimum distance d for any d <= q + 1 (this result extends those given in [10], [12], and [13]); and with length (q(2) + 2)/3 and minimum distance d for any d <= (2q + 2)/3 if 3 vertical bar(q + 1). Our method is through Hermitian self-orthogonal codes. The main idea of constructing the Hermitian self-orthogonal codes is based on the solvability in F-q of a system of homogenous equations over F-q2.", "paper_title": "A Construction of New Quantum MDS Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900033"}
