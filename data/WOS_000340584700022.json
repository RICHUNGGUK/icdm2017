Given a globally exponentially stable neural network, and in the presence of noise, we quantify how much noise intensity that the delayed neural network can remain to be globally exponentially stable. We characterize the upper bounds of the noise intensity for the delayed NNs to sustain globally exponential stability. The upper bounds of parameter uncertainty intensity are characterized by using transcendental equation. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the theoretical result.", "paper_title": "Robustness of globally exponential stability of delayed neural networks in the presence of random disturbances", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700022"}
