This BDJ photodetector directly gave the chromatic coordinates of a LED that was approximated as a monochromatic stimulus due to its narrow spectrum compared with the CIE color-matching functions. Maximal simulated and experimental errors Delta u'v' to the target white point of the white balanced RGB LEDs was 0.0154 and 0.0214. The BDJ photodetector also performed to be sensitive to the spectrum variation characterized by CCT, and was preferable as a sensor for monitoring the white point. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
