Several recent studies have looked at analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals through the use of wavelets and neural networks. While showing great promise, the final outcomes of these studies have been largely inconclusive. This is mostly due to inherent difficulty of the problem, but also - perhaps - due to inefficient use of the available information, as many of these studies have used a single EEG channel for the analysis. In this contribution, we describe an ensemble of classifiers based data fusion approach to combine information from two or more sources, believed to contain complementary information, for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Our emphasis is on sequentially generating an ensemble of classifiers that explicitly seek the most discriminating information from each data source. Specifically, we use the event related potentials recorded from the Pz, Cz, and Fz electrodes of the EEG, decomposed into different frequency bands using multiresolution wavelet analysis. The proposed data fusion approach includes generating multiple classifiers trained with strategically selected subsets of the training data from each source, which are then combined through a modified weighted majority voting procedure. The implementation details and the promising outcomes of this implementation are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
