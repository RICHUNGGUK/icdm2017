B-splines are used to specify the three components of the model. It can deal with interval censored data and multiple covariates. After a simulation study, the relation between age, the number of years of full-time education and the net income (provided as intervals) available per person in Belgian households is studied from survey data.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric additive location-scale models for interval censored data", "paper_id": "WOS:000313731400006"}
