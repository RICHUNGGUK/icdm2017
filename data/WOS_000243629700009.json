The classification problem becomes extremely difficult when the system needs to process millions of packets per second, matching them against a filter database with tens of thousands of rules. Dynamic updates to the filter database and scalability to IPv6 with 128-bit addresses pose great challenges to the classification methods. We adopt the two-stage classification approach of Baboescu et al. [F. Baboescu, S. Singh, G. Varghese, Packet classification for core routers: is there an alternative to CAMs?, IEEE INFOCOM 2003.] The first stage determines the best matching source and destination prefix pair, and the second stage determines the highest priority matching filter by comparing the remaining fields against a short list of candidate rules in parallel. The first stage 2-D search problem is reduced to a pseudo 1-D problem by a process called filter decomposition. The decomposed filters are organized as a height-balanced search tree. The search operation is speeded up by parallel processing techniques to achieve a throughput of one packet per memory cycle. Our method is scalable to large filter databases and IPv6. It also allows incremental updates to the data structures. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
