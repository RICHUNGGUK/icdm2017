They shall have the ability to recognize and locate graphical symbols in a single step. In this paper, we present a set of measures to evaluate the performance of a symbol spotting system in terms of recognition abilities, location accuracy and scalability. We show that the proposed measures allow to determine the weaknesses and strengths of different methods. In particular we have tested a symbol spotting method based on a set of four different off-the-shelf shape descriptors.", "paper_title": "A performance evaluation protocol for symbol spotting systems in terms of recognition and location indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000267106200002"}
