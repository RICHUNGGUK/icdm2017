MVE is an end-to-end multi-view geometry reconstruction software which takes photos of a scene as input and produces a textured surface mesh as result. The system covers a structure-from-motion algorithm, multi-view stereo reconstruction, generation of extremely dense point clouds, reconstruction of surfaces from point clouds, and surface texturing. In contrast to most image-based geometry reconstruction approaches, our system is focused on reconstruction of multi-scale scenes, an important aspect in many areas such as cultural heritage. It allows to reconstruct large datasets containing some detailed regions with much higher resolution than the rest of the scene. Our system provides a graphical user interface for visual inspection of the individual steps of the pipeline, i.e., the structure-from-motion result, multi-view stereo depth maps, and rendering of scenes and meshes.
