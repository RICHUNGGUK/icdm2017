In the past years, the research field of \"green\" and low power consumption networking infrastructures is of great importance for both service/network providers and equipment manufacturers. An emerging technology called Cloud computing can increase the utilization and efficiency of hardware equipment. The job scheduler is needed by a cloud datacenter to arrange resources for executing jobs. In this paper, we propose a scheduling algorithm for the cloud datacenter with a dynamic voltage frequency scaling technique. Our scheduling algorithm can efficiently increase resource utilization; hence, it can decrease the energy consumption for executing jobs. Experimental results show that our scheme can reduce more energy consumption than other schemes do. The performance of executing jobs is not sacrificed in our scheme. We provide a green energy-efficient scheduling algorithm using the DVFS technique for Cloud computing datacenters. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
