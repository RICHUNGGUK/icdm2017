Even ascertaining the number of contributors to the sample can be challenging. These uncertainties can dramatically reduce the statistical weight attached to evidentiary samples. A probabilistic mixture algorithm that takes into account not just the number and magnitude of the alleles at a locus, but also their frequency of occurrence allows the determination of likelihood ratios of different hypotheses concerning the number of contributors to a specific mixture. This probabilistic mixture algorithm can compute the probability of the alleles in a sample being present in a 2-person mixture, 3-person mixture, etc. The ratio of any two of these probabilities then constitutes a likelihood ratio pertaining to the number of contributors to such a mixture.", "paper_title": "Inferring the Number of Contributors to Mixed DNA Profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000296782200010"}
