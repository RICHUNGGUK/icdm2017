Optical label switching accomplishes packet switching using the optical-labels. It simplifies the design of switching devices in the optical domain and speeds up packet forwarding significantly. In this paper, we propose a novel design of optical switches, and present a performance analysis to show its in-depth behavior. The analysis results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed switching architecture.", "paper_title": "A Novel Optical Code-Based Label Switching Architecture for WDM Packet Switched Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000285732400015"}
