The particularity of the method is that it is based on a Variational Multiscale turbulence model, its main feature being that the numerical mechanisms which are used to deal with stability issues (convection and the inf-sup condition for incompressible flows) do also take care of the modeling of turbulence. Based on this turbulence model, we develop the expressions for the viscous and thermal dissipations, is an element of(num) and chi(num), which are later used for evaluating the constant of structure of the refraction index C-n(2) following the classical model developed by Tatarski. Numerical examples show the behavior of the proposed numerical scheme when applied to turbulent flow practical cases, which include a convective boundary layer, the flow inside a transfer optics room, and a telescope enclosure.
