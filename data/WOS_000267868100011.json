This paper investigates the effect of unequal injection rates in ASEP with a junction. It is a generalization of the work of Pronina and Kolomeisky [J. Stat. Mech. P07010 (2005)], in which only equal injection rates are considered. It is shown that the unequal rates give rise to new phases and the phase diagram structure is qualitatively changed. The phase diagram and the density profiles are investigated by using Monte Carlo simulations, meanfield approximation and domain wall approach. The analytical results are in good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.", "paper_title": "ASYMMETRIC EXCLUSION PROCESSES ON LATTICES WITH A JUNCTION: THE EFFECT OF UNEQUAL INJECTION RATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000267868100011"}
