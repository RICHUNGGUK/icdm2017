In this paper, we consider the relation between the Wiener index of a graph G and its line graph L(G). We show that if G is of minimum degree at least two, then W(G) <= W (L(G)). We prove that for every non-negative integer go, there exists g > g(0), such that there are infinitely many graphs G of girth g, satisfying W(G) = W(L(G)). This partially answers a question raised by Dobrynin and Mel'nikov [10] and encourages us to conjecture that the answer to a stronger form of their question is affirmative.", "paper_title": "On Wiener Index of Graphs and Their Line Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000284555400010"}
