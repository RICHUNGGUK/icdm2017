However, the basic question of how well the company is equipped with the necessary practices, methodologies, people, and beliefs, is far from being completely answered yet. In this paper, a metrics-based diagnosis tool for measuring and enhancing the innovation capabilities in SMEs is presented along with a set of preliminary results from case-based studies at the local industry. In this paper we propose a new method by studying the competences of SMEs in concepts tied to innovation and by using a specified framework. As a first step, all of the necessary information by using questionnaires with verbal-scales evaluations is compiled. Second, we use a non-compensatory flow-based sorting method with central profiles to identify the current level and to classify the company into predefined levels. Third, a detailed analysis of the obtained values is performed in order to make a personalized recommendation.", "paper_title": "A Metrics-based Diagnosis Tool for Enhancing Innovation Capabilities in SMEs", "paper_id": "WOS:000283908700035"}
