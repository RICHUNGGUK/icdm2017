If g = o(V(1/3)), this represents an improvement over previous results by Thomassen, and Erickson and Har-Peled. We also give algorithms to find a shortest non-contractible cycle in O(g(O(g))V(3/2)) time, which improves previous results for fixed genus. This result can be applied for computing the face-width and the non-separating face-width of embedded graphs. Using similar ideas we provide the first near-linear running time algorithm for computing the face-width of a graph embedded on the projective plane, and an algorithm to find the face-width of embedded toroidal graphs in O(V(5/4) log V) time.", "paper_title": "Finding shortest non-separating and non-contractible cycles for topologically embedded graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000244453300006"}
