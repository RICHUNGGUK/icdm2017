This gives an answer to Compton's request in Question 8.3 [Compton 1987] for an \"easily verifiable sufficient condition\" to show that an adequate class of structures has a labelled first-order 0-1 law, namely it suffices to show that the labelled component count function is O(n(theta n)) for some theta is an element of (0, 1). It also provides the means to recursively construct an adequate class of structures with a labelled 0-1 law but not an unlabelled 0-1 law, answering Compton's Question 8.4.", "paper_title": "Sufficient conditions for labelled 0-1 laws", "paper_id": "WOS:000254618600004"}
