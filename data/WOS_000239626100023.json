Multi-agent systems combined with Semantic Web are promising approach for solving the challenging problems. In this paper, a semantic Web enabled multi-agent platform for logistic VO supporting is presented. The issue of extending OWL with multi-attribute constraints for VO modeling is addressed. A constraint rule language SWOCRL is proposed which is based on OWL and SWRL with constraint extension and class-scoped restriction. Important VO concepts such as organizations, activities, resources, contracts, interactions and their logistic specializations are described with OWL plus SWOCRL.", "paper_title": "Ontological modeling of virtual organization agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000239626100023"}
