However, a better system performance, e. g., in terms of a lower overall frame loss ratio (FLR), can be achieved if BER and FDR are jointly optimized. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer optimization scheme called traffic-adaptive scheme for multicode CDMA operating over a time division multiple access (TDMA) channel. Based on the traffic condition and buffer status, this scheme employs a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to determine the optimal value of the maximum number of simultaneous data frames that can be transmitted in each time slot of a TDMA frame so as to minimize the overall FLR of the system. To facilitate implementation, we also propose an approximation scheme named the rate-adaptive scheme to reduce the computation cost. Simulation and analytical results show that both the traffic-adaptive scheme and rate-adaptive scheme can significantly reduce FLR, increase the system throughput, and optimize the packet access delay of the system. Furthermore, the rate-adaptive scheme can achieve a performance close to the traffic-adaptive scheme when the traffic load in the system is high.", "paper_title": "Cross-Layer Optimization for Multimedia Transport over Multicode CDMA Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289625700005"}
