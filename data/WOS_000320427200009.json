The calculations are carried out for the gas rarefaction ranging from the free-molecular to the hydrodynamic regime and for the reservoir pressure ratios leading to the subsonic or supersonic flow behind a slit. The structure of the flow field, given by both numerical approaches, as a function of the pressure ratio and the rarefaction parameter is examined. The mass flow rate and the distributions of density, bulk velocity and temperature along the symmetry axis are reported. An applicability of the S-model kinetic equation via comparison with the Boltzmann equation is discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
