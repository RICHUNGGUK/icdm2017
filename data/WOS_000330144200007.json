The newly developed Kinetic Iron Model (KIM) determines the surface rate constant (k) and sorption parameters (C-max & J) which were not possible to uniquely identify previously. The code was written in Visual Basic (VBA), within Microsoft Excel, was adapted from earlier command line FORTRAN codes, BEARPE and KIMPE. The program is organized with several user interface screens (UserForms) that guide the user step by step through the analysis. BEARKIMPE-2 uses a non-linear optimization algorithm to calculate transport and chemical kinetic parameters. Both reactive and non-reactive sites are considered. A demonstration of the functionality of BEARKIMPE-2, with three nitroaromatic compounds showed that the differences in reaction rates for these compounds could be attributed to differences in their sorption behavior rather than their propensities to accept electrons in the reduction process.
