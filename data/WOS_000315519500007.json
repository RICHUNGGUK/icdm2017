The data warehouse, composed of data tables extracted from Web documents, has been built to supplement existing local data sources. First, we present the main steps of our semiautomatic method to annotate data tables driven by an OTR. The output of this method is an XML/RDF data warehouse composed of XML documents representing data tables with their fuzzy RDF annotations. We then present our flexible querying system which allows the local data sources and the data warehouse to be simultaneously and uniformly queried, using the OTR. This system relies on SPARQL and allows approximate answers to be retrieved by comparing preferences expressed as fuzzy sets with fuzzy RDF annotations.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Web Data Tables Integration Guided by an Ontological and Terminological Resource", "paper_id": "WOS:000315519500007"}
