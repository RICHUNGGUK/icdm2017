To elaborate the model behavior more, we have used different fuzzy norms led to a new pair of fuzzy norms. An important practical case in fuzzy relational equations (FREs) is the identification problem which is studied in this work. In this work we employ a neuro-based approach to numerically solve the set of FREs and focus on generalized neurons that use smooth s-norms and t-norms as fuzzy compositional operators.", "paper_title": "Numerical solution of fuzzy relational equations based on smooth fuzzy norms", "paper_id": "WOS:000273561300001"}
