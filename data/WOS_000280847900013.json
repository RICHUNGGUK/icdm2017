It has recently been discovered that this property is characterized by the existence of a (k + 1)-ary polymorphism satisfying certain identities; such polymorphisms are called k-edge operations and include Mal'cev and near-unanimity operations as special cases. We prove that if Gamma is any constraint language which, for some k > 1, has a k-edge operation as a polymorphism, then the constraint satisfaction problem for <Gamma > (the closure of Gamma under there exists Lambda-atomic expressibility) is globally tractable. We also show that the set of relations definable over G using quantified generalized formulas is polynomially exactly learnable using improper equivalence queries.", "paper_title": "TRACTABILITY AND LEARNABILITY ARISING FROM ALGEBRAS WITH FEW SUBPOWERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900013"}
