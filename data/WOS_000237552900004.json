We propose an efficient algorithm called Riemannian manifold learning (RML). A Riemannian manifold can be constructed in the form of a simplicial complex, and thus its intrinsic dimension can be reliably estimated. Then the NLDR problem is solved by constructing Riemannian normal coordinates (RNC). Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can learn the data's intrinsic geometric structure, yielding uniformly distributed and well organized low-dimensional embedding data.", "paper_title": "Riemannian manifold learning for nonlinear dimensionality reduction", "paper_id": "WOS:000237552900004"}
