Based on this representation, current programmable graphics hardware can perform the rendering with only minimal communication between the CPU and GPU. A consistent definition of conical frusta including texture parametrization and a continuous surface normal is provided. Rendering is performed by analytical ray casting of the relief-mapped frusta directly on the GPU. We demonstrate both static and animated objects rendered using our technique and compare to polygonal renderings of similar quality.", "paper_title": "GPU Rendering of Relief Mapped Conical Frusta", "paper_id": "WOS:000272569400010"}
