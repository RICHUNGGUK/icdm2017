A new type of servicization model in the cutting tool supply chain reveals that most research has focused on local optimization of operational issues such as tool monitoring, spare parts management, logistics, and scheduling problems in isolation. The innovation in technologies, such as radio frequency identification and web services, for information sharing provides the ability to plan and schedule the tool requirement cross different layers in the MRO supply chain. However, their impact on the, technology complexity and performance is uncertain. In order to provide evaluation approach at the design phase, this paper analyzes the service oriented process from two dimensions that evaluate technology complexity, and system performance. Implementation of these evaluation models helps organizations analyze the business processes and further improve them through the analysis.", "paper_title": "Evaluation models for service oriented process in spare parts management", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200043"}
