Until now, however, it was not clear whether this entanglement can be used as a resource in quantum information theory. Here we show that this entanglement is physical, demonstrating the principles of its extraction from a typical spin chain by scattering two particles of the system. Moreover, we show how to simulate this process using present-day optical lattice technology.", "paper_title": "Can entanglement be extracted from many body systems?", "paper_id": "WOS:000250862500017"}
