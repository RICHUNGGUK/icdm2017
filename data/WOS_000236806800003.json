By introducing probability into fuzzy approximation space, a theory about fuzzy probabilistic approximation spaces is proposed in this paper, which combines three types of uncertainty: probability, fuzziness, and roughness into a rough set model. We introduce Shannon's entropy to measure information quantity implied in a Pawlak's approximation space, and then present a novel representation of Shannon's entropy with a relation matrix. Based on the modified formulas, some generalizations of the entropy are proposed to calculate the information in a fuzzy approximation space and a fuzzy probabilistic approximation space, respectively. As a result, uniform representations of approximation spaces and their information measures are formed with this work.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy probabilistic approximation spaces and their information measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000236806800003"}
