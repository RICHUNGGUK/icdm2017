Recent advancements have made scalable wrapper-generation possible and enabled data acquisition processes involving thousands of sources. This makes wrapper analysis and maintenance both needed and challenging as no scalable tools exists that support these tasks. We demonstrate WADaR, a scalable arid highly automated tool for joint wrapper and data repair. WADaR uses off-the-shelf entity recognisers to locate target entities in wrapper-generated data. Markov chains are used to determine structural repairs, that are then encoded into suitable repairs for both the data and corresponding wrappers. We show that WADaR is able to increase the quality of wrapper-generated relations between 15% and 60%, and to fully repair the corresponding wrapper without any knowledge of the original website in more than 50% of the cases.", "paper_title": "WADaR: Joint Wrapper and Data Repair", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800085"}
