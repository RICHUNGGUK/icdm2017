This paper presents a method to acquire an optimal interval for computing course and ship speed based on approximate reasoning. The computed error derived from positioning inaccuracy decreases with increasing time interval, but increasing interval also makes the computed values inaccurate to the actual. The optimal interval is concluded theoretically, and the value is acquired using a statistical method. Experiments show the proposed method good results, the reasonable interval can be gained, and accuracy of Eotvos correction can be improved.", "paper_title": "An optimal interval for computing course and ship speed in marine gravity survey based on approximate reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400104"}
