The objective is to minimize the net present value of the earliness-tardiness penalty costs. The problem is first mathematically modeled. Then, two meta-heuristics, genetic algorithm and simulated annealing are proposed to solve this strongly NP-hard problem. Design of experiments and response surface methodology are employed to fine-tune the meta-heuristics' parameters. Finally, a comprehensive computational experiment is described, performed on a set of instances and the results are analyzed and discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
