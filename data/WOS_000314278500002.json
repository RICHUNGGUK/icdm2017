The method is based on a background model (or null hypothesis) for the image. This model relies on independence assumptions and characterizes images in which no detection should be made. It is often image dependent, relying on statistics gathered from the image, and therefore adaptive. In this paper we propose a generalization for background models which relaxes the independence assumption and instead uses image dependent second order properties. The second order properties are accounted for thanks to graphical models. The modified a contrario technique is applied to two tasks: line segment detection and part-based object detection, and its advantages are demonstrated. In particular, we show that the proposed method enables reasonably accurate prediction of the false detection rate with no need for training data.", "paper_title": "Beyond Independence: An Extension of the A Contrario Decision Procedure", "paper_id": "WOS:000314278500002"}
