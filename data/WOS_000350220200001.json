Then, it is proved that this algorithm always returns a solution. Also, the lower and upper bounds of the sum of the NDP lengths are derived. Finally, via execution of the algorithm, it is shown that on the average the sum of lengths of NDP given by the algorithm is only similar to 10% more than the sum of the shortest paths lengths.", "paper_title": "One-to-Many Node-Disjoint Paths Routing in Dense Gaussian Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000350220200001"}
