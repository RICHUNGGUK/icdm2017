We also show that there is a unique smallest astral (18(3)) triangle-free configuration and its Levi graph is the generalized Petersen graph G(18,5). In addition, we present geometric realizations of the unique flag transitive triangle-free configuration (20(3)) and the unique point transitive triangle-free configuration (21(3)).", "paper_title": "Small triangle-free configurations of points and lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000235248300004"}
