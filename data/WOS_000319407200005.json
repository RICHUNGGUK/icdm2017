Instead of simulation, this framework is based on models of NSSs and is constructed using a stochastic process algebra, named Performance Evaluation Process Algebra (PEPA). It captures the traffic and mobility characteristics of mobile nodes in 3G-WLAN interworking networks and has a good expression of the behavior of the mobile nodes using different NSSs. Commonly used NSSs are evaluated from the perspectives of average throughput, handover rate, and network blocking probability. Results of the evaluation explore the effect of these NSSs on both mobile nodes and networks, as well as their characteristics in different mobility and traffic scenarios.", "paper_title": "A General Performance Evaluation Framework for Network Selection Strategies in 3G-WLAN Interworking Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000319407200005"}
