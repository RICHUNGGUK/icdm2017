A greedy algorithm for the problem has been shown to have an approximation ratio of 4, but this analysis was not shown to be tight. In this paper, we use the technique of factor-revealing linear programs to show that the greedy algorithm actually achieves an approximation ratio of 2, which is tight.", "paper_title": "An Improved Analysis for a Greedy Remote-Clique Algorithm Using Factor-Revealing LPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000266337100004"}
