The researchers had presented different methods to clone a card in a practical card-only scenario. Among them, they recover the second or subsequent sector key by trying to accurately estimate the time information between two consecutive authentication attempts in a nested authentication. In this paper, we study the security of the MIFARE Classic in another practical scenario, where the adversary only communicates with a legitimate reader. The worst scenario to recover the second or subsequent sector key in a nested authentication only requires about 8 authentication attempts to the legitimate reader on average and the off-line search in about 328 s on Garcia's ordinary computer without estimating the time information between two consecutive authentications. Following this result, it is possible for the attackers to simulate or forge a legal card to authenticate successfully with a legitimate reader. To avoid this weakness, the reader must verify some information on the legal card at the beginning and it requires to be protected in some sense. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
