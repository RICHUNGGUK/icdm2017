In this work, we study the performance of the joint processing multiple antenna multi-point cooperation using the maximum ratio transmission (MRT) technique. A closed form expression of the outage probability is derived for Rayleigh flat fading channel model considering path-loss and constant shadowing. Analytical and simulation results are compared.", "paper_title": "Analytical Joint Processing Multi-Point Cooperation Performance in Rayleigh Fading", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696200003"}
