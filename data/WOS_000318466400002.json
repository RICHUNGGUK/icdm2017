Although SIFT descriptors accurately extract invariant image characteristics around keypoints, the commonly used matching approaches of registration loosely represent the geometric information among descriptors. In this paper, we propose an image registration algorithm named BP-SIFT, where we formulate keypoint matching of SIFT descriptors as a global optimization problem and provide a suboptimum solution using belief propagation (BP). Experimental results show significant improvement over conventional SIFT-based matching with reasonable computation complexity. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
