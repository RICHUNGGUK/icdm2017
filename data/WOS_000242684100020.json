The features used are based on the standard features used by forensic document examiners. The process of feature extraction is presented along with the results. Analysis of the usefulness of features was conducted via searching the optimal feature sets using the wrapper method. A neural network was used as a classifier and a genetic algorithm was used to search for optimal feature sets. It is shown that most of the structural micro features studied, do possess discriminative power, which justifies their use in forensic analysis of handwriting. The results also show that the grapheme possessed significantly higher discriminating power than any of the three single characters studied, which supports the opinion that a character form is affected by its adjacent characters.
