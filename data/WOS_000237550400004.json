The classic way to identify flows, i.e. looking at port numbers, is not effective anymore. On the other hand, state-of-the-art techniques cannot determine the application before the end of the TCP flow. In this editorial, we propose a technique that relies on the observation of the first five packets of a TCP connection to identify the application. This result opens a range of new possibilities for online traffic classification.", "paper_title": "Traffic classification on the fly", "paper_id": "WOS:000237550400004"}
