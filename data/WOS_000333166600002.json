From nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we deduce that an optical signal with quadratic phase will have better nonlinear suppression ability than other phase pre-compensation methods. In our pre-compensation method, before being launched into fiber, each transmitted wavelength is modulated by a phase modulator, which is driven by a periodic parabolic electric driving signal. Thus, each channel will have a quadratic phase. Both of the simulations and experimental results show that the fiber Kerr nonlinearity can be reduced effectively and the BER can be improved by two orders of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Fiber nonlinearity suppression in fiber-optic transmission systems using an optical quadratic phase pre-compensation method", "paper_id": "WOS:000333166600002"}
