In 1990, Mirollo and Strogatz proposed a pulse-coupled oscillator model to explain the synchronization of South East Asian fireflies (Pteroptyx malaccae). However, transmission delays were not considered in their model. In fact, when transmission delays are introduced, the dynamic behaviors of pulse-coupled networks change a lot. In this paper, pulse-coupled oscillator networks with delayed excitatory coupling are studied. A concept of synchronization, named weak asymptotic synchronization, which is weaker than asymptotic synchronization, is proposed. We prove that for pulse-coupled oscillator networks with delayed excitatory coupling, weak asymptotic synchronization cannot occur.", "paper_title": "IMPOSSIBILITY OF ASYMPTOTIC SYNCHRONIZATION FOR PULSE-COUPLED OSCILLATORS WITH DELAYED EXCITATORY COUPLING", "paper_id": "WOS:000273174000003"}
