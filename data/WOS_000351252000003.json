Even in unsaturated conditions, longer queues indicate longer travel delays and higher fuel consumption. With the exception of some expensive surveillance equipment, the queue length itself cannot be measured automatically, and manual measurement is both impractical and costly in a long term scenario. Hence, many mathematical models that express the queue length as a function of detector measurements are used in engineering practice, ranging from simple to elaborate ones. The method proposed in this paper makes use of detector time-occupancy, a complementary quantity to vehicle count, provided by most of the traffic detectors at no cost and disregarded by majority of existing approaches for various reasons. Our model is designed as a complement to existing methods. It is based on Gaussian-process model of the occupancy-queue relationship, it can handle data uncertainties, and it provides more information about the quality of the queue length prediction.", "paper_title": "MODELLING OCCUPANCY-QUEUE RELATION USING GAUSSIAN PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000351252000003"}
