Its central component is a graphical editor, which supports geometric modelling of architectural ground plans through polygon meshes. Multiple levels and their interconnections, such as ramps and staircases, can be represented through the aid of layers. In order to support a full range of activities, from travelling to interacting with pervasive user interfaces, coarse models on an outdoor scale can be hierarchically refined by submodels on building and room scales. The XML-encoded models can be useful for positioning systems, referencing spatial context and for route finding through multi-story buildings. Besides the editor, the toolkit provides a routing module for pedestrian navigation.", "paper_title": "Taking location modelling to new levels: A map modelling toolkit for intelligent environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000237667100006"}
