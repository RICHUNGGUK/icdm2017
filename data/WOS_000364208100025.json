This paper proposes a whitespace-aware TSV arrangement algorithm in 3-D CTS, which mainly consists of three stages: sink preclustering, whitespace-aware 3-D method of means and medians (3-D-MMMs) topology generation, and deferred-merge embedding merging segment reconstruction. By leveraging the TSV-to-TSV coupling model, we also propose an efficient clock TSV arrangement method to alleviate the coupling effect of adjacent TSVs. Compared with the traditional 3-D-MMM-based CTS with TSV moving adjustment, the experimental results show that our proposed algorithm is more practical and efficient, achieving 49.2% reduction on the average skew and 1.9% reduction on the average power.", "paper_title": "Whitespace-Aware TSV Arrangement in 3-D Clock Tree Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100025"}
