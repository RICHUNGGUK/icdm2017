In particular, key management in MANET is a problem for which many solutions have been proposed in literature. Unfortunately, these solutions are rather limited in terms of security and availability of keys. In this paper, we propose a secure, robust, and fully distributed scheme for public-key certificate management in MANET. Our scheme, based on threshold cryptography, ensures that the private key of the certificate authority will not be revealed to an adversary, even if the number of compromised shareholders exceeds the threshold of vulnerability, thereby thwarting mobile-adversary attacks. We describe SRKM in detail and, by using security analysis and simulations, show its effectiveness, robustness and security.
