This paper aims to solve the problem of output feedback tracking control for a class of non-linear uncertain systems subject to unmodelled high-frequency gains and time delay in the input. By additive state decomposition, the uncertain system is transformed to an uncertainty-free system, in which the uncertainties, disturbances and effects of unmodelled dynamics along with time delay are lumped into a new disturbance at the output. Subsequently, additive state decomposition is used to decompose the transformed system to simplify the tracking controller design. The proposed control scheme is applied to three benchmark examples to demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Output feedback tracking control by additive state decomposition for a class of uncertain systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337363900001"}
