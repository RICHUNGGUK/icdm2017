In this study, to investigate this mechanochemical relationship, we present a mathematical model describing motions of actin filament and remodeling of the filaments in shear flows. We perform simulations of the dynamics of actin filaments remodeled by polymerization, depolymerization, and severing, and investigate contributions of these remodeling processes to effective shear viscosities of the system.
