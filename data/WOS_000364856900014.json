Previous solutions either require modifications of current ZigBee protocols or Wi-Fi re-configurations, which is not feasible in large-scale wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present WizBee, a coexistence system using single-antenna sink without changing current Wi-Fi and ZigBee design. WizBee is based on an observation that Wi-Fi signal is about 5 to 20 dB stronger than ZigBee signal in symmetric area, which leaves much room for applying interference cancelation technique to mitigate Wi-Fi interference, and extract ZigBee signals. However, we need to cancel the Wi-Fi interference perfectly for residual ZigBee signal decoding, which needs more accurate channel coefficient across data transmissions in spite of cross technology interference. For robust and accurate Wi-Fi decoding, we use soft Viterbi decoding with weighted confidence value over interfered subcarriers. Consequently, our solution uses decoded data for channel coefficient estimation instead of conventional training symbol based methods. The key insight is that, the signal recovery opportunity for cross technology coexistence, lies in multi-domain information, such as power, frequency and coding discrepancies. Using these information properly will improve the coexistence network throughput effectively. We implemented WizBee in USRP/GNURadio software radio platform, and studied the decoding performance of interference cancelation technique. Our extensive evaluations under real wireless conditions show that WizBee improves ZigBee throughput up to 1.9x, with median throughput gain of 1.2x.", "paper_title": "WizBee: Wise ZigBee Coexistence via Interference Cancellation with Single Antenna", "paper_id": "WOS:000364856900014"}
