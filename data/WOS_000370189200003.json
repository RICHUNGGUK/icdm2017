Sensor nodes are distributed randomly around the region of interest (ROI) and searched for independently. When nodes are found, an unbreakable group is formed under repulsion, attraction and speed consistency control, then searching is begun cooperatively. When some node finds a ROI, it guides the other nodes in the group following it to the ROI. While in the ROI, nodes choose the most important position within the sensing range, then move toward it independently while avoiding collision, eventually, reaching the most important area of the ROI. Under the premise of satisfying key area coverage, sensor nodes are adjusted based on the degree of coverage, maximizing coverage. Simulation results show that the proposed method quickly improves the coverage rate and achieves priority coverage of key areas strongly robustly without being adversely affected by sudden damage to nodes. Applications include coverage with limited amounts of nodes in unknown environments.", "paper_title": "Distributed Cooperation Based Priority Coverage Control Strategy for Mobile Sensors", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200003"}
