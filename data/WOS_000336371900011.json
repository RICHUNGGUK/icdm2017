Some design methods for synthesizing the winner-take-all behavior based on the memristive neural network are developed by using the obtained results. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the validity and characteristics of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Analysis and design of winner-take-all behavior based on a novel memristive neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000336371900011"}
