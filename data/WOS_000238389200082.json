CSPs can be solved with complete methods or incomplete methods. Although some frameworks has been designed to formalized constraint propagation, there are only few studies of theoretical frameworks for local search. In this paper, we are concerned with the design of a generic framework to model local search as the computation of a fixed point of functions and to solve the Sudoku problem. This work allows one to simulate standard strategies used for local search, and to design easily new strategies in a uniform framework.", "paper_title": "A generic framework for local search: Application to the Sudoku problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200082"}
