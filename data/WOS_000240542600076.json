However, in order to enable true reactive environments, context information has to be adequately collected, filtered, and processed and combined with user, device and other profiles. In this article, we present how an XML-based transcoding system can be applied for advanced profile processing and evolution. We demonstrate how to encode domain knowledge into sets of rules, which perform adaptations of user, device and context profiles for smart environments.", "paper_title": "Profile processing and evolution for smart environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600076"}
