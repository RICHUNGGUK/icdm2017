This study proposes an OWL-based language, called OWL-L to make Web resources links computer-interpretable. Two aspects of OWL-L, link profile and link model are described. The link profile provides the information required for an agent to discover a link, while the link model provides information that enables an agent to exploit a link. Finally, this study describes the feasibility of using role/arcRole properties of links to represent OWL-based ontologies, which can thus seamlessly interoperate and integrate with OWL-L to enhance knowledge representation.
