First, the MIMO Gaussian wiretap channel is revisited. A matrix characterization of the capacity-equivocation region is provided, which extends the previous result on the secrecy capacity to the more general imperfect secrecy setting. Next, the MIMO Gaussian broadcast channel with two receivers and three independent messages: a common message intended for both receivers, and two confidential messages each intended for one of the receivers but needing to be kept asymptotically perfectly secret from the other, is considered. A precise characterization of the capacity region is provided, generalizing the previous results which considered only two out of three possible messages.", "paper_title": "New Results on Multiple-Input Multiple-Output Broadcast Channels With Confidential Messages", "paper_id": "WOS:000315120400009"}
