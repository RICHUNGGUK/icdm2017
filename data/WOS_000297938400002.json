In this paper, program slicing is introduced to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of cluster test selection techniques. A static slice is computed on the modified code. The execution profile of each test case is filtered by the program slice to highlight the parts of software affected by modification, called slice filtering. The slice filtering reduces the data dimensions for cluster analysis, such that the cost of cluster test selection is saved dramatically. The experiment results show that the slice filtering techniques could reduce the cost of cluster test selection significantly and could also improve the effectiveness of cluster test selection modestly. Therefore, cluster test selection by filtering has more potential scalability to deal with large software.", "paper_title": "USING PROGRAM SLICING TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF CLUSTER TEST SELECTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000297938400002"}
