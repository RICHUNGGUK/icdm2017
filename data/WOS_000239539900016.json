Design/methodology/approach - The transmission line model is compared with pi lumped circuit models by varying the number of cells. The influence of losses is also introduced, and some constraints regarding the models are examined, showing the suitability of the new Spice libraries developed by the authors. In order to validate the theoretical results some experiments were carried out. Findings - The paper finds that Spice is a powerful engineering tool for students and technicians involved in EMC analyses. Originality/value - The main aspects concerning the accuracy and integrity of the experimental data are emphasized and discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Application of Spice simulator in the evaluation of crosstalk computational models", "paper_id": "WOS:000239539900016"}
