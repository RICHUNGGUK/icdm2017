It presents a general frame work and a specification language FCTL for specifying properties in such systems. Various important security properties such as simple safety, liveness, role containment can all be elegantly specified in this logic. It presents upper and lower bounds for checking classes of formulas specified in this logic for dynamic systems specified in the RT(0) Role based Trust Management System. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
