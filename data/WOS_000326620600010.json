This application domain is characterized by large amounts of data and relatively simple data models, making it a natural challenge for logic-based knowledge representation and reasoning techniques. Considering relational database (RDB) technology as a yardstick, we show that careful engineering of OBDA can achieve RDB-like scalability even in demanding applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the potential of OBDA in a typical business-size application.", "paper_title": "Ontology-based data access: An application to intermodal logistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000326620600010"}
