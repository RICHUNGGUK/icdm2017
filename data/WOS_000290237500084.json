The aim of this paper is to compare the CRM performances of e-commerce firms using a multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) approach. Analytical network process (ANP) is a MCDM methodology which can take the inner and outer dependencies among multiple criteria into consideration. As there are dependencies among CRM performance evaluation criteria, ANP is used for comparing the CRM performances of the e-commerce firms under consideration. A sensitivity analysis also provided in order to monitor the robustness of the proposed ANP framework to changes in the weights of evaluation criteria. To the authors' knowledge, this will be the first study which evaluates CRM performance using ANP. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
