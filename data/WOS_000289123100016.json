The method involves the reconstruction of a polymer distribution related to the conditional equilibrium of a microscopic Monte Carlo simulation, conditioned upon the desired macroscopic state. We describe the procedure in detail, give numerical results for several strategies to define the set of macroscopic state variables, and show that the resulting closures are related to those obtained by a so-called quasi-equilibrium approximation [20].
