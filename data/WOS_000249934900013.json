One of the essential tasks in digital library is the digitization of arts together with the corresponding textural descriptions. Although there are some standard interleaving algorithms for hiding the relating textural description into an image or video, the textural information is still prone to be accessed and extracted by hackers. Most of the traditional data hiding schemes focus on the recovery of covert information. The common shortcoming is that the original image will be distorted due to the processing of bit-substitution, quantization and truncation. In this paper, three novel data hiding methods are proposed. The first two methods are implemented based on pair-wise logical computation (PWLC) and pixel decomposition by treating R, G B bands and the intensity component as spatial domains and the third method is implemented by considering and utilizing the phase difference information in the hue and saturation components in the HSI color system. All of the three methods can achieve the goals of complete recovering of covert information and lossless reconstruction of original image simultaneously. In addition, it also obtains high data hiding capacity and good visual quality. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and validity of our proposed method in the data hiding of color images.", "paper_title": "Lossless data hiding of color images using pixel decomposition and phase difference", "paper_id": "WOS:000249934900013"}
