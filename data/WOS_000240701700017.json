This proves particularly useful for facilitating lead optimization projects. This study aimed to compare CoMSIA models produced using different subsets of the CoMSIA molecular fields (steric, electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen-bond donor, and hydrogen-bond acceptor) in a systematic and statistically valid manner. A total of 23 data sets sourced from the literature were used to compare molecular field contribution and model predictivity using leave-one-out cross-validated R-2 values. Predictive ability varied in a highly statistically significant manner depending on the set of CoMSIA molecular fields used. In general, the greater the number of CoMSIA molecular fields included in the analysis, the better the model predictivity was. There is great redundancy in the information contained in the different CoMSIA molecular fields. When all five CoMSIA molecular fields are included, the hydrophobic and electrostatic fields had the largest and the steric field the smallest contribution. Data sets were clustered into four groups on the basis of the utility of molecular field sets to generate predictive models.", "paper_title": "Systematic statistical comparison of comparative molecular similarity indices analysis molecular fields for computer-aided lead optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240701700017"}
