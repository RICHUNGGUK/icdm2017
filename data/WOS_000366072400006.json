While MTS uses conservativity as a major filter on GQs as serving NL-realisable determiners' meanings, conservativity fails in serving as such a filter. According to the PTS rendering of conservativity, all determiners are conservative. Instead of conservativity, PTS methodology focuses on other criteria, originating from the inferential role of determiners as captured by the introduction and elimination rules of a meaning-conferring ND-system. The criteria considered in the paper are harmony, stability and purity of rules. The paper presents two examples of conservative \"determiners\" that can be excluded by the suggested criteria.
