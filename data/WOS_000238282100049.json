Adaptive natural gradient decent algorithm attains fast convergence speed and reliability. We focus on applying cost function BSS and SVD to achieve the solution of decomposition signals. The results indicate that the SVD combining minimizing mutual information can predict the extent of mixed signal and searching direction. The simulation illustrates that the method improves the performance, convergence and reliability. The different results can be attained by distinctive nonlinear function. The algorithm of adaptive changing de-mixed function is a better way to break through the limitation of nonlinear BSS.", "paper_title": "Novel nonlinear signals separation of optimized entropy based on adaptive natural gradient learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100049"}
