The proposed operator combines the advantages of the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator and the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IFOWA) operator. We then study its properties, compare it with the intuitionistic fuzzy hybrid averaging (IFHA) operator, and use it to solve multi-attribute group decision making problem with intuitionistic fuzzy information.", "paper_title": "An intuitionistic fuzzy weighted OWA operator and its application", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204400014"}
