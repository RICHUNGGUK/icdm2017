We propose a generalization of Schnyder woods to graphs embedded on the torus with application to graph drawing. We prove several properties on this new object. Among all we prove that a graph embedded on the torus admits such a Schnyder wood if and only if it is an essentially 3-connected toroidal map. We show that these Schnyder woods can be used to embed the universal cover of an essentially 3-connected toroidal map on an infinite and periodic orthogonal surface. Finally we use this embedding to obtain a straight-line flat torus representation of any toroidal map in a polynomial size grid.", "paper_title": "Toroidal Maps: Schnyder Woods, Orthogonal Surfaces and Straight-Line Representations", "paper_id": "WOS:000329619100003"}
