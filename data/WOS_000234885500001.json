The Local Search problem consists in finding a local minimum of the function f on G, that is a vertex v such that f (v) is not larger than the value of f on the neighbors of v in G. In this note, we first prove a separation theorem slightly stronger than the one of Gilbert, Hutchinson and Tarjan for graphs of constant genus. This result allows us to enhance a previously known deterministic algorithm for Local Search with query complexity O(log n) (.) d + O(root g) (.) root n, so that we obtain a deterministic query complexity of d + O(root g) (.) root n where it is the size of G, d is its maximum degree, and g is its genus. We also give a quantum version of our algorithm, whose query complexity is of O(root d) + O((4)root g) (.) (4)root n log log n. Our deterministic and quantum algorithms have query complexities respectively smaller than the algorithm Randomized Steepest Descent of Aldous and Quantum Steepest Descent of Aaronson for large classes of graphs, including graphs of bounded genus and planar graphs.
