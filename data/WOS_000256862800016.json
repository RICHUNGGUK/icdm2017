The proposed scheme includes three modules that are a motion direction estimator, a motion length estimator and a motion combination selector. In order to identify the motion directions, the proposed scheme is based on a trial restoration by using directional forward ramp motion blurs along different directions and an analysis of directional information via frequency domain by using a Radon transform. Autocorrelation functions of image derivatives along several directions are employed for estimation of the motion lengths. A proper motion combination is identified by analyzing local autocorrelation functions of non-flat component of trial restored results. Experimental examples of simulated and real world blurred images are given to demonstrate a promising performance of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Identification of piecewise linear uniform motion blur", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862800016"}
