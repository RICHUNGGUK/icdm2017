Thus, through switching off sectors in unnecessary directions in wireless networks, we can save bandwidth and energy consumption. In this paper, we will study a directional virtual backbone (VB) in the network where directional antennas are used. When constructing a VB, we will take routing and broadcasting into account since they are two common operations in wireless networks. Hence, we will study a VB with guaranteed routing costs, named alpha Minimum rOuting Cost Directional VB (alpha-MOC-DVB). Besides the properties of regular VBs, alpha-MOC-DVB also has a special constraint-for any pair of nodes, there exists at least one path all intermediate directions on which must belong to alpha-MOC-DVB and the number of intermediate directions on the path is smaller than alpha times that on the shortest path. We prove that construction of a minimum alpha-MOC-DVB is an NP-hard problem in a general directed graph. A heuristic algorithm is proposed and theoretical analysis is also discussed in the paper. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our alpha-MOC-DVB is much more efficient in the sense of VB size and routing costs compared to other VBs.", "paper_title": "Efficient Virtual Backbone Construction with Routing Cost Constraint in Wireless Networks Using Directional Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000304148900003"}
