The evaluation relies on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods; in particular, the authors conducted an analytical survey containing structured interviews with data publishers in order to give an account of the current ontology engineering practice in Linked Data provisioning, and compared and expanded our findings with statistics on ontology development and usage provided by the Billion Triple Challenges datasets from 2012 (using the vocab. cc platform) and from 2014 and other related tools. The findings of the evaluation allow data practitioners and ontologists to yield a better understanding of the conceptual part of the LOD Cloud; and form the basis for the definition of purposeful, empirically grounded guidelines and best practices for developing, managing and using ontologies in the new application scenarios that arise in the context of Linked Data.", "paper_title": "The Role of Ontology Engineering in Linked Data Publishing and Management: An Empirical Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000353246600003"}
