Safety-critical embedded programs don't escape this trend. In the context of safety-critical embedded systems, the development processes follow strict guidelines and requirements. The development quality assurance applies as much to the final embedded code, as to the tools themselves. The French company Esterel Technologies decided in 2006 to base its new SCADE SUITE 6 (TM) certifiable code generator on Objective Caml. This paper outlines how it has been challenging in the context of safety critical software development by the rigorous norms DO-178B, IEC 61508, EN 50128 and such.", "paper_title": "Experience Report: Using Objective Caml to Develop Safety-Critical Embedded Tools in a Certification Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000271211700023"}
