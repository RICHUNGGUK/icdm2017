The nonlinear circuit of the VCO is analyzed by a novel analytical approach of harmonic balance method as an autonomous circuit, and with fulfilling the stability condition of the network, the output specifications are determined. This proposed nonlinear approach for determining of the frequency and amplitude stability is also based on harmonic balance method. The results of the analysis are compared with those of measurements. The comparison shows good agreement between results of this analytical approach and the measurements.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear analysis, design, and implementation of a VCO in S frequency band", "paper_id": "WOS:000242343500015"}
