The resulting bootstrap procedure is shown to be asymptotically valid and can be used to approximate the distributions of t-statistics, the J-statistic for overidentifying restrictions, and Wald, Lagrange multiplier and distance statistics for nonlinear hypotheses. The asymptotic validity of the efficient bootstrap based on a computationally less demanding approximate k-step estimator is also shown. The finite sample performance of the proposed bootstrap is assessed using simulations in an intertemporal consumption based asset pricing model. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
