Nowadays, related work mainly focuses on syntax agreement and compatible matching to obtain Web services, in which long responding time and low recall for discovering Web services as well as low reliability of Web services composition are manifested. In this paper, an effective Service Discovery Model is proposed, in which profile matching, functional matching, nonfunctional matching and QoS matching are included and realized at three stages, namely publish matching stage, discovery matching stage and QoS matching stage. The availability of the Service Discovery Model and its advantages are testified by experiments.", "paper_title": "An effective service discovery model for highly reliable web services composition in a specific domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000090"}
