It allows the broadcaster to dynamically choose the receiver set during each encryption. However, most broadcast encryption schemes in the literature haven't taken into consideration the receiver's privacy protection, and the scanty privacy preserving solutions are often less efficient, which are not suitable for practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose an efficient dynamic anonymous broadcast encryption scheme that has the shortest ciphertext length. The scheme is constructed over the composite order bilinear groups, and adopts the Lagrange interpolation polynomial to hide the receivers' identities, which yields efficient decryption algorithm. Security proofs show that, the proposed scheme is both secure and anonymous under the threat of adaptive adversaries in standard model.", "paper_title": "Efficient Anonymous Broadcast Encryption with Adaptive Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399500024"}
