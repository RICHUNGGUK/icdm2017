The determination of the largest size of any matching family in Z(m)(n), where Z(m) is the ring of integers modulo m, is an interesting problem. In this paper, we show an upper bound of O((pq)(0.625n+0.125)) for the size of any matching family in Z(pq)(n), where p and q a are two distinct primes. Our bound is valid when n is a constant, p -> infinity, and p/q -> 1. Our result improves an upper bound of Dvir and coworkers.", "paper_title": "Upper Bounds on Matching Families in Z(pq)(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000321928500030"}
