Its basic structure is a suspended stripline comprising of three layers. On the top layer, 4 X 4 square slots are etched and act as radiation elements. The middle layer consists of a suspended stripline power divider, and the bottom layer is a metal ground. After optimization by a parallel Genetic Algorithm (GA) on a cluster system, a prototype antenna is fabricated and tested. The measured results agree well with the simulated data, and show a high gain of 18.7 dBi and an impedance bandwidth of 5.7% for S11<-10 dB are obtained. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
