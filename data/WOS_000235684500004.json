The proposed methodology for topological optimization first employs a fuzzy-goal programming scheme at the top level for multi-objective problems with static and dynamic objectives. For the static objective with multi-stiffness cases in the fuzzy-goal formulation, a hybrid approach, involving a hierarchical sequence approach or a hierarchical sequence approach coupled with a compromise programming method, is especially suggested for the statically loaded multi-stiffness structure at the sub-level. Concerning dynamic optimization problems of free vibration cases, nonstructural mass, oscillation of the objective function, and repeated eigenvalues are also discussed. Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization density-stiffness interpolation scheme is used to indicate the dependence of material modulus upon regularized element densities. The globally convergent version of the method of moving asymptotes and the sequential linear programming method are both employed as optimizers. Several applications have been applied to demonstrate the validation of the presented methodologies.", "paper_title": "A new hybrid fuzzy-goal programming scheme for multi-objective topological optimization of static and dynamic structures under multiple loading conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000235684500004"}
