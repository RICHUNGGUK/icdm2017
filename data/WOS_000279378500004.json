However the limited communication range is a bottleneck for its widespread use. This paper deals with a new frame structure of class 4 active RFID multi-hop relay system based on ISO/IEC 18000-7 standard integrating with IEEE 802.15.4a LR-UWB PHY layer specification, which sets up a connection to USN. As a result of the vital importance of the coverage and throughput in the application of USN, further we analyze the performance of the proposed system considered both impulse radio UWB (IR-UWB) and chirp spread spectrum (CSS). Our simulation results show that the coverage and throughput are remarkably increased.", "paper_title": "Class 4 Active RFID Multi-hop Relay System based on IEEE 802.15.4a Low-Rate UWB in Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378500004"}
