The algorithm is named the memetic multiobjective particle swarm optimization RBF network (MPSON) because it integrates the accuracy and structure of an RBF network. The proposed algorithm is implemented on two-class and multiclass pattern classification problems with one complex real problem. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is viable, and provides an effective means to design multiobjective RBF networks with good generalization capability and compact network structure. The accuracy and complexity of the network obtained by the proposed algorithm are compared with the memetic non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm based RBF network (MGAN) through statistical tests. This study shows that MPSON generates RBF networks coming with an appropriate balance between accuracy and simplicity, outperforming the other algorithms considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
