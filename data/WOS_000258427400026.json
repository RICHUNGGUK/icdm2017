This feature of mobile communication has been the major value-added service of the telecommunication operators. This paper proposes to program Chinese phonetic symbols into mobile phones for better and faster communication among the Chinese. The main idea is to employ a linear programming model, paying attention to the frequency order of phonetic symbols. The results of our experiments show that through linear programming, the mobile phone,has become more suitable for the real world.", "paper_title": "Placing Chinese phonetic symbols on mobile phones using linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000258427400026"}
