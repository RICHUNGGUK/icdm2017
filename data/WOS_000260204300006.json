We present heuristics that use an algorithm, based on proposed properties, which obtains an optimal schedule fora given job sequence. A new set of benchmark problems is presented with the purpose of evaluating the heuristics. Computational experiments show that the developed heuristics outperform results found in the literature for problems up to 500 jobs. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
