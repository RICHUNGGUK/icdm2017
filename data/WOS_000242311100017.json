Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) should not only hide the identity of legitimate users but also provide means by which evidence of malicious activity can be gathered. This paper proposes a forensic investigation technique, which can be embedded in the framework of existing PETs, thereby adding network forensic functionality to the PET. This approach introduces a new dimension to the implementation of Privacy Enhancing Technologies, which enhances their viability in the global network environment.", "paper_title": "PPINA - A forensic investigation protocol for Privacy Enhancing Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000242311100017"}
