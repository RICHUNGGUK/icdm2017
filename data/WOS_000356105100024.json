Each tracking agent is assumed only its own and neighbors' information is used in their tracking strategy design. The uncertain communication topology is modelled by a finite number of Laplacian matrices with their corresponding scheduling functions. Sufficient conditions for the existence of a tracking strategy have been expressed in terms of the solvability of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical examples are given to verify the effectiveness and advantages of proposed tracking strategy. Through a set of simulations with various control parameters gamma, the relationship between gamma and the maximum allowable communications delays is tabulated. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
