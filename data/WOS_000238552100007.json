Aside from their potential utility, we believe this effort is important because it focuses on three key problems that must be solved to achieve human-level AI: Robust reasoning and learning, interactivity, and longevity. We describe the ideas we are using to develop the first architecture for Companions: analogical processing, grounded in cognitive science for reasoning and learning, sketching and concept maps to improve interactivity, and a distributed agent architecture hosted on a cluster to achieve performance and longevity. We outline some results on learning by accumulating examples derived from our first experimental version.", "paper_title": "Companion Cognitive Systems - A step toward human-level AI", "paper_id": "WOS:000238552100007"}
