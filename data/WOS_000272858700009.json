To solve the resource sharing and data security problems in vehicle collaborative design environment, grid technology and Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) technology are integrated. This paper proposes a collaborative design system for vehicle crash safety design based on grid technology that is conformed to the OGSA framework, and explains how the grid middleware VEGA contributes to make collaboration more efficiently. Web services about the functions in this collaborative system are realized based on VEGA. Design principles and methods based on the FE analysis tool LS-DYNA are also presented. Finally, a test bed is built based on LAN and a case of a carmaker collaborating with a seat supplier is presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
