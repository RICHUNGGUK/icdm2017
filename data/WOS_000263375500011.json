The Golden Code is chosen as the inner code; the scheme is based on a set partitioning of the Golden Code using two-sided ideals whose norm is a power of two. In this case, a lower bound for the minimum determinant is given by the minimum Hamming distance. The description of the ring structure of the quotients suggests further optimization in order to improve the overall distribution of determinants. Simulation results show that the proposed schemes achieve a significant gain over the uncoded Golden Code.", "paper_title": "Golden Space-Time Block-Coded Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000263375500011"}
