They are generally connected in parallel with the equipment to be protected to divert the surge currents. The paper presents an approach to teaching high-voltage laboratory using specially designed exercises that can be done using MATLAB R2007. This paper presents a MATLAB-based technology to simulate residual voltage test, long duration withstand test, and operating duty test on arresters. Evaluation of the simulation with more than 30 students is very positive in terms of their developing confidence in and understanding of this simulation. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
