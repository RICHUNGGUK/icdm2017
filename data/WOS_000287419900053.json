Selecting the desired ontology from existing ontologies is essential for ontology reuse. Until now, much research on ontology selection has focused on lexical-level support. However, in these cases, it is almost impossible to find an ontology that includes all the concepts matched by the search terms at the semantic level. Finding an ontology that meets users' needs requires a new ontology selection and ranking mechanism based on semantic similarity matching. We propose an ontology selection and ranking model consisting of selection standards and metrics based on better semantic matching capabilities. The model we propose presents two novel features different from previous research models. First, it enhances the ontology selection and ranking method practically and effectively by enabling semantic matching of taxonomy or relational linkage between concepts. Second, it identifies what measures should be used to rank ontologies in the given context and what weight should be assigned to each selection measure. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
