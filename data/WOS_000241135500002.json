This protocol is especially designed for mobile environment. It is able to deal with unreliability of the mobile wireless networks where the client's bandwidth is limited and the connection may frequently fail. We describe the synchronization process of the data from the client side as well as from the server side. The protocol can deal with data synchronization conflicts and can prevent them in most cases by using data locking mechanism. Data buffering mechanism from client and server side is supporting the reestablishing of data consistency after connection failure. The protocol has been verified by means of a scenario from a facility management domain.", "paper_title": "Jabber based protocol for collaborative mobile work", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500002"}
