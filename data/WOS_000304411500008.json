Bubble particles enable the details of air bubbles to be represented within a simulation based on an Euler grid. We control the target shapes of bubbles by the gradient vectors of the signed distance field and attraction forces associated with control particles. Our hybrid approach enables to simulate physically plausible movements of bubbles while preserving the details of a target shape. Furthermore, we control the paths of moving bubbles using user-defined curves and the shape of an air bubbles by drag force. An accurate model of the drag force near the fluid surface means that bubbles have realistic ellipsoidal shapes.", "paper_title": "Controlling shapes of air bubbles in a multi-phase fluid simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304411500008"}
