The RMC has in fact been identified as one of the prominent and technology-pioneering government agencies in the country and therefore suitable for delivering electronic public services. Data were collected in mid-2009 from two types of customers, i.e., internal (Customs officers) and external (forwarding agents, importers, and bonded warehouse licensees) who use the Customs Information Systems (CIS) C8 form for trans-shipment of goods. Overall, the findings suggest that both types of customers are either indecisive and/or doubtful with the performance of the CIS. These findings are then extended to the broader context of information technology. It is of paramount importance that the RMC takes appropriate measures to satisfy both its internal and external customers by provision of improving its service delivery process through its CIS to produce desirable results.", "paper_title": "Towards e-Government: End-User Satisfaction with IT Implementation at Royal Malaysian Customs", "paper_id": "WOS:000336411100002"}
