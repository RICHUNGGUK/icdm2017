Furthermore, the DFT CAM-B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) method was applied to study the impact of different solvents on the geometry of the molecules and their spectral data. Additionally, experimental data are correlated with theoretical results; excellent linear dependence was obtained. The overall results presented in this paper show that N, N'-bisarylmalonamides are prominent candidates for model molecules.", "paper_title": "Computational and spectroscopic data correlation study of N,N '-bisarylmalonamides (Part II)", "paper_id": "WOS:000360850900014"}
