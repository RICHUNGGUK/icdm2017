Community detection constitutes a significant tool for the analysis of complex networks by enabling the study of mesoscopic structures that are often associated with organizational and functional characteristics of the underlying networks. Community detection has proven to be valuable in a series of domains, e.g. biology, social sciences, bibliometrics. However, despite the unprecedented scale, complexity and the dynamic nature of the networks derived from Social Media data, there has only been limited discussion of community detection in this context. More specifically, there is hardly any discussion on the performance characteristics of community detection methods as well as the exploitation of their results in the context of real-world web mining and information retrieval scenarios. To this end, this survey first frames the concept of community and the problem of community detection in the context of Social Media, and provides a compact classification of existing algorithms based on their methodological principles. The survey places special emphasis on the performance of existing methods in terms of computational complexity and memory requirements. It presents both a theoretical and an experimental comparative discussion of several popular methods. In addition, it discusses the possibility for incremental application of the methods and proposes five strategies for scaling community detection to real-world networks of huge scales. Finally, the survey deals with the interpretation and exploitation of community detection results in the context of intelligent web applications and services.", "paper_title": "Community detection in Social Media Performance and application considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000302478900003"}
