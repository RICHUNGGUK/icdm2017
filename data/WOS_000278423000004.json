With the goal of preventing, diverting, or weakening the destructive forces of tropical cyclones, the preparedness of the public plays a major role in the magnitude of inflicted damage due to these storms. Acknowledging the captivating power of social networking and Web 2.0 over society, we present a prototype system which integrates meteorological data along with user generated content with the aim of improving public response by increasing their situational awareness due to such natural threats. The proposed system aggregates storm track and wind analysis data from the existing H*Wind system along with videos taken from YouTube and presents it to the user in Google Earth. A content-based concept detection mechanism is used to evaluate the relevance of the extracted YouTube videos to the storm of interest. The proposed system demonstrates the potential public benefit resulting from the integration of the areas of multimedia content analysis, Web 2.0, and meteorology.", "paper_title": "INTEGRATING MULTIMEDIA SEMANTIC CONTENT ANALYSIS OF YOUTUBE VIDEOS WITH HURRICANE WIND ANALYSIS FOR PUBLIC SITUATION AWARENESS AND OUTREACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000278423000004"}
