Vectorless power grid verification methods, by solving linear programming (LP) problems under current constraints, enable worst-case voltage drop predictions at an early stage of design when the specific waveforms of current drains are unknown. In this paper, a novel power grid verification algorithm based on hierarchical constraints is proposed. By introducing novel power constraints, the proposed algorithm generates more realistic current patterns and provides less pessimistic voltage drop predictions. The model order reduction-based coefficient computation algorithm reduces the complexity of formulating the LP problems from being proportional to steps to being independent of steps. Utilizing the special hierarchical constraint structure, the submodular polyhedron greedy algorithm dramatically reduces the complexity of solving the LP problems from over O(k(m)(3)) to roughly O(k(m) log k(m)), where k(m) is the number of variables. Numerical results have shown that the proposed algorithm provides less pessimistic voltage drop prediction while at the same time achieves dramatic speedup.", "paper_title": "A Realistic Early-Stage Power Grid Verification Algorithm Based on Hierarchical Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000298327500011"}
