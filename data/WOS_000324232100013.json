This criterion is practical since it is readily testable given only a gradient (or subgradient) of the augmented Lagrangian. It is also \"relative\" in the sense of relative error criteria for proximal point algorithms: in particular, it uses a single relative tolerance parameter, rather than a summable parameter sequence. Our analysis first describes an abstract version of the criterion within Rockafellar's general parametric convex duality framework, and proves a global convergence result for the resulting algorithm. Specializing this algorithm to a standard formulation of convex programming produces a version of the classical augmented Lagrangian method with a novel inexact solution condition for the subproblems. Finally, we present computational results drawn from the CUTE test set-including many nonconvex problems-indicating that the approach works well in practice.", "paper_title": "A practical relative error criterion for augmented Lagrangians", "paper_id": "WOS:000324232100013"}
