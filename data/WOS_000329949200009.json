In this paper, we propose an improved version of the visual digital signature scheme with enhanced security. The improvement was made based on Yang's non-expansion visual cryptography technique and Boolean operations. The security of the improved version of the visual digital signature scheme is assured by the K-SAT (3-SAT and 4-SAT) NP-hard problem. This is to compare with the security of the existing scheme which is based on the difficulty of solving random Boolean OR operations. Besides improved in security the propose scheme is also, efficient in generating shares, compared to the existing scheme where the probability of generating black shares is high.", "paper_title": "An Improved Version of the Visual Digital Signature Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000329949200009"}
