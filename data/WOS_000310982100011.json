The application of crowd density estimation methods could lead to a better understanding of crowd behavior, improved design of the built environment, and increased pedestrian safety. In this paper, we propose a new crowd density estimation method, which aims at estimating not only a moving crowd, but also a stationary crowd, using images captured from surveillance cameras situated in various public locations. The crowd density of the moving people is measured, based on the moving area during a specified time period. The moving area is defined as the area where the magnitude of the accumulated optical flow exceeds a predefined threshold. In contrast, the stationary crowd density is estimated from the coarseness of textures, under the assumption that each person can be regarded as a textural unit. A multilayer neural network is designed, to classify crowd density levels into 5 classes. Finally, the proposed method is experimented with PETS 2009 and the platform of Gangnam subway station image sequences.", "paper_title": "Estimation of Crowd Density in Public Areas Based on Neural Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000310982100011"}
