The first model type is the realistic neuronal model; the second model type is the phenomenological or analytical model. In the simplest model set-up of two interconnected units, we define a parameter space for both types of systems where their behavior is similar. Next we expand the analytical model to two sets of 90 fully interconnected units with some overlap, which can display multi-stable behavior. This system can be in three classes of states: (i) a class consisting of a single resting state, where all units of a set are in steady state, (ii) a class consisting of multiple preserving states, where subsets of the units of a set participate in limit cycle, and (iii) a class consisting of a single saturated state, where all units of a set are recruited in a global limit cycle. In the third and final part of the work, we demonstrate that phase synchronization of units can be detected by a single output unit.", "paper_title": "DYNAMICS OF COLLECTIVE MULTI-STABILITY IN MODELS OF MULTI-UNIT NEURONAL SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000330903600004"}
