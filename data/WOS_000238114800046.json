This paper proposes the optimal handoff decision mechanisms, not only avoiding the 'ping-pong effect' and frequent handoffs, but also reducing handoff latency under multi-hop network mobility. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method is well adapted for supporting network mobility over traditional handoff decision algorithms.", "paper_title": "Optimized handoff decision mechanisms for scalable network mobility support", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800046"}
