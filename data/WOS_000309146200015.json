The prototype includes: (1) an argumentation-based decision support system which can be used both to represent medical decisions within guidelines, and to dynamically choose the most suitable plans to achieve clinical goals, and (2) mechanisms to specify a health organization's facilities and health workers skills and roles, which can be taken into account during the decision process in order to improve quality of care. Results: The framework has been fully implemented in the COGENT formal modeling system. The prototype has been evaluated implementing a hypertension guideline. Conclusions: The framework has shown flexibility and adaptability in (1) advising and tailoring health care based on a health organization's resources and a patient's particular medical condition, (2) delegating health care, and (3) replanning when unexpected situations arise.
