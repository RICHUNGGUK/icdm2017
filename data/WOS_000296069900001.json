A class of modified least-squares estimators of the parameters of the model, originally proposed by Schick for univariate first-order RCA models, is studied under more general conditions. Asymptotic behavior of such estimators is explored, and a lower bound for the asymptotic variance matrix of the estimator of the mean of random coefficient is established. Finite sample properties are demonstrated in a small simulation study.", "paper_title": "ON A CLASS OF ESTIMATORS IN A MULTIVARIATE RCA(1) MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000296069900001"}
