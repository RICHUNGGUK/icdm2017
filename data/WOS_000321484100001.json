To date, existing objective measures have focused on normal hearing model, and limited use has been found for restorative hearing instruments such as cochlear implants (CIs). In this paper, we have evaluated the performance of five existing objective measures, as well as proposed two refinements to one particular measure to better emulate CI hearing, under complex listening conditions involving noise-only, reverberation-only, and noise-plus-reverberation. Performance is assessed against subjectively rated data. Experimental results show that the proposed CI-inspired objective measures outperformed all existing measures; gains by as much as 22% could be achieved in rank correlation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
