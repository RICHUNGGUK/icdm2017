The number of floating point operations required by the algorithm is in the range of 15% to 27% for computing the vertex forces from a given set of vertex positions, and 27% to 38% for the tangent stiffness matrix, in comparison to a well-optimized algorithm directly derived from the conventional Total Lagrangian formulation. In the new algorithm, the data is associated with edges and tetrahedron-sharing edge-pairs (TSEPs), as opposed to tetrahedra, to avoid redundant computation. Another characteristic of the presented formulation is that it reduces to that of a spring-network model by simply ignoring all the TSEPs. The technique is demonstrated through an interactive application involving haptic interaction, being combined with a linearized implicit integration technique employing a preconditioned conjugate gradient method.", "paper_title": "An Edge-Based Computationally Efficient Formulation of Saint Venant-Kirchhoff Tetrahedral Finite Elements", "paper_id": "WOS:000263565100008"}
