One challenge is to unveil transduction mechanisms allowing ELF to interact with brain tissue. Thus, we present a cortical network model receiving internal and external stimuli. Using frequency analysis, we study how these stimuli durably modulate network dynamics depending on exposure duration, stimuli properties and transduction mechanisms. Our results indicate that these stimuli induce different responses in the frequency domain. Ultimately, such models might be useful in evaluating power line exposure thresholds, and in developing innovative brain stimulation methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
