The new approach, addressing the problem of physical human-exoskeleton interactions, models and simulates the mechanics of both the exoskeleton and the human body, which allows designers to e ff ectively analyze and evaluate an exoskeleton design for their function in concert with the human body. A simulation platform is developed by integrating a biomechanical model of the human body and the exoskeleton. With the proposed approach, an exoskeleton is designed for assisting patients with neuromuscular injuries. Results of the analysis and optimization are included.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Design of a Spring-loaded, Cable-driven, Wearable Exoskeleton for the Upper Extremity", "paper_id": "WOS:000367821400001"}
