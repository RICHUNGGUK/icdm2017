The closed structure of PpHAL was derived from the crystal structure of PpHAL inhibited with l-cysteine, in which the 39-80 loop including the catalytically essential Tyr53 was replaced. This modified loop with closed conformation was modeled using the structure of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from Anabaena variabilis (AvPAL) with a tightly closed active site as a template. Three hypothetical structures of the covalently bound intermediate in the PpHAL active site were investigated by conformational analysis. The distances between the acidic pro-S beta-hydrogen of the ligand and the appropriate oxygen atoms of Tyr53, Ty280 and Glu414 - which may act as enzymic bases - in the conformations of the three hypothetical intermediate structures were analyzed together with the substrate and product arrangements. The calculations indicated that the most plausible HAL reaction pathway involves the N-MIO intermediate structure in which the L-histidine substrate is covalently bound to the N-3,5-dihydro-5-methylidene-4H-imidazol-4-one (MIO) prosthetic group of the apoenzyme via the amino group. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations - on a truncated model of the N-MIO intermediate containing a Zn(2+) ion coordinated to the imidazole ring of the ligand and to His83, Met382 and a water molecule - indicated that Zn-complex formation plays a role in the reactivity and substrate specificity of HAL.", "paper_title": "Computational investigation of the histidine ammonia-lyase reaction: a modified loop conformation and the role of the zinc(II) ion", "paper_id": "WOS:000292290600003"}
