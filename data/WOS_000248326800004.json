A CAD-based sampling system is developed and implemented in this work. The sculptured features are sampled along their isoparametric curves. These curves are then used to re-construct the model geometry using the skinning of cross section curves. We refer to the re-constructed model as the substitute geometry. The problem is to determine the sample curve locations such that the substitute geometry satisfies certain geometric conditions. These are, the form error, and the continuity of the substitute geometry across the boundaries of adjacent surfaces. Three criteria are integrated to determine the sample locations: the surface curvature change, the substitute geometry deviation from the CAD model, and the significance of trimmed portions of the surface. A boundary representation-based methodology for the sampling of trimmed surfaces is developed and implemented. This methodology is extended to handle n-sided surfaces obtained through filling n-sided regions with quadrilateral surface patches, and models that may include multiple surface patches. Furthermore, a tool to assess the sampling plans based on the continuity of the substitute geometry across boundaries of adjacent surface patches is developed. The developed algorithms, their implementations, and case studies are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "CAD-based sampling for CMM inspection of models with sculptured features", "paper_id": "WOS:000248326800004"}
