As user interests can be affected by context at any time and any place in mobile scenarios, rich context information becomes more and more important for personalized context-aware recommendations. Although existing context-aware recommender systems can make context-aware recommendations to some extent, they suffer several inherent weaknesses: (1) Users' context-aware interests are not modeled realistically, which reduces the recommendation quality; (2) Current context-aware recommender systems ignore trust relations among users. Trust relations are actually context-aware and associated with certain aspects (i.e., categories of items) in mobile scenarios. In this article, we define a term role to model common context-aware interests among a group of users. We propose an efficient role mining algorithm to mine roles from a \"user-context-behavior\" matrix, and a role-based trust model to calculate context-aware trust value between two users. During online recommendation, given a user u in a context c, an efficient weighted set similarity query (WSSQ) algorithm is designed to build u's role-based trust network in context c. Finally, we make recommendations to u based on u's role-based trust network by considering both context-aware roles and trust relations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our recommendation approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Recommendation Using Role-Based Trust Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000363675500003"}
