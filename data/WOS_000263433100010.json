By using a combination of duality theorem and SDP relaxation technique, we reformulate the original convex maximization problem as a relaxed convex SDP problem, which can be solved with global optimality. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
