The well resistance and smear effect are also considered. The smear effect is described by three decay patterns of horizontal permeability towards drains within the smeared zone, including a reduced constant pattern, a linear decay pattern and a parabolic decay pattern. A parameter analysis is performed to investigate the consolidation behavior of the vertical drain. The convergence of the proposed series solution is discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
