This approach based on facial symmetry and image average can solve the drawbacks of the conventional algorithms such as histogram equalization (HE) and region-based histogram equalization (RHE). Among others, the proposed approach has the following advantages: (1) it is very simple, so it is easily implemented in a real-time face recognition system; (2) it is able to reinforce key facial features and to standardize other parts of the face; and (3) it can apply directly to single face image without any prior information of light source direction. The experimental results reveal that the proposed approach has a rather excellent recognition performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
