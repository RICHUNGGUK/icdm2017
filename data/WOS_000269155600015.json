Control architectures for multiagent systems employed in this correspondence paper can be categorized as centralized, sequential-decentralized, and fully decentralized methods. Centralized methods generally have better performance than decentralized methods. However, it is well known that the performance of the centralized methods for formation flight degrades when there exists communication failure among the vehicles, and they require more computation time than the decentralized method. This correspondence paper evaluates the control performance and the computation time reduction of the sequential-decentralized and fully decentralized methods in comparison with the centralized method and shows that the fully decentralized method can be made effective against short-term communication failure. The control inputs for formation flight are computed by nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC). The control input saturation and state constraints are incorporated as inequality constraints using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions in the NMPC framework, and the collision avoidance can be considered in real time. The proposed schemes are validated by numerical simulations, which include the process and measurement noise for more realistic situations.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Model Predictive Formation Flight", "paper_id": "WOS:000269155600015"}
