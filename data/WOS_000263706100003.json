However, past literature on this topic remains largely anecdotal, fragmented, and atheoretical. In this paper, we address this gap and adapt the DeLone and McLean model of IS success to the context of mobile work in healthcare, and articulate specific propositions. We then deductively evaluate each proposition based on studies reporting mobile device use in the healthcare context. Through this rigorous evaluation process, we are able to deliver a revised theoretical model that presents a consolidated view of the literature in the area of mobile work in healthcare.
