In particular, an asymptotically unbiased estimator of the CAI (denoted as CAICC) is derived as the model selection criterion which takes the estimation uncertainty in the variance component parameters into consideration. The relationship between bias correction and generalized degree of freedom for GLMMS is also explored. Simulation results show that the estimator performs well. The proposed criterion demonstrates a high proportion of correct model identification for GLMMS. Two sets of real data (epilepsy seizure count data and polio incidence data) are used to illustrate the proposed model identification method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
