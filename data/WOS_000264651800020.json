To facilitate broader understanding of genome evolution, we have designed an interactive 3D environment that enables visualization of diverse genome evolution processes. The system can intuitively and interactively animate mutation histories involving genome rearrangement, point mutation, recombination, insertion and deletion. Multiple organisms related by a phylogeny can be visualized simultaneously. As methods to infer evolutionary histories of genomes become increasingly complex, visualization of the evolutionary process will not only be useful for communication, but will also serve as an exploratory tool for discovering new patterns of genome evolution.", "paper_title": "Seevolution: visualizing chromosome evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000264651800020"}
