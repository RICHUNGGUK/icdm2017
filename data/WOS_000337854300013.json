Liaison can be viewed as a set, usually a pair, of features in proximity with which process information can be associated. A liaison is defined as a set of geometric entities on the parts being assembled and relations between these geometric entities. Liaisons have been defined for riveting, welding, bolt fastening, screw fastening, adhesive bonding (gluing) and blind fastening processes. The liaison captures process specific information through attributes associated with it. The attributes are associated with process details at varying levels of abstraction. A data structure for liaison has been developed to cluster the attributes of the liaison based on the level of abstraction. As information about the liaisons is not explicitly available in either the part model or the assembly model, algorithms have been developed for extracting liaisons from the assembly model. The use of liaison is proposed to enable both the construction of process model as the product model is fleshed out, as well as maintaining integrity of both product and process models as the inevitable changes happen to both design and the manufacturing environment during the product lifecycle. Results from aerospace and automotive domains have been provided to illustrate and validate the use of liaisons. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
