To reveal the orbital interactions clearly and interpret the stability of the title compounds, natural bonding orbital (NBO) analysis was carried out. Strong p-pi and pi-pi conjugation interactions exist in molecules. Substituent effects on the geometrical and electronic structures, aromaticity of the triazole ring, electronic sensitivity, impact sensitivity, thermal stability, density, solid state heat of formation [Delta H-f(s)], detonation velocity (D), detonation pressure (P), and specific impulse (I-s) were investigated. Substituent groups have significant and differing effects on performance. -N-3, -NF2, and -NO2 groups are very helpful for enhancing D and P, but the case is different for the -NH2 group. The order of the contribution of various groups to P and D is -NF2>-NO2>-N-3>-NH2. -NF2 brings the highest D and P, but the lowest I-s. -NO2 results in the secondary highest D and P and the best electronic stability. -N-3 gives relatively low D, P and stability, but the highest Delta H-f(s) and I-s. -NH2 leads to the lowest D and P, while giving the best impact and thermal stabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to consider various aspects comprehensively according to the practical requirements for each compound designed. Taking both detonation performance and sensitivity into consideration, introducing -NH2 and -N-3 into N, N'-azobis(1, 2, 4-triazole) may be a good choice for designing high-energy density materials.", "paper_title": "Computational investigations into the substituent effects of -N-3, -NF2, -NO2, and -NH2 on the structure, sensitivity and detonation properties of N, N '-azobis(1, 2, 4-triazole)", "paper_id": "WOS:000334934900034"}
