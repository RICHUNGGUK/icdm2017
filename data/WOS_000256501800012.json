A potential geophysical application of this effect is electroseismic (ES) logging, in which the converted acoustic wavefield is received in a fluid-filled borehole to evaluate the parameters of the porous formation around the borehole. In this paper, a finite-difference scheme is proposed to model the ES logging responses to a vertical low frequency electric dipole along the borehole axis. The EM field excited by the electric dipole is calculated separately by finite-difference first, and is considered as a distributed exciting source term in a set of extended Biot's equations for the converted acoustic wavefield in the formation. This set of equations is solved by a modified finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) algorithm that allows for the calculation of dynamic permeability so that it is not restricted to low-frequency poroelastic wave problems. The perfectly matched layer (PML) technique without splitting the fields is applied to truncate the computational region. The simulated ES logging waveforms approximately agree with those obtained by the analytical method. The FDTD algorithm applies also to acoustic logging simulation in porous formations.
