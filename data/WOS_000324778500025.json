In many cases, these data can be represented as a bipartite graph because it describes interactions between elements of two different types such as the influence of different experimental conditions on cellular variables or the direct interaction between receptors and their activators/inhibitors. One of the major challenges in the analysis of such noisy datasets is the statistical evaluation of the relationship between any two elements of the same type. Here, we present SICOP (significant co-interaction patterns), an implementation of a method that provides such an evaluation based on the number of their common interaction partners, their so-called co-interaction. This general network analytic method, proved successful in diverse fields, provides a framework for assessing the significance of this relationship by comparison with the expected co-interaction in a suitable null model of the same bipartite graph. SICOP takes into consideration up to two distinct types of interactions such as up-or downregulation. The tool is written in Java and accepts several common input formats and supports different output formats, facilitating further analysis and visualization. Its key features include a user-friendly interface, easy installation and platform independence.", "paper_title": "SICOP: identifying significant co-interaction patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000324778500025"}
