In this paper, we present on-line simple-to-implement (i) minimum variance unbiased and (ii) maximum likelihood estimators for the local mean signal power estimation in the decibel domain. We consider a generalized Nakagami-m fading environment and show that these estimators are asymptotically efficient in the number of samples and in the fading parameter in. Numerical and simulation results confirm that these estimators outperform the sample mean estimator and quickly approach the Cramer-Rao lower bounds.
