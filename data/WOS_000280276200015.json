We show that for the editing operations vertex deletion and edge deletion, both separately and combined, the problem is W[P]-complete. and remains W[P]-complete even if the input graph is already (r + 1)-degenerate, or has maximum degree 2r + 1 for all r >= 2. We also demonstrate fixed-parameter tractability for several CLIQUE based problems when the input graph has bounded degeneracy. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
