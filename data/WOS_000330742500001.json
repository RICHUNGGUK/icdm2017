According to earlier test records, the majority of defects were exposed due to a series of testing cases. However, the context of malformed inputs is not taken account into the previous algorithms. In this paper, we propose a refined structure-based fuzzing algorithm for Zigbee based on FSM, FSM-fuzzing. Any malformed input in FSM-Fuzzing is injected to the tested sensor against a specific initial state. If the sensor transferred to the next state of FMS or crashed, there would be a defect of Zigbee in dealing with the input under the state. The final state of the sensor is verified by an UIO sequence. After a round of tests, the sensor is regressed to the specific state to prepars for receiving the next mutation. All of the states would be traversed in FSM-fuzzing. A fuzzing tool, ZFSM-fuzzer, is designed for evaluating the performance of FSM-fuzzing. Experiment results show that there is a vulnerability of Zigbee in dealing with the frames without destination addresses. Further, the quality of cases of FSM-fuzzing is higher than the previous algorithms. Therefore, FSM-fuzzing is powerful in finding the vulnerabilities of Zigbee.", "paper_title": "A Novel Fuzzing Method for Zigbee Based on Finite State Machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000330742500001"}
