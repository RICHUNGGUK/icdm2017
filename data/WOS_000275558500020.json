Using a graph-theoretic approach, we propose two distributed algorithms, MLS and BSPAN, that construct spanning trees with minimum maximum (minmax) edge cost. MLS is based on computation ofminmax-cost paths from a reference node, while BSPAN performs a binary search over the range of power levels and exploits the wireless broadcast advantage. We also present a simple distributed method for pruning a graph to its Relative Neighborhood Graph, which reduces the worst-case message complexity of MLS under natural assumptions on the path-loss. In our network simulations both MLS and BSPAN significantly outperform the recently proposed Distributed Min-Max Tree algorithm in terms of number of messages required.", "paper_title": "Distributed algorithms for lifetime maximization in sensor networks via Min-Max spanning subgraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000275558500020"}
