And development environment was changed the internet based learning media contents into the more various technology such as component, web 2.0, service oriented development and so on. Especially, service-oriented development is one of new trend in web based system and has become mainstream in software development. In the development, web components aims at providing support to service-oriented technique by enabling automatic discovery, composition, invocation and interoperation of the services. In this paper, we aimed the implementation of English e-learning system including the item guessing parameter and considering the relative correction of item difficulty. In the system, a learner was given to choose the learning step by the relative difficulty. In order to process and combine, all the learning contents are based on Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) with Learning Management System (LMS). Also, each learning contents are belong to Sharable Content Objects (SCOs).", "paper_title": "English course E-learning system based on relative item difficulty using web component composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000306345000014"}
