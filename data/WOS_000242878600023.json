The proposed modeling expresses Si-substrate as four filaments in a filament-based extractor. Although the number of filaments is small, extracted loop inductances and resistances show accurate frequency dependence resulting from the proximity effect. We experimentally prove the accuracy using FEM (Finite Element Method) based simulations of electromagnetic fields. We also show a method to determine optimal size of the four filaments. The proposed model realizes substrate-aware extraction in SoC design flow. key words: substrate, interconnect, resistance, inductance, SoC", "paper_title": "Si-substrate modeling toward substrate-aware interconnect resistance and inductance extraction in SoC design", "paper_id": "WOS:000242878600023"}
