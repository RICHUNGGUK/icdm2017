Probably the most revealing finding is the fact that, in addition to cognitive intelligence and computing, also elements from social intelligence and design play a dominant role in the realization of the vision. In this paper we discuss these novel insights and their resulting impact on the AmI research landscape. We introduce a number of new AmI research perspectives that are related to social intelligence and in addition we argue that new ways of working are required applying the concept of Experience Research resulting in a true user-centered approach to Ambient Intelligence.", "paper_title": "New research perspectives on Ambient Intelligence", "paper_id": "WOS:000207841500002"}
