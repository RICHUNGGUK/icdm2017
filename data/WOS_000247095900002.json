Once the alignment between the global ontology and each distributed ontology is established, agreements that encode a variety of mappings between concepts are derived. In this way, users can potentially query hundreds of geospatial databases using a single query. Using our approach, querying can be easily extended to new data sources and, therefore, to new regions. In this paper, we describe the AgreementMaker, a tool that displays the ontologies, supports several mapping layers visually, presents automatically generated mappings, and finally produces the agreements.
