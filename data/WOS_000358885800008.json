The main contribution of this work lies in the control of GSC for supplying harmonics in addition to its slip power transfer. The rotor-side converter (RSC) is used for attaining maximum power extraction and to supply required reactive power to DFIG. This wind energy conversion system (WECS) works as a static compensator (STATCOM) for supplying harmonics even when the wind turbine is in shutdown condition. Control algorithms of both GSC and RSC are presented in detail. The proposed DFIG-based WECS is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink. A prototype of the proposed DFIG-based WECS is developed using a digital signal processor (DSP). Simulated results are validated with test results of the developed DFIG for different practical conditions, such as variable wind speed and unbalanced/single phase loads.", "paper_title": "Doubly Fed Induction Generator for Wind Energy Conversion Systems With Integrated Active Filter Capabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000358885800008"}
