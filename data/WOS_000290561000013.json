This paper presents a new nonlinear programming model in a dynamic environment. Furthermore, a novel hybrid approach based on the genetic algorithm and artificial neural network is proposed to solve the presented model. From the computational analyses, the proposed algorithm is found much more efficient than the genetic algorithm and simulated annealing in generating optimal solutions. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
