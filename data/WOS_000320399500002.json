The proposed schemes were based on dual-hop relaying where a relay with multiple-antenna capabilities at reception and transmission is deployed between the source and the destination nodes. We analyzed the performance of the proposed schemes by quantifying the average spectral efficiency and the outage probability. We also investigated the trade-off of performance and complexity by comparing the average number of active antennas, path estimations, and signal-to-noise ratio comparisons of the different proposed schemes.
