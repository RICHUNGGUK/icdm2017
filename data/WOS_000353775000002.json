Methods: We analysed the physicians' responses to an online survey. First, we performed a statistical descriptive analysis of the data; thereafter, a principal component analysis; and finally an order logit model to explain the effect of the use in the adoption and to analyse which are the existing barriers. Results: The principal component analysis revealed three main uses of Health Information Technologies: Electronic Health Records (EHR), ePrescription and patient management and telemedicine services. Results from an ordered logit model showed that the frequency of use of HIT is associated with the physicians' perceived usefulness. Lack of financing appeared as a common barrier to the adoption of the three types of services. For ePrescription and patient management, the physician's lack of skills is still a barrier. In the case of telemedicine services, lack of security and lack of interest amongst professionals are the existing barriers. Conclusions: EHR functionalities are fully adopted, in terms of perceived usefulness. EPrescription and patient management are almost fully adopted, while telemedicine is in an early stage of adoption. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
