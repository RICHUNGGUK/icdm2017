According to these metrics, data centers designed with conventional server processors are inefficient. Recently introduced processors based on low-power cores can improve both throughput and energy efficiency compared to conventional server chips. However, a specialized scale-out processor (SOP) architecture maximizes on-chip computing density to deliver the highest performance per tco and performance per watt at the data-center level.", "paper_title": "OPTIMIZING DATA-CENTER TCO WITH SCALE-OUT PROCESSORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309790100006"}
