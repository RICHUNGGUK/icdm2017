For the linear Navier slip boundary condition, an implicit implementation in the system of equations is carried out for which there is no need for any relaxation, especially when handling high slip coefficients. For three different nonlinear slip boundary conditions, two different methods are devised, one based on solving a transcendental equation for the boundary and the other on the linearization of the slip law. For assessment purposes, comparison is made between these new methods and the usual iterative process. With these new methods, the convergence difficulties, typical of the iterative procedure, are eliminated, and for some of the test cases, the convergence rate even increased with the slip velocity. The details of these implementations are given first for a simple geometry using orthogonal meshes and Cartesian coordinates followed by their generalization to non-Cartesian coordinates and nonorthogonal meshes. The developed code was tested in the benchmark slip-stick and 4:1 contraction flows, evidencing the robustness of the proposed procedures.
