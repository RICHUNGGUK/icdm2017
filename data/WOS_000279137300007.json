In this paper, we present a unified study of these two types of networks. Our results include decomposing the edges into disjoint Hamiltonian cycles, a simplification of the calculation of the Eisenstein-Jacobi distance, a distribution of the distances between Eisenstein-Jacobi nodes, and shortest path routing algorithms. In particular, the known Gaussian routing algorithm is simplified.", "paper_title": "The Topology of Gaussian and Eisenstein-Jacobi Interconnection Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000279137300007"}
