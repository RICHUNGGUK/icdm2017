The top mirror reflectivity is adjusted for high output power, slope efficiency, and small signal modulation bandwidth. An oxide confined VCSEL with an similar to 3 mu m aperture diameter delivers 2 mW of output power and reaches a resonance frequency as high as 25 GHz and a modulation bandwidth exceeding 20 GHz. A small K-factor of 0.17 ns and a large D-factor of 17.3 GHz/mA(1/2), extracted from the VCSEL modulation response, along with the improved DC and modal properties enable energy-efficient data transmission at high bit rates over long-distance multimode fiber. Error-free transmission at bit rates exceeding 20 Gbits/s over 1.1 km of OM4 fiber is demonstrated and shown to be limited mainly by the photoreceiver bandwidth. A theoretical investigation of the dependence of link performance on photoreceiver bandwidth is also presented.", "paper_title": "High-Speed 850 nm Quasi-Single-Mode VCSELs for Extended-Reach Optical Interconnects", "paper_id": "WOS:000322026500003"}
