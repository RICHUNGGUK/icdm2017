In this paper, we show that the breaking reversibility problem can result in significant energy dissipation. Subsequently, we propose an efficient technique to address the breaking reversibility problem, which is applicable to the usual fully adiabatic logic such as 2LAL, SCRL, and RERL. Detailed SPICE simulations are used to evaluate the proposed technique. The experimental results show that the proposed technique can considerably reduce (e.g., about 74% for RERL, 35% for 2LAL, and 17% for SCRL) the energy dissipation arising from the breaking reversibility problem.
