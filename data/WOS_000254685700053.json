The method is based on implicit higher-order upwind discretization of Navier-Stokes equations. The extension for unsteady simulation is considered by increasing artificial compressibility parameter or by using dual time stepping. Turbulence models are eddy-viscosity SST model and explicit algebraic Reynolds stress model. Results for steady turbulent flow over confined backward-facing step, unsteady laminar flow around circular cylinder and for unsteady turbulent free synthetic jet are presented.
