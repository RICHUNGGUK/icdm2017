It features a unique combination of properties that distinguish it from other such games, including continuous action and state spaces, uncertainty in execution, a unique turn-taking structure, and of course an adversarial nature. This article discusses some of the work done to date, focusing on the software side of the pool-playing problem. We discuss in some depth CueCard, the program that won the 2008 computational pool tournament. Research questions and ideas spawned by work on this problem are also discussed. We close by announcing the 2011 computational pool tournament, which will take place in conjunction with the 25th AAAI Conference.", "paper_title": "Computational Pool: A New Challenge for Game Theory Pragmatics", "paper_id": "WOS:000286710900003"}
