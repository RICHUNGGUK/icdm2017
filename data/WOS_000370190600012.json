Typical examples of these algorithms are sequential hard c-means (SHCM) and possibilistic clustering (PCM) based algorithms. Two types of L-1-regularized possibilistic clustering are proposed to induce crisp and possibilistic allocation rules and to construct a novel sequential cluster extraction algorithm. The relationship between the proposed method and SHCM is also discussed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through numerical examples. Results show that the entropy-based method yields better results for the Rand Index and the number of extracted clusters.", "paper_title": "On Sequential Cluster Extraction Based on L-1-Regularized Possibilistic c-Means", "paper_id": "WOS:000370190600012"}
