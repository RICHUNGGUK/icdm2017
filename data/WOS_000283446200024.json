As opposed to the structured P2P systems deployed so far, resource indexing and placement is uncorrelated with network structure and topology, and resource keys are organized and managed by self-organizing mobile agents through simple local operations driven by probabilistic choices. Self-Chord has three main features that are particularly advantageous in Grid and Cloud Computing: 1) it is possible to give a semantic meaning to keys, which enables the execution of range queries; 2) the keys are fairly distributed over the peers, thus improving the balancing of storage responsibilities; 3) maintenance load is also limited because it is not necessary to reassign keys when new peers or resources are added to the system-the mobile agents will spontaneously reorganize the keys. The efficiency and effectiveness of Self-Chord were assessed both with a simulation framework and with an analytical model inspired by fluid dynamics.", "paper_title": "Self-Chord: A Bio-Inspired P2P Framework for Self-Organizing Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000283446200024"}
