In particular, we have selected as peculiar key-study an ensemble of Camptothecin (CPT) analogs classified as human DNA Topoisomerase I (Top1) selective inhibitors. The CPT analogs dataset has been recently analyzed by Hansch and Verma using a classical 2D-QSAR study.", "paper_title": "A Novel Generalized 3D-QSAR Model of Camptothecin Analogs", "paper_id": "WOS:000298089900003"}
