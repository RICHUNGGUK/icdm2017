Group testing is for the scenario where each test is on a subset of items, and tells whether the subset contains at least one defective item or not. In practice, the number of defective items is often unknown in advance. In this paper, we propose a new randomized group testing algorithm RPT (Randomized Parallel Testing) for the case where the number of defective items is unknown in advance, such that with high probability , the total number of tests performed by RPT is bounded from the above by . If for some constant , which holds for most practical applications, this upper bound is asymptotically smaller than previous best result. In addition, we give a new upper bound on , the minimum number of tests required in the worst case to identify all the defective items out of items when the value of is known in advance.", "paper_title": "A new randomized algorithm for group testing with unknown number of defective items", "paper_id": "WOS:000355630900012"}
