In contrast to the previous research studies in cyber physical society, we are focusing on a different case of CPS - green IT in this paper. The complex cyber-physical systems of cloud bring unprecedented challenges in power resource managements. This paper looks at the literature behind virtualization and mainly virtual desktop infrastructure as the solution to these challenges. In this paper, we investigate how to use cutting-edge virtualisation technologies to reduce power consumption of IT infrastructure in Cyber Physical Society. This research and the implementation of a testing virtual desktop environment using VMware and Wyse technologies portray the clear improvements that hypervisor and desktop virtualization can be brought to IT infrastructures drawing particular attention to power consumption and the green incentives.", "paper_title": "Achieving Green IT Using VDI in Cyber Physical Society", "paper_id": "WOS:000320291200007"}
