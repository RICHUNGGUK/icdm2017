Design/methodology/approach - The objective is to provide references that identify seminal, early work, and references that represent the current state of the art. References are listed in categories that cover the broad range of induction modeling and application issues. Findings - A brief over-view of the key areas in induction processing of materials is provided, but greater emphasis and space is devoted to the references provided. Research limitations/implications - The middle years of each topic area are not covered. Practical implications - A very comprehensive coverage of material is provided to those with an interest in induction processing of materials. Originality/value - This paper fulfils an identified information/resources need.", "paper_title": "State of the art of numerical modeling for induction processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000254663100002"}
