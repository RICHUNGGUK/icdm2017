We translate finite control processes, a well-known subset of pi-Calculus, into Petri nets, which are subsequently used for model checking. This translation always yields bounded Petri nets with a small bound, and we develop a technique for computing a non-trivial bound by static analysis. Moreover, we introduce the notion of safe processes, a subset of finite control processes, for which our translation yields safe Petri nets, and show that every finite control process can be translated into a safe one of at most quadratic size. This gives a possibility to translate every finite control process into a safe Petri net, for which efficient unfolding-based verification is possible. Our experiments show that this approach has a significant advantage over other existing tools for verification of mobile systems in terms of memory consumption and runtime. We also demonstrate the applicability of our method on a realistic model of an automated manufacturing system.", "paper_title": "A Practical Approach to Verification of Mobile Systems Using Net Unfoldings", "paper_id": "WOS:000271472900008"}
