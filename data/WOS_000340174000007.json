This article presents the architecture and implementation of an Augmented Presentation Feedback System. The system allows a speaker equipped with an Augmented Reality Head-Mounted Display to display visual cues depicted over the listeners' heads. These can be used as a way to provide the speaker with continuous, private, and immediate feedback on his or her explanations. The results of a case study conducted showed that the system not only assists the speaker in adapting the content and pace of the explanation to the listener but also helps to better manage their interventions and improve the flow of the presentation.", "paper_title": "Augmented Presentations: Supporting the Communication in Presentations by Means of Augmented Reality", "paper_id": "WOS:000340174000007"}
