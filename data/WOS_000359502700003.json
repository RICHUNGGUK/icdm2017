The main aims of the proposed strategy are to face time-varying network-induced delays and to avoid packet disorder. A Markov chain-driven NCS scenario will be considered, where different network load situations, and consequently, different probability density functions for the network delay are assumed. In order to assure mean-square stability for the considered NCS, a decay-rate based sufficient condition is enunciated in terms of probabilistic Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs). Simulation results show better control performance, and more accurate path tracking, for the scheduled (delay-dependent) controller than for the non-scheduled one (i.e. the nominal controller when delays appear). Finally, the control strategy is validated on an experimental test-bed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
