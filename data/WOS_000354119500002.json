Two criteria for required by a fractional operator are formulated. The Grunwald-Letnikov, Riemann-Liouville and Caputo fractional derivatives and the Riesz potential are accessed in the light of the proposed criteria. A Leibniz rule is also obtained for the Riesz potential. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "What is a fractional derivative?", "paper_id": "WOS:000354119500002"}
