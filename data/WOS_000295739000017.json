However, in mobile environments, the outage probability does not completely describe the behavior of cooperative diversity schemes since the mobility of the involved nodes introduces variations in the channel gains. As a result, the capacity outage events are correlated in time and second-order statistical parameters of the achievable information-theoretic capacity such as the average capacity outage rate (AOR) and the average capacity outage duration (AOD) are required to obtain a more complete description of the properties of cooperative diversity protocols. In this paper, assuming slow Rayleigh fading, we derive exact expressions for the AOR and the AOD of three well-known cooperative diversity protocols: variable-gain amplify-and-forward, decode-and-forward, and selection decode-and-forward relaying. Furthermore, we develop asymptotically tight high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) approximations, which offer important insights into the influence of various system and channel parameters on the AOR and the AOD. In particular, we show that on a double-logarithmic scale, similar to the outage probability, the AOR asymptotically decays with the SNR with a slope that depends on the diversity gain of the cooperative protocol, whereas the AOD asymptotically decays with a slope -1/2 of independent of the diversity gain.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Diversity With Mobile Nodes: Capacity Outage Rate and Duration", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000017"}
