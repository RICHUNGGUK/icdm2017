However. the existing works focus extensively on the design concept. In this paper, we focus Oil the performance of a web database application Such as an integrated web data warehousing using a well-defined and uniform structure to deal with web information sources including semi-structured data Such as XML data, and documents such as HTML in a web data warehouse system. By using a case Study, our implementation of the prototype is a web manipulation concept for both incoming Sources and result Outputs. Thus, the system not only call be operated through the web, it call also handle the integration of web data sources and structured data Sources. Our main contribution is the performance evaluation of all integrated web data warehouse application which includes two tasks. Task one is to perform a verification of the correctness of integrated data based oil the result set that is retrieved front the web integrated data warehouse system using complex and OLAP queries. The result set is checked against the result set that is retrieved from the existing independent data source systems. Task two is to measure the performance of OLAP or complex query by investigating source operation functions used by these queries to retrieve the data. The information Of Source operation functions used by each query is obtained using the TKPROF utility.", "paper_title": "A high performance integrated web data warehousing", "paper_id": "WOS:000245911900009"}
