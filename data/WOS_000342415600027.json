The optimal codeword lengths obtained are based on a new coding algorithm, which transforms the initial source probability vector into a new probability vector according to a merging rule. The coding algorithm is equivalent to a partition of the source alphabet into disjoint sets on which a new transformed probability vector is defined as a function of the initial source probability vector and scalar parameter. The payoff criterion considered encompasses a tradeoff between maximum and average codeword length; it is related to a payoff criterion consisting of a convex combination of average codeword length and average of an exponential function of the codeword length, and to an average codeword length payoff criterion subject to a limited length constraint. A special case of the first related payoff is connected to coding problems involving source probability uncertainty and codeword overflow probability, whereas the second related payoff compliments limited length Huffman coding algorithms.", "paper_title": "Optimal Merging Algorithms for Lossless Codes With Generalized Criteria", "paper_id": "WOS:000342415600027"}
