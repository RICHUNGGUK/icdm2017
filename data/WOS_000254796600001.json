The human operator's eye and computer mouse movements were analyzed, and their interrelationship was investigated in the framework of the SSA theory. A new method of eye movement interpretation is presented. Procedures for development of predictive design models of human performance are also suggested. These design models can be developed based on either purely analytical procedures or a combination of analytical procedures and abbreviated experimental studies. Developed models are task specific and are described in terms of human actions and operations, rather than in terms of the internal cognitive architecture. The design process is considered in terms of stages of the sequential refinement of designed models.", "paper_title": "Application of systemic-structural theory of activity in the development of predictive models of user performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000254796600001"}
