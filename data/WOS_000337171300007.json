Based on the analysis of the trajectories of prominent technologies, we can explore the phenomena of technology evolution and knowledge diffusion. In this study, we focus on explaining knowledge diffusion in the core technology used in fuel cells, i.e. the development of 5-layer membrane electrode assembly (MEA) technologies. Through an investigation of path analysis, this study explores how the knowledge of this technology has evolved and diffused across different locations. The empirical analysis also explains how certain technological knowledge plays a critical role in main path. In this study, patent data of 5-layer MEA technologies for fuel cells is collected from the US Patent Office, for a total of 1,356 patents, followed by constructing a patent citation network based on citation relationships, recognising prominent patents with many citations through path analysis. Using the local main path analysis and global key-route method, we identify three stages of technological development, including an improvement of the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and catalyst synthesis. Additionally, we use regression analysis to demonstrate that patents with specific characteristics play a vital role in the process of knowledge diffusion. Patents from Japan and South Korea are relatively more important than patents from other countries. The brokerage characteristics of a patent (e.g., coordinating domestically or liaising among three or more countries) also facilitate the diffusion of technological knowledge. However, the importance of these brokerages changes when we look at inventing time. Furthermore, the technological diversification of a patent exerted no substantial influence on its network position.", "paper_title": "Exploring knowledge diffusion among nations: a study of core technologies in fuel cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000337171300007"}
