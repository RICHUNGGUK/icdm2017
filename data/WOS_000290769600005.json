We wish to obtain a confidence interval (CI) for the length of its mean. The usual method is to Studentize. The resulting CIs are not exact. The error in their nominal levels is similar to n(-1/2) and similar to n(-1) in the one-sided and two-sided cases. We show how to reduce these errors to similar to n(-3/2) and similar to n(-2).", "paper_title": "Confidence intervals for the length of a vector mean", "paper_id": "WOS:000290769600005"}
