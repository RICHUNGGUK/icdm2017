With the development of new emerging service-related computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing and Mobile Internet, more and more services are provided by different providers. These services are becoming increasingly complex. Aiming at recommending high-quality and trustful services in the complex service computing environment, this paper presents a trust-aware search engine by integrating service functionalities, QoS (quality of service) and service trust. The proposed search engine primarily contains four components: keyword-based service matching, service QoS evaluation, service reputation evaluation and a hybrid ranking method which combines the results yielded by the previous three components to produce final service recommendations. To evaluate the performance of the authors' service search engine, comprehensive experiments are conducted using a real Web service dataset. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms conventional QoS-based service selection methods. Finally, a prototype is also presented to validate the authors' trust-aware Web service search engine.", "paper_title": "A Trust-Aware Search Engine for Complex Service Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000343387100003"}
