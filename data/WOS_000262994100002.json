We then describe a generalization of face routing, and prove that this algorithm does provide a local routing algorithm for arbitrary graphs embedded in the torus. Finally we discuss extension of this type of algorithm to surfaces of genus g.", "paper_title": "Local Routing on Tori", "paper_id": "WOS:000262994100002"}
