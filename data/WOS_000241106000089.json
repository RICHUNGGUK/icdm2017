This paper presents an Entropy-based Stability QoS Routing with Priority scheduler in MANET using fuzzy controllers (ESQRP). The key idea of ESQRP algorithm is to construct the new metric-entropy and select the stability path with the help of entropy metric to reduce the number of route reconstruction so as to provide QoS guarantee in the ad hoc network. The simulation results shows that the ESQRP approach provide an accurate and efficient method of estimating and evaluating the route stability in dynamic mobile networks.", "paper_title": "An entropy-based stability QoS routing with priority scheduler in MANET using fuzzy controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000089"}
