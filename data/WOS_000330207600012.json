A comprehensive study on two conventional methods, with one of them based on optimizing the number of stage for minimum silicon area (minimum area method) and the other for maximum power efficiency (optimal power method), will be presented by considering both top- and bottom-plate parasitic capacitances. It was found that when the parasitic factors are as large as 0.1, the area and power efficiencies of the charge pumps designed with either the optimal power or minimum area method do not have much degradation. However, when the parasitic factors are small, charge pumps designed with the optimal power and minimum area methods can, respectively, result in a large area and poor power efficiency. The power efficiency of the charge pump designed with the minimum area method may be reduced by 50 %, while the area of the charge pump designed with the optimal power method can be 1-2 times larger, when the parasitic factors are 0.01. Hence, neither the optimal power nor minimum area methods should be used when the parasitic factors are small, unless the power or area is the only concern in the design. With this connection, the number of stage which leads to an area and power-efficient charge pump is suggested. Validity was proved by the good agreement between the simulated and the expected results for some designed charge pump circuits of the proposed design strategy.", "paper_title": "On the design of power- and area-efficient Dickson charge pump circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000330207600012"}
