Design/methodology/approach - A survey of Saudi Arabia private companies with a KM policy was carried out, and the issues raised were investigated further by literature analysis. Findings - Issues examined include the effect of demographics, the balance between human and digital resources, the relation between KM and organisational learning, the effect of the cultural context, the nature of reward for knowledge sharing, including enhancement of self-worth, and the relation between the personal and individual, and the collective and social. Research limitations/implications - The survey has a self-selected convenience sample, which is rather skewed demographically. The literature analysis is selective rather than comprehensive. Originality/value - Presents an analysis of some general issues of KM and information sharing through the lens of one cultural context.", "paper_title": "The individual and the collective Factors affecting knowledge sharing in Saudi Arabian companies", "paper_id": "WOS:000349645500011"}
