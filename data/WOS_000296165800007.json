Danziger et al. (2009) [8] have studied this problem and shown some computational complexity results. Around the same time, Martinez et al. (2009) [19] defined and studied error-locating arrays (ELAs), which are closely related to CAFEs. Both papers left some computational complexity questions. In particular, these papers showed polynomial-time solvability of the existence of CAFEs and ELAs for binary alphabets (g = 2), and the NP-hardness of these problems for g >= 5. In this paper, we prove that optimizing CAFEs and ELAs is indeed NP-hard even when restricted to the case of binary alphabets, using a reduction from edge clique covers of graphs (ECCs). We also provide a hardness of approximation result. We explore important relationships between ECCs and CAFEs and give some new bounds for uniform ECCs and CAFEs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
