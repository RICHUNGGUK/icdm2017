Recently, Zhang et al. proposed a new authenticated key agreement protocol for the session initiation protocol using smart card and claimed their protocol was secure against various attacks. However, we found that Zhang et al.'s protocol cannot withstand the user impersonation attack, i. e., a malicious user could impersonate any other user to the server. We also propose a new authenticated key agreement protocol using smart card for SIP which is immune to the presented attack. Besides, the proposed protocol also has better performance than Zhang et al.'s protocol.", "paper_title": "An Improved Authentication Protocol for Session Initiation Protocol Using Smart Card and Elliptic Curve Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000336723900005"}
