Most existing 3-D mesh transmission systems do not consider such a view-dependent delivery issue, and thus transmit unnecessary portions of 3-D mesh models, which leads to the waste in precious wireless network bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel view-dependent 3-D model transmission scheme, where a 3-D model is partitioned into a number of segments, each segment is then independently coded using the MPEG-4 3DMC coding algorithm, and finally only the visible segments are selected and delivered to the client. Moreover, we also propose analytical models to find the optimal number of segments so as to minimize the average transmission size. Simulation results show that such a view-based 3-D model transmission is able to substantially save the transmission bandwidth and therefore has a significant impact on wireless graphics applications.", "paper_title": "Segmentation-based view-dependent 3-D graphics model transmission", "paper_id": "WOS:000258223800006"}
