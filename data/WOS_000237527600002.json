The issues of data quality. selection of the error function. incorporation of the predictive learning methods into the existing modeling frameworks. expert knowledge model uncertainty. and other application-domain specific problems are discussed. A brief overview of the papers in the Special issue is provided follow by discussion of open issues and directions for future research. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
