First, a TOPSIS based fuzzy goal programming (FGP) is proposed which considered uncertain DM preferences on priority of achievement level of fuzzy goals. The FGP essentially considers economic factors like cost, profit, and budget. The output of FGP and other affecting factors (i.e. social and environmental effects, risk of investment, strategic alliance, and organizational readiness) are treated as inputs of a fuzzy rule based system to estimate fitness value of an investment. Properties of the proposed DSS are discussed. It also is compared with an existing procedure on historical data of a financial and credit institute. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
