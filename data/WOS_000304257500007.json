It uses text mining, visualization, and communication tools to provide the empirical knowledge necessary to address management of technology questions. Tech mining can help assess mature or emerging fields of science and technology, such as nanotechnology. Here, we depict select analyses and visualizations of relevant ST&I data on the topics of nanoenhanced, thin-film solar cells and dye-sensitized solar cells. These analyses help identify complementary and competitive research activity, evaluate research productivity, assess research interdisciplinarity, understand nanotechnology developmental trajectories, and identify and forecast promising nanoapplications.
