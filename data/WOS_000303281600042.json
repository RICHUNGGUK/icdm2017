We propose here a multidisciplinary method for the recognition of physical activity with the emphasis on feature extraction and selection processes, which are considered to be the most critical stages in identifying the main unknown activity discriminant elements. Efficient feature selection processes are particularly necessary when dealing with huge training datasets in a multidimensional space, where conventional feature selection procedures based on wrapper methods or 'branch and bound' are highly expensive in computational terms. We propose an alternative filter method using a feature quality group ranking via a couple of two statistical criteria. Satisfactory results are achieved in both laboratory and semi-naturalistic activity living datasets for real problems using several classification models, thus proving that any body sensor location can be suitable to define a simple one-feature-based recognition system, with particularly remarkable accuracy and applicability in the case of the wrist.
