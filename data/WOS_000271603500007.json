However, designers must also appropriately address the network performance, availability, and complexity problems that firewalls introduce. The authors survey existing cluster-based fault-tolerant firewall architectures and discuss their trade-offs in these three areas. They present a preliminary evaluation of these architectures and discuss the need for state replication in stateful firewall clusters. They also discuss the difficulties of providing a simple, performance, and fault-tolerant cluster-based firewall solution.", "paper_title": "Demystifying Cluster-Based Fault-Tolerant Firewalls", "paper_id": "WOS:000271603500007"}
