While 1D H-1 NMR spectroscopy is a powerful, highly informative technique that can rapidly and nondestructively report details of complex metabolite mixtures, it suffers from significant signal overlap that hinders interpretation and quantification of individual analytes. Two-dimensional (2D) NMR methods that report heteronuclear connectivities can reduce spectral overlap, but their use in metabolic fingerprinting studies is limited. We describe a generalization of Adaptive Intelligent binning that enables its use on multidimensional datasets, allowing the direct use of nD NMR spectroscopic data in bilinear factorizations such as principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS).
