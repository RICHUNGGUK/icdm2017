These existing approaches mainly use the Markov Random Field (MRF) or texture features as texture model to analyze the local properties of sample textures. Indeed, human perception is sensitive to structure and periodicity. In this paper, we perform texture synthesis by taking into account the distribution of texels. Given a sample texture, the analysis procedure consists in segmenting texture into individual texels, and detecting each texel in order to analyze their neighborhood relationships by constructing connectivity. Then the synthesis process consists in reproducing a new large texture directly on a user-specified canvas by recomposing segmented texels, which synthesizes two-dimensional texel arrangements based on the previously constructed neighborhood relationships of texels. Results show that the proposed method is successful in generating textures visually indistinguishable to the sample textures. Moreover, the method especially deals with the near-regular textures, which well preserves underlying structural regularity.", "paper_title": "Periodic pattern of texture analysis and synthesis based on texels distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000278135800055"}
