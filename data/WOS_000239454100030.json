We study the position of the class of languages generated by contextual hypergraph grammars in comparison with graph languages generated by hyperedge replacement grammars and double-pushout hypergraph grammars. Moreover, several examples show the potential of the new class of grammars.", "paper_title": "Contextual hypergraph grammars - A new approach to the generation of hypergraph languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454100030"}
