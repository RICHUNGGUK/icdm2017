In CR networks, available sub-channels are dynamically assigned to secondary users (SUs). However, when a primary user accesses a primary channel consisting of multiple sub-channels, data transmissions of the SUs already using the sub-channels may be terminated. In this paper, we analyze the performance of dynamic spectrum handoff scheme with channel bonding, in which the number of sub-channels used by an SU are variable. We model the multichannel CR network as a multiserver priority queueing system without waiting facility, deriving the blocking probability, the forced termination probability and the throughput for SUs. In terms of the way of forced termination, we consider two policies; one is that SUs using the largest number of sub-channels are forced to terminate their transmissions, and the other is that SUs using the smallest number of sub-channels are chosen for termination. The analysis is also validated by simulation. Numerical examples show that in both forced-termination policies, the throughput of SUs that are forced to terminate their transmissions degrades as the offered load to the system increases.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of dynamic spectrum handoff scheme with variable bandwidth demand of secondary users for cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600004"}
