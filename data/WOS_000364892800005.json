This software, named PCLab, is able to analyze the microstructure evolution and mechanical performance by both Monte Carlo (MC) simulation and the Finite Element method (FEM). The software has integrated preprocessors, solvers and postprocessors. Some examples are tested and explored the functionality of the software package. It shows that the PCLab software with a user-friendly graphical interface provides an efficient tool for faster material analysis, design and application. It also provides a flexible, robust platform for the future extensity in the material multi-physics research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
