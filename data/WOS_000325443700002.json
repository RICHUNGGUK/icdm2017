We explore two configurations, the static case in which virtual machines are generated according to the cloud orchestration, and the dynamic case in which virtual machines are reactively adapted according to the job submissions, using migration, for optimizing performance time metrics. We integrate both solutions in the same simulator for measuring the performance of various combinations of virtual machines, jobs and hosts in terms of the average execution and total simulation time. We conclude that the dynamic configuration is prosperus as it offers optimized job execution performance.", "paper_title": "Cloud Scheduling Optimization: A Reactive Model to Enable Dynamic Deployment of Virtual Machines Instantiations", "paper_id": "WOS:000325443700002"}
