In addition, it showed the whole structure of the scheme, added an extensional registration number to certificates and designed unified authentication process for the scheme. The unified authentication process was modelled and simulated by Coloured Petri Net (CPN) Tools and verified by analyzing the state space of CPN model. In conclusion, this paper provides a unified authentication service and confirms that the proposed scheme is totally controllable, realizable and feasible. The suggested scheme can enhance the efficiency and security of authentication systems and achieve good results in practical applications.", "paper_title": "A Unified Authentication Scheme Based on Analytic Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000361372000026"}
