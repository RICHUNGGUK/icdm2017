This problem arises in the structural analysis of differential-algebraic systems. The purpose of this paper is to show that this problem is NP-complete. We show that the problem is equivalent to the stable set problem in a restricted case of tripartite graphs. Then we show that the latter remains NP-complete in that case. We also prove the NP-completeness of the related minimum blocker problem in bipartite graphs with perfect matching. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
