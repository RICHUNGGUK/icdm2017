Using post-correction methods can improve the performance of the component as well as overall measurement system. In this paper an ADC is characterised by a Kautz-Volterra (KV) model, which utilises a model-based post-correction of the ADC with general properties and a reasonable number parameters. It is also shown that the inverse model has the same dynamic properties as the direct KV model. Results that are based on measurements on a high-speed 12-bit ADC show good results for a model.
