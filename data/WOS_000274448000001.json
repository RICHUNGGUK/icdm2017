There the large numbers of design variables needed to parameterize surfaces in 3D necessitates the use of gradient-based optimization algorithms, and hence efficient and accurate evaluation of gradients. In this context over the last 20 years a variety of approaches have been developed to supply these gradients, raising particular challenges that hive required novel algorithms. In this paper, we examine the historical development of these approaches, describe in some detail the theoretical background of each major method and the associated numerical techniques required to make them practical in an engineering setting. We give examples from Our own experience and describe what we consider to be the state-of-the-art in these methods, including their application to optimization of complex 3D aircraft configurations.
