Due to the short wireless transmission range of RSUs and vehicle mobility, a vehicle spends only a short period of time inside the range of an RSU. This limitation, together with possible overload of RSUs sited near busy road junctions, may mean that requests from vehicles are not served within the prescribed deadlines. In this paper, we propose a cooperative load balancing approach among RSUs, in which an RSU can transfer the overload requests to other RSUs. Load transfer is done based on a number of factors: request delay tolerance, current load of the transferee RSU, and the direction in which the vehicle is heading. Using a series of simulation experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed cooperative load balancing approach outperforms the non-cooperative (stand-alone) approaches in a wide range of scenarios based on our performance metrics.", "paper_title": "On scheduling data access with cooperative load balancing in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs)", "paper_id": "WOS:000330997300006"}
