To tackle this problem, an innovative method is proposed that combines concepts from corrosion modeling and cellular automata to generate a texture descriptor. The core processes of metal (pitting) corrosion are identified and applied to texture images by incorporating the basic mechanisms of corrosion in the transition function of the cellular automaton. The surface morphology of the image is analyzed before and during the application of the transition function of the cellular automaton. In each iteration the cumulative mass of corroded product is obtained to construct each of the attributes of the texture descriptor. In the final step, this texture descriptor is used for image classification by applying Linear Discriminant Analysis. The method was tested on the well-known Brodatz and Vistex databases. In addition, in order to verify the robustness of the method, its invariance to noise and rotation was tested. To that end, different variants of the original two databases were obtained through addition of noise to and rotation of the images. The results showed that the proposed texture descriptor is effective for texture classification according to the high success rates obtained in all cases. This indicates the potential of employing methods taking inspiration from natural phenomena in other fields. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
