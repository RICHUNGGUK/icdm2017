T-shaped slits, bridges, and the solid ground plane are used to constitute the novel L-EBG structure. Considering a threshold of -35 dB, the stopband of the proposed EBG structure is about 7.29 GHz which is 1.68 GHz wider than that of a conventional L-EBG structure. Measurement results confirm the wide bandwidth of the prototype that is predicted in simulations. In addition, the lower and upper cutoff frequencies are estimated by use of lumped-component circuit models and parallel-plate waveguide models, respectively. Moreover, the IR-drop and dc resistance are examined through simulations. Additionally, common signal integrity issues in a power distribution network such as IR-drop, DC resistance, and eye diagrams are investigated and compared to a conventional L-EBG structure.
