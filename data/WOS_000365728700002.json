In this paper, we argue that the mechanism of action imitation is necessary and in some cases sufficient to describe sentence imitation. We first develop a framework for action imitation in which key ideas of Hurley's shared circuits model are integrated with Wolpert et al.'s motor selection mechanism and its extensions. We then explain how this action-based framework clarifies sentence imitation without a language-specific faculty. Finally, we discuss the empirical support for and philosophical significance of this perspective.", "paper_title": "How Sensorimotor Interactions Enable Sentence Imitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000365728700002"}
