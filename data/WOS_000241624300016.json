MI acquiring is a key activity for enterprises to keep predominance in furious market competition. The quick-developed Internet provides abundant information resources, but there is a lack of effective new approaches and models for MI acquiring. In this paper, we concentrate on MI mining based on B2C websites. We develop a specialized B2C websites mining model by syncretizing technology of web mining, knowledge representation, data warehouse and metadata. We design a web content mining algorithm integrating several web mining methods, and perform the digital camera sales experiments to validate it.", "paper_title": "Web content mining for Market Intelligence acquiring from B2C websites", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300016"}
