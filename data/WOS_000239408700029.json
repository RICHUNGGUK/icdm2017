The HDA system, which exploits the advantages of both digital and analog systems, generalizes a scheme previously presented by the authors, and can operate for any bandwidth ratio (bandwidth compression and expansion). It is based on vector quantization and features turbo coding in its digital component and linear/nonlinear processing in its analog part. Simulations illustrate that, under both bandwidth compression and expansion modes of operation, the HDA system provides a robust and graceful performance with good reproduction fidelity for a wide range of channel conditions.", "paper_title": "Hybrid digital-analog source-channel coding for bandwidth Compression/Expansion", "paper_id": "WOS:000239408700029"}
