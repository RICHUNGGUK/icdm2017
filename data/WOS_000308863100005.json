With the aim of identifying the most important features in customising mobile phones, 288 questionnaires were collected and analysed. The result showed that 'text message', 'battery', 'contacts', 'software updates', and 'display size' were highly required to customise. Among six factors ( physical design, technical design, cost of entertainment, cost of information, cost of durability, easiness of use) obtained from a factor analysis, the most important reason for users to customise mobile phones was that they wanted to use a mobile phone easily. Cost of durability and cost of information were also important motivations for customisation of mobile phones. Finally, this research showed that gender and user experience were significant factors for customisation.", "paper_title": "Providing customisation guidelines of mobile phones for manufacturers", "paper_id": "WOS:000308863100005"}
