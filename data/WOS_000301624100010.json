We investigated whether the treatment of OSA at night by means of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) improves the daytime consequences. Twenty-eight patients with OSA, 18 with arterial hypertension, 10 with normal blood pressure, were investigated at baseline and with three months of CPAP treatment. Ten age and sex matched healthy control subjects were investigated for comparisons. We recorded a resting period with 20 min quiet breathing and an exercise stress test during daytime with ECG and blood pressure (Portapres). The bicycle ergometry showed a significant reduction of the diastolic blood pressure at a work load of 50W and 100W (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively) and a decrease of the heart rate recovery time after the stress test (p < 0.05). These results indicate a reduction of vascular resistance and sympathetic activity during daytime. The coupling analysis of the resting periods by means of symbolic coupling traces approach indicated an effect of the CPAP therapy on the baroreflex reaction in hypertensive patients where influences of the systolic blood pressure on the heart rate changed from pathological patterns to adaptive mechanisms of the normotensive patients (p < 0.05).
