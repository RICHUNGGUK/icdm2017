For this purpose, novel Log-Domain and Sinh-Domain integrators are introduced, where the realization of time-constants is achieved through a capacitor multiplication. The same concept has been followed in the case of realization of the Log-Domain and Sinh-Domain equivalents of passive elements. The performance of the derived filters has been evaluated through simulation and comparison results using the Analog Design Environment of the Cadence software and MOS transistors parameters provided by the TSMC 180 nm CMOS process. As a design example, a fourth-order bandpass filter has been realized for extracting the alpha, beta, gamma, and theta waves of an electroencephalogram.", "paper_title": "Realization of companding filters with large time-constants for biomedical applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329222700021"}
