With IaaS clouds' growing popularity, tools and technologies are emerging that can transform an organization's existing infrastructure into a private or hybrid cloud. OpenNebula is an open source, virtual infrastructure manager that deploys virtualized services on both a local pool of resources and external IaaS clouds. Haizea, a resource lease manager, can act as a scheduling back end for OpenNebula, providing features not found in other cloud software or virtualization-based data center management software.", "paper_title": "Virtual Infrastructure Management in Private and Hybrid Clouds", "paper_id": "WOS:000269716300004"}
