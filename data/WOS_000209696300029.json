This setup can be used to investigate practical issues which are not usually addressed in simulation models, such as imperfect channel estimation or coherency between the multiple transmitters. Our implementation is based on the use of optical delay lines to apply appropriate time shifts to the output of an electrical arbitrary waveform generator (AWG). In this paper we assess the experimental accuracy of our setup over a 4x1 MISO system using time reversal beamforming.", "paper_title": "Experimental Test-Bed for Studying Multiple Antenna Beamforming over Ultra Wideband Channels up to 12 GHz", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300029"}
