For a functional unit, its maximum allowable delay (for a target clock period) limits its smallest standby leakage current its power gating can achieve. In this paper, we point out that, in the high-level synthesis of a nonzero clock skew circuit, the resource binding (including functional units and registers) has a large impact on the maximum allowable delays of functional units; as a result, different resource binding solutions have different standby leakage currents. Based on that observation, we present the rim: work formulating the timing driven power gating in high-level synthesis. Given a target clock period and design constraints, our goal is to derive the minimum-standby-leakage-current resource binding solution. Benchmark data show that, compared with the existing design flow, our approach can greatly reduce the standby leakage current without any overhead.", "paper_title": "Resource Selection and Binding of Nonzero Clock Skew Circuits for Standby Leakage Current Minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000284740500019"}
