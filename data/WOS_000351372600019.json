One of the most attractive features of smartphones is the availability of a large number of apps for users to download and install. However, it also means hackers can easily distribute malware to smartphones, launching various attacks. This issue should be addressed by both preventive approaches and effective detection techniques. This article first discusses why smartphones are vulnerable to security attacks. Then it presents malicious behavior and threats of malware. Next, it reviews the existing malware prevention and detection techniques. Besides more research in these directions, it points out efforts from app developers, app store administrators, and users, who are also required to defend against such malware.", "paper_title": "MOBILE APPLICATION SECURITY: MALWARE THREATS AND DEFENSES", "paper_id": "WOS:000351372600019"}
