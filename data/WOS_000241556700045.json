This paper presents a motion-compensated imaging approach with COMB tagging for valve imaging. It involves an automatic method for tracking the full 3D motion of the valve plane so as to provide a motion-tracked acquisition scheme. Super-resolution enhancement is then applied to the slice-select direction so that the partial volume effect is minimised. In vivo results have shown that in terms of slice positioning, the method has equivalent accuracy to that of a manual approach whilst being quicker and more consistent. The use of multiple parallel COMB tags will permit adaptive imaging that follows tissue motion. This will have significant implications for quantification of myocardial perfusion and tracking anatomy, functions that are traditionally difficult in MRI.", "paper_title": "Motion-compensated MR valve imaging with COMB tag tracking and super-resolution enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700045"}
