In this paper, an ant colony optimization (ACO) approach is proposed for the team orienteering problem. Four methods, i.e., the sequential, deterministic-concurrent and random-concurrent and simultaneous methods, are proposed to construct candidate solutions in the framework of ACO. We compare these methods according to the results obtained on well-known problems from the literature. Finally, we compare the algorithm with several existing algorithms. The results show that our algorithm is promising. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Ants can solve the team orienteering problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000254157500023"}
