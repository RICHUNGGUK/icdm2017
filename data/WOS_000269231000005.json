A successful grid resource allocation depends, among other things, on the quality of the available information about software artifacts and grid resources. In this article, we propose a semantic approach to integrate selection of equivalent resources and selection of equivalent software artifacts to improve the scheduling of resources suitable for a given set of application execution requirements. We also describe a prototype implementation of our approach based on the Integrade grid middleware and experimental results that illustrate its benefits.
