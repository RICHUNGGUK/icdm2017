Although the importance of these linkages has been described in conceptual literature, it has not been widely demonstrated empirically. The survey research was carried out in 73 medium and large-sized Slovenian manufacturing companies within the mechanical, electro-mechanical and electronic industries. The resulting data were subjected to reliability and validity analyses. Canonical correlation analysis was used to test six hypotheses. The results confirmed the need for a strategically-driven BPR approach and the positive impact of performance measurement on BPR performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
