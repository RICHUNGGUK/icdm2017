A quadratic loss function is used. We give a number of estimators (for the mean) with their loss functions admitting expansions to the order of p(-1/2) as p -> infinity. These estimators contain Stein's [Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal population, in Proceedings of the Third Berkeley Symposium in Mathematical Statistics and Probability, Vol. 1, J. Neyman, ed., University of California Press, Berkeley, 1956, pp. 197-206] estimate as a particular case and also contain 'multiple shrinkage' estimates improving on Stein's estimate. Finally, we perform a simulation study to compare the different estimates.", "paper_title": "Asymptotically optimal shrinkage estimates for non-normal data", "paper_id": "WOS:000299727100017"}
