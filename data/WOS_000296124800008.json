In this paper, we study the indirect derivation of these metrics' values for users that do not know each other, but are connected through the network. In particular, we study bilattice-based aggregation approaches and investigate how they can be improved by using ordered weighted averaging techniques, or through the incorporation of knowledge defects. Experiments on a real world data set from CouchSurfing.org demonstrate that the best operators from a theoretical perspective are not always the most suitable ones in practice, and that the sophisticated aggregation methods can outperform the more obvious bilattice-based approaches.
