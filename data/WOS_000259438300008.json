The method of configuration is one of important ways to realize quickly product customization. But, in business, particularly through the Internet, a customer normally develops in his mind some sort of ambiguity, given the choice of similar alternative products. This paper proposes a new approach to product configuration by applying the theory of fuzzy multiple attribute decision making (FMADM), which focus on uncertain and fuzzy requirements the customer submits to the product supplier. The proposed method can be used either in the product data management system or e-commerce websites, with which it is easy for customers to get his preferred product according to the utility value with respect to all attributes. Finally, the digital camera is taken as an example to further verify the validity and the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Applying fuzzy multiple attributes decision making for product configuration", "paper_id": "WOS:000259438300008"}
