The improvements are made by applying Taylor series approximations to the exponential and logarithmic functions in the VAD algorithm based on an in-depth analysis of the algorithm. Experiments performed on a smart-phone as well as on a desktop computer with various background noises confirm the effectiveness of the proposed technique.", "paper_title": "Efficient Implementation of Statistical Model-Based Voice Activity Detection Using Taylor Series Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332591300020"}
