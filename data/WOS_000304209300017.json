Major product features extracted from consumer reviews may let product providers find what features are mostly cared by consumers, and also may help potential consumers to make purchasing decisions. In this work, we propose a linear regression with rules-based approach to ranking product features according to their importance. Empirical experiments show our approach is effective and promising. We also demonstrate two applications using our proposed approach. The first application decomposes overall ratings of products into product feature ratings. And the second application seeks to generate consumer surveys automatically.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Consumer Reviews for Product Feature Ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000304209300017"}
