In modern microfluidic technology, reducing the number of independent control pins that reflects most of the fabrication cost, power consumption, and reliability of a microfluidic system, is a key challenge for every digital microfluidic biochip design. However, all the previous chip designs sacrifice the optimality of the problem, and only limited reduction on the number of control pins is observed. Moreover, most existing designs cannot satisfy high-throughput demand for bioassays, and thus inapplicable in practical contexts. In this paper, we propose the first optimal pin-count design scheme for digital microfluidic biochips. By integrating a very simple combinational logic circuit into the original chip, the proposed scheme can provide high-throughput for bioassays with an information-theoretic minimum number of control pins. Furthermore, to cope with the rapid growth of the chip's scale, we also propose a scalable and efficient heuristics to reduce the number of control pins. A logic optimization technique, which can be used to reduce the complexity of the integrated combinational logic circuit, is also presented in this paper. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme can obtain much fewer number of control pins compared with the previous state-of-the-art works.", "paper_title": "An Optimal Pin-Count Design With Logic Optimization for Digital Microfluidic Biochips", "paper_id": "WOS:000351765000012"}
