Ag2F3 is predicted to crystallize in three equally stable NaCuF3-, KAgF3-, or CuTeO3-type structures, while Ag3F4 should be isostructural to Na2CuF4. The calculated vibration-corrected energies of formation at 0 K of Ag2F3 and Ag3F4 (in their most stable polytypes) from binary fluorides are negative but small (respectively, -0.09 eV and -0.21 eV per formula unit). Formation of Ag3F5 (which, in fact, is a mixed valence Ag(I)/Ag(III) salt) from binary fluorides is much less likely, since the energy of formation is quite positive of about a quarter eV. The predicted volumes per formula unit for all forms of Ag2F3 are larger and that for K2CuF4-type Ag3F4 is smaller than the sum of volumes of the corresponding binary fluorides; Ag2F3 should not form at high pressure conditions due to a decomposition to the binary constituents. Ag2F3 and Ag3F4 should exhibit genuine mixed- and not intermediate-valence with quite different coordination spheres of Ag(I) and Ag(II). Nevertheless, they should not be electric insulators. Ag2F3 is predicted to be a metallic ferrimagnet with a magnetic superexchange coupling constant, J, of -2 meV while Ag3F4 should be a metallic ferromagnet with J of +52 meV. Since Ag2F3 and Ag3F4 are at the verge of thermodynamic stability, a handful of exothermic reactions have been proposed which could yield these as yet unknown compounds.", "paper_title": "On possible existence of pseudobinary mixed valence fluorides of Ag(I)/Ag(II): a DFT study", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900014"}
