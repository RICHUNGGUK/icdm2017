This goal can be achieved by using model-based inference. In this sense, random regression coefficient models provide a flexible way of modelling the relationship between the target and the auxiliary variables. Because of this, empirical best linear unbiased predictor (EBLUP) estimates based on these models are introduced. A closed-formula procedure to estimate the mean-squared error of the EBLUP estimators is also given and empirically studied. Results of several simulation studies are reported as well as an application to the estimation of household normalized net annual incomes in the Spanish Living Conditions Survey.", "paper_title": "Small area estimation under random regression coefficient models", "paper_id": "WOS:000325451100011"}
