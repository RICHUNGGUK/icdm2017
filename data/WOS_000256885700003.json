While other methods either modify existing wavelets or introduce new ones to handle the lack of shift-invariance, we derive the explicit relationships between the coefficients of the shifted signal and those of the unshifted one. We then establish their computational complexity, and compare and demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach against classical interpolation tools in terms of accumulation of errors under successive shifting.", "paper_title": "Phase-shifting for nonseparable 2-d Haar wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000256885700003"}
