Inspired by the fact that small high-contrast patches from natural images in gray-scale accumulate with high density around a surface with the topology of a Klein bottle (Carlsson et al. International Journal of Computer Vision 76(1):1-12, 2008), we present in this paper a novel framework for the estimation and representation of distributions around , of patches from texture images. More specifically, we show that most patches from a given image can be projected onto yielding a finite sample , whose underlying probability density function can be represented in terms of Fourier-like coefficients, which in turn, can be estimated from . We show that image rotation acts as a linear transformation at the level of the estimated coefficients, and use this to define a multi-scale rotation-invariant descriptor. We test it by classifying the materials in three popular data sets: The CUReT, UIUCTex and KTH-TIPS texture databases.", "paper_title": "A Klein-Bottle-Based Dictionary for Texture Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000331640500005"}
