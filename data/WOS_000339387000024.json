We consider in this paper the non-stationary signal models and derive conditions for energy efficient watermarking under random vector model without wide sense stationary (WSS) assumption. We find that the covariance matrix of the energy efficient watermark should be proportional to the host covariance matrix to best resist the optimal linear removal attacks. For WSS process model, our result reduces to the well-known power spectrum condition. Intuitive geometric interpretations of the results in Hilbert space of random vectors are discussed, which also provides us simpler proof of the main results. Practical implementation of the covariance matrix shaped watermark for speech signal using linear prediction analysis (LPA) and image signal using eigen-value decomposition (EVD) are also presented and tested, showing improved performance as compared to lowpass and Su's global watermark.", "paper_title": "Condition for energy efficient watermarking without WSS assumption", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000024"}
