A previously derived computational model of seizure generation describing collective degrees of freedom and featuring bistable dynamics is used. A novel technique for real-time control of epileptogenicity is introduced. The reactive control reduces practically all seizures in the model. The study indicates which parameters provide the maximal seizure reduction with minimal intervention. An adaptive scheme is proposed that optimizes the stimulation parameters in nonstationary situations.", "paper_title": "REACTIVE CONTROL OF EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES IN REALISTIC COMPUTATIONAL NEURONAL MODELS WITH BISTABILITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000316807400005"}
