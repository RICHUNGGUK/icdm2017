In practice, however, economic and technical considerations are likely to dictate a more limited and sparse deployment of wavelength converters in the optical network. Therefore, we present a novel scheme for OBS networks, called logical cascaded private subnet (LCPN) with start wavelength assignment policy. We define the concept of canoe relative to cluster in self-similar traffic, and introduce a new device named payload segregator at the edge node as a gateway to the core node in OBS Networks. According to the changes in the edge node framework, we put forward the concept of cluster private subnet and canoe private subnet in the core node correspondingly. A new start wavelength assignment policy is proposed for the absence of (full) wavelength conversion capabilities in the core node of OBS Networks. The performance study indicates that, our new scheme is robust under self-similar traffic and wavelength continuity constraint.", "paper_title": "A novel optical burst switching scheme - logical cascaded private subnet with start wavelength assignment policy", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902400002"}
