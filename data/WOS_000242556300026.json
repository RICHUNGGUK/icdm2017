The proposed VNPSO method is used for solving the multi-objective Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problems (FJSP). The details of implementation for the multi-objective FJSP and the corresponding computational experiments are reported. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm is an efficient approach for the multi-objective FJSP, especially for large scale problems.", "paper_title": "Variable neighborhood particle swarm optimization for multi-objective flexible job-shop scheduling problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300026"}
