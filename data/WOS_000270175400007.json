The data are assumed to be collected using the Pairwise Comparisons paradigm. The concept of a partially ordered approximation of an arbitrary binary relation is formally defined and some solutions are proposed. The problem of testing and the importance of indifference and the power of weak order extensions are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Pairwise Comparisons Based Non-Numerical Ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000270175400007"}
