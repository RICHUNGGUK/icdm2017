This article reports on a study that confirms these observations and explores the nature of their direct and indirect influences on project performance. Data from a sample of software development professionals confirms that behavioral controls and learning directly influence project performance, while outcome controls contribute only indirectly through their impact on learning.", "paper_title": "The relationship of control and learning to project performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000235611100004"}
