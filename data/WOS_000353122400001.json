However, due to the incompatibility with knowledge structure of the learning systems and real-time exploratory nature of reinforcement learning (RL), domain knowledge cannot be inserted directly. In this paper, we show how self-organizing neural networks designed for online and incremental adaptation can integrate domain knowledge and RL. Specifically, symbol-based domain knowledge is translated into numeric patterns before inserting into the self-organizing neural networks. To ensure effective use of domain knowledge, we present an analysis of how the inserted knowledge is used by the self-organizing neural networks during RL. To this end, we propose a vigilance adaptation and greedy exploitation strategy to maximize exploitation of the inserted domain knowledge while retaining the plasticity of learning and using new knowledge. Our experimental results based on the pursuit-evasion and minefield navigation problem domains show that such self-organizing neural network can make effective use of domain knowledge to improve learning efficiency and reduce model complexity.", "paper_title": "Self-Organizing Neural Networks Integrating Domain Knowledge and Reinforcement Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000353122400001"}
