Effectiveness is concerned with producing a synthesis of the published knowledge. A systematic approach to reviewing is at best a partial approach to efficiency because the foundations of the academic publishing system are rigidly locked into old technology. An outline for redesigning academic publishing to jump literature reviewing efficiency to a new level and enhance the productivity of many other aspects of scholarship is proposed.", "paper_title": "Beyond being systematic in literature reviews in IS", "paper_id": "WOS:000355369800009"}
