This is mainly due to the poor capture and characterisation of facial data that compromises their spatial and temporal precision. For emerging applications it is not only necessary to have a high level of precision for the representation of facial data, but also to characterise dynamic faces as naturally as possible and in a timely manner. This study proposes a new framework for capturing and recovering dynamic facial information in real-time at significantly high order of spatial and temporal accuracy to capture and model subtle facial changes for enhanced realism in 3D face visualisation and higher precision for face recognition applications. We also present a novel, fast, and robust correspondence mapping approach for 3D registration of moving 3D faces. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
