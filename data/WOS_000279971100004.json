BSL and SST variants and the k - root kL two-equation model. The results are obtained at several Reynolds numbers ranging from 10(7) to 2.5 x 10(9). Sets of nine geometrically similar Cartesian grids are adopted to demonstrate that the numerical uncertainty of the finest grid predictions is negligible. The profiles obtained numerically have relevance for the application of so-called 'wall function' boundary conditions. Such wall functions refer to assumptions about the flow in the viscous sublayer and the 'log law' region. It turns out that these assumptions are not always satisfied by our results, which are obtained by computing the flow with full near-wall resolution. In particular, the solution in the 'log-law' region is dependent on the turbulence model and on the Reynolds number, which is a disconcerting result for those who apply wall functions.
