The purpose of this paper is to examine the application of AI in the telecommunications industry sector. Our research finds that AI's first main application in telecommunications is in the network management area. Expert systems and machine learning are the two AI techniques that have been widely used in telecommunications, while machine learning and distributed artificial intelligence are the two AI techniques which are most promising for the future. The research also finds that different AI techniques have their unique applications in the telecommunications industry.", "paper_title": "Artificial intelligence applications in the telecommunications industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000248961000005"}
