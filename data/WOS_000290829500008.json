Both vowel consonant vowel (VCV) and consonant vowel (CV) stimuli were created. A total of 320 natural-sounding acoustic speech stimuli were created, comprising 16 stimulus series. A behavioral experiment demonstrated that the stimuli varied perceptually from /b/ to /d/ to /g/, and provided useful reference data for the ambiguity of each token. Acoustic analyses indicated that the stimuli compared favorably to standard characteristics of naturally-produced consonants, and that the LPC morphing procedure successfully modulated multiple acoustic parameters associated with place of articulation.
