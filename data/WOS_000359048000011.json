Design/methodology/approach - First, an efficient strategy based on graph theory is proposed to construct the edge system. Second, the stress is smoothed in global coordinate system based on edge instead of strain, which makes the theory of EST more rigorous and can be easily extended to the situation of multi elements sharing the same edge. Third, the singular degree of freedoms (DOFs) of the nodes linked by edges are restrained in edge local coordinate system, which makes the global stiffness matrix non-singular and can be decomposed successfully. Findings - First, an efficient edge constructing strategy can make EST element more standout. Second, some modifications should be made to EST element to extend it to the situation with multi elements sharing the same edge, so that EST element can deal with the geometrical models with this kind of features. Third, the way to restrain the singular DOFs of EST element must be different from normal isoparametric triangle element, because the stiffness matrix of the smoothing domain is not computed in local coordinate system. Originality/value - The modified EST element performs stably in engineering analysis including large scale problems and the situation with multi elements sharing the same edge, and the efficiency of edge system constructing is no longer the bottleneck.", "paper_title": "Some modifications for ES-FEM and its application for vehicle design", "paper_id": "WOS:000359048000011"}
