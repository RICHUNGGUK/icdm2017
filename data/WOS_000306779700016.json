However, the alleviation of server load may not be very effective in the multi-channel P2P VoD systems due to the intra-channel and inter-channel upload bandwidth imbalances. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of these bandwidth imbalances on the systems performances through two analytically models: a queuing network which describes the whole system, and a stage-based model which describes a single channel. Our models capture several aspects of peer behavior, such as participating in the system, sojourning in a channel, downloading and uploading the content, wandering around channels and leaving the system. We apply our models to three potential P2P VoD designs: Naive bandwidth Allocation Design (NAD). Independent-channel Chunk-aware bandwidth Allocation design (ICA) and Cross-channel Chunk-aware bandwidth Allocation design (CCA). By developing an asymptotic theory to provide theoretical results, we analytically show that ICA can perform better than NAD, and CCA can perform best of the three designs in terms of server load. We also present optimization problems and simple heuristic strategies for ICA and CCA. Our analytical results are validated by extensive simulations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
