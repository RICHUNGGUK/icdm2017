Three applications of the (RRBF)-R-2 network on the prediction values confirmed that the proposed architecture minimizes the prediction error. The proposed (RRBF)-R-2 is excited by the recurrence of the output looped neurons on the input layer which produces a dynamic memory on both the input and output layers. Given the learning complexity of neural networks with the use of the back-propagation training method, a simple architecture is proposed consisting of two simple Recurrent Radial Basis Function networks (RRBF). Each RRBF only has the input layer with looped neurons using the sigmoid activation function. The output of the first RRBF also presents an additional input for the second RRBF. An unsupervised learning algorithm is proposed to determine the parameters of the Radial Basis Function (RBF) nodes. The K-means unsupervised learning algorithm used for the hidden layer is enhanced by the initialization of these input parameters by the output parameters of the RCE algorithm.", "paper_title": "A NEW RBF NEURAL NETWORK FOR PREDICTION IN INDUSTRIAL CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000311164200004"}
