Especially, N-Shift Regional Zero Correlation (NS-RZC) sequences have the zero values in N-shift positions. In this letter, the generation algorithm of N-shift RLC/FaC sequences derived from Three Low Correlation Zones (T-LCZ) sequence set and Three Zero Correlation Zones (T-ZCZ) sequence set is proposed. In order to highlight the relationship between these sequences, the corresponding theoretical bound is calculated and analyzed.", "paper_title": "N-Shift Regional Low/Zero Correlation Sequence Generation Based on T-LCZ/ZCZ Sequence Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567100010"}
