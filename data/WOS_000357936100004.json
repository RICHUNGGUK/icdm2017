Extensive simulation results show that the new method is very effective in correcting the bias of the MLE, regardless of censoring mechanism, sample size, censoring proportion and number of populations involved. The method can be extended to more complicated Weibull models.", "paper_title": "Bias-correction for Weibull common shape estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000357936100004"}
