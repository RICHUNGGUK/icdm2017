When the same term refers to different things, the dominant sense is preferred in the rankings of search results. In this paper, we propose a novel two-box technique in the context of Web search that utilizes contextual terms provided by users for query disambiguation, making it possible to prefer other senses without altering the original query. A prototype system, Bobo, has been implemented. In Bobo, contextual terms are used to capture domain knowledge from users, help estimate relevance of search results, and route them towards a user-intended domain. A vast advantage of Bobo is that a wide range of domain knowledge can be effectively utilized, where helpful contextual terms do not even need to co-occur with query terms on any page. We have extensively evaluated the performance of Bobo on benchmark datasets that demonstrates the utility and effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "A novel two-box search paradigm for query disambiguation", "paper_id": "WOS:000313063900001"}
