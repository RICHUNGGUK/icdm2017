With complicated arguments, the W-1,W-1-seminorm estimate for partial derivative(Z,l)G(Z)* is then derived. Finally, applying the triangle inequality and the error estimate of the finite element approximation results in the W-1,W-1-seminorm estimate with order O(vertical bar In h vertical bar(G/4)) for partial derivative(Z,l)G(Z)(h).", "paper_title": "An Estimate for the Discrete Derivative Green's Function for the 4D Variable Coefficient Elliptic Equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000300529400013"}
