Some examples of measures of specificity for interval-valued fuzzy sets are showed. It is also defined a extension of the notion of alpha cut for interval-valued fuzzy sets and a generalized similarity for interval-valued fuzzy relations. An axiomatic definition of specificity of interval-valued fuzzy sets under the knowledge of a generalized similarity is given.", "paper_title": "Specificity for interval-valued fuzzy sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000304476000005"}
