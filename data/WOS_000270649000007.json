We show that the scheme converges and the subdivision curve is continuous. Moreover, starting with the chord length parametrization of the initial polygon, we obtain a subdivision curve parametrized by a multiple of the arc-length. The proposed method focuses on convexity preservation, limiting the oscillations of the subdivision curve and avoiding artifacts. A bound for the Hausdorff distance between the limit curve and the initial polygon is also obtained.", "paper_title": "Curve subdivision with arc-length control", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649000007"}
