The linear systems for determining coefficients of RBF may be ill-conditioned when processing a large point set, which leads to unstable numerical results. We introduce a quasi-interpolation framework based on compactly supported RBF to solve this problem. In this framework, implicit surfaces can be reconstructed without solving a large linear system. With the help of an adaptive space partitioning technique, our approach is robust and can successfully reconstruct surfaces on non-uniform and noisy point sets. Moreover, as the computation of quasi-interpolation is localized, it can be easily parallelized on multi-core CPUs. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
