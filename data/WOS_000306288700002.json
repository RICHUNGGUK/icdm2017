In designing and developing human identification with prior information a new approach that is robust to illumination and distance variations in the indoor environment is proposed. In addition, a substantial exploration method with an octree structure, suitable for path planning in an office configuration, is employed. All these functionalities are integrated in a message- and component-based architecture for the efficient integration and control of the system. This approach is demonstrated by succeeding human search in the challenging robot mission of the 2009 Robot Grand Challenge Contest.", "paper_title": "Proactive Human Search for the Designated Person with Prior Context Information in an Undiscovered Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000306288700002"}
