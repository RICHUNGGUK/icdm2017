In the Interval type-2 fuzzy context, the aim of this paper is to develop an interactive signed distance-based simple additive weighting (SAW) method for solving multiple criteria group decision-making problems with linguistic ratings and incomplete preference information. This paper first formulates a group decision-making problem with uncertain linguistic variables and their transformation to interval type-2 trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Concerning the relative importance of multiple decision-makers and group consensus of fuzzy opinions, a procedure using hybrid averages is then employed to construct a collective decision matrix. By an appropriate extension of the classical SAW approach, this paper utilizes the concept of signed distances and establishes an integrated programming model to manage multi-criteria group decisions under the incomplete and inconsistent preference structure. Further, an interactive procedure is established for group decision making. Finally, the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methods are illustrated by a collaborative decision-making problem of patient-centered care (PCC).", "paper_title": "An Interactive Signed Distance Approach for Multiple Criteria Group Decision-Making Based on Simple Additive Weighting Method with Incomplete Preference Information Defined by Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000341843900006"}
