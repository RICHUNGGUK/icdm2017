However, it is hard to design the optimized dynamic access structures because it is static access structures and properties of Attribute-Based Encryption. In this paper, we propose the attribute-based encryption using the algorithm of context-based service inference model to collect the attributes by data and to provide appropriate services by recognizing the situation. Especially it is analyzed that the students' answering process is sectionalized to several scenarios according to teachers' educational objective and plan in educational environment. And through the process it is described that the application of security policy and technology must be distinguished by tables.", "paper_title": "Extraction Security Indexing Value to use Story-Telling and Attribute-Based Encryption Scheme considering on Big Data Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000369378600025"}
