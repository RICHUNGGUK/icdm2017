In this paper, we first introduce the novel notion of generalized cointraces, extensions of comtraces that can additionally model the \"non-simultaneously\" relationship. Then we study some basic algebraic properties and canonical representations of comtraces and generalized comtraces. Finally we analyze the relationship between generalized comtraces and generalized stratified order structures. The major technical contribution of this paper is a proof showing that generalized comtraces can be represented by generalized stratified order structures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
