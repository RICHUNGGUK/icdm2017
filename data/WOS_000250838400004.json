This may not be true in some application. This paper considers semi-online problems on identical machines with inexact partial information. Three problems are considered, where we know in advance that the optimal value, or the largest job size are in given intervals, respectively, while their exact values are unknown. We give both lower bounds of the problems and competitive ratios of algorithms as functions of a so-called disturbance parameter r is an element of [1, infinity). We establish for which r the inexact partial information is useful to improve the performance of a semi-online algorithm with respect to its pure online problem. Optimal preemptive semi-online algorithms are then obtained.", "paper_title": "Optimal semi-online algorithms for preemptive scheduling problems with inexact partial information", "paper_id": "WOS:000250838400004"}
