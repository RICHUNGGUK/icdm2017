In this paper, we proposed an approach which can deal with the daily dependence and personal dependence in the data of multiple subjects and samples. 30 features were extracted from the physiological signals of subject for three states of emotion. The physiological signals measured were: electrocardiogram (ECG), skin temperature (SKT) and galvanic skin response (GSR). After removing the daily dependence and personal dependence by the statistical technique of MANOVA, six machine learning methods including Bayesian network learning, naive Bayesian classification, SVM, decision tree of C4.5, Logistic model and K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) were implemented to differentiate the emotional states. The results showed that Logistic model gives the best classification accuracy and the statistical technique of MANOVA can significantly improve the performance of all six machine learning methods in emotion recognition system.", "paper_title": "STATISTICAL PREDICTION OF EMOTIONAL STATES BY PHYSIOLOGICAL SIGNALS WITH MANOVA AND MACHINE LEARNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000309922300003"}
