We compare two types of pseudozero sets: the complex and the real pseudozero sets. These sets differ with respect to the type of perturbations. The first set-complex perturbations of a complex polynomial-has been intensively studied while the second one-real perturbations of a real polynomial-seems to have received little attention. We present a computable formula for the real pseudozero set and a comparison between these two pseudozero sets. We conclude that the complex pseudozero sets have to be preferred except when the perturbed real polynomials admit non-real zeros. We also give some applications of pseudozero set in control theory.", "paper_title": "Real and complex pseudozero sets for polynomials with applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000247202900004"}
