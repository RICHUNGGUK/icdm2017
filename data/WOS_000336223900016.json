The primary objective of this step is to cluster machines into machine cells and parts into part families so that the minimum of intercell trips will be achieved. This paper will be focused on the configuration of machine cells considering three types of initial machine-part matrix: binary (zero-one) matrix, production volume matrix, and operation time matrix. The similarity measure uses only information from these types of matrix. A pure combinatorial programming formulation will be developed to maximize the sum of similarity coefficients between machine/part pairs. An e-Learning tool/application to help industrial students and engineers for enhancing their cell formation capability is proposed. This tool is designed to include a novel similarity coefficient-based heuristic algorithm for solving the cell formation problem. To determine the performance of the proposed tool, comparison is made with a well-known tool along a case study.", "paper_title": "An e-Learning tool considering similarity measures for manufacturing cell formation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336223900016"}
