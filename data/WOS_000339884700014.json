For a class of the dynamic NEPSC, we propose a differential variational inequality formulation. Using this formulation, we show the existence of solutions of the dynamic NEPSC, and develop a regularized smoothing method to find a solution of it. We prove that the regularized smoothing method converges to the least norm solution of the differential variational inequality, which is a solution of the dynamic NEPSC as the regularization parameter and smoothing parameter go to zero with the order . Numerical examples are given to illustrate the existence and convergence results.", "paper_title": "Differential variational inequality approach to dynamic games with shared constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000339884700014"}
