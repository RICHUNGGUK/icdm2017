Sufficient conditions in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and linear matrix equalities (LMEs) are presented for the existence of a static output feedback controller, that makes the resulting closed-loop system quadratically strict positive real and minimizes the upper bound for a given cost function. A numerical example is included to illustrate effectiveness of the theoretic results obtained.", "paper_title": "Guaranteed cost and positive real control of uncertain systems via static output feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000256710400003"}
