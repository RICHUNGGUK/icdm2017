Routers use distance insensitive switching, e.g., wormhole. A OAB proceeds in rounds that consist of message passing between pairs of nodes using disjoint paths. Routers also have all-output-port functionality, i.e., they can send a packet via all output ports simultaneously. In CCCn, this assumption implies that the lower bound on the number rounds of the OAB is log(4) (\\V(CCCn)\\). The main result of this paper is an algorithm for the OAB in CCCn whose number of rounds is greater than the lower bound by at most 1 for all n < 123. The algorithm is depth-contention-free and therefore, it works correctly even if nodes participating in the broadcast run asynchronously. We also show how to make the algorithm deadlock-free.
