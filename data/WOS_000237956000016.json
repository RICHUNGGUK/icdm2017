A solution is to split a large design in different clock regions and introduce intentional clock skews between them, while taking the timing constraints into account. In this paper, the authors present a complete design flow to optimize the clock tree for less substrate-noise generation in large digital systems. It proposes a technique to assign combinatorial cells and flip-flops to the clock regions. It also takes into account the impact of unintentional clock skew such as jitter on the computed skews in order to assure a robust design. During the optimization, it uses compressed supply-current profiles to improve the CPU time. Experimental results show more than a factor-of-2 reduction in substrate-noise generation from large digital circuits of which the skews are optimized.", "paper_title": "Clock-skew-Optimization methodology for substrate-noise reduction with supply-current folding", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000016"}
