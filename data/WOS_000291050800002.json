The Resource Space is a semantic coordinate system that can support SQL-like multi-dimensional range queries, but lack automatic construction mechanism and the efficient search algorithm for query routing in the dynamic and decentralized environment. This paper first partitions a centralized Resource Space into a number of decentralized sub-spaces based on the classification semantics and dimension locality of RSM, and then deploys these sub-spaces onto a ring-structured P2P topology HRing that is able to totally preserve the classification semantics and dimension locality of RSM. After that, we build the routing tables, define the dynamic resource operations and propose an efficient routing algorithm for multi-dimensional range queries on the decentralized P2P Resource Space. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the construction and maintenance cost, as well as the search performance can reach logarithmic scale. Thus, the decentralized P2P Resource Space can be applied on dynamic and large-scale resource-sharing systems.
