The -consensus protocol is an average consensus protocol where agents exchange the information with their neighbours at some discontinuous moments. We provide convergence analysis for such consensus algorithm under stochastic switching communication graphs, and then present some generic criteria for solving the average consensus problem. We also show that directed delayed networks of dynamic agents can achieve average consensus even when each agent in the networks intermittently exchanges the information with its neighbours only at some discrete moments. Subsequently, a typical numerical example illustrates and visualises the effectiveness and feasibility of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Distributed -consensus in directed delayed networks of multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000315656100011"}
