The distribution of the estimator of the process capability index C-pmk is very complicated and the asymptotic distribution is proposed by Chen and Hsu [The asymptotic distribution of the processes capability index C-pmk, Comm. Statist. Theory Methods 24(5) (1995), pp. 1279-1291]. However, we found a critical error for the asymptotic distribution when the population mean is not equal to the midpoint of the specification limits. In this paper, a correct version of the asymptotic distribution is given. An asymptotic confidence interval Of C-pmk by using the correct version of asymptotic distribution is proposed and the lower bound can be used to test if the process is capable. A simulation study of the coverage probability of the proposed confidence interval is shown to be satisfactory. The relation of six sigma technique and the index C-pmk is also discussed in this paper. An asymptotic testing procedure to determine if a process is capable based on the index Of C-pmk is also given in this paper.", "paper_title": "A note on the asymptotic distribution of the process capability index C-pmk", "paper_id": "WOS:000273913800017"}
