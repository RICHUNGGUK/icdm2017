Approximation spaces considered in the context of rough sets were introduced by Zdzislaw Pawlak more than two decades ago. In general, a calculus of approximation spaces is a system for combining, describing, measuring, reasoning about, and performing operations on approximation spaces. An approach to achieving a calculus of approximation spaces that provides a basis for approximating reasoning in distributed systems of cooperating agents is considered in this paper. Examples of basic concepts are given throughout this paper to illustrate how approximation spaces can be beneficially used in many settings, in particular for complex concept approximation. The contribution of this paper is the presentation of a framework for calculi of approximation spaces useful for approximate reasoning by cooperating agents.", "paper_title": "Calculi of approximation spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000240603000027"}
