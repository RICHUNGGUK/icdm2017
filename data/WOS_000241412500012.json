A systematic way is introduced to explore the space of possible tests to detect these faults; it is based on generating appropriate sensitizing address transitions and the corresponding sensitizing operation sequences. DFT features are given to facilitate the BIST implementation of the new tests.", "paper_title": "Opens and delay faults in CMOS RAM address decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000241412500012"}
