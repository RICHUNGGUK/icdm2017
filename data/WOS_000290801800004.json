In this paper, we present a novel and holistic data broadcast management approach in 4 G wireless networks with multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) antennae. The proposed scheme consists of three elements, namely: (i) broadcast ordering; (ii) Global indexing; and (iii) merging data structure. With the integration of these elements, we expect to obtain substantial efficiency for mobile computing clients when retrieving data on-air. We have experimentally evaluated the performance of the proposed model including comparison with the relevant schemes. The results from the experiments affirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach in respect to minimizing query access time and conserving energy utilization of the clients.", "paper_title": "Mobile broadcast services with MIMO antennae in 4G wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290801800004"}
