As being failed to effectively evaluate, monitor, and control the business processes, paradigms of BPM have evolved continuously with changes in information technology (IT), and vice versa. BPM should be implemented based on a synthesis of suitable technology and techniques, which support the integration of business processes. Accordingly, a method is required to carefully select the business processes that will be tackled first in a BPM project. However, an in-depth analysis of criteria for selecting processes to improve has not been done before. In this study, an integrated method for business process improvement, which includes the evaluation criteria of business processes to improve, the decision framework for business process selection, and the four types of business process improvement strategies, is developed. Finally, we apply a method to a BPMS planning project in a Korean government agency in South Korea, to show this method's practical utility.", "paper_title": "AN INTEGRATED METHOD FOR BUSINESS PROCESS IMPROVEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700021"}
