For the Chi-square test of the equality of multinomial populations a very simple method is proposed for calculating the sample size to satisfy specified significance level and power. This method is especially understandable and does not require software nor the non-central Chi--square tables. Simulations are used to verify the accuracy of the new method. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
