It is different from the previous nearest neighbor rule (NNR), this new rule utilizes the distance weighted local learning in each class to get a new nearest neighbor of the unlabeled pattern-pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN), and then assigns the label associated with the PNN for the unlabeled pattern using the NNR. The proposed PNNR is compared with the k-NNR, distance weighted k-NNR, and the local mean-based nonparametric classification [Mitani, Y., & Hamamoto, Y. (2006). A local mean-based nonparametric classifier. Pattern Recognition Letters, 27, 1151-1159] in terms of the classification accuracy oil the unknown patterns. Experimental results confirm the validity of this new classification rule even in practical situations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
