Having real-time access to traceability information allows its exploitation, which is the aim of this work. In this paper, the problem of minimizing the cost of products recall is treated. First the raw material dispersion problem is analyzed, in order to determine a risk-level criterion or \"production criticality\". This criterion is used subsequently to optimize deliveries dispatch with the purpose of minimizing the number of batch recalls in case of crisis. This is achieved by implementing decision-making aid tools based on operational research and artificial intelligence. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
