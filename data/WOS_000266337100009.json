However, unlike the case of k-wise independent functions, the size of previously constructed families of such permutations is far from optimal. This paper gives a new method for reducing the size of families given by previous constructions. Our method relies on pseudorandom generators for space-bounded computations. In fact, all we need is a generator, that produces \"pseudorandom walks\" on undirected graphs with a consistent labelling. One such generator is implied by Reingold's log-space algorithm for undirected connectivity (Reingold/Reingold et al. in Proc. of the 37th/38th Annual Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 376-385/457-466, 2005/2006). We obtain families of k-wise almost independent permutations, with an optimal description length, up to a constant factor. More precisely, if the distance from uniform for any k tuple should be at most delta, then the size of the description of a permutation in the family is O(kn + log 1/delta).", "paper_title": "Derandomized Constructions of k-Wise (Almost) Independent Permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000266337100009"}
