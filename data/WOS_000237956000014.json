The circuit is first divided into layers with a limited number of interlayer vias, and then placed on individual layers, while minimizing the delay of critical paths. We use our tool as a platform to explore the potential benefits, in terms-of delay and wire length (WL), that 3-D technologies can offer for FPGA fabrics. Experimental results show, on average, a total decrease of 25% in WL and 35% in delay can be achieved over traditional two-dimensional chips, when ten layers are used in 3-D integration.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional place and route for FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000014"}
