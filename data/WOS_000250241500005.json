This is the generalization of common knowledge that removing up/downsampling will not lose perfect reconstruction. The results provide a simple way of building over-sampled filter banks. If the original filter banks are orthogonal, these oversampled banks construct tight frames Of l(2)(Z(n)) when iterated. As an example, a quincunx lattice is used to replace the rectangular one of the standard wavelet transform. This replacement leads to a tight frame that has a higher sampling in both time and frequency. The frame transform is nearly shift invariant and has intermediate scales. An application of the transform to image fusion is also presented.", "paper_title": "A simple method to build oversampled filter banks and tight frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000250241500005"}
