The watermark accompanied with a reference is embedded into the RGB channels of color images. By applying the embedded reference watermark, a linear discriminant matrix is obtained. The watermark can be correctly extracted under several different attacks. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has good performance against several attacks. Especially when the watermarked image is enhanced in luminance and contrast at a rate of 50%, the proposed method can extract the watermark with few bit errors. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
