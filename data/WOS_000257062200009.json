Objective function is defined on a metric space and depends on a probability measure which is unknown, but, estimated from empirical observations. We try to derive stability results without precise knowledge of problem structure and without measurability assumption. Moreover, e-optimal solutions axe considered. The setup is illustrated on consistency of a epsilon-M-estimator in linear regression model.", "paper_title": "Stability of stochastic optimization problems - Nonmeasurable case", "paper_id": "WOS:000257062200009"}
