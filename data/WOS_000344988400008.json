We demonstrate that an explicit relationship exists between the achievable timing acquisition performance and the schemes employed by a multihop aided initial synchronization procedure, which is capable of improving the cellular coverage. We conclude by discussing the relationships between the factors either beneficially or detrimentally affecting the achievable performance as well as providing guidelines for designing relay-aided cooperative non-coherent MIMO aided schemes.", "paper_title": "SYNCHRONIZATION ISSUES IN RELAY-AIDED COOPERATIVE MIMO NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000344988400008"}
