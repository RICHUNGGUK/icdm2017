The practical ubiquitous computing environment is world in which a variety of services based on RFID/USN devices are integrated, creating synergy effects. From perspective of the end user, there should be a middleware platform and a business logic framework that join various services together to satisfy a range of user requirements. In addition, the platform should provide the user with a description of a scenario based on various events to maximize the collaboration. In this paper, we propose a business logic framework that supports collaboration between heterogeneous service systems based on user scenarios. We also attempt to show the efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework by providing the result of several tests.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Business Logic Framework for Collaboration of Heterogeneous Service Systems in RFID/USN Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000291237900017"}
