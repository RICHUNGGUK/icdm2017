To this end, a new audio dataset organized similarly to the one used in MIREX mood task comparison was created. From the data, 253 standard and 98 melodic features are extracted and used with several supervised learning techniques. Results show that, generally, melodic features perform better than standard audio. The best result, 64% f-measure, with only 11 features (9 melodic and 2 standard), was obtained with ReliefF feature selection and Support Vector Machines.", "paper_title": "Music Emotion Recognition with Standard and Melodic Audio Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000353403900001"}
