This paper deals with the mean square bounded consensus problem of multi-agent systems with intrinsic nonlinear dynamics, where each agent is affected by stochastic noises. Considering the impact of the former behaviors of nonlinear agents, we put forward a novel type of integral distributed delay protocol which is formed as a weighted sum of historical information exchange over all time interval [t-tau,t]. Compared with the previous work, the protocol expression of this paper is more general and includes many traditional protocols as its special cases. Based on a Lyapunov-based approach, together with results from matrix theory and algebraic graph theory, sufficient conditions are derived for the mean square bounded consensus. Simulation examples with nonlinear even chaotic agents illustrate the theoretical results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
