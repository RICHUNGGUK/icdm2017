A new kernel is derived by establishing a connection with the Riemannian geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices. Different kernels are tested, in combination with support vector machines, on a past BCI competition dataset. We demonstrate that this new approach outperforms significantly state of the art results, effectively replacing the traditional spatial filtering approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
