The method extends the current practice by focusing not only on cognitive but also affective considerations that may influence e-learning usability. The method was developed according to an established methodology in HCI research and relied upon a conceptual framework that combines Web and instructional design parameters and associates them with the most prominent affective learning dimension, which is intrinsic motivation to learn. The latter is proposed as a new usability measure that is considered more appropriate to evaluate e-learning designs. Two large empirical studies were conducted in order to evaluate usability of e-learning courses offered in corporate environments. The results provide valuable evidence for reliability and validity of the method, thus providing evidence that usability practitioners can use it with confidence when evaluating the design of e-learning applications.", "paper_title": "Developing a Usability Evaluation Method for e-Learning Applications: Beyond Functional Usability", "paper_id": "WOS:000262473100004"}
