Nonlinear response of the element is obtained by integration of section response, which in turn is obtained by integration of material response. Satisfaction of transverse equilibrium equations at section includes the interaction between concrete and transverse reinforcing steel. A 3d plastic damage model is implemented to describe the hysteretic behavior of concrete. Comparisons with available experimental data on RC structural walls confirm the accuracy of proposed method.", "paper_title": "Analysis of RC walls with a mixed formulation frame finite element", "paper_id": "WOS:000328287500007"}
