An estimate (delta) over cap (u, v) of the actual distance d( u, v) between u, v is an element of V is said to be of stretch t if and only if delta(u, v) <= (delta) over cap (u, v) <= t . delta(u, v). Computing all-pairs small stretch distances efficiently ( both in terms of time and space) is a well-studied problem in graph algorithms. We present a simple, novel, and generic scheme for all-pairs approximate shortest paths. Using this scheme and some new ideas and tools, we design faster algorithms for all-pairs t-stretch distances for a whole range of stretch t, and we also answer an open question posed by Thorup and Zwick in their seminal paper [J. ACM, 52 (2005), pp. 1-24].", "paper_title": "FASTER ALGORITHMS FOR ALL-PAIRS APPROXIMATE SHORTEST PATHS IN UNDIRECTED GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280847900006"}
