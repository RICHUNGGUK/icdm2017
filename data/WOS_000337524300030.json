In this context, both OCMAS social model and the tasks that users need to accomplish can be rather complex, and thus, users may benefit from having an assistance service. Hence, we propose personal assistant agents (PA), which, based on knowledge about the OCMAS specification and current system state, provide the user with an advice (a plan) to achieve her or his goal. Additionally, we implement this service with PLAN-EA, an Extension of the A* algorithm that generates plans for a user whose actions may depend on other users' actions. Thus, PAs provide plans that do not only include assisted user actions but also other users' ones. We illustrate our approach by means of v-mWateran online water marketand make a comparative analysis, with and without assistance, where efficiencyin terms of number of user actionsshows an improvement (7 vs 10.8), efficacypercentage of completed tasksalso improves (93% vs 77%), and assistance's overall satisfaction is positive.
