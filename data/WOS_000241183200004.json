We have used the literature values of the magnetic critical exponents to observe the dynamic finite-size scaling behavior of the time evolution of the magnetization during early stages of the Monte Carlo simulation. In this way we have calculated the dynamic critical exponent Z for 2- and 3-dimensional Ising Models by using the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. We have also presented that this method opens the possibility of calculating z and x(0) separately. Our results show good agreement with the literature values. Measurements done on lattices with different sizes seem to give very good scaling. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
