We review some of them and their environmental applicability, with examples and a reference list. The techniques covered are case-based reasoning, rule-based systems, artificial neural networks, fuzzy models, genetic algorithms, cellular automata, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, reinforcement learning and hybrid systems.
