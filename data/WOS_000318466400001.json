Different from most existing view-dependent gait recognition systems, we devise a new Multiview Subspace Representation (MSR) method which considers gait sequences collected from different views of the same subject as a feature set and extracts a linear subspace to describe the feature set. Subspace-based feature representation methods measure the variances among samples, and can handle certain intra-subject variations. To better exploit the discriminative information from these subspaces for recognition, we further propose a marginal canonical correlation analysis (MCCA) method which maximizes the margins of interclass subspaces within a neighborhood. Experimental results on a widely used multiview gait database are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
