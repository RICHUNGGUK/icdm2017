Based on their compact signal and image representation ability, we apply the transform based techniques on the video recognition area to extract discriminative information from each given video sequence, and use the transformed coefficients as descriptors for representing and recognizing human actions in video sequences. We validate our proposed methods on the KTH and the Hollywood datasets, which have been extensively studied by a lot of researchers. The proposed descriptors, especially the wavelet transform based descriptor, yield promising results on action recognition. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
