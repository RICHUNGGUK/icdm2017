In this paper, we propose possibilistic description logics as an extension of description logics, which are a family of well-known ontology languages. We first give the syntax and semantics of possibilistic description logics and define several inference services in possibilistic description logics. We show that these inference serviced can be reduced to the task of computing the inconsistency degree of a knowledge base in possibilistic description logics. Since possibilistic inference services suffer from the drowning problem, that is, axioms whose confidence degrees are less than or equal to the inconsistency are not used, we consider a drowning-free variant of possibilistic inference, called linear order inference. We propose an algorithm for computing the inconsistency degree of a possibilistic description logic knowledge base and an algorithm for the linear order inference. We consider the impact of our possibilistic description logics on ontology learning and ontology merging. Finally, we implement these algorithms and provide some interesting evaluation results.
