(3) analyzing the evolution of technical trends The dataset consists of 656 papers collected From well-known conferences on ACM The experimental results indicate that our proposed methods can effectively explore interesting evolutionary technical trends in various research topics", "paper_title": "Exploring Evolutionary Technical Trends From Academic Research Papers", "paper_id": "WOS:000274348800009"}
