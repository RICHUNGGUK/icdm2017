Within a benchmarking exercise, we propose a method for selecting a preferable development path that consists of a sequence of intermediate benchmarks. First, an outranking multi-criteria approach is used to establish the hierarchical position of benchmarking units. For each unit, we evaluate possible development paths and distinguish those that are characterised by balanced improvement steps along the whole path. The proposed method can help decision makers to 1) detect disparities among benchmarking units and 2) identify intermediate benchmarks for less successful ones in each stage of their progress toward the ultimate benchmark target. The method is applied to benchmark European Union Member countries against Digital Agenda key performance targets. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
