A multitude of estimation techniques have been proposed for defect prediction. However, not all techniques are applicable in all cases. The selection of the proper approach to use depends on multiple factors: the features of the approach; the availability of resources; and the goals for using the estimated defect data. In this paper a survey of existing estimation techniques and a decision support approach for selecting the most suitable defect estimation technique for a project, with specific goals, is proposed. The results of the ranking are a clear indication that no estimation technique provides a single, comprehensive solution; the selection must be done according to a given scenario.
