Our algorithm solves the APSP problem for weighted directed graphs, with real (positive or negative) weights, up to an additive error of epsilon. For any pair of vertices u, v, the algorithm finds a path whose length is at most delta(u, v) + epsilon. The algorithm is randomized., and runs in (O) over bar (n((omega+3)/2) < O(n(2.688)) time, where n is the number of vertices and omega is the matrix multiplication exponent. The absolute weights are allowed to mildly depend upon n, being at most n(o(1)) (we note that even if the weights are constants, delta(u, v) can be linear in n, while the error requirement epsilon is a small constant independent of n). Clearly, epsilon-additive approximations generalize exact algorithms for integer weighted instances. Hence, if omega = 2 + o(1), this algorithm is as fast as any algorithm known for integer APSP in directed graphs, and is more general. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
