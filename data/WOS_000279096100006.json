We present a heuristic improvement procedure for OVRP based on Integer Linear Programming (ILP) techniques. Given an initial feasible solution to be possibly improved, the method follows a destruct-and-repair paradigm, where the given solution is randomly destroyed (i.e., customers are removed in a random way) and repaired by solving an ILP model, in the attempt of finding a new improved feasible solution. The overall procedure can be considered as a general framework which could be extended to cover other variants of Vehicle Routing Problems. We report computational results on benchmark instances from the literature. In several cases, the proposed algorithm is able to find the new best known solution for the considered instances.
