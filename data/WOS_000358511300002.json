In this paper, we address both issues with two synergistic approaches. First, we introduce a novel body-biasing technique to mitigate the performance loss at near-threshold voltages while not requiring any additional circuitry for the body-bias control, thereby minimizing the design effort and simplifying the systems-on-chip integration. Second, we introduce a novel statistical design methodology to efficiently and accurately evaluate the design guardband strictly needed in the worst case, thereby keeping the area cost of variations at its very minimum. A 65-nm advanced encryption standard testchip demonstrates 1.65x throughput improvement over a baseline design without body biasing, and enables reliable operation over a wide voltage range (0.5-1.2 V) as opposed to traditional body-biasing schemes. In addition, our testchip achieves 1.63x area efficiency improvement compared with a design based on corner analysis. Accordingly, the proposed techniques are well suited for the design of near-threshold specialized hardware with improved performance, reduced silicon area, and design effort.", "paper_title": "Novel Self-Body-Biasing and Statistical Design for Near-Threshold Circuits With Ultra Energy-Efficient AES as Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300002"}
