For end-to-end IP QoS delivery, each wireless access domain can independently choose its internal resource management policies to guarantee the customer access SLA (CASLA), while the border-crossing traffic is served by a core network following policy rules to meet the transit domain SLA (TRSLA). Particularly, we propose an engineered priority resource sharing scheme for a voice/data integrated wireless domain, where the policy rules allow cellular-only access or cellular/WLAN interworked access. By such a resource sharing scheme, the CASLA for each service class is met with efficient resource utilization, and the interdomain TRSLA bandwidth requirement can be easily determined. In the transit domain, the traffic load fluctuation from upstream access domains is tackled by an inter-TRSLA resource sharing technique, where the spare capacity from underloaded TRSLAs can be exploited by the overloaded TRSLAs to improve resource utilization. Advantages of the inter-SLA resource sharing technique are that the core network service provider can freely design the policy rules that define underload and overload status, determine the bandwidth reservation, and distribute the spare resources among bandwidth borrowers, while all the policies are supported by a common set of resource allocation techniques.", "paper_title": "Efficient resource allocation for policy-based wireless/wireline interworking", "paper_id": "WOS:000239431400003"}
