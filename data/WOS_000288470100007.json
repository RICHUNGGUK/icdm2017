The aim of this paper is to develop a series of aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy information. We first discuss the relationship between intutionistic fuzzy set and hesitant fuzzy set, based on which we develop some operations and aggregation operators for hesitant fuzzy elements. The correlations among the aggregation operators are further discussed. Finally, we give their application in solving decision making problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
