Some new classes of estimators are proposed for any sampling design. These new classes employ to all observation (incomplete cases too) in the estimation without using any imputation techniques. On the basis of properties derived and some simulation results, the proposed estimators are compared with other complete case estimators. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
