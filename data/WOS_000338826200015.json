And then, the method is implemented by GMRES. If a fuzzy nonsingular linear system has a fuzzy solution, our method is able to obtain the solution. Otherwise, our method can only find a weak fuzzy solution. At last, some large scale numerical tests are presented.", "paper_title": "A GMRES Method for Solving Fuzzy Linear Equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000338826200015"}
