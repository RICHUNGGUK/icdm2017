It aims to develop behavioral models of human groups and analyze the impact of culture factors on human group behavior using computational methods. Machine learning methods, in particular classification, play a critical role in such applications. Since various cultural-related data sets possess different characteristics, it is important to gain a computational understanding of performance characteristics of various machine learning methods. In this paper, we investigate the performance of seven representative classification algorithms using a benchmark cultural modeling data set and analyze the experimental results as to group behavior forecasting.", "paper_title": "Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods in Cultural Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000271535700003"}
