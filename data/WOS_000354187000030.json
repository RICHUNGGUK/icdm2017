This complexity is associated with contradictory objectives and significant uncertainties involved in analysis process. Although a large body of intuitive and analytical models for EA analysis has evolved over the last few years, none of them leads to an efficient and optimized ranking in fuzzy environments. Moreover, it is necessary to simultaneously employ some complementary methods to reflect the ambiguity and vagueness as the main sources of uncertainty. This paper incorporates the concept of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model into EA scenario analysis through a group analysis under uncertain conditions. To resolve the vagueness and ambiguity of the EA analysis, fuzzy credibility constrained programming and p-robustness technique are applied, respectively. Not only is the proposed DEA model linear, robust, and flexible in aggregating experts' opinion in a group decision making process, but it also is successful in discrimination power improvement - a major shortcoming associated with classic DEA model. The proposed model provides useful solutions to support decision making process for large-scale Information Technology (IT) development planning. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
