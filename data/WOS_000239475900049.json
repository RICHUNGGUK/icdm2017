The equivalence between non-parametric flat counter automata and Presburger arithmetic has been established previously by Comon and Jurski [5]. We simplify their proof by introducing finite state automata defined over alphabets of a special kind of graphs (zigzags). This framework allows one to express also the reachability problem for parametric automata with one control loop as the existence of solutions of a 1-parametric linear Diophantine systems. The latter problem is shown to be decidable, using a number-theoretic argument. Finally, the general reachability problem for parametric flat counter automata with more than one loops is shown to be undecidable, by reduction from Hilbert's Tenth Problem [9].", "paper_title": "Flat parametric counter automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900049"}
