Special attention is paid to the verification of the conformity of the designed system to the requirements formulated at the early stages of design. The key features of this environment are as follows: the use of a formal model of operation for distributed systems, and the analysis of various aspects of the behavior of a system, both quantitative and logical, by a unified description of systems. The application of the DYANA environment in research and engineering projects over the last 28 years is considered. A comparison with other domestic and foreign results in the field of simulation of real-time distributed embedded computing systems is presented.", "paper_title": "Integrated environment for the analysis and design of distributed real-time embedded computing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000324396300003"}
