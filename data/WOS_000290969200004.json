The system is designed to strike a balance between low latency and accurate recognition while simultaneously taking advantage of the rich complexity of sounds producible by the human vocal tract. By developing a modular, cross-platform library, we aim to provide a robust but simple means of incorporating such controls into any application, thereby producing a new form of accessible technology. This is demonstrated by the various applications that so far have used the Vocal Joystick engine. Unlike previous discussions of parts of the Vocal Joystick, this paper presents a detailed view of the inner workings of the current version of the engine. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
