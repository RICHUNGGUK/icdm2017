In this work, we develop an energy-efficient streaming system for mobile hotspots to achieve better Quality-of-Experience. Our main idea is (a) to avoid redundant 3G transmissions as well as reduce the usage of 3G links for those low residual-energy users, and (b) to enable near by mobile users cooperatively to share the downloaded data via short-range interfaces. The experiment results shows our scheme can improve the system life time by 27%, and provide better throughput as well as lower loss rate than conversional 3G systems do.", "paper_title": "Towards Energy-Efficient Streaming System for Mobile Hotspots", "paper_id": "WOS:000302124800065"}
