Structured application specific integrated circuits (sASICs) offer a middle ground in price and performance between ASICs and field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) by sharing masks across different designs. In this paper, two sASIC architectures are proposed, the first being based on three-input lookup-tables, and the second on AOI22 gates. The sASICs are programmed using a standard-cell compatible design flow. They are customized using a minimum of three masks, i.e., two metals and one via. The area and delay of the sASIC are compared with ASICs and FPGAs. Results over a set of benchmark circuits show that our AOI22-based sASIC had an average of 1.76x/1.41x increase in area/delay compared to ASICs, a considerable improvement compared with the 26.56x/5.09x increase for FPGAs. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the best performance reported in the literature for a practical sASIC. A prototype using the sASIC was fabricated using a universal machine control 0.13-mu m mixed-mode/RF process. It was fully verified using scan and functional tests, and used in a demonstration system.", "paper_title": "Architecture and Design Flow for a Highly Efficient Structured ASIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000315639900003"}
