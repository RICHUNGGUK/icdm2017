TAGEDs can test (dis)equalities between subtrees which may be arbitrarily faraway. In particular, they are equipped with an equality relation and a disequality relation on states, so that whenever two subtrees t and t' evaluate (in an accepting run) to two states which are in the (dis)equality relation, they must be (dis)equal. We study several properties of TAGEDs, and prove emptiness decidability of for several expressive subclasses of TAGEDs.", "paper_title": "TREE AUTOMATA WITH GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280773400007"}
