This paper introduces a new class of binary security-oriented codes of rate >1/2. The codes are derived from the cubic code by applying a linear transformation on the codewords before puncturing. The codes are systematic and robust in that any nonzero error can be detected with a probability >0. The error masking probability of the codes is upper bounded by 2(-r+1) where r is the number of redundancy bits. It is shown that in some cases, by choosing the proper transformation and puncturing matrices, it is possible to increase the minimum distance of the code, or to reduce the maximal error masking probability to meet its lower bound.", "paper_title": "Robust Generalized Punctured Cubic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900025"}
