We consider the front and back ideal images as two individual patterns overlapped in the observed recto and verso scans, and apply an unsupervised constrained maximum likelihood technique to separate them. Through several real examples, we show that the results obtained by this approach are much better than the ones obtained through data decorrelation or independent component analysis. As compared to approaches based on segmentation/classification, which often aim at cleaning a foreground text by removing all the textured background, one of the advantages of our method is that cleaning does not alter genuine features of the document, such as color or other structures it may contain. This is particularly interesting when the document has a historical importance, since its readability can be improved while maintaining the original appearance. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
