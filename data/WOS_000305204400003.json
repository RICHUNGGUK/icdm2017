In the proposed signaling, 1-bit data with control information is represented by using a one-digit multi-level signal, so serial data can be transmitted asynchronously using only a single wire. The small number of wires alleviates the routing complexity of wiring long-range interconnects. The use of current-mode signaling makes it possible to transmit data at high speed without buffers or repeaters over a long interconnect wire because of the low-voltage swing of signaling, and it leads to low-latency data transmission. We achieve a latency of 0.45 ns, a throughput of 1.25 Gbps, and energy dissipation of 0.58 pJ/bit with a 10-mm interconnect wire under a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology. This represents an 85% decrease in latency, a 150% increase in throughput, and a 90% decrease in energy dissipation compared to a conventional serial asynchronous data-transmission link.", "paper_title": "Long-Range Asynchronous On-Chip Link Based on Multiple-Valued Single-Track Signaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000305204400003"}
