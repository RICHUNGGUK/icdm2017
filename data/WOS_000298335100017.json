A continuum regularization of the network is carried out by balancing the maximization of the information entropy corresponding to the nodal data, with the minimization of the total width of the shape functions. The accuracy and convergence properties of the given curvature prediction procedure are assessed through numerical applications to benchmark problems, which include coarse grained molecular dynamics simulations of the fluctuations of red blood cell membranes [2,3]. We also provide an energetic discrete-to-continuum approach to the prediction of the zero-temperature bending rigidity of membrane networks, which is based on the integration of the local curvature estimates. The local maximum entropy approach is easily applicable to the continuum regularization of fluctuating membranes, and the prediction of membrane and bending elasticities of molecular dynamics models.
