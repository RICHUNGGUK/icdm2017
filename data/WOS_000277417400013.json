By developing a tight outerbound as well as an achievable scheme which exploits the idea of interference alignment, we are able to exactly characterize the sum degrees of freedom (DoF) of the network when the channel coefficients are time-or frequency-varying, which equals KM/K+min(M,K) (where M and K denote the number of receiver antennas and number of users in per cell, respectively) per cell. From the DoF result, it can be observed that in addition to the multi-user gain which has been reported for the network with single-antenna BSs, there also exists the multi-antenna gain in the cellular network. In particular, when the number of users is large, we can nearly achieve the interference-free DoF of a cellular network with multiple-antenna BSs, which is a somewhat surprising result.", "paper_title": "On degrees of freedom of the cellular network", "paper_id": "WOS:000277417400013"}
