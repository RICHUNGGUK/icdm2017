The results indicated that almost half (45%) of preservice teachers supported the use of mobile phones in the classroom while one-fourth (25%) did not support their use and approximately one third (30%) reported uncertainty. The preservice teachers perceived many features/functions of mobile phones as being useful in the classroom, but they identified access to the Internet, clicker capabilities, use of educational apps, and use as a reader as the most valuable. They perceived cheating, disruptions, cyberbullying, and accessing inappropriate content as major barriers to the use of mobile phones in the classroom. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
