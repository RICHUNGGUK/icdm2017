Most of multivariate quality control charts are effective in detecting out-of-control signals based upon an overall statistics in multivariate manufacturing processes. The main problem of such charts is that they can detect an out-of-control event but do not directly determine which variable or group of variables has caused the out-of-control signal and what is the magnitude of out of control. This study presents a hybrid learning-based model for on-line analysis of out-of-control signals in multivariate manufacturing processes. This model consists of two modules. In the first module using a support vector machine-classifier, type of unnatural pattern can be recognized. Then by using three neural networks for shift mean, trend and cycle it can be recognized magnitude of mean shift, slope of trend and cycle amplitude for each variable simultaneously in the second module. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated using two examples. The output generated by trained hybrid model is strongly correlated with the corresponding actual target value for each quality characteristic. The main contributions of this work are recognizing the type of unnatural pattern and classification major parameters for shift, trend and cycle and for each variable simultaneously by proposed hybrid model.
