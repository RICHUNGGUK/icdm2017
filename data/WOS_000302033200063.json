The class of doubly fractional models is extended to include the possibility of long memory in cyclical (non-zero) frequencies in both levels and volatility, and a new model, the GARMA-GARMASV (Gegenbauer AutoRegressive Moving Average-Gegenbauer AutoRegressive Moving Average Stochastic Volatility), is introduced. A sequential estimation strategy based on the Whittle approximation to maximum likelihood is proposed and its finite sample performance is evaluated with a Monte Carlo analysis. Finally, a trifactorial in the mean and bifactorial in the volatility version of the model is proved to successfully fit the well-known sunspot index. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
