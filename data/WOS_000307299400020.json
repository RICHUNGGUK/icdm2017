A scattering matrix formalism based on the FEM allows the efficient treatment of light reflection and transmission by multilayer bi-periodic structures, and the computation of Bloch modes of three-dimensional arrays. Numerical simulations, which show the accuracy and flexibility of the FEM, are presented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
