The intrinsic illumination subspace is constructed from illumination images of intrinsic images, which is a midlevel description of appearance images and can be useful for many visual inferences. This subspace forms a convex polyhedral cone and can be efficiently represented by a low-dimensional linear subspace, which enables an analytic generation of illumination images under varying lighting conditions. When only objects of the same class, such as faces, are concerned, a class-based generic intrinsic illumination subspace can be constructed in advance and used for novel objects of the same class. Based on this class-based generic subspace, we propose a lighting normalization method for lighting insensitive face recognition, where only a single input image is required. The generic subspace is used as a bootstrap subspace for illumination images of novel objects. Face recognition experiments are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed lighting normalization method and verify empirically that the class-based generic subspace is applicable to novel objects. Our method is simple and fast, which makes it useful for real-time applications, embedded systems, or mobile devices with limited resources.", "paper_title": "Intrinsic Illumination Subspace for Lighting Insensitive Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000302097000011"}
