There is nonetheless still much to study on their kinematics, dynamics and locomotion. In this paper, initially, full body kinematics of a radial symmetrical six-legged robot with statically stable movements are reviewed. The kinematics analysis is made on cooperated swing legs over supporting legs. Using the robot screw theory and exponential product equations, the velocities and accelerations referring to the object reference frame of each robot part are presented in a compact form. This makes it easy to calculate kinetic energy and so to build the dynamics model using the Lagrangian method. Many ways of walking of six-legged robots have been introduced in specialized literature. However, mobility comparison is still open to research. Two main aspects of mobility are analyzed in detail in this paper. The first one concerns the mobility of three statically stable ways of walking (the insect-wave gait, mammal-kick gait and mixed gait) with the same duty factor on the same radial symmetrical hexapod robot. The stability, energy efficiency, turning flexibility, and terrain or environment adaptability among those gaits have been compared. The mixed gait presents important advantages over the other two, while those two are useful for some special terrain conditions where the mixed gait is limited. The second aspect that has been analyzed focuses on the mobility of the body. The body height, measured from the body bottom to the supporting surface, and the stride optimization factors are proposed according to the obstacles' configuration and the energy optimization. The results of our study can be used for the intelligent locomotion control of some articulated multi-legged robots for walking statically-stably on a complicated surface. Most of our analyses have been successfully verified on the prototype which has been designed by Politecnico di Milano (POLIMI) and Beijing University of Astronautics and Aeronautics (BUAA) and developed by POLIMI in 2007.
