A class of estimators of unknown parameter is employed. This class was originally proposed by Schick and it covers both least squares estimator and maximum likelihood estimator for instance. Asymptotic behavior of such estimators is explored, especially the rate of convergence to normal distribution is established.", "paper_title": "Rate of convergence for a class of RCA estimators", "paper_id": "WOS:000244953000005"}
