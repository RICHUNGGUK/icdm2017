Although there are exponentially many facets (see Gomory and Johnson in Math Program 3:359-389, 1972, Example 4.6) and exponentially many vertices for the group polyhedron for the master cyclic group problem, Gomory's characterization of the non-trivial facets has polynomially many subadditive inequalities, in fact of order |G|(2) for a finite Abelian group G. We reduce this subadditive inequality system to its minimal representation by a triple system of the same order and show the dimensionality of the polytope of non-trivial facets. The system of all triples corresponds to all solution vectors of length three into which every solution vector can be decomposed. Our minimal representation leads to a characterization of the vertices of length three. Gomory et al. (Math Program 96:321-339, 2003) introduced a shooting experiment involving solving the shooting linear program repeatedly to find important facets. We develop a topological network flow model of the dual problem of the shooting linear program in a reverse procedure from the decomposition of solution vectors into triples. Hunsaker (2003) gave a knapsack shooting experiment, which we use to find a simple pattern for the most hit knapsack facets.", "paper_title": "Cyclic group blocking polyhedra", "paper_id": "WOS:000316639000011"}
