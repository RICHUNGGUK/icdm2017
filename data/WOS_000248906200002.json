For p=1 this model reduces to the classical Lindley equation for the waiting time in the G/G/1 queue, whereas for p=0 it describes the waiting time of the server in an alternating service model. For all other values of p, this model describes a FCFS queue in which the service times and interarrival times depend linearly and randomly on the waiting times. We derive the distribution of W when A is generally distributed and B follows a phase-type distribution, and when A is exponentially distributed and B deterministic.", "paper_title": "On queues with service and interarrival times depending on waiting times", "paper_id": "WOS:000248906200002"}
