There are two parts of forecast. The first one is to build an optimal grey model from a series of data, the other uses the Fourier series to refine the residuals produced by the mentioned model. Finally, the Markov state scheme is used for predicting the possibility of location results to promote the intermediate results generated by the Fourier grey model (FGM). it is evident that the proposed approach gets the better result performance than that of the other methods.
