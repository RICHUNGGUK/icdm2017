This article presents a knowledge-based methodology for constructing readiness assessment instruments for B2B integration solutions and examines its validation by conducting structural equation modeling analysis with input data from wholesale trading firms in Greece. Strong emphasis is given to the usability and appropriateness of the produced indicators and the relevant gap in literature is addressed. The B2Bi success factors that are presented and the final set of their underlying indicators can provide a starting point for conducting organizational readiness evaluations for the successful adoption of multi-enterprise integration solutions. Our methodology and findings can assist enterprises and public bodies to utilize, share, and enrich a knowledge base about B2Bi organizational readiness, throughout their evolution as part of the Knowledge Society.", "paper_title": "A Knowledge-Based Framework for Measuring Organizational Readiness for the Adoption of B2B Integration Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000279841000009"}
