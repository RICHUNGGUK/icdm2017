This paper describes how to apply timed Petri nets and existing production data to the modelling of production systems. Information concerning the structure of a production facility and the products that can be produced is usually given in production-data management systems. We describe a method for using these data to construct a Petri-net model algorithmically. The timed Petri-net simulator, which was constructed in Matlab, is also described. This simulator makes it possible to introduce heuristics, and, in this way, various production scenarios can be evaluated. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we applied it to a scheduling problem in the production of furniture fittings.", "paper_title": "Production-process modelling based on production-management data: a Petri-net approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000250346000006"}
