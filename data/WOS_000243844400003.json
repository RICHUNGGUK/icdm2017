The new methods are shown to be quadratically convergent. Both the sequences of diameters {b(n) - a(n)} and the iterative sequence {x(n) - x*} are quadratically convergent to zero. The theoretical analysis and numerical experiments show that Dew exponential iterative formulae are effective and comparable to those of the well-known Newton and Steffensen methods.
