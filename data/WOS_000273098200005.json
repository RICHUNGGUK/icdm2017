On the one hand, the LS approach is based on the classical shape derivative; while on the other hand, the TG method is precisely designed for introducing new perturbations in the optimization domain. These two approaches, which consist in minimizing a cost function related to the component behavior, are first described. Regarding given electrical specifications, these techniques are applied to optimize the distribution of ceramic parts of a dual-mode resonator in order to improve its behavior. The optimized dielectric resonators result in a wide spurious-free stop band. A comparison between classical and optimized dual mode resonator is presented. Theoretical results are then validated by careful measurements.
