Here, we introduce a web server for prediction of protein homo-oligomer structure. The server takes a protein monomer structure as input and predicts its homo-oligomer structure from oligomer templates selected based on sequence and tertiary/quaternary structure similarity. Using protein model structures as input, the server shows clear improvement over the best methods of CASP9 in predicting oligomeric structures from amino acid sequences.", "paper_title": "GalaxyGemini: a web server for protein homo-oligomer structure prediction based on similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000318109300017"}
