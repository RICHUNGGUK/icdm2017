In both cases, as the class of test problems under consideration, a slight generalization of the well-known OneMax test function has been chosen. The techniques used for the runtime analysis of the two algorithms differ: in the case of GBAS, the expected runtime until the optimal solution is reached is studied by a direct bound estimation approach inspired by comparable results for the (1 + 1) evolutionary algorithm (EA). A runtime bound of order O(m log m), where m is the problem instance size, is obtained. In the case of ant system, the original discrete stochastic process is approximated by a suitable continuous deterministic process. The validity of the approximation is shown by means of a rigid convergence theorem exploiting a classical result from mathematical learning theory. Using this approximation, it is demonstrated that for the considered OneMax-type problems, a runtime of order O(m log(1 /epsilon)) until reaching an expected relative solution quality of 1 - epsilon, and a runtime of O(m log m) until reaching the optimal solution with high probability can be predicted. Our results are the first to show competitiveness in runtime complexity with (1 + 1) EA on OneMax for a proper ACO algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
