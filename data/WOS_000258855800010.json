Lately, the production of cheap complementary metal-oxide semiconductor cameras and microphones, which are able to capture rich multimedia content, gave birth to what is called Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs). WMSNs will boost the capabilities of current wireless sensor networks, and will fuel several novel applications, like multimedia surveillance sensor networks. WMSNs introduce several new research challenges, mainly related to mechanisms to deliver application-level Quality-of-Service (e.g., latency minimization). To address this goal in an environment with extreme resource constraints, with variable channel capacity and with requirements for multimedia in-network processing, the caching of multimedia data, exploiting the cooperation among sensor nodes is vital. This article presents a cooperative caching solution particularly suitable for WMSNs. The proposed caching solution exploits sensor nodes which reside in \"positions\" of the network that allow them to forward packets or communicate decisions within short latency. These so-called \"mediator\" nodes are selected dynamically, so as to avoid the creation of hot-spots in the communication and the depletion of their energy. The mediators are not more powerful than the rest of the nodes, but they have some special role in implementing the cooperation among the sensors. The proposed cooperative caching protocol includes components for locating cached data as well as for implementing data purging out of the sensor caches. The proposed solution is evaluated extensively in an advanced simulation environment, and it is compared to the state-of-the-art cooperative caching algorithm for mobile ad hoc networks. The results confirm that the proposed caching mechanism prevails over its competitor.", "paper_title": "Cooperative caching in wireless multimedia sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258855800010"}
