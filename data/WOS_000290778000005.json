The approximation uses a state-space encoding based on multiway decision diagrams and a transition rate encoding based on a new class of edge-valued decision diagrams. The new method retains the favorable properties of a previously proposed Kronecker-based approximation, while eliminating the need for a Kronecker-consistent model decomposition. Removing this restriction allows for a greater utilization of event locality, which facilitates the generation of both the state-space and the transition rate matrix, thus extends the applicability of this algorithm to larger and more complex models.
