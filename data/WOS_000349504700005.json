Rough set theory has been proved to be an excellent mathematical tool for dimension reduction. In this paper, based on rough set, a novel framework for ensemble is proposed. hi our proposed framework, the relationship among attributes in rough subspace is first considered, and the maximum dependency degree of attribute is first employed to effectively reduce the searching space of reducts and augment the diversity of selected reducts. In addition, in order to choose an appropriate reduct from the dynamic reduct searching space, an assessment function which can balance the accuracy and diversity is utilized. At last, a new method, i.e., Dynamic Rough Subspace based Selective Ensemble (DRSSE), which is derived from our framework is given. By repeatedly changing the searching space of reducts and selecting the next reduct from the changed searching space, DRSSE finally trains an ensemble system with these selected reducts. Compared with several available ensemble methods, experimental results with several datasets demonstrate that DRSSE can lead to a comparative or even better performance. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
