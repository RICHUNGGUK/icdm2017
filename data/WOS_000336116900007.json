In the proposed IFFO, a new control parameter is introduced to tune the search scope around its swarm location adaptively. A new solution generating method is developed to enhance accuracy and convergence rate of the algorithm. Extensive computational experiments and comparisons are carried out based on a set of 29 benchmark functions from the literature. The computational results show that the proposed IFFO not only significantly improves the basic fruit fly optimization algorithm but also performs much better than five state-of-the-art harmony search algorithms.
