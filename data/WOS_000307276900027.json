Such conjunction between the Ago protein and miRNA raises the question: How do Mg2+ ions participate in the recognition process of miRNA by Ago or its target. Furthermore, it is still unclear whether the Mg2+ ions contribute to the local or global stability of the miRNA complex. In this work, we have performed a series of 16 independent molecular dynamic simulations (MD) to characterize the functions of Mg2+, hydration patterns and the conformational events involved in the miRNA-target interactions. The cross correlation analysis shows that Mg1 and Mg2 significantly enhance a locally cooperated movement of the PAZ, PIWI and Mid domains with the average correlation coefficient of similar to 0.65, producing an \"open-closed\" motion (rotation Angle, 46.5A degrees) between the PAZ and PIWI domains. Binding of Mg3 can globally stabilize the whole Ago protein with the average RMSD of similar to 0.34 , compared with the systems in absence of Mg3 (average RMSD = similar to 0.43 ). Three structural water molecules surrounding the Mg2+-binding regions also stabilize these ions, thus facilitating the recognition of miRNA to its target. In addition, the thermodynamic analysis also verifies the positive contribution of all three Mg2+ to the binding of miRNA to Ago, as well as the importance Mg2 plays in the cleavage of the miRNA targets.", "paper_title": "Local and global effects of Mg2+ on Ago and miRNA-target interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000307276900027"}
