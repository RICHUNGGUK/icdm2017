This review paper surveys pervasive affect sensing by examining and considering three major elements of affective pervasive systems, namely \"sensing,\" \"analysis,\" and \"application.\" Sensing investigates the different sensing modalities that are used in existing real-time affective applications, analysis explores different approaches to emotion recognition and visualization based on different types of collected data, and application investigates different leading areas of affective applications. For each of the three aspects, the paper includes an extensive survey of the literature and finally outlines some of challenges and future research opportunities of affective sensing in the context of pervasive computing.", "paper_title": "Emotions in context: examining pervasive affective sensing systems, applications, and analyses", "paper_id": "WOS:000361653300020"}
