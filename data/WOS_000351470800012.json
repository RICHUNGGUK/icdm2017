A simplistic principle founded upon regular variation theory is that the backoff time has a truncated Pareto-type tail distribution with an exponent of (log gamma)/log m (m is the multiplicative factor and gamma is the collision probability). This reveals that the per-node backoff process is heavy-tailed in the strict sense for gamma > 1/m(2), and paves the way for the following unifying result. The state-of-the-art theory on the superposition of the heavy-tailed processes is applied to establish a dichotomy exhibited by the aggregate backoff process, putting emphasis on the importance of time-scales on which we view the backoff processes. While the aggregation on normal time-scales leads to a Poisson process, it is approximated by a new limiting process possessing long-range dependence (LRD) on coarse time-scales. This dichotomy turns out to be instrumental in formulating short-term fairness, extending existing formulas to arbitrary population, and to elucidate the absence of LRD in practical situations. A refined wavelet analysis is conducted to strengthen this argument.", "paper_title": "Fundamentals of the Backoff Process in 802.11: Dichotomy of the Aggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351470800012"}
