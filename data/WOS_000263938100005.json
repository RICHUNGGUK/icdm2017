The vertical and horizontal relations of models were recorded before scanning with a special device. A 3D graphic database of artificial teeth, which can be aligned with parameters, was established. Special CAD software developed by ourselves was applied to the 3D integrated design process including automatic setting up artificial teeth, semiautomatic designing aesthetic and individualized artificial gingiva and base plate, automatic constructing individualized virtual flasks according to the finished CAD digital models of removable complete denture. At last, 3DP technology was used to make the individualized physical flasks. In this study, AMT and classic denture materials were effectually combined to achieve making removable complete denture aided by CAD/RP technology. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
