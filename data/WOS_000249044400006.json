In this mechanism, a unique electronic code is allocated to each wavelength channel in the network and therefore can be electronically identified without a wavelength demultiplexer. We analyze the scalability of the signaling mechanism in the presence of noise and interference, and the optimum power tapping ratio for the error-free recovery of the payload data and electronic code-division-multiple-access-based control signal. Theoretical analyses were performed for the optimum control arm power tapping ratio for varying modulation depth and the transmission bit rate of the payload data signal.
