To deal with big data classification problems we propose the Chi-FRBCS-BigData algorithm, a linguistic fuzzy rule-based classification system that uses the MapReduce framework to learn and fuse rule bases. It has been developed in two versions with different fusion processes. An experimental study is carried out and the results obtained show that the proposal is able to handle these problems providing competitive results.", "paper_title": "A MapReduce Approach to Address Big Data Classification Problems Based on the Fusion of Linguistic Fuzzy Rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000349377100002"}
