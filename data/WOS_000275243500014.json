Results: The proposed graph-based approach generates a robust GSN for the training process of genetic network construction. The RVM-based ensemble model that combines AdaBoost and reduced-feature yields improved performance on large-scale learning problems with massive missing values in comparison to Naive Bayes.", "paper_title": "Prediction of human functional genetic networks from heterogeneous data using RVM-based ensemble learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000275243500014"}
