The proposed approach replaces temporal noise with an equivalent power/ground voltage. This replacement reduces complexity that comes from the variety in noise waveform shape, and improves compatibility of power/ground noise aware timing analysis with conventional timing analysis framework. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can compute gate propagation delay considering temporal noise within 10% error in maximum and 0.5% in average.", "paper_title": "Timing analysis considering temporal supply voltage fluctuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254606100031"}
