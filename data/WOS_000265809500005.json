Compared with the conventional roller tape applied by the traffic police of Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Security in 142 traffic cases, photogrammetry is proven to be a time saving and cost effective method for accident investigation. The 2D photogrammetry method and the trajectory analysis accident reconstruction technique are applied to actual traffic accidents. With the assistance of a Portable-Control System as the reference system, the 3D photogrammetry method can be used in a vehicle deformation survey. The measurement results obtained in accordance with the CRASH survey criteria for vehicle deformation can be adopted as initial information for the damage analysis reconstruction technique. It appears that photogrammetry has greater potential for application to traffic accident investigation and reconstruction. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
