Fortunately, sleepiness-related health and occupational hazards can be kept under control using scientifically tested precautions designed to help maintain wakefulness. Suitable work and rest scheduling and observance of tire. principles of sleep hygiene are of major importance there. In situations which interfere with sleep, it is possible to use hypnotics or behavioral techniques and melatonin for circadian regimen optimization. In situations when sleep loss is temporarily inevitable, options to be taken into account include work shift shortening, breaks for rest, naps of short duration or administration of vigilance enhancing drugs. In the future, risks associated with sleepiness could be mitigated by means of currently developed technologies for real-time detection of sleepiness.", "paper_title": "UNTIMELY SLEEPINESS: THE PROBLEM AND THE CURRENT STATE OF ITS MANAGEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000264426400007"}
