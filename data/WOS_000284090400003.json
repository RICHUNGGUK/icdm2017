Turtle is an example of such a network, where a peer only connects to real life friends. In this paper we propose an extension of Turtle for connecting to other nodes based on their reputation. Furthermore, we use trust management to dynamically adjust this reputation based on the honest or malicious behaviour of all connected peers. Using these techniques, a node is able to create links to other nodes and identify possible misbehaving friends. Finally, we present simulation results of a reputation based Turtle Friend-to-Friend network.", "paper_title": "Reputation based friend-to-friend networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000284090400003"}
