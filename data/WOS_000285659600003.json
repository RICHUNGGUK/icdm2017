It states how these user surveys play an important role in service quality enhancement. Design/methodology/approach - Following a brief history of Tsinghua University Library, a summary of the collections and services developed in recent years is given. The library has made a great effort to learn about users' needs and to improve service delivery through a series of user surveys. The paper describes these surveys, including the conclusions and the improvement measures adopted. Findings - Feedback gathered from user surveys provides vital information for improving library services. Through these user surveys, the library received a large amount of data to be analysed and a lot of valuable information, it promoted communication with our users, and the librarian's service literacy has also improved. Practical implications - An overview of user surveys, including methodology, content, organisation, and implementation process, as well as data analysis, might offer reference and practical experience for other university libraries. Originality/value - User surveys play an important role in the library's service quality enhancement. The paper provides a useful overview and practical experience of the topic.", "paper_title": "E-resources, services and user surveys in Tsinghua University Library", "paper_id": "WOS:000285659600003"}
