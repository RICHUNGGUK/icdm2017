Simulation experiments are carried out through using a combination of NS-2 and Vanet MobiSim software. Compared with the performance of the SWF-GPSR protocol with general GPSR, 2-hop C-GEDIR, and the GRA and AODV protocols, we find that the SWF algorithm has a certain degree of improvement in routing hops, the packet delivery ratio, delay performance, and link stability.", "paper_title": "A Routing Algorithm Based on Dynamic Forecast of Vehicle Speed and Position in VANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000321631600001"}
