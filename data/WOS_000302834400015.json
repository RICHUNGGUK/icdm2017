The DRM scheme without packets replication (DRM_noPR) sends multicast packet through a non-deterministic path. The DRM schemes with adaptive packets replication (DRM_PR_src and DRM_PR_all) replicate multicast packets at the source or intermediate node according to the destination position and the state of output ports to reduce the average multicast latency. We also provide fault-tolerant supporting in these schemes through a reinforcement-learning-based method to reconfigure the routing table to tolerate permanent faulty links in the network. Simulation results illustrate that the DRM_PR_all scheme achieves 41%, 43% and 37% less latency on average than that of the DRM_noPR scheme and 27%, 29% and 25% less latency on average than that of the DRM_PR_src scheme under three synthetic traffic patterns respectively. In addition, all three fault-tolerant DRM schemes achieve acceptable performance degradation at various link fault rates without any packet lost.", "paper_title": "Support Efficient and Fault-Tolerant Multicast in Buffer less Network-on-Chip", "paper_id": "WOS:000302834400015"}
