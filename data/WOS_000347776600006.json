Three main steps of the proposed method are determination of patch priority, the search space estimation for the candidate patches and the patch completion to fill in the unknown pixels of the target patch. In patch priority, we emphasize on the structure by the spatial relationship of neighborhood similar patches and kernel regression based local image structure. We find the search space, sub-regions of the entire source region similar to the region surrounding the target patch, to find the candidate patches. The said search space is estimated using probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA). Last, we infer the unknown pixels of the target patch using pLSA-based context and histogram similarity measure between the target patch and the candidate patches. Experimental results are found to be good compared to the competitive methods and may be used for digital restoration of images of defective or damaged artifacts.", "paper_title": "An image inpainting method using pLSA-based search space estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000347776600006"}
