MicrobeDB provides a foundation for such projects by the automation of downloading published, completed bacterial and archaeal genomes from key sources, parsing annotations of all genomes (both public and private) into a local database, and allowing interaction with the database through an easy to use programming interface. MicrobeDB creates a simple to use, easy to maintain, centralized local resource for various large-scale comparative genomic analyses and a backend for future microbial application design.", "paper_title": "MicrobeDB: a locally maintainable database of microbial genomic sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000306136100030"}
