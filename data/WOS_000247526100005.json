This paper addresses issues of allowing a user to continue to communicate with a remote party while changing terminals over multiple devices. Specifically, we propose an SIP extension header to improve the Call Transfer mechanism and hide the changing of the terminal from the remote party. We also propose a mechanism to solve the problem of the user needing to terminate all devices separately when a session is split over multiple devices. Finally, the proposed mechanisms are implemented using Sip-Communicator, an open source of SIP. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
