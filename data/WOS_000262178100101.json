However, many previous researches have only emphasized oil one of the two trends. In this paper, we integrate the application of LBS with recommendation technologies to present a location-based service recommendation model (LBSRM) and design a prototype system to simulate and measure the validity of LBSRM. Due to the accumulation and variation of preference, in the recommendation model we conduct an adaptive method including long-term and short-term preference adjustment to enhance the result of recommendation. Research results show, with the assessments of relative index, the rate of recommendation precision could be 85.48%. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
