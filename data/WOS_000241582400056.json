This simple method can solve some instances involving a number T of teams up to 70 while the best known constraint programing algorithm is limited to T <= 40. The proposed approach relies on interesting properties which are used to constraint the search process.", "paper_title": "Sports league scheduling: Enumerative search for Prob026 from CSPLib", "paper_id": "WOS:000241582400056"}
