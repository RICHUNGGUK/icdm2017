In many practical situations, there usually exists incomplete and uncertain information, and the decision makers cannot easily express their judgments on the candidates with exact and crisp values. Therefore, an extended technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) method for group decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is proposed to solve the partner selection problem under incomplete and uncertain information environment in this paper. And the feasibility and practicability of the extended TOPSIS method are further manifested through an illustrative example. Results show that this extended TOPSIS method for group decision making with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers is more suitable to cope with the partner selection problem under incomplete and uncertain information environment.
