In classical lattice Boltzmann methods, a pressure-density relation, and/or a finite Mach number, no matter how small, are required in the solution of the linearized Boltzmann-type equation, thus generating inherent compressibility error unavoidably. In the present approach, the pressure field is determined by a pressure-correction method to ensure incompressibility, thus the approach is valid for both liquid and incompressible gas flows. A variety of thermal laminar incompressible flows, such as Couette flow, falling thin liquid film flow, fluid flow through porous plates, and two- and three-dimensional natural convection flow are simulated. The results compared extremely well with analytical solutions and other known numerical simulations of the thermal incompressible flows investigated. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
