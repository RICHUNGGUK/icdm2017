Although a small increase in k can increase payload, it also increases image distortion. In this paper, we proposed an improvement scheme to the diamond encoding technique for reducing image distortion during a k change. Another aim is to increase payload size. A square matrix conversion of the diamond matrix is used to lower the MSE values in high payload when k = 3. A lower MSE reduces image distortion. In low payload, that is when k changes from 1 to 2, a one dimension matrix modulus is used to reduce image distortion. Experimental results showed that payload may be increased while image quality is not significantly reduced. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
