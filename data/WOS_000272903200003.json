Our optimization algorithm utilizes light source and camera spectral information in order to maximize the signal strength and the robustness to noise. Through the use of active wide band illumination, our system can obtain material reflectance information in the presence of moderate (indoor) unknown ambient illumination. Our method is very simple and does not require special equipment. It can be used by photographers to obtain material properties in uncontrolled environment and to synthesize captured scenes under arbitrary illumination.", "paper_title": "Multi-Spectral Imaging by Optimized Wide Band Illumination", "paper_id": "WOS:000272903200003"}
