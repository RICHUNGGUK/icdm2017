This demo presents AQWA, an adaptive and query-workload-aware data partitioning mechanism for processing large-scale spatial data. Unlike existing cluster-based systems, e.g., SpatialHadoop, that apply static partitioning of spatial data, AQWA has the ability to react to changes in the query-workload and data distribution. A key feature of AQWA is that it does not assume prior knowledge of the query-workload or data distribution. Instead, AQWA reacts to changes in both the data and the query-workload by incrementally updating the partitioning of the data. We demonstrate two prototypes of AQWA deployed over Hadoop and Spark. In both prototypes, we process spatial range and k-nearest-neighbor (kNN, for short) queries over large-scale spatial datasets, and we exploit the performance of AQWA under different query-workloads.", "paper_title": "A Demonstration of AQWA: Adaptive Query-Workload-Aware Partitioning of Big Spatial Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800078"}
