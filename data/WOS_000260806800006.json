This technique does not require additional space but has the drawback of removing solutions. We investigate a number of variations on the basic algorithm including the use of seed solutions, consistency techniques, and a variety of pruning heuristics. Our experimental results indicate that a significant proportion of the solutions to the original problem can be retained especially when an optimization algorithm that specifically searches for such \"good\" backtrack-free representations is employed. Further extensions increase solution retention by searching for high-coverage backtrack-free representations, by removing tuples rather than values, and by combining multiple backtrack-free representations. Our approach elucidates, for the first time, a three-way trade-off between space complexity, potential backtracks, and solution loss and enables algorithms that can actively reason about the trade-off between space, backtracks, and solution loss.", "paper_title": "A SPACE-EFFICIENT BACKTRACK-FREE REPRESENTATION FOR CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260806800006"}
