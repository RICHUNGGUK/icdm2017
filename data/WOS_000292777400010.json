Most conventional diagnosis systems are expert systems based on experiences which can not diagnose faults beyond those captured by the experiences. In this paper, model-based diagnosis (MBD) as a cognitive diagnosis method is applied to diagnose faults in the traction power supply system. The system models employed including system description, system signs and element models are described. Finally, an actual fault of the traction power supply system of High-speed Maglev is simulated to verify the effectiveness of MBD technique.", "paper_title": "Application of Model Based Diagnosis for Diagnosing Faults in the High-speed Maglev's Traction Power Supply System", "paper_id": "WOS:000292777400010"}
