In this paper, we first implement a WSD system for nouns and verbs, then the language sense model (LSM) for information retrieval is proposed. The LSM combines the terms and senses of a document seamlessly through an EM algorithm. Retrieval on TREC collections shows that the LSM outperforms both the vector space model (BM25) and the traditional language model significantly for both medium and long queries (7.53%-16.90%). Based on the experiments, we can also empirically draw the conclusion that the fine-grained senses will improve the retrieval performance when they are properly used.", "paper_title": "LSM: Language sense model for information retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000239658700009"}
