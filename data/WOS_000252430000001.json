The package adehabitat for the R software is designed to provide a computing environment for the analysis and modelling of such relationships. This paper focuses on the preliminary steps of data exploration and analysis, performed prior to a more formal modelling of habitat selection. In this context, I illustrate the use of a factorial analysis, the K-select analysis. This method is a factorial decomposition of marginality, one measure of habitat selection. This method was chosen to present the package because it illustrates clearly many of its features ( home range estimation, spatial analyses, graphical possibilities, etc.). I strongly stress the powerful capabilities of factorial methods for data analysis, using as an example the analysis of habitat selection by the wild boar ( Sus scrofa L.) in a Mediterranean environment.", "paper_title": "Exploring habitat selection by wildlife with adehabitat", "paper_id": "WOS:000252430000001"}
