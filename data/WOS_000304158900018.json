Existence of a Lipschitz solution trajectory to the model is established by a constructive time-stepping method whose convergence is rigorously analyzed. The solvability of the time-discretized subproblems by Lemke's algorithm is also proved. Combining linear complementarity with ordinary differential equations and being a new entry to the mathematical programming field, the LCS provides a computational tractable framework for the rigorous treatment of the DUE problem in continuous time; this paper makes a positive contribution in this promising research venue pertaining to the application of differential variational theory to dynamic traffic problems.", "paper_title": "A continuous-time linear complementarity system for dynamic user equilibria in single bottleneck traffic flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000304158900018"}
