Most of existing research considers security and video quality separately. However, it is crucial to integrate security and video quality together for video transmission because delivering video data across a secure path does not often meet video quality requirements in many traditional approaches. Applying the general concept of secret sharing algorithm on a data packet and delivering it through disjoint multipaths can be considered to deliver the data securely. However, using the general concept of secret sharing is not efficient when large-size video data are routed. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel security and quality aware routing (SQAR) protocol to address these two issues concurrently. We jointly consider security and video quality in wireless multimedia networks by proposing a video distortion model based on a new secret image sharing scheme. In SQAR, a secret image sharing is only applied on the intra-frames of the video codec H.264 and can significantly reduce the transmission overheads. Simulation results show that SQAR scheme can achieve better trade-off between the security and quality over the traditional routing protocols.
