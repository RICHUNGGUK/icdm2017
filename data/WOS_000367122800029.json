We use a novel strategy based on a physical model where the extreme intensity of each RGB pixel is used to define an initial atmospheric veil (local atmospheric light veil). Across bilateral filter is applied to each veil to achieve both local smoothness and edge preservation. A transmission map and a reflection component of each RGB channel are constructed from the physical atmospheric scattering model. The proposed approach avoids adverse effects caused by the error in estimating the global atmospheric light. Experimental results on outdoor hazy images demonstrate that the proposed method produces image output with satisfactory visual quality and color fidelity. Our comparative study demonstrates a higher performance of our method over several state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
