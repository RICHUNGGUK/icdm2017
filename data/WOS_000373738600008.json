In the HPNC scheme, both sources first transmit the correlated raw source messages to the relay simultaneously. The relay performs physical-layer network coding (PNC) on the received symbols, compresses the PNC-coded symbols using Huffman coding, and broadcasts the compressed symbols to both source nodes. Then, each source decodes the other source's messages by using its own messages as side information. Compression rate and block error rate (BLER) of the proposed scheme are analyzed. Simulation results demonstrate that the HPNC scheme can effectively improve the network throughput, and meanwhile, achieve the superior BLER performance compared with the conventional non-compressed relaying scheme in TWRN-CS.", "paper_title": "Compressed Relaying for Two-Way Relay Networks With Correlated Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000373738600008"}
