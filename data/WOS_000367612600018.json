Neither are indicators of efficiency. In the current work we propose an indicator of efficiency, the number of HCAs per scientist, which can complement the productivity indicators based on impact of total output. We apply this indicator to measure excellence in the research of Italian universities as a whole, and in each field and discipline of the hard sciences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
