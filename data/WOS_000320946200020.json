This is used for ensuring functional operation conditions during the functional clock cycles of the tests. For a partially-functional broadside test, the scan-in state has a known Hamming distance to a reachable state. This ensures measurable deviations from functional operation conditions during the functional clock cycles of the test. It is important for addressing overtesting as well as excessive power dissipation. This brief develops a fault-simulation procedure for transition faults under arbitrary (functional and nonfunctional) broadside tests that considers the tests as partially-functional broadside tests. The procedure can be used for evaluating the proximity to functional operation conditions of arbitrary broadside test sets. For illustration, the procedure is used for comparing a low-power test set with an arbitrary broadside test set.", "paper_title": "Transition Fault Simulation Considering Broadside Tests as Partially-Functional Broadside Tests", "paper_id": "WOS:000320946200020"}
