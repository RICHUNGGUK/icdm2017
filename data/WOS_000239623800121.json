Transportation costs include time costs, truck setup costs, and the number of trucks used. The model is formulated as an integer program and a solution of two-stage metaheuristic is provided. Computational experiments are conducted to test the algorithms.", "paper_title": "Reducing transportation costs in distribution networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800121"}
