As proved in the algorithm of Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP), two Gaussian distributions are followed by the matched filter coefficients corresponding to and without corresponding to the actual support set of the original sparse signal, respectively. Therefore, the selection for each support point is interpreted as a process of hypothesis testing, and the preliminarily selected support set is supposed to consist of rejected atoms. A hard threshold, which is controlled by an input parameter, is used to implement the rejection. Because the Type I error may happen during the hypothesis testing, not all the rejected atoms are creditable to be the true support points. The creditability of each preliminarily selected support point is evaluated by a well-designed built-in mechanism, and the several most creditable ones are adaptively selected into the final support set without being controlled by any extra external parameters. Moreover, the proposed CEMP does not necessitate the sparsity level to be a priori control parameter in operation. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, Gaussian and Pulse Amplitude Modulation sparse signals are measured in the noiseless and noisy cases, and the experiments of the compressed sensing signal recoveries by several greedy algorithms including CEMP are implemented. The simulation results show the proposed CEMP can achieve the best performances of the recovery accuracy and robustness as a whole. Besides, the experiment of the compressed sensing image recovery shows that CEMP can recover the image with the highest Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and the best visual quality.", "paper_title": "Compressed Sensing Signal Recovery via Creditability-Estimation Based Matching Pursuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600013"}
