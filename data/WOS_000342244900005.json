We focus especially on the two classes of normal and nonnegative matrices and we present intervals of applications for rational L-infinity approximations of various degrees for these types of matrices in the lines of Hargreaves and Higham (2005). Our method relies on Remez algorithm for rational approximation while the innovation here is the choice of the starting set of non-symmetrical Chebyshev points. Only one Remez iteration is then usually enough to quickly approach the actual L-infinity approximant. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
