Recently, it is shown that the Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) is a strong enough tool for dealing with unconstraint real life problems (such as DPAP), emphasizing the importance of incorporating problem-specific knowledge for increasing its efficiency. In a constrained Multi-objective Optimization Problem (such as K-connected DPAP), the search space is divided into feasible and infeasible regions. Therefore, problem-specific operators are designed for MOEA/D to direct the search into optimal, feasible regions of the space. Namely, a DPAP-specific population initialization that seeds the initial solutions into promising regions, problem-specific genetic operators (i.e. M-tournament selection, adaptive crossover and mutation) for generating good, feasible solutions and a DPAP-specific Repair Heuristic (RH) that transforms an infeasible solution into a feasible one and maintains the MOEA/D's efficiency simultaneously. Simulation results have shown the importance of each proposed operator and their interrelation, as well as the superiority of the DPAP-specific MOEA/D against the popular constrained NSGA-Il in several WSN instances.
