We introduce the k-NN Delaunay graph, which is the graph-theoretic dual of the k-NN Voronoi diagram, and use it as a base to directly compute this diagram in R (2). We implemented our paradigm in the L (1) and L (a) metrics, using segment-dragging queries, resulting in the first output-sensitive, O((n+m)logn)-time algorithm to compute the k-NN Voronoi diagram of n points in the plane, where m is the structural complexity (size) of this diagram. We also show that the structural complexity of the k-NN Voronoi diagram in the L (a) (equiv. L (1)) metric is O(min{k(n-k),(n-k)(2)}). Efficient implementation of our paradigm in the L (2) (resp. L (p) , 1 < p < a) metric remains an open problem.", "paper_title": "The k-Nearest-Neighbor Voronoi Diagram Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000352290500009"}
