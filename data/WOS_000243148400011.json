Unfortunately, almost currently available tools for building probabilistic graphical models offer no explanation facility. This paper shows how the explanation capabilities provided by Elvira, a software tool for editing and evaluating probabilistic graphical models, have helped us in the debugging of two medical Bayesian networks: PROSTANET, for the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and HEPAR II, for liver disorders.
