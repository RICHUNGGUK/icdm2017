The approach is based on computer technology which enables each patient to create an avatar of the entity (human or non-human) that they believe is talking to them. The therapist promotes a dialogue between the patient and the avatar in which the avatar progressively comes under the patient's control. Using real-time voice conversion delivery software, the therapist can modify the relationship between the patient and his/her voice. The innovation of this new intervention is discussed in the present paper as well as the advantages of using a computer based system. The subjective view of the technology from a participant's point of view is also presented.", "paper_title": "Confronting Auditory Hallucinations Using Virtual Reality: The Avatar Therapy", "paper_id": "WOS:000375005900035"}
