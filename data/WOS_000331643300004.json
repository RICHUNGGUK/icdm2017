The relationship between the generator matrix and minimum distance d is derived through MT, which is benefit to find numbers of QC codes with large minimum distance by our Matroid search algorithm. More than seventy of QC codes that extend previously published results are presented. Among these codes, there are nine codes whose minimum distance is larger than those of the known codes found by Gulliver et al.", "paper_title": "Constructing rate 1/p systematic binary quasi-cyclic codes based on the matroid theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000331643300004"}
