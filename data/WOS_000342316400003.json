In this paper, we investigate the polytype target coverage problem in heterogeneous wireless sensor networks where each sensor is equipped with multiple sensing units and each type of sensing unit can sense an attribute of multiple targets. How to schedule multiple sensing units of a sensor to cover multiple targets becomes a new challenging problem. This problem is formulated as an integer linear programming problem for maximizing the network lifetime. We propose a novel energy-efficient target coverage algorithm to solve this problem based on clustering architecture. Being aware of the coverage capability and residual energy of sensor nodes, the clusterhead node in each cluster schedules the appropriate sensing units of sensor nodes that are in the active status to cover multiple targets in an optimal way. Extensive simulations have been carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.
