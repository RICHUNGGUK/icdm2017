Utilizing a different perspective, this paper gives a new definition of risk for random fuzzy portfolio selection. A new optimal portfolio selection model is proposed based on this new definition of risk. A new hybrid intelligent algorithm is designed for solving the new optimization problem. In the proposed new algorithm, neural networks are employed to calculate the expected value and the chance value. These greatly reduce the computational work and speed up the process of solution as compared with the random fuzzy simulation used in our previous algorithm. A numerical example is also presented to illustrate the new modelling idea and the proposed new algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
