By utilizing the symmetric property of the minor input correction vector, the hardware complexity of the error compensation circuit can be lowered. By constructing the error compensation circuit mainly from the \"outer\" partial products, the hardware complexity only increases slightly as the multiplier input bits increase. In the proposed 16 x 16 bits fixed-width multiplier, the truncation error can be lowered by 87% as compared with the direct-truncated multiplier and the transistor count can be reduced by 47% as compared with the full-length multiplier. As compared with the state-of-the-art design, the proposed fixed-width multiplier performs not only with lower compensation error but also with lower hardware complexity, especially as multiplier input bits increase.", "paper_title": "Low-Error and Hardware-Efficient Fixed-Width Multiplier by Using the Dual-Group Minor Input Correction Vector to Lower Input Correction Vector Compensation Error", "paper_id": "WOS:000306922400022"}
