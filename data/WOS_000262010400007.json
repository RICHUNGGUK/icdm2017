To this end. there has not been much work to devise proper buffer cache management algorithms. This paper presents it novel huller cache management algorithm which considers both I/O cost per device and workload patterns in mobile computing systems with it heterogeneous storage pair of a hard disk all a NAND flash memory. In order to minimize the total I/O cost under varying workload patterns, the proposed algorithm employs a dynamic cache partitioning technique over different devices and manages each partition according to request patterns and I/O types along with the temporal locality. Trace-based Simulations show that the proposed algorithm reduces the total I/O cost and flash write count significantly over the existing buffer cache algorithms on typical mobile traces.", "paper_title": "DAC: A Device-Aware Cache Management Algorithm for Heterogeneous Mobile Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400007"}
