PARSEC can search for a sequence or a degenerated pattern. The retrieved set of genomic sites can be characterized in terms of (i) conservation in model organisms, (ii) genomic context (proximity to genes) and (iii) function of neighboring genes. These modules allow the user to explore, visualize, filter and extract biological knowledge from a set of short genomic regions such as transcription factor binding sites.", "paper_title": "PARSEC: PAtteRn SEarch and Contextualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000325485800018"}
