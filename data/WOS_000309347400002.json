Such restriction is imposed to discern which issues arise from the introduction of movement in the wireless ad hoc networks. Given a transmission range assignment for a set of n stations S, we provide an polynomial O(n (2))-time algorithm to decide whether a broadcast operation from a source station could be performed or not. Additionally, we study the problem of computing a transmission range assignment for S that minimizes the energy required in a broadcast operation. An O(n (3)log n)-time algorithm for this problem is presented, under the assumption that all stations have equally sized transmission ranges. However, we prove that the general version of such problem is NP-hard and not approximable within a (1-o(1))ln n factor (unless NPaS,DTIME(n (O(log log n)))). We then propose a polynomial time approximation algorithm for a restricted version of that problem.", "paper_title": "Min-energy broadcast in mobile ad hoc networks with restricted motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000309347400002"}
