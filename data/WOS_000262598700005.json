A random corner detection method is developed in this paper based on a new concept \"accumulative intersection space\" under Monte Carlo scheme. This method transforms the corner detection in the image space into local maxima localization in the accumulative intersection space where the intersections are accumulated by random computations. The proposed algorithm has been demonstrated by both theory and experiments. The proposed algorithm is isotropic, robust to image rotation, insensitive to noise and false corners on diagonal edges. Unlike the other existing contour based corner detection methods, our algorithm can effectively avoid the influence of the edge detectors, such as rounding corners or line interceptions. Extensive comparisons among our approach and the other detectors including Harris operator, Fei Shen and Han Wang detector, Han Wang and Brady detector, Foveated Visual Search method and SIFT feature, have shown the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "ACCUMULATIVE INTERSECTION SPACE BASED CORNER DETECTION ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598700005"}
