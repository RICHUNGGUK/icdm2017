Considering the requirements of illumination, the human eye safety, and the energy saving, we optimize the optical power allocation (PA) to maximize the transmission capacity of the overall system. Specifically, we discuss two typical scenarios where the LED array in each room serves multiple users either simultaneously or in a round-robin manner. The problem corresponding to the first case turns out to be non-convex whose globally optimal solution is hard to obtain. To address this difficult problem, we first adopt the famous gradient projection algorithm to obtain a locally optimal solution, then we employ powerful convex relaxation techniques, and achieve a high-quality solution. While for the round-robin case, we are able to derive an optimal solution in closed form by virtue of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Interestingly, the derived closed-form solution follows a water-filling pattern with both square root and two-side clipping operations, which differs from the conventional water-filling-like PA in radiofrequency channels. Numerical results depict the performance advantage provided by the proposed PA strategies under various settings.", "paper_title": "Transmission capacity maximization for LED array-assisted multiuser VLC systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358135700012"}
