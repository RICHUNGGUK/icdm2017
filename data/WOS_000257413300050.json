Most existing algorithms require the restriction that at each instant (i.e. in each column of the source matrix S), there is at most one single dominant component. Moreover, these algorithms require that the number of sources must be determined in advance. In this paper, we proposed a new algorithm for estimating the matrix A, which does not require the restriction of single dominant source at each instant. Moreover, it is not necessary that the exact number of sources be known a priori. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
