We are looking for a shorter program p' having the same property (p'(a) = b). In addition, we want p' to be simple conditional to p (this means that the conditional Kolmogorov complexity K(p'vertical bar p) is negligible). In the present paper, we prove that sometimes there is no such program p', even in the case when the complexity of p is much bigger than K(b vertical bar a). We give three different constructions that use the game approach, probabilistic arguments and algebraic (combinatorial) arguments, respectively.", "paper_title": "Non-reducible descriptions for conditional Kolmogorov complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800029"}
