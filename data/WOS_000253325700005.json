Hence, a more general form of the problem formulation is necessary to consider randomness in both source condition and system parameters. When the source varies with time, the unsteady problem, can be solved using the unit response function. In the case of random system parameters, the response function becomes a random function and depends on the randomness in the system parameters. In the present study, the source is modelled as a random discrete process with either a fixed interval or a random interval (the Poisson process). In this study, an attempt is made to assess the relative effects of various types of source uncertainties on the probabilistic behaviour of the concentration in a porous medium while the system parameters are also modelled as random fields. Analytical expressions of mean and covariance of concentration due to random discrete source are derived in terms of mean and covariance of unit response function. The probabilistic behaviour of the random response function is obtained by using a perturbation-based stochastic finite element method (SFEM), which performs well for mild heterogeneity. The proposed method is applied for analysing both the 1-D as well as the 3-D solute transport problems. The results obtained with SFEM are compared with the Monte Carlo simulation for I-D problems.
