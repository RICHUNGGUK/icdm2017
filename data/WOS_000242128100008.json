Decisions range from collective (common good) to individual (self-interested) perspectives, intuitively shaping a two-layer decision model. However, current decision theoretic models are either purely collective or purely individual and seek optimal policies. We present a two-layer, collective versus individual (CvI) decision model and explore the tradeoff between cost reduction and loss of optimality while learning coordination skills. Experiments, in a partially observable domain, test our approach for learning a collective policy and results show near-optimal policies that exhibit coordinated behavior.", "paper_title": "Coordination with collective and individual decisions", "paper_id": "WOS:000242128100008"}
