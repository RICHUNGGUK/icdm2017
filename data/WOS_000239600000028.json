Owing to vague concepts frequently represented in decision data, the crisp value is inadequate to model real-life situations. In this paper, the scoring of each alternative and the weight of each criterion are described by linguistic terms which can be expressed in triangular fuzzy numbers. Then, the ratings and weights assigned by decision makers are averaged and normalized into a comparable scale. A coefficient of variation is defined to determine the ranking order of alternatives by calculating the mean value and standard deviation. A numerical example demonstrates the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Combination of fuzzy TOPSIS and fuzzy ranking for multi attribute decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000239600000028"}
