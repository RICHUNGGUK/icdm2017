This paper uses a GMDH neural network model with moving average crossover inputs to predict price in the crude oil futures market. The predictions of price are used to construct buy and sell signals for traders. Compared to those of benchmark models. cumulative returns, year-to-year returns, returns over a market cycle, and Sharpe ratios all favor the GMDH model by a large factor. The significant profitability of the GMDH model casts doubt on the efficiency of the oil futures market. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
