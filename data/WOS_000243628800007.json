The curves used have earlier been validated against length distribution curves obtained by analyzing pulp samples with a commercial analyzer (FiberMaster). The curves were extracted from acoustic data without any \"calibration\" against fiber length analyses. The acoustic measurements were performed using an accelerometer affixed to the refiner blow-line during a full-scale trial with a Sunds Defibrator double disc refiner at SCA Ortviken, Sweden. Pulp samples were collected concurrently with the acoustic measurements and extensive physical testing has been made on these samples. For each trial point three pulp samples were collected. PLS1 and PLS2 models were successfully made linking the distribution curves obtained using CWT-FLE to pulp tensile strength properties as well as optical properties. The resulting Root Mean Square Error of Prediction (RMSEP) for all parameters is comparable to what can be obtained by pooling the standard deviations of reference measurements from the different trial points. The results obtained are compared to FiberMaster data modeled in the same fashion, yielding lower prediction errors than the CWT-FLE data. However, this can be partly due to the five-year storage of pulp samples between pulp sampling/acoustic measurement and FiberMaster analyses/sheet testing. The acoustic method is fast and produces results without dead time and could constitute a new tool for improving process control and optimizing the fiber characteristics in a specific process and for a specific purpose. The technique could be implemented in a PC-environrnent at a fairly low cost. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
