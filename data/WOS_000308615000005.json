MSBA is a memory-based diversified optimisation technique that hires mutable smart bee (MSB) instead of conventional bee. MSB heuristic agents are capable of maintaining their historical memory for the location and quality of food sources and also a little chance of mutation is considered for them. Exerted experiments reveal that these features are really effective for optimising multi-modal constraint problems. To elaborate on the authenticity of MSBA, obtained results are compared to state-of-the-art optimisation techniques.", "paper_title": "Optimal design of constraint engineering systems: application of mutable smart bee algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000308615000005"}
