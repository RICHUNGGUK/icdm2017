However, it is difficult to check the correctness of a stochastic simulator, since any two realizations from a single model will typically be different. Results: We have developed a test suite of stochastic models that have been solved either analytically or using numerical methods. This allows the accuracy of stochastic simulators to be tested against known results. The test suite is already being used by a number of stochastic simulator developers.", "paper_title": "The SBML discrete stochastic models test suite", "paper_id": "WOS:000252498500021"}
