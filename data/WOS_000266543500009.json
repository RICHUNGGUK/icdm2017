A fuzzy logic system is used to estimate the concentration dependent terms and other unknown system parameters appearing in the control law. It is shown that the closed loop system is asymptotically stable and influences of minimum approximation error and external disturbance on the L(2) norm of the output tracking error can be attenuated arbitrarily. The performance of the proposed controller has been examined for temperature control of an unstable reactor and its effectiveness has been demonstrated through computer simulation.
