Although NAND Flash memory wear-leveling has been well studied, all the existing algorithms aim to equalize the number of programming/erase cycles among all the memory blocks. Unfortunately, such a conventional design practice becomes increasingly suboptimal as inter-block variation becomes increasingly significant with the technology scaling. This brief presents a dynamic BER-based greedy wear-leveling algorithm that uses BER statistics as the measurement of memory block wear-out pace, and guides dynamic memory block data swapping to fully maximize the wear-leveling efficiency. Simulations have been carried out to quantitatively demonstrate its advantages over existing wear-leveling algorithms.", "paper_title": "Error Rate-Based Wear-Leveling for NAND Flash Memory at Highly Scaled Technology Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000320946200018"}
