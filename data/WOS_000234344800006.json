This scheme supplies to the DMC controller the linear model and the nonlinear output predictions at each sample instant, and is composed of two blocks. The first one makes use of a fuzzy partition of the external variable universe of discourse, which smoothly commutes between several linear models. In the second block, a recurrent linear neuron with interpretable weights performs the identification of the models by means of supervised learning. The resulting identifier has several main advantages: interpretability, learning speed, and robustness against catastrophic forgetting. The proposed controller has been tested both on simulation and on a real laboratory plant, showing a good performance.", "paper_title": "A neurofuzzy scheme to on-line identification in an adaptive-predictive control", "paper_id": "WOS:000234344800006"}
