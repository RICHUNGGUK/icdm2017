Evaluation methods and algorithms for design for assembly, design for disassembly, and design for recycling are proposed to estimate the assembly times and the disassembly times. By these results could be evaluated the assemblability, disassemblability, and recyclability of parts. Finally, a new integrated DFX system is implemented to help designers of product analyze environment-friendly products during the design process.", "paper_title": "Design for environment-friendly product", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300104"}
