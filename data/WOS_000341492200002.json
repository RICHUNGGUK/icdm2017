The first scheme is the well-known finite volume scheme with a two-point flux approximation, classically used in industry. The second class contains the so-called approximate gradient schemes, which include finite elements with mass lumping, mixed finite elements, and mimetic finite differences. Both (classes of) schemes are nonconforming and can be expressed using discrete function and gradient reconstructions within a variational formulation. Each class has its specific advantages and drawbacks: monotony properties are natural with the two-point finite volume scheme, but meshes are restricted due to consistency issues; on the contrary, gradient schemes can be used on general meshes, but monotony properties are difficult to obtain.", "paper_title": "TP or not TP, that is the question", "paper_id": "WOS:000341492200002"}
