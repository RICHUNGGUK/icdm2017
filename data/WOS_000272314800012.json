This methodology includes 1) four alternative variable ordering schemes: forward/backward phased dependent operations, and forward/backward concatenation; 2) a strategy to choose an adequate ordering scheme to process a new phased-mission system instance depending on its phase and mission configuration; and 3) efficient generation and evaluation algorithms for generalized phased-mission system binary decision diagrams adopting any arbitrary ordering scheme. The advantages of this methodology are in the low computational complexity, broad applicability, and easy implementation.", "paper_title": "New Insights Into the BDD-Based Reliability Analysis of Phased-Mission Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000272314800012"}
