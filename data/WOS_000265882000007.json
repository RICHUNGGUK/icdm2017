We show how to embed n-point negative-type metrics into Euclidean space l(2) with distortion D = O(log (3/4) n). This embedding result, in turn, implies an O(log (3/4) k)-approximation algorithm for the Sparsest Cut problem with nonuniform demands. Another corollary we obtain is that n-point subsets of l(1) embed into l(2) with distortion O(log (3/4) n).", "paper_title": "Embeddings of Negative-Type Metrics and An Improved Approximation to Generalized Sparsest Cut", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882000007"}
