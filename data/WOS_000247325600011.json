The numerical solution of such equations is always challenging because of its strong nonlinear phenomena and strong discontinuous interfaces. In this article, we design a symmetric finite volume method, develop the corresponding preconditioning technique, and propose a mesh adaptation algorithm based on Hessian matrix and a two-grid method. Using these new methods, we demonstrate that the energy conservation error and computation efficiency of the integrated algorithm are much better than classical method. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
