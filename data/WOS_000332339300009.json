The beams were constructed and tested in the laboratory under eccentric concentrated load at mid-span to obtain a combined loading case: torsion, bending, and shear. The reinforcement case parameters were as follows: without reinforcement, with longitudinal reinforcement only, and reinforced with steel bars and stirrups. All beams were tested under two different combined loading conditions: T/V = 545 mm (high eccentricity) and T/V = 145 mm (low eccentricity). The failure of the plain beams was brittle, and the addition of longitudinal steel bars increased beam strength, particularly under low eccentricity. Transverse reinforcement significantly affected the strength at high eccentricities, that is, at high torque. A program can predict accurately the behavior of these beams under different reinforcement cases, as well as under different ratios of combined loadings. The ANSYS model accurately predicted the loads and deflections for various types of reinforcements in spandrel beams, and captured the critical crack regions of these beams.", "paper_title": "Finite element analysis of reinforced concrete spandrel beams under combined loading", "paper_id": "WOS:000332339300009"}
