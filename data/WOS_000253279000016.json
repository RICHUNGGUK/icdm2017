In this framework, there exist elements which naturally play the role of integers, which are called beta-integers. The set of non-negative beta-integers, denoted by Z(beta)(+), has various equivalent definitions which arise from different points of view. Nevertheless, these definitions may be generalized on negative real numbers in a non-unique way, depending on the chosen framework. We focus in this article on confluent Parry units. They are the positive roots of the polynomials X-d - Sigma(d-1)(i=1) kX(i) - 1, where the integers d and k satisfy d >= 2 and k >= 1. For any of these numbers, we prove that there exists a discrete subset of R, that we denote by Z(beta)(s), which is locally isomorphic to Z(beta)(+), and such that Z(beta)(s) = -Z(beta)(s). Moreover, Z(beta)(s) is a model set and satisfies the inflation property: there exists lambda > 1 such that; lambda Z(beta)(s) subset of Z(beta)(s) (lambda is then called the inflation factor for Z(beta)(s)). Finally, we compute inflation factors for Z(beta)(s) of the form beta(i), i being a positive integer. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
