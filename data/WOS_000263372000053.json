By constructing the appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, two sufficient conditions ensuring the global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium point of such networks with interval-time-varying delays are established. The present results, together with two numerical examples, show that the equilibrium points of the considered networks may be globally asymptotically stable in some delay interval(s) even though the equilibrium points of the corresponding delay-free recurrent neural networks are not globally asymptotically stable.
