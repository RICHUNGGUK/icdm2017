Unlike many previous efforts, our framework considers several factors that affect end-to-end performance. Among these factors, the framework takes into account the effect of the relative positions of the links on a path when choosing the rates of operation and the importance of avoiding congested areas. The key element of our framework is a new comprehensive path metric that we call ETM (for expected transmission cost in multi-rate wireless networks). We analytically derive the ETM metric. We show that the ETM metric can be used to determine the best end-to-end path with a greedy routing approach. We also show that the metric can be used to dynamically select the best transmission rate for each link on the path via a dynamic programming approach. We implement the ETM-framework on an indoor wireless mesh network and compare its performance with that of frameworks based on the popular ETT and the recently proposed ETOP metrics. Our experiments demonstrate that the ETM-framework can yield throughput improvements of up to 253 and 368 % as compared with the ETT and ETOP frameworks.", "paper_title": "An integrated routing and rate adaptation framework for multi-rate multi-hop wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000320891600028"}
