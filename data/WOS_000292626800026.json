VC scheme encodes the secret image into the shares. Each participant holds one share. When the participants stack a sufficient number of shares, the secret image can be decrypted through the human visual system. However, in some situations, cheating is possible in the VC scheme. The dishonest participant, called a cheater, may provide a fake secret image to cheat the other participants. In this paper, we proposed a cheating scheme to prove that the cheater can cheat other participants in Hu and Tzeng's cheat-prevention scheme [1]. To achieve cheat-prevention in VC, we propose a novel transformation scheme. The proposed scheme can recognize the fake share by stacking shares in a special position in the verification stage. In our scheme, we can improve Hu and Tzeng's cheat-preventing scheme and transform the existing VC scheme into the cheat-prevention scheme. Moreover, our scheme does not need an extra verification share which would reduce the burden of share management for each participant.", "paper_title": "A CHEAT-PREVENTING VISUAL CRYPTOGRAPHY SCHEME BY REFERRING THE SPECIAL POSITION", "paper_id": "WOS:000292626800026"}
