In the present study we experimentally investigate the combination of support vector clustering with a triangular alignment kernel by evaluating it on an artificial time series benchmark dataset. The experiments lead to meaningful segmentations of the data, thereby providing an example that clustering time series with specific kernels is possible without pre-processing of the data. We compare our approach and the results and learn that the clustering quality is competitive when compared to other approaches. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
