We examined the contributions of the sensory information from the force-sensitive afferents in the ankle extensor muscle and from the position-sensitive afferents from the hip, inspired by a neuro-mechanical simulation for the stepping of the hind legs of cats. Our simulation results showed that the sensory signals related to the force in the ankle extensor muscle make a larger contribution than sensory signals related to the joint angle at the hip to produce robust walking against disturbances, as observed in the simulation results of cat locomotion. This suggests that such a sensorimotor mechanism is a general property and is also embedded in the neuro-control system of human bipedal walking. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
