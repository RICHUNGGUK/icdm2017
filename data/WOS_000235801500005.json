We present a PRISM-implementation of a general model for polyphonic music, based on Hidden Markov Models. Its probability parameters are automatically learned by running the built-in EM-algorithm of PRISM on training examples. We show how the model can be used as a classifier for music that guesses the composer of unknown fragments of music. Then we use it to automatically compose new music.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic-logical modeling of music", "paper_id": "WOS:000235801500005"}
