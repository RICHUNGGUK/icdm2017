These oriCs are organized into a MySQL database, DoriC, which provides extensive information and graphical views of the oriC regions. In addition, users can Blast a query sequence or even a whole genome against DoriC to find a homologous one. DoriC will be updated timely and the latest version is DoriC 1.8, in which oriCs of 425 genomes (468 chromosomes) are identified.", "paper_title": "DoriC: a database of oriC regions in bacterial genomes", "paper_id": "WOS:000249248300029"}
