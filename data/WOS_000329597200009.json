The time-varying jump transition probability matrix is described by a polytope. By Lyapunov function approach, mode-dependent and variation-dependent H-infinity filter is designed such that the resulting error dynamic system is stochastically stable and has a prescribed H-infinity performance index. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
