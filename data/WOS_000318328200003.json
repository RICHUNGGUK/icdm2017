The fuzzy semi-Kmeans is an extension of K-means clustering model, and it is inspired by an EM algorithm and a Gaussian mixture model. Additionally, the fuzzy semi-Kmeans provides the flexibility to employ different fuzzy membership functions to measure the distance between data. This work employs Gaussian weighting function to conduct experiments, but cosine similarity function can be used as well. This work conducts experiments on three data sets and compares fuzzy semi-Kmeans with several methods. The experimental results indicate that fuzzy semi-Kmeans can generally outperform the other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
