In this work we propose a Genetic Algorithm hybridized with a local search method that searches over the space of semi-active schedules and a heuristic seeding method that generates active schedules stochastically. We report results from an experimental study over a small set of selected problem instances of common use, and also over a set of big problem instances that clarify the influence of each method in the Genetic Algorithm performance.", "paper_title": "Genetic algorithms hybridized with greedy algorithms and local search over the spaces of active and semi-active schedules", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100025"}
