Resequencing is permitted where stations have access to intermittent or centralized resequencing buffers. The access to the buffers is restricted by the number of available buffer places and the physical size of the products. Characteristics such as the difference between the intermittent and the centralized case, the number of buffer places and the distribution of the buffer places are analyzed. Improvements that come with the introduction of constrained resequencing buffers are highlighted.", "paper_title": "Performance study of a genetic algorithm for sequencing in mixed model non-permutation flowshops using constrained buffers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237648300068"}
