At present time PCCs are recognized to be the most flexible class of multivariate copulas. Vine PCCs and semiparametric copula-based dynamic (SCOMDY) models with ARMA-GARCH margins are combined. As building blocks of the PCCs, bivariate t-copulas are used. Exchange rates are considered as an application and their dependence structure is modelled using regular and canonical vines. A non-nested model comparison of the above SCOMDY models is performed using the adapted Voung's test. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
