Although, in general, a bound in the reverse direction is impossible, in many applications the quantity of interest is actually D*(v, Q)-defined, for an arbitrary fixed Q, as the infimum of D(P parallel to Q) over all distributions P that are at least v-far away from Q in total variation. We show that D*(v, Q) <= Cv(2) + O(v(3)), where C = C(Q) = 1/2 for balanced distributions, thereby providing a kind of reverse Pinsker inequality. Some of the structural results obtained in the course of the proof may be of independent interest. An application to large deviations is given.", "paper_title": "Minimum KL-Divergence on Complements of L-1 Balls", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300008"}
