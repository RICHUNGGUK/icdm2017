A set of features describing dance is proposed, to quantify local gestures of the dancer as well as global stage usage. These features are used to compute similarities between recorded dance improvisations, which in turn serve to guide the visual exploration in the browsing methods presented here. The software integrating all these components is part of an interactive touch-screen installation, and is also accessible online in association with an artistic project. The different components of this browsing system are presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Browsing a dance video collection: dance analysis and interface design", "paper_id": "WOS:000208506600005"}
