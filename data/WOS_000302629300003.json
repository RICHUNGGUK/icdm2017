By applying a TF-IDF weighting method, a voting mechanism and importing term scores, an acceptable and stable clustering result can be obtained. The methodology has competitive advantages over the two existing types of approaches: symbolic techniques and supervised learning methods. It is a well-performed, efficient and non-human participating approach to solving sentiment analysis problems.", "paper_title": "Application of a clustering method on sentiment analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000302629300003"}
