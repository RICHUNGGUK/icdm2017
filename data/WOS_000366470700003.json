While this facilitates shorter, more efficient and frequent release cycles, it requires continuous testing. Having insight into application behavior through explicit models can largely support development, testing and maintenance. Model-based testing allows efficient test creation based on a description of the states the application can be in and the transitions between these states. As specifying behavior models that are precise enough to be executable by a test automation tool is a hard task, an alternative is to extract them from running applications. However, mining such models is a challenge, in particular because one needs to know when two states are equivalent, as well as how to reach that state. We present Process Crawler (ProCrawl), a tool to mine behavior models from web applications that support multi-user workflows. ProCrawl incrementally learns a model by generating program runs and observing the application behavior through the user interface. In our evaluation on several real-world web applications, ProCrawl extracted models that concisely describe the implemented workflows and can be directly used for model-based testing.", "paper_title": "Mining Workflow Models from Web Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000366470700003"}
