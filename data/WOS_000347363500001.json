To accurately compensate the hysteresis phenomena from the electromechanical devices, the modeling of actuator hysteresis is first integrated into the dynamics of multiple arms system. Then, the adaptive control scheme is introduced to reduce the harmful effects from unknown nonlinearities. Subsequently, the issue of the motion constraint is taken into account to facilitate the application in the condition of potential collisions. Furthermore, the stability analysis is carried out to guarantees the motion and internal forces in the robotic arms converge to the desired values. Simultaneously, the predetermined motion boundary is ensured to be never violated. Finally, comparative results are presented to illustrate the proposed scheme's effectiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
