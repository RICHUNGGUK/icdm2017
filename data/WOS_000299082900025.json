However, they are often not suitable to be used in many practical application domains because of their lack of transparency and comprehensibility. This paper proposes a new neuro-fuzzy method to investigate the characteristics of the facial images perceived as Iyashi by one hundred and fourteen subjects. Iyashi is a Japanese word used to describe a peculiar phenomenon that is mentally soothing, but is yet to be clearly defined. In order to gain a clear insight into the reasoning made by the nonlinear prediction models such as holographic neural networks (HNN) in the classification of Iyashi expressions, the interpretability of the proposed fuzzy-quantized HNN (FQHNN) is improved by reducing the number of input parameters, creating membership functions and extracting fuzzy rules from the responses provided by the subjects about a limited dataset of 20 facial images. The experimental results show that the proposed FQHNN achieves 2-8% increase in the prediction accuracy compared with traditional neuro-fuzzy classifiers while it extracts 35 fuzzy rules explaining what characteristics a facial image should have in order to be classified as Iyashi-stimulus for 87 subjects.", "paper_title": "Neuro-Fuzzy Quantification of Personal Perceptions of Facial Images Based on a Limited Data Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000299082900025"}
