Two variants are introduced and analyzed. A discretization is done by finite elements. It leads to a system of non-smooth, piecewise linear equations. This system is solved by the semismooth Newton method. Numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of this approach.", "paper_title": "Fictitious domain formulations of unilateral problems: analysis and algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000264319500004"}
