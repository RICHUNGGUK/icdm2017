As the number of known protein structures grows rapidly, the need for automatic methods for determining protein domains based on the proteins tree-dimensional structure becomes more desirable. In this paper, we introduce a new domain decomposition algorithm which is based on the dominating set of the graph representation of a protein. To evaluate our method, we compare our results with the other computational methods on a commonly used benchmark of 55 proteins. It is shown that the performance of our algorithm is better than the other automatic methods.", "paper_title": "A New Protein Domain Assignment Algorithm Based on the Dominating Set of a Graph", "paper_id": "WOS:000331850800018"}
