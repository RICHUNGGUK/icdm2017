They are often deployed in hostile environments and are left unattended for long periods of time without recharging. These sensor nodes can be compromised by adversaries who launch network layer attacks, such as sinkhole attacks, in which a compromised node is disguised as a base station and all packets forwarded to it are exposed to attackers. A localized encryption and authentication protocol (LEAP) observes the different types of the packets exchanged between the sensors to cope with the attacks. Although this method performs well for securing communication using multiple keys, the data is transmitted without consideration of efficient routing paths to limit energy consumption. Our proposed method selects the next forwarding node to allow an efficient path setup for the packet routing based on a fuzzy logic system. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method provides energy savings of up to 10% while maintaining the same level of security against sinkhole attacks compared to the existing method.
