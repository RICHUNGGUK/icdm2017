We prove that both of these operations require only O(n log(d-1) n) number of multiplications, where n is the number of univariate B-spline basis functions used in each coordinate direction and d is the number of variables of the functions. We also establish the optimal approximation order of the periodic B-spline quasi-interpolation. Numerical examples are presented to confirm the theoretical estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
