It relies on either an analytical profile for the velocity profile within the first off-wall cell or the solution of Turbulent Boundary Layer Equations. The latter are solved thanks to a meshless approach to obtain a user-friendly method. The proposed method is observed to be both robust and accurate, yielding very satisfactory results in plane channel flow up to R-et = 20000 on uniform grids with Delta x(+) = Delta y(+) = Delta z(+) = 1000. The computed maximum error on skin friction is about 4% in most investigated cases on the coarsest grids (10 grid points across the half-channel height). It lies within 1-2% on finer grids with 20-60 uniformly distributed grid points in the channel half-height. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
