In this analysis, we use methods and tools of the theory of super-recursive algorithms. The concept of algorithm of the second level is introduced and studied. It is demonstrated that although the main components of various check-point/recovery algorithms are recursive algorithms, check-point/recovery algorithms, as a whole, are super-recursive second-level algorithms. Treating network recovery algorithms as second level algorithms is oriented at developing more powerful algorithms by combining existing ones in a common schema.", "paper_title": "Second-Level Algorithms, Superrecursivity, and Recovery Problem in Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300242400007"}
