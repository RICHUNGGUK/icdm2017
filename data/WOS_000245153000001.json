In this paper, we show how the parallelization of both multigrid and multilevel multi-integration for these problems may be accomplished and discuss the scalability of the resulting code. A performance model of the solver is constructed and used to perform an analysis of the results obtained. Results are shown with good speed-ups and excellent scalability for distributed memory architectures and in agreement with the model.
