Crosstalk-immunity property of OR gate and relations between wire adjacency and cell I/O are exploited in technology mapping. Meanwhile, a metric to measure the crosstalk sensitivity of domino cells in synthesis level is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the crosstalk sensitivity of the synthesized domino-cell network is greatly reduced by 52% using our synthesis flow as compared with conventional methodology. Furthermore, after placement and routing are performed, the ratio of the number of crosstalk-immune wire pairs to the number of total wire pairs is about 24% using our methodology as compared to 9% using conventional techniques, and the maximum wire coupling can be greatly reduced from 95% to 60%.", "paper_title": "Crosstalk-aware domino-logic synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000246863300013"}
