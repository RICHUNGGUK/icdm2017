The state-of-the-art is illustrated at selected examples, chosen from nanostructured materials, quasicrystals, surface science and catalysis. Finally a brief outlook is given on current developments attempting to make post-DFT approaches applicable to materials-science problems. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
