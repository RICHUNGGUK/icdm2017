The goal of this study is to show how motion features (optic-flow), which have an inherent spatio-temporal profile, can be self-organised using correlations of precise spike intervals. The proposed framework is applied to the spiking output of an asynchronous dynamic vision sensor (DVS), which mimics the workings of the mammalian retina. Our results show that our framework is able to form a topologic organisation of optic-flow features similar to that observed in the human middle temporal lobe. (C) 2013 The Authors.
