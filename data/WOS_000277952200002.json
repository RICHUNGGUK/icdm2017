This paper discusses the problem of matchmaking for visualization web services, gives a unified visualization service description model to depict the services' basic properties, functional and non-functional properties, and proposes a matchmaking framework for visualization services discovery which is based on the ontology defined and permits user to specify his QoS request in order to get \"good\" visualization services. Meanwhile, a proof of concept is done with a prototype implementation, and a qualitative analysis and a quantitative test of the prototype system are given to evaluate its performance.", "paper_title": "Matchmaking framework for visualization web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000277952200002"}
