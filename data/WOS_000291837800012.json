The implemented control structure consists of a conventional controller and a neuro-fuzzy network-based feedback controller. The former is provided both to guarantee global asymptotic stability in compact space and as an inverse reference model of the response of the controlled system. Its output is used as an error signal by an incremental learning algorithm to update the parameters of the neuro-fuzzy controller. In this way the latter is able to gradually replace the conventional controller from the control of the system. The proposed new learning algorithm makes direct use of the variable structure systems theory and establishes a sliding motion in terms of the neuro-fuzzy controller parameters, leading the learning error toward zero. In the simulations and in the experimental studies, it has been tested on the control of antilock breaking system model and the analytical claims have been justified under the existence of uncertainty and large nonzero initial errors.
