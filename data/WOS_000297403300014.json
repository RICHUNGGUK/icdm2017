This problem consists of the selection and weighting of financial assets. Its goal is to form an investment strategy which maximizes a return measure and minimizes a risk measure. We perform a series of simulation experiments with historical data in the NASDAQ and S&P500 markets between 2006 and 2008. The results show that adding a terrain strategy to a previously successful Memetic Algorithm promoted niching and speciation of the population, which led to a significant improvement in the performance when compared to previous evolutionary methods. We also show that the use of Memetic Algorithms gives the evolved solutions a degree of adaptability to changes in a dynamic market. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
