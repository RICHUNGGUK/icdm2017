A remote iris acquisition system is set up to collect noncooperative iris video images. An objective method is used to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of the segmentation results. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method. The proposed method would make noncooperative iris recognition or iris surveillance possible.", "paper_title": "Video-Based Noncooperative Iris Image Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286388300006"}
