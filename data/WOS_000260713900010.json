Considering the risk of exposing trade secrets and the cost of gathering information, the centralized constraint optimization mechanism is infeasible when it comes to handling distributed scheduling problems in a real-world environment. This paper proposes an agent-based distributed coordination mechanism that integrates negotiation techniques with genetic algorithm to plan quasi-optimal order fulfillment schedules to mect customers' demands. In this study, to evaluate the performance and feasibility of our proposed mechanism, experiments are conducted using a mold manufacturing supply chain as an example. The experimental results reveal that the proposed distributed coordination mechanism is a feasible approach to resolving the order fulfillment conflicts in a Supply chain. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
