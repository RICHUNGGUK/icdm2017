We extend the well-known Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) construction for conventional trellises to tail-biting trellises. The BCJR-like labeling scheme yields a simple specification for the tail-biting trellis for the dual code, with the dual trellis having the same state-complexity profile as that of the primal code. Finally, we show that the algebraic specification of Forney for state spaces of conventional trellises has a natural extension to tail-biting trellises.", "paper_title": "Unifying views of tail-biting trellis constructions for linear block codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240776500006"}
