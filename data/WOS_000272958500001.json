Our aim is to assess the current state of the art, and also to understand to which extent QBF encodings can be evaluated producing certificates that can be checked in a reliable and efficient way. We conclude that, while the evaluation of some QBFs is still an open challenge, producing and checking certificates for many medium-to-large scale QBFs is feasible with the current technology.", "paper_title": "Evaluating and certifying QBFs: A comparison of state-of-the-art tools", "paper_id": "WOS:000272958500001"}
