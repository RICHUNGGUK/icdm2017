In this paper, we propose a novel location algorithm based on mean received signal strength (RSS) measurements. It incorporates Chan's hyperbolic position location algorithm and the extended Kalman filtering to achieve an accurate estimation. We have verified the scheme mentioned in the paper performed better than conventional received signal strength indicator (RSSI) location algorithm for the static location estimator in indoor sensor networks.", "paper_title": "A novel localization scheme based on RSS data for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100042"}
