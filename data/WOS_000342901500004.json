In order to perform reliable and trusted vehicular communications, one requirement is to ensure peer vehicle credibility by means of validating digital certificate attached to messages that are transmitted by other vehicles. However, in vehicular communication systems, certificate validation is more time consuming than in traditional networks because each vehicle receives a large number of messages in a short period. Another concern is the unsuccessful delivery of information between vehicles and other entities on the road due to their high mobility rate. For these reasons, we seek new solutions that will aid in speeding up the process of certificate validation. In this article, we propose a certificate revocation status validation scheme using the concept of clustering from data mining that can meet the aforementioned requirements. We employ the technique of k-Means clustering to boost the efficiency of certificate validation, thereby enhancing the security of a vehicular ad hoc network. Additionally, a comprehensive security analysis for this scheme is presented; the analysis shows that this scheme can effectively improve the validation of certificates and thus increase the communication security in vehicular ad hoc networks.
