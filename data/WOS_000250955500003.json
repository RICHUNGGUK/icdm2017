So we show that inclusion-exclusion coverings are characterized by the Shapley interaction index. Then inclusion-exclusion coverings are invariant under the transformations which characterize the Shapley value and/or the Shapley interaction index, and pieseive the Shapley value.", "paper_title": "Some relations among values, interactions, and decomposability of non-additive measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000250955500003"}
