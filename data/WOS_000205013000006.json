One common way of constructing such a backbone is based on the construction of a connected dominating set (CDS). In this article we present a very simple distributed algorithm for computing a small CDS. Our algorithm has an approximation factor of at most 6.91, improving upon the previous best-known approximation factor of 8 due to Wan et al. [2002]. The improvement relies on a refined analysis of the relationship between the size of a maximal independent set and a minimum CDS in a unit disk graph. This subresult also implies improved approximation factors for many existing algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Simple Improved Distributed Algorithm for Minimum CDS in Unit Disk Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000205013000006"}
