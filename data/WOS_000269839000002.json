A PIC group decoding decodes the symbols embedded in an STBC by dividing them into several groups and decoding each group separately after a linear PIC operation is implemented. It can be viewed as an intermediate decoding between the maximum likelihood (ML) receiver that decodes all the embedded symbols together, i.e., all the embedded symbols are in a single group, and the zero-forcing (ZF) receiver that decodes all the embedded symbols separately and independently, i.e., each group has and only has one embedded symbol, after the ZF operation is implemented. The PIC group decoding provides a framework to adjust the complexity-performance tradeoff by choosing the sizes of the information symbol groups. Our proposed design criterion (group independence) for the PIC group decoding to achieve full diversity is an intermediate condition between the loosest ML full rank criterion of codewords and the strongest ZF linear independence condition of the column vectors in the equivalent channel matrix. We also propose asymptotic optimal (AO) group decoding algorithm which is an intermediate decoding between the MMSE decoding algorithm and the ML decoding algorithm. The design criterion for the PIC group decoding can be applied to the AO group decoding algorithm because of its asymptotic optimality. It is well-known that the symbol rate for a full rank linear STBC can be full, i.e., n(l), for n(l) transmit antennas. It has been recently shown that its rate is upper bounded by 1 if a code achieves full diversity with a linear receiver. The intermediate criterion proposed in this paper provides the possibility for codes of rates between n(l) and that achieve full diversity with the PIC group decoding. This therefore provides a complexity-performance-rate tradeoff.
