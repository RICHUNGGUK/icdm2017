One may numerically compute a desired gait, e.g. one that has been optimized to be asymptotically stable without feedback. One would normally give the gait as commands to the controllers for the robot joints. However, control system outputs generally differ from the command given, and the faster the command changes with time, the more deviation there is. Iterative learning control (ILC) and repetitive control (RC) aim to fix this problem in situations where a command is repeating or periodic. Since gaits are periodic motions, it is natural to ask whether ILC/RC can be of use in implementing gaits in hardware. These control concepts are no substitutes for feedback control but work in combination with them by adjusting the commands to the feedback controllers from a higher level perspective. It is shown that the gait problem does not precisely fit either the ILC or the RC problem statements. Gait problems are necessarily divided into phases defined by foot strike times, and furthermore the durations of the phases are not the same from cycle to cycle during the learning process. Several methods are suggested to address these issues, and four repetitive control laws axe studied numerically. The laws that include both position and velocity error in the updates are seen to be the most effective. It appears that with appropriate refinement, such generalized RC laws could be very helpful in getting hardware to execute desired gaits.", "paper_title": "Investigating the use of iterative learning control and repetitive control to implement periodic gaits", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700009"}
