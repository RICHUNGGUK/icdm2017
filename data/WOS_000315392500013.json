First, an introduction to Delay-Tolerant Networks and Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks is given. Delay-Tolerant schemes and protocols can help in situations where network connectivity is sparse or with large variations in density, or even when there is no end-to-end connectivity by providing a communications solution for non real-time applications. Some special issues like routing are addressed in the paper and an introductory description of applications and the most important projects is given. Finally, some research challenges are discussed and conclusions are detailed.", "paper_title": "From Delay-Tolerant Networks to Vehicular Delay-Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000315392500013"}
