A commercial available hemispheric cup with five screw holes was used as the target acetabular cup. The simulation results showed that if screws were placed closed together, when the screw number increased from 1 to 5, the peak micromotion decreased less than 14%, from 126.5 to 108.8 mu m, while the stable region, micromotion less than 28 mu m, enlarged only by 40%, from 46.1% to 64.7%. However, if the screw could be placed near the cup rim, a single rim screw, 202.1 mu m micromotion, could provide better stability than that of four dome screws, 209.6 mu m micromotion, placed closed together. To conclude, multiple cup screws should be placed near cup rim and as separate as possible to enlarge the stable region and reduce the peak micromotion between cup and acetabulum.
