In this paper we aim to enable the vision of smart and safe cities by exploiting mobile and social networking technologies to securely and privately extract, model and embed real-time public safety information into quotidian user experiences. We first propose novel approaches to define location-and user-based safety metrics. We evaluate the ability of existing forecasting techniques to predict future safety values. We introduce iSafe, a privacy-preserving algorithm for computing safety snapshots of co-located mobile devices as well as geosocial network users. We present implementation details of iSafe as both an Android application and a browser plugin that visualizes safety levels of visited locations and browsed geosocial venues. We evaluate iSafe using crime and census data from the Miami-Dade (FL) county as well as data we collected from Yelp, a popular geosocial network.", "paper_title": "Towards Safe Cities: A Mobile and Social Networking Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000023"}
