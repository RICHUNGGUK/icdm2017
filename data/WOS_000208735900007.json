To consider this issue, a plenary panel was organised at the UK Operational Research Society's Simulation Workshop 2010 (SW10). This paper captures the discussion that took place and addresses the key questions and opportunities regarding ABS that will face the OR community in the future.", "paper_title": "Discrete-event simulation is dead, long live agent-based simulation!", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735900007"}
