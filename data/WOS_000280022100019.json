A radial basis function neural network is used to represent the controller's structure. The stability of the closed loop system is guaranteed through Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive controller is illustrated by considering two nonlinear systems: a two-inverted pendulum and a turbo generator. The simulation results verify the merits of the proposed controller. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
