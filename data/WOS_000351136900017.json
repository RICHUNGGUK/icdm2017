We obtain analytical results for the unitary dynamics of this system in the slow-qubit (or degenerate) regime, considering ultra-strong coupling between qubits and resonator mode, for which the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is no longer applicable. We also numerically investigate the dynamics beyond the slow-qubit condition in order to study the validity of the model in the presence of less strict conditions.", "paper_title": "Entanglement generation in the ultra-strongly coupled Rabi model", "paper_id": "WOS:000351136900017"}
