The review aims at laying bare their core philosophies, processes, and internal activities. This is done by using a process-centered template for summarizing the methodologies, highlighting the activities prescribed in the methodology while describing the modeling languages used (mainly diagrams and tables) as secondary to the activities. The descriptions produced using this template aim not to offer a critique on the methodologies and processes, but instead provide an abstract and structured description in a way that facilitates their elaborate analysis for the purposes of improving understanding, and making it easier to tailor, select, and evaluate the processes.", "paper_title": "Process-centered review of object oriented software development methodologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000253939100003"}
