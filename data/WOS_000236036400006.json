We use ontologies as 'brain' for the holonic diagnostic system to enhance its ability to structure information in a meaningful way and share information fast. To integrate distributed heterogeneous knowledge available on the Web we use intelligent agents augmented by the mechanisms of the technology of fuzzy sets, which automatically structures the information in the adequate ontology template. Our vision of how this system implementation should be supported by a solid security shield that ensures the privacy and safety of medical information concludes the paper. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
