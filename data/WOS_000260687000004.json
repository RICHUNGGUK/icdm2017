There are many known examples of EDD in one-dimensional CA, but not in higher dimensions. We describe the results of an automated search for two-dimensional CA exhibiting EDD. We found a plethora of examples of EDD, but we also found that the proportion of CA with EDD declines rapidly with increasing neighbourhood size.", "paper_title": "Emergent Defect Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000260687000004"}
