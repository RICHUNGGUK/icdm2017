In spite of many researchers' persistent efforts, there are still some challenging problems to be solved. In this paper, we focus on mining non-free-choice constructs, where the process models are represented in Petri nets. In fact, there are totally two kinds of causal dependencies between tasks, i.e., explicit and implicit ones. Implicit dependency is very hard to mine by current mining approaches. Thus we propose three theorems to detect implicit dependency between tasks and give their proofs. The experimental results show that our approach is powerful enough to mine process models with non-free-choice constructs.", "paper_title": "Detecting implicit dependencies between tasks from event logs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000052"}
