The stream cipher LEX, based on this methodology and on the AES block cipher, was selected to round 3 of the eSTREAM competition. The suggested methodology seemed promising, and LEX, due to its elegance, simplicity, and performance, was expected to be selected to the eSTREAM portfolio. In this article we present a key recovery attack on LEX. The attack requires about 2(40) bytes of key-stream produced by the same key (possibly under many different IVs), and retrieves the secret key in time of about 2(100) AES encryptions. Following a preliminary version of our attack, LEX was discarded from the final portfolio of eSTREAM.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of the Stream Cipher LEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000316821200005"}
