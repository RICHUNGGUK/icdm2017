However, most of these tools provide inadequate display of insertions and can be cumbersome to use on large datasets. I implemented PyBamView, a lightweight Web application for visualizing short read alignments. It provides an easy-to-use Web interface for viewing alignments across multiple samples, with a focus on accurate visualization of insertions.", "paper_title": "PyBamView: a browser-based application for viewing short read alignments", "paper_id": "WOS:000345827400019"}
