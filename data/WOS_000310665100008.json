Current solutions focus mainly on efficient power consumption at the micro level; few consider large-scale energy-management strategies. The low-carbon, nationwide GreenStar Network in Canada uses network and server virtualization techniques to migrate data center services among network nodes according to renewable energy availability. The network deploys a \"follow the sun, follow the wind\" optimization policy as a virtual infrastructure-management technique.", "paper_title": "Toward a Zero-Carbon Network Converging Cloud Computing and Network Virtualization", "paper_id": "WOS:000310665100008"}
