The HBMOLS algorithm proposed is inspired from the IBEA algorithm, an indicator-based multi-objective evolutionary algorithm proposed by Zitzler and Kunzli in 2004, where the optimization goal is defined in terms of a binary indicator defining the selection operator. In this paper, we use the indicator optimization principle, and we apply it to an iterated local search algorithm, using hypervolume contribution indicator as selection mechanism. The methodology proposed here has been defined in order to be easily adaptable and to be as parameter-independent as possible. We carry out a range of experiments on the multi-objective flow shop problem and the multi-objective quadratic assignment problem, using the hypervolume contribution selection as well as two different binary indicators which were initially proposed in the IBEA algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the HBMOLS algorithm is highly effective in comparison with the algorithms based on binary indicators.", "paper_title": "Hypervolume-based multi-objective local search", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400011"}
