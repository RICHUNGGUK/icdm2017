We extended it with LEO-II and Satallax, the two most prominent higher-order ATPs, improving its performance on higher-order problems. To explore their usefulness, these ATPs are measured against first-order ATPs and built-in Isabelle tactics on a variety of benchmarks from Isabelle and the TPTP library. Sledgehammer provides an ideal test bench for individual features of LEO-II and Satallax, revealing areas for improvements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
