This set is a unique signature for a given pulsar. It can be used to decide whether a pulsar is newly discovered or not. Features can be constructed from coefficients of a wavelet decomposition. Two types of wavelet based pulsar features are proposed. The energy based features reflect the multiscale distribution of the energy of coefficients. The singularity based features first classify the signals into a class with one peak and a class with two peaks by exploring the number of the straight wavelet modulus maxima lines perpendicular to the abscissa, and then implement further classification according to the features of skewness and kurtosis. Experimental results show that the wavelet based features can gain comparatively better performance over the shape parameter based features not only in the clustering and classification, but also in the error rates of the recognition tasks.
