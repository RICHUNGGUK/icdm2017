In one problem nodes are associated with security labels that impose father-child relations. We prove that the feasible solutions define a matroid. In the other problem, there are permission constraints which impose descendant-ancestor relations. We show that even simple special cases of this problem are not approximable within a sub-logarithmic factor, and describe a square root approximation when the edge weights satisfy the triangle inequality.
