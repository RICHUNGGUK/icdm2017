Oversampling and noise-shaping is employed to enable a coarsely quantized conversion with high effective resolution. The time-domain output waveform from a delta-sigma modulator is often impossible to predict analytically, therefore modulator design is largely based on high level digital simulations and rule-of-thumb estimation. However, the output waveform also largely determines the distortion caused by analog error sources in the converter. Therefore optimization of the modulator with regards to digital quantization noise might not yield an optimal design when analog errors are included. This paper extends common estimation methods to include analog error sources, with the objective of enabling more global rule-of-thumb optimization.", "paper_title": "Review and advances in delta-sigma DAC error estimation based on additive noise modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000273587200007"}
