It is assumed that the conditional distribution is either discrete or that it has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Partitioning estimates of the conditional distribution are constructed and results concerning consistency and rate of convergence of the integrated total variation error of the estimates are presented.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions", "paper_id": "WOS:000246034600021"}
