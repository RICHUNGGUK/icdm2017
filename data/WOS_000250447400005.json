In the recent past, several algorithms have been presented in the literature that aim at putting the expression analogy paradigm into practice. Some of these methods exclusively handle expression mapping between 3-D face models, while others enable the transfer of expressions between images of faces only. None of them, however, represents a more general framework that can be applied to either of these two face representations. In this paper, we describe a novel generic method for analogy-based facial animation that employs the same efficient framework to transfer facial expressions between arbitrary 3-D face models, as well as between images of performer's faces. We propose a novel geometry encoding for triangle meshes, vertex-tent-coordinates, that enables us to formulate expression transfer in the 2-D and the 3-D case as a solution to a simple system of linear equations. Our experiments show that our method outperforms many previous analogy-based animation approaches in terms of achieved animation quality, computation time and generality.", "paper_title": "A generic framework for efficient 2-d and 3-d facial expression analogy", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447400005"}
