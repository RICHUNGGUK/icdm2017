However, to support the operations of a VE, a resource planning system (RPS) is required. In this study, a systematic and hierarchical approach which consists of top-down modeling and bottom-up implementation steps is proposed and used for developing the RPS. Following this approach, a Predicate/Transition (Pr/ Tr) net model for resource planning is derived. In addition, activity-based costing (ABC) is applied to provide a financial measure, profit, which is believed to be more meaningful in a collaborative environment. The Pr/Tr net model is further transformed into Horn clauses, and implemented by a logical programming language, Visual Prolog. Finally, a RPS which contains graphical user interface, model and knowledge database is developed. In the RPS, the goals and dispatching rules call be easily included and evaluated. In addition, the schedules based oil the best dispatching rule can be generated. An example of horizontal collaborative manufacturing is used to illustrate the application of the RPS and the generation of the schedules. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
