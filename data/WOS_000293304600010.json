Both algorithms are based on the self-organizing map (SUM) for which an application in W is not typical. The first is Somhom's algorithm, and the second is the Co-adaptive net. These algorithms are augmented by a simple approximation of the shortest path among obstacles in W. Moreover, the competitive and cooperative rules are modified by recent adaptation rules for the Euclidean TSP, and by proposed enhancements to improve the algorithms' performance in the non-Euclidean TSP. Based on the modifications, two new variants of the algorithms are proposed that reduce the required computational time of their predecessors by an order of magnitude, therefore making SUM more competitive with combinatorial heuristics. The results show how SUM approaches can be used in the polygonal domain so they can provide additional features over the classical combinatorial approaches based on the complete visibility graph.
