In the present work, comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity index analysis were conducted on a large series of selective inhibitors of trypanosomatid GAPDH. Four statistically significant models were obtained (r(2) > 0.90 and q(2) > 0.70), indicating their predictive ability for untested compounds. The models were then used to predict the potency of an external test set, and the predicted values were in good agreement with the experimental results. Molecular modeling studies provided further insight into the structural basis for selective inhibition of trypanosomatid GAPDH.", "paper_title": "Structural basis for selective inhibition of trypanosomatid glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase: Molecular docking and 3D QSAR studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000255448400022"}
