Details of the fulling mill and its operation are presented, and innovative technical developments to accurately convert existing data (technical drawings, CAD models, etc) into a 3D model are described. Preliminary evaluation of the usefulness of the model as an aid to support the undergraduate teaching module are also presented. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
