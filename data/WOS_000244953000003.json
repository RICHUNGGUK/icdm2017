The relaxations here provided allow state and input dependence of the membership functions' derivatives, as well as independence on initial conditions when input constraints are needed. Moreover, the controller synthesis is attainable via linear matrix inequalities, which are efficiently solved by commercially available software.", "paper_title": "Nonquadratic stabilization of continuous-time systems in the Takagi-Sugeno form", "paper_id": "WOS:000244953000003"}
