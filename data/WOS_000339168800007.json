Increasing channel width increases capacity, but it comes at the cost of decreased transmission range and greater susceptibility to interference. However, with the incorporation of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology in 802.11n, devices can now exploit the increased transmission rates from wider channels with minimal sacrifice to signal quality and range. The goal of our work is to identify the network factors that influence the performance of channel bonding in 802.11n networks and make intelligent channel bonding decisions. We discover that channel width selection should consider not only a link's signal quality, but also the strength of neighboring links, their physical rates, and interferer load. We use our findings to design and implement a network detector that successfully identifies interference conditions that affect channel bonding decisions in 100% of our test cases. Our detector can form the foundation for more robust and accurate algorithms that can adapt bandwidth to variations in channel conditions. Our findings allows us to predict the impact of network conditions on performance and make channel bonding decisions that maximize throughput.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Channel Bonding in 802.11n WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168800007"}
