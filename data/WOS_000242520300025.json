SpeedNet is intended to track mobile users and their speed passively for both speed policing and control of traffic. The speed of the vehicle is controlled in a speed critical zone by means of an electro-mechanical control system, suitably referred to as VVLS (Vehicular Velocity Limiting System). VVLS is mounted on the vehicle and responds to the command signals generated by the base station. It also determines the next base station to handoff, in order to improve the connection reliability and bandwidth efficiency of the underlying network. Robust Extended Kalman Filter (REKF) is used as a passive velocity estimator of the mobile user with the widely used proportional and integral controller speed control. We demonstrate through simulation and analysis that our prediction algorithm can successfully estimate the mobile user's velocity with low system complexity as it requires two closest mobile base station measurements and also it is robust against system uncertainties due to the inherent deterministic nature in the mobility model.
