However, current MSK models are often limited by their oversimplifications in anatomical geometries, sometimes lacking discrete representations of connective tissue components entirely, which ultimately affect their accuracy in biomechanical simulation. in particular, the aponeuroses - the flattened fibrous connective sheets connecting muscle fibres to tendons - have never been geometrically modeled. The initiative was thus to extend Anatomy3D - a previously developed software bundle for reconstructing muscle fibre architecture to incorporate aponeurosis -modeling capacity. Two different algorithms for aponeurosis reconstruction were written in the MEL scripting language of the animation software Maya 6.0, using its NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) modeling functionality for aponeurosis surface representation. Both algorithms were validated qualitatively against anatomical and functional criteria. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
