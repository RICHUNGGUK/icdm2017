An intrinsic error-correction circuit corrects errors introduced by the detectors. Our controlled-phase gate has a 1/4 success probability. Recent development in cluster-state quantum computing has shown that a two-qubit gate with non-zero success probability can build an arbitrarily large cluster state only with polynomial overhead. Hence, it is possible to generate optical cluster states without number-resolving detectors and with polynomial overhead.", "paper_title": "Alternate scheme for optical cluster-state generation without number-resolving photon detectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000251175600012"}
