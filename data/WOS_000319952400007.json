The procedure was is involved in the quantification of facial palsy using pre-marked points. The recognition is done in two steps: in the first step a detection of the pre-marked mimic points on a human face is performed and in the second step the mutual distances between points are calculated. A procedure of deducing the mobility or the immobility of points and the amplitude of mimic points movement follows.", "paper_title": "Erosion based Method for Quantification of Facial Palsy", "paper_id": "WOS:000319952400007"}
