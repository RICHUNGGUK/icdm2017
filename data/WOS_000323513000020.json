Graphlet constitutes an efficient and common framework for interpreting host behaviors, which essentially consists of a visual representation as a graph. However, graphlet analyses face the issues of choosing between supervised and unsupervised approaches. The former can analyze a priori defined behaviors but is blind to undefined classes, while the latter can discover new behaviors at the cost of difficult a posteriori interpretation. This paper aims at bridging the gap between the two. First, to handle unknown classes, unsupervised clustering is originally revisited by extracting a set of graphlet-inspired attributes for each host. Second, to recover interpretability for each resulting cluster, a synoptic graphlet, defined as a visual graphlet obtained by mapping from a cluster, is newly developed. Comparisons against supervised graphlet-based, port-based, and payload-based classifiers with two datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the unsupervised clustering of graphlets and the relevance of the a posteriori interpretation through synoptic graphlets. This development is further complemented by studying evolutionary tree of synoptic graphlets, which quantifies the growth of graphlets when increasing the number of inspected packets per host.", "paper_title": "Synoptic Graphlet: Bridging the Gap Between Supervised and Unsupervised Profiling of Host-Level Network Traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000323513000020"}
