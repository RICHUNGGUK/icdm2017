The boundary voxels in the digital representation are identified and then replaced by a boundary triangulation of the similar resolution as the original digital image. This triangulation is then subjected to recursive subdivision to recover a smooth surface of the microstructure which is then retriangulated according to a user specified resolution. Finally, the interior of the microstructure is discretized. The performance of the proposed approach is shown on an example. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
