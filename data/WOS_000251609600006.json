The stego-codes are defined over the field with q(q >= 2) elements. A method of constructing linear stego-codes is proposed by using the direct sum of vector subspaces. And the problem of linear stego-codes is converted to an algebraic problem by introducing the concept of the tth dimension of a vector space. Some bounds on the length of stego-codes are obtained, from which the maximum length embeddable (MLE) code arises. It is shown that there is a corresponding relation between MLE codes and perfect error-correcting codes. Furthermore the classification of all MLE codes and a lower bound on the number of binary MLE codes are obtained based on the corresponding results on perfect codes. Finally hiding redundancy is defined to value the performance of stego-codes.", "paper_title": "A coding problem in steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000251609600006"}
