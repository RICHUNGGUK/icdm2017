We propose three algorithms based on text processing techniques to cluster articles in newspaper pages. Based on the complexity of the three algorithms and experiments on actual pages from the Italian newspaper L'Adige, we select one of the algorithms as the preferred choice to solve the textual clustering problem.", "paper_title": "Textual article clustering in newspaper pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000241520800003"}
