The viscous flow in a time dependent domain is described by the Navier-Stokes equations written with the aid of the Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) method. The equations of motion for elastic deformations of the human vocal folds are coupled with the equations for the fluid flow using either loose or strong coupling. The space discretization of the flow problem is carried out by the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. For the time discretization we use a semi-implicit scheme. In order to derive the space-time discretization of the elastic body problem, we apply the finite element method using continuous piecewise linear elements. For the time discretization we use the Newmark scheme. Results of numerical experiments are presented.", "paper_title": "Numerical simulation of fluid-structure interaction of compressible flow and elastic structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100020"}
