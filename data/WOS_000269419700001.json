Particularly relevant is the field of fuzzy linear programming (FLP). Its applications as well as practical realizations can be found in all the real world areas. As FLP problems constitute the basis for solving fuzzy optimization problems, in this paper a basic introduction to the main models and methods in FLP is presented and, as a whole, Linear Programming problems with fuzzy costs, fuzzy constraints and fuzzy coefficients in the technological matrix are analyzed. But fuzzy sets and systems based optimization methods do not end with FLP, and hence in order to solve more complex optimization problems, fuzzy sets based Meta-heuristics are considered, and two main operative approaches described. Provided that these techniques obtain efficient and/or effective solutions, we present a fuzzy rule based methodology for coordinating Meta-heuristics and in addition, to provide intelligence, we propose a process of extraction of the knowledge to conduct the coordination of the system.", "paper_title": "Towards a new strategy for solving fuzzy optimization problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000269419700001"}
