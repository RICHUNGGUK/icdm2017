However, they cannot 1) acquire new knowledge from data and 2) correct false prior knowledge, thus reducing the game-based learning ability. This paper utilizes Hebbian Learning Rule to solve the first problem and uses Unbalance Degree to solve the second problem. As a result, an improved FCM gains the ability of self-learning from both data and prior knowledge. The improved FCM, therefore, is intelligent enough to work as a teacher to guide the study process. Based on the improved FCM, a novel game-based learning model is proposed, including a teacher submodel, a learner submodel, and a set of game-based learning mechanisms. The teacher submodel has enough knowledge and intelligence to deduce the answers by the improved FCM. The learner submodel records students' study processes. The game-based learning mechanism realizes the guided game-based learning process with the support of the teacher submodel. A driving training prototype system is presented as a case study to present a way to realize a real system based on the proposed models. Extensive experimental results justify the model in terms of the controlling and guiding the study process of the student.", "paper_title": "Guided Game-Based Learning Using Fuzzy Cognitive Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000292541700008"}
