We formally define a broad class of problems of this type, capturing situations in which the pattern is obtained from the text by a sequence of rearrangements. We consider several natural rearrangement schemes, including the analogues of the l(1) and l(2) distances, as well as two distances based on interchanges. For these. we present efficient algorithms to solve the resulting string matching problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
