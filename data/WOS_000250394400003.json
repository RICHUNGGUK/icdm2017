Necessary and sufficient optimality conditions are derived. Numerical methods for the model equation and its adjoint are presented. Computational results based on a steepest descent method are given for two test examples underlining the feasibility of our approach.", "paper_title": "Optimal control in radiative transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000250394400003"}
