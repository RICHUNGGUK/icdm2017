By using the principles of systems dynamics and polynomial control theory, this paper demonstrates how to convert a function-based policy problem into a parameter-based policy problem which can then be solved with a programming model based on genetic algorithm. A case of multi-vendor inventory system is studied to validate the proposed programming model and solution methods. This paper is of theoretical and practical significance in developing and perfecting the fundamental principles of Systems Dynamics as well as in exploring the theories of socio-economic system control and policy optimization.", "paper_title": "A STUDY OF THE FUNCTION-BASED POLICY OPTIMIZATION IN SYSTEM DYNAMICS MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000278688700037"}
