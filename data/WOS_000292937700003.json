Our objective was to analyze the response of carotid artery subjected to inflation/extension with phenomenological and microstructure-based candidate strain-energy functions (SEFs), according to species (rabbit vs. pig) and region (proximal vs. distal). Histological variations among segments were examined, aiming to explicitly relate them with the differential material response. The Fung-type model could not capture the biphasic response alone. Combining a neo-Hookean with a two-fiber family term alleviated this restraint, but force data were poorly captured, while consideration of low-stress anisotropy via a quadratic term allowed improved simulation of both pressure and force data. The best fitting was achieved with the quadratic and Fung-type or four-fiber family SEF. The latter simulated more closely than the two-fiber family the high-stress response, being structurally justified for all artery types, whereas the quadratic term was justified for transitional and muscular arteries exhibiting notable elastin anisotropy. Diagonally arranged fibers were associated with pericellular medial collagen, and circumferentially and longitudinally arranged fibers with medial and adventitial collagen bundles, evidenced by the significant correlations of SEF parameters with quantitative histology.", "paper_title": "Differential histomechanical response of carotid artery in relation to species and region: mathematical description accounting for elastin and collagen anisotropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000292937700003"}
