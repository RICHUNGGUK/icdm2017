Ripples in the envelope function cause spreading of the transmitted signal spectrum into adjacent channels when the signal passes through non-linear elements in the transmission path. This results in the failure to meet transmission standard requirements. In this paper, two time-domain techniques are proposed to compensate for the magnitude and phase characteristics of the two analog reconstruction filters. The techniques are based on the minimization of the H-2 norm of the error transfer function and are formulated using state-space equations. Simulation and implementation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the new techniques.", "paper_title": "Design of digital compensation filters in IQ modulator by H-2 norm minimization - A state-space approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981400001"}
