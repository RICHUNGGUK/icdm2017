Each pixel of an image is represented by a vector where the components of the vector constitute the reflectance value of the surface for each of the bands. The length of the vector is equal to the number of bands. Due to the presence of large number of bands, classification of hyperspectral images becomes computation intensive. Moreover, higher correlation among neighboring bands increases the redundancy among them. As a result, feature selection becomes very essential for reducing the dimensionality. In the proposed work, an attempt has been made to develop a supervised feature selection technique guided by evolutionary algorithms. Self-adaptive differential evolution (SADE) is used for feature subset generation. Generated subsets are evaluated using a wrapper model where fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier is taken into consideration. Our proposed method also uses a feature ranking technique, ReliefF algorithm, for removing duplicate features. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, investigation is carried out on three sets of data and the results are compared with four other evolutionary based state-of-the-art feature selection techniques. The proposed method shows promising results compared to others in terms of overall classification accuracy and Kappa coefficient. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
