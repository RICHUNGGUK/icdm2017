The working surface is deformable. The geometric and physical model of the surface is unknown and all contact force is nonlinear and difficult to model. To accomplish a task of this kind, we propose a force/motion fuzzy controller based on the philosophy of the parallel approach in two decoupled subspaces. In one subspace, we control the constant contact force normal to the surface and estimate the end-effector tool's deformable depth of the surface; in the other, we keep the end-effector's constant velocity parallel to the tangential plane of the surface and suppress the tangential force of the surface deformation. The nonholonomic mobile base is utilized to avoid the singularity. Stability is established and conditions for the control parameters are derived. Performance of the proposed controller is verified through computer simulations compared with the model-based control.", "paper_title": "Intelligent compliant force/motion control of nonholonomic mobile manipulator working on the nonrigid surface", "paper_id": "WOS:000238327700003"}
