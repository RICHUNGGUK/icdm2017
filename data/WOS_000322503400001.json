By means of Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy models, the fuzzy controller systems and the overall closed-loop fuzzy dynamics are constructed. A sufficient condition is firstly established on the stochastic stability using stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional. Then in terms of linear matrix inequalities techniques, the sufficient conditions on the existence of mode-dependent state feedback L-2-L-infinity fuzzy controller are presented and proved respectively for constant and time varying case. Finally, the design problems are formulated as optimization algorithms. Simulation results are exploited to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed techniques. (C) 2013 IMACS.
