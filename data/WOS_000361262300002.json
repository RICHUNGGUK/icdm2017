The goal of this paper is to provide a coordination model (formalised as a process algebra) capturing the relevant aspects of such systems. It should allow the behaviour of large-scale, situated, and self-organising systems to be conveniently expressed, paving the way towards their rigorous study as well as development of supporting platforms. Focusing on the recently introduced concept of pervasive ecosystems, the proposed model revolves around (i) the notion of a distributed and dynamic space of \"live semantic annotations\" (wrapping data, knowledge, and the relevant facts about activities of humans, devices, and services) upon which autonomous agents coordinate and (ii) a small set of chemical-resembling coordination rules that enforce mechanisms of diffusion, aggregation, decay, and bonding between such annotations.
