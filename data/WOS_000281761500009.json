To enhance the morphing procedure, we employ permutations of atoms: we seek to find the permutation sigma that minimizes the mean-square distance traveled by the atoms. Instead of performing this combinatorial search in the space of permutations, we show that the best permutation can be found by solving a linear assignment problem. We demonstrate that the use of such optimal permutations significantly improves the efficiency of the free-energy computation.", "paper_title": "A linear assignment approach for the least-squares protein morphing problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000281761500009"}
