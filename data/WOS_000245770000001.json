The characterization of ideal access structures and the search for bounds on the optimal information rate are two important problems in secret sharing. This paper deals with these problems for 3-homogeneous access structures, that is, whenever the minimal qualified subsets have exactly three participants. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
