The luminance mechanism was explored by analyzing the characteristics of devices with different doping concentrations. It was found that DSA-ph showed effective assistant energy transfer ability in the system. When 1.5% DSA-ph and 0.5% DCJTB were doped, the energy of the system could be most effectively utilized, achieving a maximum luminance efficiency of 14.26 cd/A at 40 mA/cm(2), with a color rendering index of 80. The Commission International de L'Eclairage coordinates changed slightly from (0.3381, 0.3327) to (0.3336, 0.3203), as the applied current density increased from 20 mA/cm(2) to 200 mA/cm(2). The high efficiency could be attributed to effective utilization of host energy, as well as the depression of concentration quenching, and the color stability may be ascribed to the efficient energy transfer from host to both guests in direct and indirect ways and efficient exciton confinement.
