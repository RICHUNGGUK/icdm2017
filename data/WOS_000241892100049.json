The complexity of the clonal selection detection algorithm for V-BLAST system (CA-VBLAST) is analyzed and the bit error ratio (BER) performance is verified via computer simulations. Simulation results show that the BER performance of CA-VBLAST detector with proper algorithm parameters is comparable with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector which presents the best BER performance but the highest computational complexity, and our CA-VBLAST detector obtains a much more decreased complexity.", "paper_title": "Clonal selection detection algorithm for the V-BLAST system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100049"}
