To define s(n) we consider pairs of words w,w' over A of length at most n equal in S and use relations from R for the derivations bounds from above the lengths of the words w (i) at intermediate steps, i.e., the space sufficient to implement all such transitions . One of the results obtained is the following criterion: A finitely generated semigroup S has decidable word problem of polynomial space complexity if and only if S is a subsemigroup of a finitely presented semigroup H with polynomial space function.", "paper_title": "Space Functions and Space Complexity of the Word Problem in Semigroups", "paper_id": "WOS:000327323300003"}
