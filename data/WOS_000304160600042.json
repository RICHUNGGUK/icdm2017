Job scheduling in a wafer fabrication factory is a very difficult task. To solve this problem, two intelligent scheduling rules are proposed in this study. The intelligent scheduling rules are modified from the well-known fluctuation smoothing rules with some innovative treatments. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, production simulation was also applied in this study. According to experimental results, the proposed methodology outperformed some existing approaches by reducing the average cycle time and cycle time standard deviation, the most important objectives of job scheduling in a wafer fabrication factory.", "paper_title": "Intelligent scheduling approaches for a wafer fabrication factory", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600042"}
