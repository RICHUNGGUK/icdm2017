In this paper, we extend EigenAnt to the sequential ordering problem (SOP), comparing its performance to Gambardella et al.'s enhanced ant colony system (EACS), a model that has been found to have state-of-the-art performance on the SOP. Our experimental results, using the SOPLIB2006 instance library, indicate that there is no statistically significant difference in performance between our proposed method and the state-of-the-art EACS method.", "paper_title": "A bare-bones ant colony optimization algorithm that performs competitively on the sequential ordering problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000343289700003"}
