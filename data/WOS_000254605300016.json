We clarify that, for a given individual sequence, the optimal cost attainable by the blockwise lossy encoders is equal to the optimal average cost with respect to the empirical distribution of the given sequence. Moreover, we show that, for a given nonstationary source, the optimal cost attainable by the blockwise encoders is equal to the supremum of the optimal average cost over all the stationary sources in the stationary hull of the given source. In addition, we show that the universal lossy coding algorithm based on Lempel-Ziv 78 code attains the optimal cost for any individual sequence and any nonstationary source.", "paper_title": "Fixed-slope universal lossy coding for individual sequences and nonstationary sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300016"}
