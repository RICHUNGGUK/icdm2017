First of all, according to the principles of different heuristics that the metaheuristics derived from, 5 categories are classified. Then based on the analysis of the characteristics of the problem, a framework of the generalized procedure to solve LSVRP is given. The techniques of knowledge representation, state-space search theory, heuristics, and modeling optimization used in the procedure are elaborated. Finally, a comparison study is given to show the procedure's competitiveness. The new idea of incorporating the qualitative reasoning into quantitative approaches can strengthen the procedure's capability of dealing with empirical information. It is beneficial to greatly decreasing the number of possible routing schemes, and meanwhile, improving the practicability of the procedure.", "paper_title": "LARGE SCALE VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM: AN OVERVIEW OF ALGORITHMS AND AN INTELLIGENT PROCEDURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800028"}
