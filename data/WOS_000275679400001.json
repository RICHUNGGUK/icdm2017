In this study, molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) surfaces of phencyclidine-like (PCP-like) compounds are modeled and visualized in order to extract features that are useful in predicting binding affinities. In modeling, the Cartesian coordinates of MEP surface points are mapped onto a spherical self-organizing map (SSOM). The resulting maps are visualized using electrostatic potential (ESP) values. These values also provide features for a prediction system. Support vector machines and partial least-squares method are used for predicting binding affinities of compounds.
