The new numerical scheme of the DSM enables to consider scattering from such substrate defects as flat particles, mounds, pits and voids. A detailed description of the numerical scheme is provided. The developed computer model has been employed to investigate scattering from a shallow particle and pit. Simulation results corresponding to the Differential Scattering Cross-Section and the integral response for P/S polarized light are presented. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
