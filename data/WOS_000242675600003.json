Under stochastic demand modeled using scenarios, we maximize the expected demand coverage subject to a budget constraint on hub installation, and technological constraints on demand coverage by installed hubs. There are multiple hub types, differing in costs and capacities. We present a practical greedy heuristic based on the budgeted maximum-coverage problem and analyze its worst-case performance. For special cases with a single hub type or a single demand scenario, we show that a guarantee of 1-1/e or 63.2% applies to our greedy heuristic. For the general case we develop a data-dependent performance guarantee. Through computational experiments, we show that the greedy heuristic's empirical performance is, on average, within 2% of the optimal expected demand coverage.", "paper_title": "Budget-constrained, capacitated hub location to maximize expected demand coverage in fixed-wireless telecommunication networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242675600003"}
