Some key references on the above-mentioned aspects pertaining to the machine are discussed briefly. Particular emphasis is given on the design and performance analysis of AFPM machines. A comparison among different permanent magnet machines is also provided. Thus, this paper makes a bridge between the currently used permanent magnet machines in industry and the recent developments of AFPM machines.", "paper_title": "A Comprehensive Review of Axial-Flux Permanent-Magnet Machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000339449300003"}
