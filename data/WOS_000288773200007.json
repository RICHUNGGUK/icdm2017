Since Client-Server paradigm is considered for communication between the field devices, the existing methods of network delays evaluation are hardly applicable to assess realistic upper bounds of these delays. In an effort to enhance these delays evaluation, we propose an alternative method. Two algorithms, usually used for optimization problems, exhaustive and genetic algorithms, are then developed to achieve this purpose. While a formal proof about the capacity of the former one to ensure the worst delay overestimation is given, the latter proves to provide faster and more accurate results at the same time. This is shown on a practical case study while comparing the results of the two methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
