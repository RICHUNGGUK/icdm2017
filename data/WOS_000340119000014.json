We collected 224 h of accelerometric signals from 28 subjects [22 suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)] to develop and then evaluate our algorithms. We describe the process for determining the most robust parameters of the algorithms. Our results with COPD patients show the feasibility of conducting real-time classification of their activities in everyday situations, with high fidelity.", "paper_title": "Characterization of Physical Activity in COPD Patients: Validation of a Robust Algorithm for Actigraphic Measurements in Living Situations", "paper_id": "WOS:000340119000014"}
