This class of codes was proposed recently by Chee et al. in order to more precisely capture a code's performance against permanent narrowband noise in power line communication. In this paper, two series of new equitable symbol weight codes of optimal sizes meeting the Plotkin bound are constructed via combinatorial designs.", "paper_title": "Two series of equitable symbol weight codes meeting the Plotkin bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000347692400002"}
