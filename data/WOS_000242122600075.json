Especially in chemical plants, there are possibilities of disasters or explosion, because these plants handle with many combustible or hazardous substances. Therefore, safety operation for the plants is required absolutely. To prevent the plant from abnormal state, plant maintenance techniques and human engineering has been proposed. And to prevent the plant from accidents in abnormal state, decision making support system for operation has been proposed. But the design of the system has some problems. In this paper, the design example using boiler plant simulator is illustrated, and the results and problems are proved.", "paper_title": "Design problems of decision making support system for operation in abnormal state of chemical plant", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600075"}
