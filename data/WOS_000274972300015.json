The workflow management system is able to execute all tasks related to grid communication, such as authorization, scheduling and monitoring. It remains to the developer to make the code accessible for the workflow manager, and to define, what to do with it. Coarse-grained parallelization of processing steps for runtime reduction can easily be realized. We describe the procedure how to port the code to the grid and show exemplarily the integration of segmentation and registration algorithms for transrectal ultrasound guided prostate biopsies.
