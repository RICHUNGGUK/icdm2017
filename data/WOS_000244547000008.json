A dynamic latch is utilized that expends neither input DC nor drain current during the monitoring phase. Accuracy analysis of analog/digital conversion error in the RAM bank is discussed to ensure low power consumption of a counter buffer circuit. Moreover, the counter buffer utilizes a combination of NMOS and CMOS buffers to reduce power consumption. Total power consumption of a 10-bit 800-column 40 MHz RAM bank is 2.9 mA for use in an imager.", "paper_title": "A 10-bit 800-column low-power RAM bank including energy-efficient D-flip-flops for a column-parallel ADC", "paper_id": "WOS:000244547000008"}
