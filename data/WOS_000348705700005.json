Providing an efficient privacy-preserving data aggregation in WSNs is becoming more and more important. The secure data aggregation in WSNs has been studied in recent years, but most of the algorithms are suffering from the high computation overhead and high communication overhead, and some of the algorithms do not supply the data integrity checking. To resolve these problems, a modified private-preserving data aggregation based on complex number algorithm for WSN is proposed in this paper. An efficient key distribution scheme is used in the algorithm to improve the security of the key. The complex number is used in the algorithm to protect the privacy and check the data integrity. According to the analysis in the paper, the algorithm is efficient in terms of communication, computation and integrity checking.", "paper_title": "Research of privacy-preserving data aggregation algorithm for wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000348705700005"}
