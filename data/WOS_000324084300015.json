The weight corresponds to a \"hard\" constraint that cannot be violated while the height is a \"soft\" constraint. The objective is to find a trade-off between the number of bins and the maximum height of a bin. This problem has various real-world applications (computer science, production planning and logistics). Based on the special structure of its Pareto front, we propose two iterative resolution approaches for solving the Mo2-DBPP. In each approach, we use several lower bounds, heuristics and metaheuristics. Computational experiments are performed on benchmarks inspired from the literature to compare the effectiveness of the two approaches. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
