Blackbox optimization is about optimizing functions that are usually given as costly programs with no derivative information and no function values returned for a significant number of calls attempted. NOMAD is designed for such problems and aims for the best possible solution with a small number of evaluations. The objective of this article is to describe the underlying algorithm, the software's functionalities, and its implementation.", "paper_title": "Algorithm 909: NOMAD: Nonlinear Optimization with the MADS Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000287849900007"}
