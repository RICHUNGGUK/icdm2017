Smart consumer devices, such as tablets and phones, have the potential to act as biometric readers authenticating user transactions. However, the use of these devices in uncontrolled environments is highly susceptible to replay attacks, where these biometric data are captured and replayed at a later time. Current approaches to counter replay attacks in this context are inadequate. In order to show this, we demonstrate a simple replay attack that is 100% effective against a recent state-of-the-art face recognition system; this system was specifically designed to robustly distinguish between live people and spoofing attempts, such as photographs. This paper proposes an approach to counter replay attacks for face recognition on smart consumer devices using a noninvasive challenge and response technique. The image on the screen creates the challenge, and the dynamic reflection from the person's face as they look at the screen forms the response. The sequence of screen images and their associated reflections digitally watermarks the video. By extracting the features from the reflection region, it is possible to determine if the reflection matches the sequence of images that were displayed on the screen. Experiments indicate that the face reflection sequences can be classified under ideal conditions with a high degree of confidence. These encouraging results may pave the way for further studies in the use of video analysis for defeating biometric replay attacks on consumer devices.", "paper_title": "Face Recognition on Consumer Devices: Reflections on Replay Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352141700005"}
