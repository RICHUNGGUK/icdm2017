We propose a novel composition coding method for this sequence. This method is a combination of segmental probability of four nucleotides correlation factors and four components of the conventional nucleotides composition. Using the composition vectors, phylogeny analysis of species are given for the complete mtDNA sequences of eight Eutherian mammals.", "paper_title": "A Novel Composition Coding Method of DNA Sequence and Its Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000299657400014"}
