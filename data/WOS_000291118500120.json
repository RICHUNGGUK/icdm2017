Aiming to extend the achievements of product configuration in manufacturing industry to service industry and considering ontology's reusability, an ontology-based service product modeling approach for configuration is presented in this paper. Firstly, service variants of service products are represented through the feature modeling approach. Then, the feature-based service model is formalized in OWL (Ontology Web language) - an ontology language for semantic web, and configuration rules are formalized in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) - a rule language. Configuration reasoning processes are performed with the support of JESS (Java Expert System Shell) rule engine. Finally, the proposed approach to service customization is demonstrated by an example of configuring service packages for China Mobile. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
