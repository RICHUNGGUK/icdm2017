Efficient algorithms have been proposed to solve influence maximization problem according to the proposed diffusion models. Existing diffusion models assume that a node influences its neighbors once, and there is no time constraint in activation process. However, in real-world marketing situations, people influence his/her acquaintances repeatedly, and there are often time restrictions for a marketing. This paper proposes a new realistic influence diffusion model Continuously activated and Time-restricted IC (CT-IC) model which generalizes the IC model. In CT-IC model, every active node activate its neighbors repeatedly, and activation continues until a given time. We first prove CT-IC model satisfies monotonicity and submodularity for influence spread. We then provide an efficient method for calculating exact influence spread for a directed tree. Finally, we propose a scalable influence evaluation algorithm under CT-IC model CT-IPA. Our experiments show CT-IC model finds seeds of higher influence spread than IC model, and CT-IPA is four orders of magnitude faster than the greedy algorithm while providing similar influence spread.
