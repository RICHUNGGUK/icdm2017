In this paper, we propose a two-stage based approach for extracting periodic signals. At the first stage, the autocorrelation property of the desired source signal is exploited to roughly extract the desired source signal. At the second stage, the extracted signal is further processed as cleanly as possible, based on the higher-order statistics. Simulations on artificially generated data and real-world ECG data have showed its better performance, compared with many existing extraction algorithms.", "paper_title": "A two-stage based approach for extracting periodic signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300038"}
