The proposed algorithm is voxel-based and takes into account the conical projection geometry associated with the biplane image acquisition equipment. The reconstruction process starts with an initial ellipsoidal approximation derived from the input ventriculograms. This model is subsequently deformed in such a way as to match the input projections. To this end, the object is modeled as a 3-D Markov-Gibbs random field, and an energy function is defined so that it includes one term that models the projections compatibility and another one that includes the space-time regularity constraints. The performance of this reconstruction method is evaluated by considering the reconstruction of mathematically synthesized phantoms and two 3-D binary databases from two orthogonal synthesized projections. The method is also tested using real biplane ventriculograms. In this case, the performance of the reconstruction is expressed in terms of the projection error, which attains values between 9.50% and 11.78% for two biplane sequences including a total of 55 images.", "paper_title": "Markov random field modeling for three-dimensional reconstruction of the left ventricle in cardiac angiography", "paper_id": "WOS:000239359700011"}
