This Perspective provides an overview of ligand efficiency metrics and summarizes thermodynamics of protein-ligand binding. Different classes of ligand efficiency metric are critically examined and the study concludes with suggestions for alternative ways to account for physicochemical properties when prioritizing and optimizing leads.", "paper_title": "Ligand efficiency metrics considered harmful", "paper_id": "WOS:000339723800001"}
