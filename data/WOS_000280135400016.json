Such phenomena usually span a long time and it is very difficult to capture their whole process. Our system accepts a source image sequence and a reference image as input. The source sequence contains the desired scene except for color alteration, and the reference image has the color style which the source sequence is expected to advance into. First, an RBF network is employed to model the mapping between the colors of the source sequence and the reference image. Then, a simple interpolation algorithm is applied to render the resulting sequence. The effectiveness of the new method is verified by experiments.
