The automatic mapping of the entire reinforcement network inside the concrete hexahedral finite elements is performed using the end-point coordinates of the rebar reinforcement macro-elements. By introducing a geometrical constraint, this procedure decreases significantly the computational effort for generating the input data of the embedded rebar elements in three-dimensional finite-element analysis, particularly when dealing with relatively large-scale reinforced concrete models. The computational robustness and efficiency of the proposed mesh generation method are demonstrated through numerical experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
