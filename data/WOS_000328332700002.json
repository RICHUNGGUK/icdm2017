A general solution is obtained that makes it possible to construct approximate procedures of various accuracy. Formulas for the Erlang distribution of the stay times and formulas based on the recalculation of the first two moments are obtained. Computed characteristics are presented and an illustrative example is discussed.", "paper_title": "Sampling of piecewise constant stochastic processes with smooth distributions of stay time in states", "paper_id": "WOS:000328332700002"}
