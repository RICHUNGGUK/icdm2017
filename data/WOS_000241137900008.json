Given the condition that the search is over only after all the users in the group are found, this problem is called the Conference Call Search (CCS) problem. The goal is to design efficient CCS strategies under delay and bandwidth constraints. While the problem of tracking a single user has been addressed by many studies, to the best of our knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to reduce the search cost for multiple users. Moreover, as oppose to the single user tracking, for which one can always reduce the expected search delay by increasing the expected search cost, for a multicast search the dependency between the delay and the search cost is more complicated, as demonstrated in this study. We identify the key factors affecting the search efficiency, and the dependency between them and the search delay. Our analysis shows that under tight bandwidth constraints, the CCS problem is NP-hard. We therefore propose a search method that is not optimal, but has a low computational complexity. In addition, the proposed strategy yields a low search delay as well as a low search cost. The performance of the proposed search strategy is superior to the implementation of an optimal single user search on a group of users.", "paper_title": "Efficient multicast search under delay and bandwidth constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137900008"}
