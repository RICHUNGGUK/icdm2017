On the other hand, the importance of the ready times can be shown in Wafer fabrication with the presence of unequal ready times. It is sometimes advantageous to form a non-full batch, while in other situations it is a better strategy to wait for future job arrivals in order to increase the fullness of the batch. However, research on scheduling with two-agent and ready time simultaneously is relatively unexplored. This paper addresses a single-machine two-agent scheduling problem with ready times. The aim is to find an optimal schedule to minimize the total completion time of the jobs of the first agent with the restriction that total completion time is allowed an upper bound for the second agent. To the best of our knowledge, the problem under study has not been considered. Firstly, we show that the proposed problem is strongly NP-hard. Following that, we then develop a branch-and-bound, an ant colony, and four genetic algorithms for an optimal and near-optimal solution, respectively. In addition, the extensive computational experiments are also given. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
