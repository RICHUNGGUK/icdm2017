The empirical basis of this work comes from case studies of integrated criminal justice information systems (IJIS). IJIS are organizational and technological ensembles created to facilitate inter-organizational information sharing among criminal justice agencies. The focus of these case studies was to examine how organizational identity shapes organizational ICT. This research found that organizational identity shapes an organization's ICT-related processes and is reflected in the material configurations of an organization's ICT; and that organizations with different identities exhibit those differences in their ICT. Three implications of this research are that organizational identity serves as both an enabler and constraint on organizational ICT development; organizational identity commitments will likely serve as a barrier to large-scale integration of different organizations' systems; organizational identity is relatively static and difficult to change.", "paper_title": "Organizational identity and information systems: how organizational ICT reflect who an organization is", "paper_id": "WOS:000329350500006"}
