Although these solutions are widely adopted, they introduce several issues related to user content/metadata migration on server-side components managed by third-party providers. The authors propose a middleware solution to support social-driven peer-to-peer content sharing while preserving content ownership. A prototype demonstrates the proposal's feasibility in terms of both performance results and easy integration with off-the-shelf devices using unmodified HTTP/UPnP protocols.", "paper_title": "Peer-to-Peer Content Sharing Based on Social Identities and Relationships", "paper_id": "WOS:000337170100008"}
