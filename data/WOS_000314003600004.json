Recently, we have deduced the closed-form thresholding formula for L-1/2 regularization model (Xu (2010) [1]). In this work, we further deduce the closed-form thresholding formula for the L-2/3 non-convex regularization problem. Based on the closed-form formulas for L-q(q = 1/2, 2/3) regularization, we propose a fast algorithm to solve the image deconvolution problem using half-quadratic splitting method. Extensive experiments for image deconvolution demonstrate that our algorithm has a significant acceleration over Krishnan et al.'s algorithm (Krishnan et al. (2009) [3]). Moreover, the simulated experiments further indicate that L-2/3 regularization is more effective than L-0, L-1/2 or L-1 regularization in image deconvolution, and L-1/2 regularization is competitive to L-1 regularization and better than L-0 regularization.
