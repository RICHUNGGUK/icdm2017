The idea at the base of the thesis is that the future generation of user adaptive systems will cooperate in a \"many-to-many paradigm\" to exchange distributed user models data. We address this novel process as user models interoperability. The central contribution of the thesis is the conceptualization and development of a framework to enable user models interoperability across web-based user-adaptive systems. The framework supports various challenges of user models interoperability.", "paper_title": "From user models to interoperable user models", "paper_id": "WOS:000267763600005"}
