We have applied this computational method in two domains: historical analysis of languages and historical analysis of parasite-host systems. In particular, using this method, we have computed some plausible phylogenies for Chinese dialects, for Indo-European language groups, and for Alcataenia species. Some of these plausible phylogenies are different from the ones computed by other software. Using this method, we can easily describe domain-specific information (e. g., temporal and geographical constraints), and thus prevent the reconstruction of some phylogenies that are not plausible.", "paper_title": "Inferring phylogenetic trees using answer set programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000251094400002"}
