The introduction of insulating GO effectively lowered the dielectric constant of carbon black-based BM, but maintained the high optical density. The dielectric constant of the BM film significantly decreased from 26 (carbon black-based BM) to 4.5 (GO/CB-based BM). This work demonstrates the successful chemical modification and good dispersion of carbon-based materials (i.e. GO and CB) and their physical effects on the BM films. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
