This article offers a brief introduction to these methods, focusing on Me ways in which they may need to be adapted and extended to take into account the characteristic properties of systems that include some sort of AI. The discussion is organized around three types of activity: understanding users' needs, interaction design, and evaluation.", "paper_title": "Usability Engineering Methods for Interactive Intelligent Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273146800004"}
