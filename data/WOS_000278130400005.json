In this context, CP can be considered an appropriate framework for development of decision making software, supporting scheduling of multi-robots in a multi-product job shop. The paper deals with the multi-resource problem, in which more than one shared renewable and non-renewable resource type may be required by a manufacturing operation and the availability of each type is time-windows limited. The problem is NP-complete. The aim of the paper is to present a knowledge based and CP-driven approach to multi-robot task allocation providing prompt service to a set of routine queries, stated both in direct and reverse way. Provided examples illustrate the cases with consideration of accurate and uncertain specification of robot and worker operation time.", "paper_title": "Knowledge based and CP-driven approach applied to multi product small-size production flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000278130400005"}
