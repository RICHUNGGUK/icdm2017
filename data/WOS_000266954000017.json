As regards the transport of DC content towards theatres, Distributors may select the method that is both economically and technically sound. In this work, which is carried out within the framework of the IST Integrated Project Enhanced Digital CINEma (EDCINE), we deal with the network distribution service provided by a Network Service Provider, which becomes a new actor in the DC business. One of the main criticalities of the system is the very large size of the contents to be transferred towards theatres. From the operator's perspective, this criticality translates into the objective of optimising the usage of network resources while complying with quality of service (QoS) constraints. The goal of this paper is to present the system which is able to support the network delivery of DC contents, with a special focus on live event delivery. This service can consume a large amount of network bandwidth, not only because of the volume of transmitted data, but also due to the number of receivers, and thus multicast transmission proves to be very useful. Consequently, a key issue of the overall distribution system is the request-routing algorithm, the goal of which is to optimise the QoS-guaranteed delivery of a number of live streams in the backbone, each one of which is sent towards a set of theatres (QoS multicast routing). We consider the MultiProtocol Label Switching mechanism, which has emerged as an elegant solution to meet traffic engineering and resource reservation requirements in backbone networks, and focus especially on the overall request-routing procedure, the mathematical modelling of the problem, and relevant solving algorithms. Finally, we present the comparative performance evaluation of these algorithms by means of an extensive simulation campaign performed with the OMNeT++ simulation platform. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
