For practical multi-cell multi-antenna mobile cellular networks, co-channel interference is a critical issue affecting cooperative transmission (Co-Tx) performance. In this paper, we first derive a cooperative outage probability model and a cooperative block error rate (BLER) model incorporating a binary differential phase shift keying modulation for performance analysis in such cooperative cellular networks. Based on them, a cooperative energy efficiency model is proposed and analyzed under different Co-Tx scenarios, interference levels and wireless channel conditions. As demonstrated by numerical results, our analytical models show that Co-Tx is an effective approach to mitigate co-channel interference and improve the energy efficiency, BLER and overall outage probability performance in multi-cell multi-antenna cooperative cellular networks.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Energy Efficiency Modeling and Performance Analysis in Co-Channel Interference Cellular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000322648400010"}
