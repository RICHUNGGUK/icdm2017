Two different techniques for efficient generation of authenticable quotations using cascaded hashing are proposed for conventional quotations, and an efficient two-dimensional signature generation technique is proposed for two-dimensional quotations from spreadsheets. A technique for associating the signature with the quotation in the Microsoft Word document is also proposed for generation of integrated authenticable quotations that survive copy-and-paste operations.", "paper_title": "Quotation Authentication: A New Approach and Efficient Solutions by Cascaded Hashing Techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000284360000030"}
