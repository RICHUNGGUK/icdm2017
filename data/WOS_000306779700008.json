Minor changes to existing resources can alter the situation and lead to major changes to the end user experience. In this manuscript we present the dynamic web personalization and document grouping infrastructure for meta-portals and the evaluation of our mechanism on a meta-portal. A meta-portal is an informational node where articles from different sources are collected and presented in a categorized and personalized manner. The web personalization mechanism is based on dynamic creation and update of user profiles according to the users preferences when browsing. In parallel a user's profile is affected by user grouping details, which are constructed by users with similar profiles. Assuming that required information, such as article tagging, keywords to categories matching and articles to categories relation is already part of the meta-portal we present a novel mechanism that can build and maintain a user profile which is formed without disturbing the user. Furthermore, we describe the real-time user-centred document grouping mechanism that is implemented to support the web personalization system and present the experimental evaluation of the whole system.
