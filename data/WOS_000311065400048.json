In this paper, we recommend certain points of the MSGP model and offer a Revised MSGP Model as an aid to burdened decision makers who cannot expect an either-or selection of coefficients in practice. The proposed model takes into account a scenario in which the selection of all possible coefficients pertaining to each decision variable in the MSGP model can be an in-between selection instead of an exclusive-or selection. We hope this study can fill in a possible gap that might exist when applying the MSGP model, and can offer an extension model for practitioners when they use this model to solve related decision problems.
