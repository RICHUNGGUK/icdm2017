A connection overload path model was developed from data gathered in Ireland, the United States, and Korea. The magnitude of connection demands reduced negative affect, while connection habits reduced negative outcomes and negative affect. Difficulties controlling connection habits were related to negative impacts on important life activities, stress, and affect. Cultural differences were interpreted through the individualism-collectivism framework. Collectivists may be buffered from mechanisms that can adversely impact psychological well-being.", "paper_title": "Connection Overload?
