In this paper, we present a hybrid algorithm for finding MUSes in overconstrained CSPs. The hybrid algorithm combines the direct and the indirect approaches to finding MUSes in overconstrained CSPs. Experimentation with random CSPs reveals that the hybrid approach is not only quite efficient but when operating under a time bound it finds a more representative set of MUSes.
