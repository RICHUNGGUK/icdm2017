In particular, our complexity upper bounds match in order (as a function of the accuracy of approximation), and sometimes even improve, those obtained by Nesterov [Introductory Lectures on Convex Optimization, Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, 2004; Accelerating the cubic regularization of Newton's method on convex problems, Math. Program. 112(1) (2008), pp. 159-181] and Nesterov and Polyak [Cubic regularization of Newton's method and its global performance, Math. Program. 108(1) (2006), pp. 177-205] for these same problem classes, without requiring exact Hessians or exact or global solution of the subproblem. An additional outcome of our approximate approach is that our complexity results can naturally capture the advantages of both first-and second-order methods.", "paper_title": "Evaluation complexity of adaptive cubic regularization methods for convex unconstrained optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000305292200003"}
