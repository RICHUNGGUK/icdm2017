Ordering of the graphs with perfect matchings having 2n vertices and q edges according to their minimal Hosoya indices is investigated. We characterize the first two graphs for q = 2n - 1, 2n and obtain the first three graphs for q = 2n + 1. For 2n + 2 <= q <= 3n - 3, we deduce the first two graphs.", "paper_title": "Minimizing the (2n, q)-Graphs with Perfect Matchings in Terms of the Hosoya Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000312622900017"}
