A k-regular graph G is called rainbow (or domatically full) if it admits a rainbow (k + 1)-coloring. The d-dimensional grid graph G(d) is the graph whose vertices are the points of Z(d) and two vertices are adjacent if and only if their l(1)-distance is 1. We use a simple construction to prove that Gd is rainbow for all d >= 1. We discuss an important application of this result in steganography.", "paper_title": "Grid colorings in steganography", "paper_id": "WOS:000245306000022"}
