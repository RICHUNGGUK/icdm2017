This paper discusses what can be learned about the nature of representation from the car's successful attempt to navigate the world. We review the hardware and software that it uses to interact with its environment, and describe how these techniques enable it to represent the world. We discuss robosemantics, the meaning of computational structures in robots. We argue that the car constitutes a refutation of semantic arguments against the possibility of strong artificial intelligence.", "paper_title": "Robosemantics: How Stanley the Volkswagen represents the world", "paper_id": "WOS:000256086000002"}
