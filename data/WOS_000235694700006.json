However, they are often criticized to result in poor learning accuracy. In this paper, we propose Neuro-Fuzzy Decision Trees (N-FDTs); a fuzzy decision tree structure with neural like parameter adaptation strategy. In the forward cycle, we construct fuzzy decision trees using any of the standard induction algorithms like fuzzy ID3. In the feedback cycle, parameters of fuzzy decision trees have been adapted using stochastic gradient descent algorithm by traversing back from leaf to root nodes. With this strategy, during the parameter adaptation stage, we keep the hierarchical structure of fuzzy decision trees intact. The proposed approach of applying backpropagation algorithm directly on the structure of fuzzy decision trees improves its learning accuracy without compromising the comprehensibility (interpretability). The proposed methodology has been validated using computational experiments on real-world datasets.", "paper_title": "Neuro-fuzzy decision trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000235694700006"}
