Reputation systems help buyers to select sellers by aggregating seller information reported by other buyers (called advisers). However, in such competitive marketplaces, buyers may also be concerned about the possibility of losing business opportunities with good sellers if they report truthful seller information. In this paper, we propose a trust-oriented mechanism built on a game theoretic basis for buyers to: (1) determine an optimal seller reporting strategy, by modeling the trustworthiness (competency and willingness) of advisers in reporting seller information; (2) discover sellers who maximize their profit by modeling the trustworthiness of sellers and considering the buyers' preferences on product quality. Experimental results confirm that competitive marketplaces operating with our mechanism lead to better profit for buyers and create incentives for seller honesty.", "paper_title": "Trust-oriented buyer strategies for seller reporting and selection in competitive electronic marketplaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000340534500002"}
