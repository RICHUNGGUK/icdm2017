In the morphological component analysis (MCA) inpainting approach, a TV penalty is added to better reduce ringing artifacts. However, the incorporation of TV penalty terms leads to PDE schemes that are numerically intensive. Inspired by the works of Daubechies-Teschke and Borup-Nielsen, we replace the TV term by a G(1,1)(1/2) term. It results in an iterative curvelet thresholding scheme for the structure image inpainting. In the whole inpainting process, an alternative approach is presented to layer inpainting. Experimental results show the performance of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE IMAGE INPAINTING USING SPARSE REPRESENTATIONS AND AN ITERATIVE CURVELET THRESHOLDING APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000261734700003"}
