The main contributions of this paper include: 1) Syndrome messages instead of extrinsic messages are processed and exchanged between variable nodes and check nodes, which can reduce the decoding complexity; 2) a more flexible decision mechanism is developed in which the decision threshold can be self-adjusted during the iterative process. Such decision mechanism is particularly effective for decoding the majority-logic decodable codes; 3) only part of the variable nodes satisfying the pre-designed criterion are involved for the presented algorithm, which is in the proportionality-logic sense and can further reduce the computational complexity. Simulation results show that, when combined with factor correction techniques and appropriate proportionality parameter, the presented algorithm performs well and can achieve fast decoding convergence rate while maintaining relative low decoding complexity, especially for small quantized levels (3-4 bits). The presented algorithm provides a candidate for those application scenarios where the memory load and the energy consumption are extremely constrained.", "paper_title": "Reliability-Based Iterative Proportionality-logic Decoding of LDPC Codes with Adaptive Decision", "paper_id": "WOS:000358260700001"}
