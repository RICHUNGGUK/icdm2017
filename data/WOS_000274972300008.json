Scheduling problems are at the heart of any Grid-like computational system. Different types of scheduling based on different criteria, such as static versus dynamic environment, multi-objectivity, adaptivity, etc., are identified. Then, heuristic and meta-heuristic methods for scheduling in Grids are presented. The paper reveals the complexity of the scheduling problem in Computational Grids when compared to scheduling in classical parallel and distributed systems and shows the usefulness of heuristic and meta-heuristic approaches for the design of efficient Grid schedulers. We also discuss on requirements for a modular Grid scheduling and its integration with Grid architecture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
