To date, image retrieval methods include content-based retrieval and keyword-based retrieval, the former utilizing visual features such as color and brightness, and the latter utilizing keywords that describe the image. However, the effectiveness of these methods in providing the exact images the user wants has been under scrutiny. Hence, many researchers have been working on relevance feedback, a process in which responses from the user are given as feedback during the retrieval session in order to define a user's need and provide an improved result. Methods that employ relevance feedback, however, do have drawbacks because several pieces of feedback are necessary to produce an appropriate result, and the feedback information cannot be reused. In this paper, a novel retrieval model is proposed, which annotates an image with keywords and modifies the confidence level of the keywords in response to the user's feedback. In the proposed model, not only the images that have been given feedback, but also other images with visual features similar to the features used to distinguish the positive images are subjected to confidence modification. This allows for modification of a large number of images with relatively little feedback, ultimately leading to faster and more accurate retrieval results. An experiment was performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, and the result demonstrated a rapid increase in recall and precision using the same amount of feedback.
