The guidance law is capable of guiding the missile (interceptor) to a straight collision course with respect to the target. The missile turning rate command proportional to the error angle between the current missile heading and the predicted aim point is calculated based on the predicted target position. Performance of the APG law is numerically evaluated and compared with the proportional navigation guidance (PNG) law. The result of numerical simulation shows that the APG law is superior to the PNG law in terms of miss distance, time of interception and final stage missile turning rate demand.", "paper_title": "Development of three-dimensional aiming point guidance law", "paper_id": "WOS:000282579900008"}
