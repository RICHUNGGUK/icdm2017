Exponential growth in education and learning research output occurred as of the first half of the 1990s with the introduction of the World Wide Web. Rather than becoming an integral part of learning research, the support of network technologies for learning has grown into a research stream which is separate from traditional research areas such as formal and informal learning. It is affiliated with the sciences, including the medical field, more strongly than with the natural home of educational studies, the social sciences. Keyword analysis indicates terms of broad interest, yet their occurrence in the research publications shows the divergence between traditional learning and technology-based research streams. The community of technology-assisted learning research is undergoing evolution. We provide recommendations to promote a more cohesive research community to better navigate in a borderless digital world where learning occurs formally and informally.", "paper_title": "The effect of technology on learning research trends: a bibliometric analysis over five decades", "paper_id": "WOS:000361992800043"}
