The purpose of this study is to develop a motion tracking device that can be integrated within a home-based rehabilitation system for stroke patients. Human upper limbs are represented by a kinematic chain in which there are four joint variables to be considered: three for the shoulder joint and one for the elbow joint. Kinematic models are built to estimate upper limb motion in 3-D, based on the inertial measurements of the wrist motion. An efficient simulated annealing optimisation method is proposed to reduce errors in estimates. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed system has less than 5% errors in most motion manners, compared to a standard motion tracker.", "paper_title": "Inertial measurements of upper limb motion", "paper_id": "WOS:000240032700004"}
