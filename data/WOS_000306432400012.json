Gromov improved the known lower bound on c (d) by topological means. Using methods from extremal combinatorics, we improve one of the quantities appearing in Gromov's approach and thereby provide a new stronger lower bound on c (d) for arbitrary d. In particular, we improve the lower bound on c (3) from 0.06332 to more than 0.07480; the best upper bound known on c (3) being 0.09375.", "paper_title": "A New Lower Bound Based on Gromov's Method of Selecting Heavily Covered Points", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400012"}
