Robust and systematic results demonstrate strong support for the effectiveness of the market trading heuristic of buying when one-day share trading volume spikes. Implementation of the methods is straightforward and may be readily accomplished with spreadsheet technology for decision support applications. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
