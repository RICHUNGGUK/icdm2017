Firstly, a review of the existing discretization and parallelization strategies for solving numerically the Boltzmann kinetic equation with various model collision integrals is carried out. Secondly, a new parallelization strategy for the implicit time evolution method is implemented which improves scaling on large CPU clusters. Accuracy and scalability of the methods are demonstrated on a pressure-driven rarefied gas flow through a finite-length circular pipe as well as an external supersonic flow over a three-dimensional re-entry geometry of complicated aerodynamic shape.
