Users have to evaluate email related risks before forming their attitude and read intention toward commercial emails. Drawing on a seminal theoretical framework in risky decision making, we propose a research model that incorporates computer risk taking propensity and email risk perception as influential in cultivating commercial email attitude and read intention. The research model is empirically validated using survey data and the results provide significant support. This study contributes to the literature on email use by exploring the process of risky decision making and influence sources. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
