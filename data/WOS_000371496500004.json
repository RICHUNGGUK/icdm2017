Each class can be obtained as a natural restriction of deterministic macro tree transducers (MTTs): (1) no context parameters, i.e., top-down tree transducers, (2) linear size increase, i.e., MSO definable tree transducers, and (3) monadic input and output ranked alphabets. For the full class of MTTs, decidability of equivalence remains a long-standing open problem.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Decidable Equivalence Problems for Tree Transducers", "paper_id": "WOS:000371496500004"}
