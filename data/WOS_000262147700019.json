The nature of these decisions Usually is considered to be multidimensional, interdisciplinary, complex, and unstructured due to lack of certainty in environment and information regarding time. quantity and quality of returns, etc. Fuzzy decision methodology provides an alternative framework to handle these reverse logistics system (RLS) complexities and to determine the decision strategies for best alternative selection for reprocessing. Designing a decision-making model for the same requires quantitative and qualitative evaluation based on criteria such as cost/time, legislative factors, environmental impact, quality, market, etc. Performance must be considered on the basis of these criteria to determine a suitable reverse manufacturing option depending on the expert opinion in this domain. In this paper, we propose a multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) model based on fuzzy-set theory. The proposed model can help in designing effective and efficient flexible return policy depending on the various criteria. Further, companies can use this analysis as a strategic decision-making tool to develop fresh reprocessing facilities or efficiently use the already exiting facility. Finally, an example has been illustrated to highlight the procedural implementation of the proposed model. Further, this paper also makes an attempt to bring fuzzy-based flexible MCDM and reverse logistics together as a well-suited group decision support tool for alternative selections.
