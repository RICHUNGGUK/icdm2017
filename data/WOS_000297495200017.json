In this paper, we propose an efficient and exact algorithm to compute the geodesic offsets on triangle meshes by extending the Xin-Wang algorithm of discrete geodesics. We define a new data structure called parallel-source windows, and extend both the \"one angle one split\" and the filtering theorem to maintain the window tree. Similar to the original Xin-Wang algorithm, our extended algorithm has an O(n) space complexity and an O(n(2) log n) asymptotic time complexity, where n is the number of vertices on the input mesh. We tested our algorithm on numerous real-world models and showed that our algorithm is exact, efficient and robust, and can be applied to large scale models with complicated geometry and topology.
