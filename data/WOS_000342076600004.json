In our problem setting, a bag contains a number of graphs and a class label. A bag is labeled positive if at least one graph in the bag is positive, and negative otherwise. In addition, the genuine label of each graph in a positive bag is unknown, and all graphs in a negative bag are negative. The aim of multi-graph learning is to build a learning model from a number of labeled training bags to predict previously unseen test bags with maximum accuracy. This problem setting is essentially different from existing multi-instance learning (MIL), where instances in MIL share well-defined feature values, but no features are available to represent graphs in a multi-graph bag. To solve the problem, we propose a Multi-Graph Feature based Learning (gMGFL) algorithm that explores and selects a set of discriminative subgraphs as features to transfer each bag into a single instance, with the bag label being propagated to the transferred instance. As a result, the multi-graph bags form a labeled training instance set, so generic learning algorithms, such as decision trees, can be used to derive learning models for multi-graph classification. Experiments and comparisons on real-world multi-graph tasks demonstrate the algorithm performance.", "paper_title": "Bag Constrained Structure Pattern Mining for Multi-Graph Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000342076600004"}
