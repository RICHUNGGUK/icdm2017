In this article, we first provide two linear time algorithms for the problem. We then demonstrate the efficacy of these algorithms through experiments. Lastly, as an application of this research, we indicate that the construction of wavelet synopses on a prescribed error bound (in L-2 metric) can be solved in linear time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
