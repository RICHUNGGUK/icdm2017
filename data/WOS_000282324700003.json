However, the initial population of current scheduling algorithms is randomly determined. Similar scheduling instances in the production process are not reused rationally. For this reason, we propose a method to generate the initial population of job shop problems. The scheduling model includes static and dynamic knowledge to generate the initial population of the genetic algorithm. The knowledge reflects scheduling constraints and priority rules. A scheduling strategy is implemented by matching and combining the two categories of scheduling knowledge, while the experience of dispatchers is externalized to semantic features. Feature similarity based knowledge matching is utilized to acquire the constraints that are in turn used to optimize the scheduling process. Results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective for the job shop optimization problem.", "paper_title": "Feature-based initial population generation for the optimization of job shop problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000282324700003"}
