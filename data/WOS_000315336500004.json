Sampling 18 ideologically diverse blogs (left-leaning, moderate, and right-leaning) across three public affairs issues in 2007, it was found that weak-tie connections enabled moderate blogs to bridge all ideological blog networks more comprehensibly and expansively than partisan blog networks. Unfortunately, the bridging effect of weak-tie connections provided less internal and external cohesion within the moderate blog network when compared to both partisan blog networks. Moderate blogs had low intragroup (within group) and intergroup (between group) cohesion: moderate blogs not only linked less internally but received fewer, reciprocal linkages from partisan blog networks. Findings highlight the trade-off that moderate blogs make as they sacrifice the visibility benefits of cohesive community for the informational benefits of heterogeneous, weak-tie connections.", "paper_title": "The Democratic Contribution of Weakly Tied Political Networks: Moderate Political Blogs as Bridges to Heterogeneous Information Pools", "paper_id": "WOS:000315336500004"}
