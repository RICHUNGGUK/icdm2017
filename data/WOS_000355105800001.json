The WSLA adopts a modified received signal strength indicator-based range model to estimate the distances between nodes, utilizes the results of a centroid localization algorithm as the search initial point, and employs a new weighted search method to compute the positions of nodes in a distributed and recursive manner. The key ideas of theWSLA include a node localization precision classification scheme, a processing scheme for special nodes, and weight-based searches. Compared with three state-of-art localization algorithms-namely, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), edge-based second-order cone programming + nonconvex sequential greedy (ESOCP + NCSG), and particle swarm optimization (PSO)-the simulation results show that localization performance of theWSLA is superior to that of MLE, ESOCP + NCSG, and PSO.", "paper_title": "A RSSI-Based Distributed Weighted Search Localization Algorithm for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000355105800001"}
