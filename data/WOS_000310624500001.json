FBG sensor has a high sensitivity, but it can only realize the measurement of local discrete points for the quasidistributed sensing. BOTDA can realize the long distance and distributed measurement, but its spatial resolution is not high. FBG and BOTDA were applied together in bridge monitoring in this test, taking full advantage of the distributed BOTDA on the overall strain measurements of the structure, as well as monitoring the key parts by the arrangement of FBG. The combined application of BOTDA and FBG can achieve the overall monitoring from point to line and then to the surface and, therefore, obtain more comprehensive information on the strain of the test structure.", "paper_title": "Application of Multiscale Fiber Optical Sensing Network Based on Brillouin and Fiber Bragg Grating Sensing Techniques on Concrete Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000310624500001"}
