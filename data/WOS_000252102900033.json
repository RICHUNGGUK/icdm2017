Such functions model many practical problems that cannot be formulated in the smaller class of globally nonexpanding functions. The upper bound 2n(2) ln(2/epsilon) on the number of function evaluations for finding epsilon-residual approximations to the fixed points remains the same for the larger class. We also present a modified version of a hybrid bisection-secant method for efficient approximation of univariate fixed point problems in combustion chemistry. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
