In this paper, we show how these calculations can be performed within a theorem prover or proof assistant in a convenient and highly automated as well as interactive way. First, we formally establish upper and lower bounds for elementary functions. Then, based on these bounds, we develop a rational interval arithmetic where real number calculations take place in an algebraic setting. In order to reduce the dependency effect of interval arithmetic, we integrate two techniques: interval splitting and Taylor series expansions. This pragmatic approach has been developed, and formally verified, in a theorem prover. The formal development also includes a set of customizable strategies to automate proofs involving explicit calculations over real numbers. Our ultimate goal is to provide guaranteed proofs of numerical properties with minimal human theorem-prover interaction.", "paper_title": "Verified Real Number Calculations: A Library for Interval Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000261846600009"}
