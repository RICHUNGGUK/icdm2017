Although V-DD scaling can reduce the energy, the minimum operating voltage (V-DDmin) of FFs prevents the operation at the optimum supply voltage that minimizes the energy, because the V-DDmin of FFs is higher than the optimum supply voltage. In HVFF, the V-DD of combinational logic gates is reduced below the V-DDmin of FFs while keeping the V-DD of FFs at their V-DDmin. This makes it possible to minimize the energy without power and delay penalties at the nominal supply voltage (1.2 V) as well as without FF topological difications. A 16-bit integer unit with HVFF is fabricated in a 65-nm CMOS process, and measurement results show that HVFF reduces the minimum energy by 13% compared with the conventional operation, which is 1/10 times smaller than the energy at the nominal supply voltage.", "paper_title": "Minimizing Energy of Integer Unit by Higher Voltage Flip-Flop: V-DDmin-Aware Dual Supply Voltage Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000319473000017"}
