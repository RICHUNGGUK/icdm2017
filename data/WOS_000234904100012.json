The use of iterative solvers and parallel computation methods are identified as being of particular relevance to addressing the computation challenges. 3D stereoscopic visualisation is discussed in relation to data analysis and communication. An example analysis is presented related to the issue of nuclear waste disposal where the use of iterative solvers and parallel algorithms was found to yield significant results.
