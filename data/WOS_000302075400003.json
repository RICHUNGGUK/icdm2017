Refined mesh and sub modeling techniques were used to obtain converged results. Contact convergence was achieved using augmented Lagrangian algorithm, with penetration control equal to 0.1% on radial interference and allowable elastic slip of 0.1 mu m. Fatigue results are presented for 4 different fatigue criteria: Von Mises, Sine, Crossland and Dang Van. Dang Van criterion gives the most consistent results and shows no evidence of a correlation between sliding amplitude and fatigue life. Relative slip seems to be a consequence rather than the cause, excluding cases with important wear. A fretting fatigue strength reduction factor was calculated for the fretting zone. Its value is between 0.35 and 0.69 depending on the chosen criterion, but varies for different materials and/or loading types. Results give a good fatigue life approximation and can easily be used to optimize the shape of the interference fits. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
