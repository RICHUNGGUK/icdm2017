We consider the satisfiability and finite satisfiability problems of these logics and show that for D-2, both problems are NEXPTIME-complete, whereas for IF2, the problems are pi(0)(1) and Sigma(0)(1)-complete, respectively. We also show that D-2 is strictly less expressive than IF2 and that already in D-2, equicardinality of two unary predicates and infinity can be expressed (the latter in the presence of a constant symbol).
