Uses of TV white space (TVWS) and long term evolution (LTE) are the combination of a new research direction to meet the increasing user demands in the domain of wireless cellular networks. Without the consideration of traffic flow, a network may operate with serious congestion problems that degrade the system performance. Congestion problems can be resolved by either reducing traffic flow or increasing the bandwidth provision. This paper has proposed Distributed dynamic load balancing (DDLB) cellular-based TVWS and LTE technique, such that a cellular-based device can operate on both TVWS and LTE by simply switching its frequency of operation when necessary. The objective of this paper is to resolve the congestion problems in a HetNet through dynamically constructing new clusters to increase the system bandwidth. The simulation results show that the proposed technique solved the bottleneck problem, reduced transmission control overhead and power consumption, and increased the average throughput and load balancing index.", "paper_title": "Distributed dynamic load balancing in a heterogeneous network using LTE and TV white spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000361822000022"}
