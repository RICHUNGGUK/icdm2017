The model expresses the short-run cost per unit of operating the SPRT chart as a function of the cost parameters associated with the operation. A simple algorithm capable of optimizing the charting parameters is also proposed. The model can be used to quantify cost reductions achievable by substituting a traditional control policy by SPRT control. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. It is shown that the resulting cost reduction can range from modest to substantial as the out-of-control probability of the process increases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
