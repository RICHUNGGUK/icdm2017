We first introduce some operations on the interval grey linguistic variables. Then, we further develop the induced interval grey linguistic ordered weighted geometric (I-IGLOWG) operator. Then, we apply the induced interval grey linguistic ordered weighted geometric (I-IGLOWG) operator and interval grey linguistic weighted geometric (IGLWG) operator to deal with multiple attribute group decision making with the interval grey linguistic variables. Finally, an illustrative example for supplier selection in supply chain management with the interval grey linguistic variables is given to verify the developed approach.", "paper_title": "An approach based on the I-IGLOWG and the IGLWG operators to multiple attributes group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000341926700019"}
