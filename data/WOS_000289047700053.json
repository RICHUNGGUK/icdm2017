However, the interdependent relationships of the key factors have not yet been fully studied. This paper provides the first analysis on the interactive relationships among the factors in incorporating the methods of Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and Analytic Network Process (ANP). The empirical results show that factors from the existing analytical methodologies have significant interactive and self-feedback dynamics. Among the key factors, profitability is the most important one affecting investment decision, followed by growth and trading volume. In addition, due to the complexity of the ANP, this study proposes a new methodology to simplify the process, and empirical evidences indicate that the approach is effective and efficient.
