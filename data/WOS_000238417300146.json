In this paper, we compare the situations of the micro-, grand- and canonical ensemble based on their respective partition functions. We present results for a specific, recently introduced Hamiltonian. Interestingly, for all three ensembles we find scale-free networks with 'complex' topology for a wide range of parameters. We further show results of some topological measures depending on energy and temperature.", "paper_title": "Simulation of micro-, grand-, and canonical ensembles of complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238417300146"}
