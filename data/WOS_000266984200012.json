By analysis of the BER performance for the corresponding optical code division multiple access (OCDMA) system, it is shown that the users with different codewords have significant differences in performance. Users with heavier-weight address matrices always outperform those with lighter-weight address matrices, and shorter-length and longer-length matrices support high bit-rate and low bit-rate in OCDMA applications, respectively. Therefore, heavier-weight shorter-length matrices can accommodate high bit-rate and high-quality of services (QoS) (e.g., real-time video), and lighter-weight longer-length matrices can achieve low bit-rate and low-QoS (e.g., voice). The system performance becomes worse as the users concentrate on one type of service. Especially, a surge of the number of users with shorter-length matrices has particularly impact on system performance. Thus, the 2-D VLVWOOCs can be used to provide many different types of services with different rate-levels and different levels of QoS, and simultaneously make better use of bandwidth resources in optical networks.", "paper_title": "Construction and performance analysis of 2-D variable-length variable-weight optical orthogonal codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200012"}
