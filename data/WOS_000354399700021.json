The formulation is based on the Scaled Boundary Finite Element Method (SBFEM), a general semi-analytical method requiring the discretization of boundaries only. For a homogeneous finite or infinite plate section, only the through-thickness direction of the plate is discretized. To describe a defect, the full boundary of a short plate section of irregular shape is discretized. High-order spectral elements are employed for the discretization. The formulation for infinite plates can model the transmission into an unbounded domain exactly. Results are compared with conventional Finite Element Analyses in both time domain and frequency domain. The presented approach allows for the simulation of complex reflection and scattering phenomena using a very small number of degrees of freedom while the mesh consists of one-dimensional elements only.
