An approach for solving some special uncertain linear systems is designed and conditions for the existence of a solution to an uncertain linear system are presented. And, two examples are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, an application to diet is given to show the practical significance of uncertain linear systems.", "paper_title": "Uncertain linear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354288600005"}
