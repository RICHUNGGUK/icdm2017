The material was either cast and homogenised or extruded with strong cube texture. The textured specimens demonstrated unusual shapes of the fracture surface that deviated from elliptical and were more rectangular in shape. A phenomenological plasticity model was used in finite element simulations of the tensile tests, together with a crystal plasticity model. The phenomenological plasticity model could not reproduce the evolution of the cross-section of the specimens made from the textured material. The crystal plasticity finite element model on the other hand demonstrated behaviour closer to the experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
