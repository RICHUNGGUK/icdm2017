Following the Part I (the previous paper), a called PGR dataset collected from the financial holding stocks in Taiwan's stock market is implemented as the empirical case study in the Part, II (this paper) to evaluate the proposed hybrid models. An external comparison and internal comparison are conducted; concurrently, some findings and management implications are disclosed from the experimental results. The results include decision rules of a set to directly rule the strategy of investment and intelligently offer a powerful explanation for the investors. They are of value to both academicians and practitioners.", "paper_title": "A FUZZY-BASED ROUGH SETS CLASSIFIER FOR FORECASTING QUARTERLY PGR IN THE STOCK MARKET (PART II)", "paper_id": "WOS:000288522600016"}
