Based on the previous method, the approach presented makes the higher priority achieve the higher satisfying degree. For three fuzzy relations of the objective functions, the corresponding optimization models are proposed. Not only can satisfying results for all the objectives be acquired, but the preemptive priority requirement can also be simultaneously actualized. The balance between optimization and priorities is realized. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method by illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "Enhanced interactive satisfying optimization approach to multiple objective optimization with preemptive priorities", "paper_id": "WOS:000237295200004"}
