First, the parallel distributed compensation method is utilized to design a fuzzy controller, which ensures the robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system and guarantees an H-infinity norm-bound constraint on disturbance attenuation for all admissible uncertainties. Second, based on the Schur complement and some variable transformations, the stability conditions of the overall fuzzy control system are formulated by linear matrix inequalities. Finally, the validity and applicability, of the proposed schemes are demonstrated by a numerical simulation and the Van de Vusse example.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity fuzzy control for a class of uncertain discrete fuzzy bilinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029400020"}
