The comparative is done with a non subjective evaluation function. The main objective is to validate the efficiency of several methods in Interactive Evolutionary Computation environments. The most important constraint of working within those environments is the user interaction, which affects the results adding time restrictions for the experimentation stage and subjectivity to the validation. The experiments done in this paper replace user interaction with several approaches avoiding user limitations. So far, the results show the efficiency of the purposed algorithm in terms of quality of solutions and convergence speed, two known keys to decrease the user fatigue.", "paper_title": "An experimental comparative study for interactive evolutionary computation problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237228900052"}
