To decide the bit-width of a division unit, error analysis has been carried out in various ways. As a result, when the original bit-width was 31-bit, the proposed method reduced the bit-width to 24-bit and reduced the area by 42% with a maximum error of 0.00001%.", "paper_title": "Effective Fixed-Point Pipelined Divider for Mobile Rendering Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000321468100003"}
