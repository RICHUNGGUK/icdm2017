In sign language (SL), it takes the form of impact among adjacent signs, which results in variations of signs from their standard configurations. Standard configuration is the appearance of a sign when it appears singly, without context. Without co-articulation, SL animation based on virtual character will be a simple concatenation of signs. The movement of virtual character will be mechanical, lacking fluency and realism. This paper presents a key frame based SL co-articulation animation scheme aiming at the three most important elements of co-articulation, i.e. hand shape, hand position and SL speed. To generate co-articulation, motion data of signs which appear sequentially is parsed to identify hand shapes and positions included in these signs. Then, co-articulation will be achieved through some modification to the motion data according to the interaction between adjacent hand shapes and adjacent hand positions. SL Speed acts as an adjusting parameter which dynamically impacts co-articulation. Different expression speed will lead to different degree of co-articulation.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of sign language co-articulation based on key frames", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500010"}
