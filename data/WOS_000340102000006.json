In this paper, we propose an efficient method of estimation for the parameters and quantiles of the three-parameter IG distribution, which is based on statistics invariant to unknown location. Through a Monte Carlo simulation study, we then show that the proposed method performs well compared with other prominent methods in terms of bias and variance. Finally, we present two illustrative examples.", "paper_title": "A method for estimating parameters and quantiles of the three-parameter inverse Gaussian distribution based on statistics invariant to unknown location", "paper_id": "WOS:000340102000006"}
