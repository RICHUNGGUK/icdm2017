A set S of vertices is a strong metric generator for G if every pair of vertices of G is strongly resolved by some vertex of S. The smallest cardinality of a strong metric generator for G is called the strong metric dimension of G. In this paper we obtain several tight bounds or closed formulae for the strong metric dimension of the Cartesian sum of graphs in terms of the strong metric dimension, clique number or twins-free clique number of its factor graphs.", "paper_title": "On the Strong Metric Dimension of Cartesian Sum Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361626300003"}
