According to the audio statistics characteristics and synchronization code technique, a new robust audio watermarking scheme against desynchronization attacks is proposed in this paper. Firstly, the original digital audio is segmented and then each audio segment is cut into two parts. Secondly, with the spatial watermarking technique, the synchronization code is embedded into the statistics average value of audio samples in the first part. Finally, the second part of audio segment is Cut into audio sections, the DWT is performed on the audio sections, and the watermark bit is embedded into the statistics average Value of low frequency components. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme is inaudible and robust against common signals processing, including MP3 compression, low-pass filtering, noise addition, and equalization, etc. Moreover, it also survives several desynchronization attacks, such as random Cropping, amplitude variation, pitch shifting, time-scale modification, and jittering, etc. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
