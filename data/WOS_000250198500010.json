In this paper, the independent component analysis (ICA) with references was applied to separate the gastric signal from noises. The nonlinear uncorrelatedness between the desired component and references was introduced as a constraint. The results show that the proposed method can extract the desired component corresponding to gastric slow waves directly, avoiding the ordering indeterminacy in ICA. Furthermore, the perturbations in EGG can be suppressed effectively. In summary, it can be a useful method for EGG analysis in research and clinical practice.", "paper_title": "Electrogastrogram extraction using independent component analysis with references", "paper_id": "WOS:000250198500010"}
