This paper focuses on the research of an inventory control strategy of a serial supply chain. First, it proposes an optimization model of an inventory control that is based on the combination of a nonlinear integer programming model and the generally used push/pull control model. Then, the optimal control strategy is ratified by the fusion of genetic algorithm and simulation analysis. Case studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the method.", "paper_title": "The research on the optimal control strategy of a serial supply chain based on GA", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600090"}
