A key issue in that respect and compared to monocular settings is to ensure propagation of segmentation information between views while minimizing complexity and computational cost. In this work, we first investigate the idea that examining measurements at the projections of a sparse set of 3D points is sufficient to achieve this goal. The proposed algorithm softly assigns each of these 3D samples to the scene background if it projects on the background region in at least one view, or to the foreground if it projects on foreground region in all views. Second, we show how other modalities such as depth may be seamlessly integrated in the model and benefit the segmentation. The paper exposes a detailed set of experiments used to validate the algorithm, showing results comparable with the state of art, with reduced computational complexity. We also discuss the use of different modalities for specific situations, such as dealing with a low number of viewpoints or a scene with color ambiguities between foreground and background.", "paper_title": "Sparse Multi-View Consistency for Object Segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000359216600012"}
