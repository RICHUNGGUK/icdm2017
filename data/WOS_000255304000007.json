The method is based on beta-spline curves generation from a collision-free path previously calculated. Several constraints have been considered in order to ensure the existence of collision-free and admissible Curves. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated using the nonholonomic autonomous vehicles ROMEO-3R and ROMEO-4R designed and built at the University of Seville. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
