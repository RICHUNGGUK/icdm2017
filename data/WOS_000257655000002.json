In such a model, packet overhead and computing efficiency are two parameters to be taken into account when designing a multicast stream protocol. In this paper, we propose to use two families of erasure codes to deal with this problem, namely, rateless codes and maximum distance separable codes. Our constructions will have the following advantages. First, our packet overhead will be small. Second, the number of signature verifications to be performed at the receiver is O(1). Third, every receiver will be able to recover all the original data packets emitted by the sender despite losses and injection occurred during the transmission of information.", "paper_title": "A coding approach to the multicast stream authentication problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000257655000002"}
