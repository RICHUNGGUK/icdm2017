To mitigate this problem we propose: (a) to partition the set of sub-channels into chunks, which are assigned different power levels; (b) the design of a data scheduling and allocation algorithm positioned in the medium access control (MAC) layer of the base station (BS), exploiting such a partitioning. The framework is analyzed in a multi-cell IEEE 802.16 network by means of system-level packet-based simulations, with detailed MAC and physical layer abstractions in combination with realistic models of the wireless channel and interference.
