One application of this technique is to register two consecutive images in an ultrasound image sequence. Although intensity is the most widely used feature in traditional ultrasound image registration algorithms, speckle noise and lower image resolution make the registration process difficult. By integrating the intensity and the local phase information, we can find and track the non-rigid transformation of each pixel under diffeomorphism between the source and target images. Experiments using synthetic and cardiac images of in vivo mice and human subjects are conducted to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Non-Rigid Ultrasound Image Registration Based on Intensity and Local Phase Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000265085600005"}
