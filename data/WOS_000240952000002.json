Issues related to host interoperability are addressed partially by the principles of the service-oriented computing paradigm. However, certain technical concerns relating to predictable interactions among hosts in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) have not yet received much attention. We introduce `follow-me sessions,\" where interactions occur between a client and a service, rather than a specific service provider. A client, thus, may exploit several service providers during the course of its interaction with a given service. This redundancy mitigates the effects of mobility-induced disconnections, thereby facilitating reliable communication. The switching of service providers is done using a combination of strong process migration, context-sensitive binding and location-agnostic communication protocols. This paper covers the architecture and implementation of a middleware that supports follow-me sessions and shows how this middleware mitigates issues related to proxy-based service-oriented architectures in mobile ad hoc networks. We support our claims via technical evaluation of our approach.", "paper_title": "Supporting predictable service provision in MANETs via context-aware session management", "paper_id": "WOS:000240952000002"}
