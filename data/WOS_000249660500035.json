We use bitwise arithmetics to evaluate, encode, and combine the samples blocked by each triangle. In particular the number of operations is almost independent of the number of samples. Our method requires no CPU/GPU transfers, is fully implemented as geometric, vertex and fragment shaders, and thus does not impose to modify the way the geometry is sent to the graphics card. We finally present applications to soft shadows, and visibility analysis for level design.", "paper_title": "Visibility sampling on GPU and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500035"}
