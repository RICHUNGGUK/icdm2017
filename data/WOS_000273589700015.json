The aim is to move as few vertices as possible. We present an algorithm that untangles the cycle graph C (n) while keeping Omega(n (2/3)) vertices fixed. For any connected graph G, we also present an upper bound on the number of fixed vertices in the worst case. The bound is a function of the number of vertices, maximum degree, and diameter of G. One consequence is that every 3-connected planar graph has a drawing delta such that at most O((nlog n)(2/3)) vertices are fixed in every untangling of delta.", "paper_title": "Untangling Polygons and Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000273589700015"}
