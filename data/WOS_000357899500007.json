The land area is divided in equally sized rectangular grids, where each grid contains up to one facility surrounded by streets. Some facilities may produce hot and/or cold streams and the associated heat exchangers network (HEN) is simultaneously optimized with the layout problem. The three dimensions of geographical allocation points for each generated stream are included in the model. No additional cost for geographical allocation of heating and cooling services is considered since every facility is expected to contain these services regardless of their use in the HEN. The toxic effect is estimated via probit functions and its associated risk reduction results in providing safety to the combined HEN-facility layout problem. The grid-based allocation eliminates numerical difficulties appearing with conventional non-overlapping and Euclidian distance equations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
