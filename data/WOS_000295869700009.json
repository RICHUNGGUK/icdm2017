In this paper, we introduce an optimization method called \"condensed composition\" for the tree-based composite event processing. \"Condensed composition\" divides the events in groups to participate the composition. We analyze the reason why the performance is improved and propose the idea of using the statistics of the \"condensation degree\" to dynamically decide using condensed composition or not for different data characteristics. In the experiments, the \"condensed composition\" method significantly improved the performance on the real stock data.", "paper_title": "An Optimization Method for Sequence Event Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000295869700009"}
