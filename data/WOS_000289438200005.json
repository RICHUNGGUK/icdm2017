In this paper, based on fuzzy measures a generalized intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operator is investigated for multiple criteria group decision making. First, some operational laws on intuitionistic fuzzy values are introduced. Then, a generalized intuitionistic fuzzy ordered geometric averaging (GIFOGA) operator is proposed. Moreover, some of its properties are given in detail. It is shown that GIFOGA operator can be represented by special t-norms and t-conorms and is a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted geometric averaging operator. Further, an approach to multiple criteria group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy information is developed where what criteria and preference of experts often have inter-dependent or interactive phenomena among criteria or preference of experts is taken into account. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the developed approaches.", "paper_title": "Generalized intuitionistic fuzzy geometric aggregation operator and its application to multi-criteria group decision making", "paper_id": "WOS:000289438200005"}
