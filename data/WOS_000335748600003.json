Solutions to this problem are fuzzy schedules, which we argue should be seen as predictive schedules, thus establishing links with the concept of robustness and a measure thereof. We propose a particle swarm optimization (PSO) approach to minimise the schedule's expected makespan, using priorities to represent particle position, as well as a decoding algorithm to generate schedules in a subset of possibly active ones. Our proposal is evaluated on a varied set of several benchmark problems. The experimental study includes a parametric analysis, results of the PSO compared with the state-of-the-art, and an empirical study of the robustness of taking into account uncertainty along the scheduling process.", "paper_title": "Robust swarm optimisation for fuzzy open shop scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000335748600003"}
