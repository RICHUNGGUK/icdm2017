Moreover, efficient routines have been provided for rigid body MID simulations, resulting in 1.6 times speedup compared to the two-point finite difference approach. It has also been shown that the time cost of a MID simulation will be almost equal to a similar MC simulation, making use of the provided routines. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
