The major problem lies in the fact that the high transversal deflection of workpiece results in high diameter error in turning slender shaft. In order to investigate the development of diameter error, the turning operation is simulated by using the Rayleigh beam theory. Through this theory, the dynamic response of a rotating workpiece under the cutting force is determined. Then, the diameter error of slender bar is determined based on the geometric correlation between the workpiece deflection and the diameter error. In this simulation, the cutting force is obtained using an empirical model, which is extensively used. Finally, a series of experimental tests are carried out to validate the simulation of diameter error. The experimental results demonstrate that the simulated values are considerably accurate. In addition, in order to eliminate the diameter error through error compensation method, the nominal depth of cut corresponding to a certain actual depth is determined by using the proposed model. The originality of this work is that the rotational motion of workpiece is taken into account in determining the diameter error of slender bar.", "paper_title": "Simulating the diameter error due to the dynamic response of a spinning slender shaft in turning operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239998600002"}
