This study develops a Decision Ball model to assist a decision maker in ranking alternatives and visualizing decision process based on the Even Swap concept. By viewing the moving trajectories of alternatives on spheres, a decision maker can specify trade-offs among criteria via the Even Swap process thus ranking alternatives more consistently.
