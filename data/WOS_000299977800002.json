We show the existence of a family of languages hard for pfa's in the following sense: For any positive integer d, there exists a unary d-cyclic language such that any pia accepting it requires d states, as the smallest deterministic automaton. On the other hand, we prove that there exist infinitely many languages having pfa's which from one side do not match a known optimal state lower hound and, on the other side, they are smaller than nfa's which, in turn, are smaller than deterministic automata.", "paper_title": "On the Size of Unary Probabilistic and Nondeterministic Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000299977800002"}
