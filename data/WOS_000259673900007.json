The underlying principle is the dynamic adaptation of the clock duty cycle to propagation delay variation along disturbed logic paths. This methodology makes digital circuits more robust to power line fluctuations while maintaining the at speed clock rate.", "paper_title": "Signal integrity enhancement in digital circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000259673900007"}
