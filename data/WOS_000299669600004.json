While such services are essential to overcome distances, using infrastructure services for location-based services may not be desirable. In contrast, we design and analyze a fully distributed variant of an ephemeral content sharing service, solely dependent on the mobile devices in the vicinity using principles of opportunistic networking. The result is a best effort service for floating content in which content is created locally, its availability is geographically limited and its lifetime and spreading depends on interested nodes being available. In this paper, we present our system design, algorithms, and protocol specification in detail. A set of real world experiments is then used to assess the achievable transmission rates and transmission ranges in such a system. We validate our previous analytical results and assess the performance of floating content in general and especially of different replication and deletion strategies by means of extensive simulations using a map-based mobility model in downtown Helsinki.
