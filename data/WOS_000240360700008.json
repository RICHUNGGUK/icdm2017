Three qualitative evaluations focused on recognizing drawn shapes and creating drawings have been conducted together with a reference group of 5 visually impaired children. Additionally, one formal pilot test involving I I adult sighted users investigated the use of a combination of haptic and sound field feedback. In the latter test the relief type (positive and negative) was also varied. Results indicate a subjective preference as well as a shorter examination time for negative relief over positive relief for the interpretation of simple shapes such as 2D geometrical figures. The presence of the position sound field with a pitch and stereo panning analogy was not shown to affect task completion times.", "paper_title": "User evaluations of a virtual haptic-audio line drawing prototype", "paper_id": "WOS:000240360700008"}
