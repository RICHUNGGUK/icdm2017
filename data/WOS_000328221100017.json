Studying moral judgment based on currently available computational intelligence methods and techniques may shed new light on the matter. This article reviews computational models of moral judgment on the basis of the CLARION cognitive architecture, emphasizing a motivation-based approach. It attempts to integrate the understanding of moral judgment with other areas of cognition. In particular, it shows how a model of human motivation can play an important role in understanding human moral judgment, which opens the door for new possibilities in developing theories of moral judgment.", "paper_title": "Moral Judgment, Human Motivation, and Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328221100017"}
