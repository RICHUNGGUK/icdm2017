Denniston, A. Melton, and S.E. Rodabaugh, which extends lattice-valued topological spaces, this paper introduces the notion of lattice-valued bornological system as a generalization of lattice-valued bornological spaces of M. Abel and A. Sostak. We aim at (and make the first steps towards) the theory, which will provide a common setting for both lattice-valued point-set and point-free bornology. In particular, we show the algebraic structure of the latter. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Lattice-valued bornological systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345440400008"}
