However, due to the existence of too many notations to represent the same design concepts in different methodologies, personalization specifications cannot be used out of the scope of a single tool or method. Moreover, in some cases, personalization is not defined as a separate aspect, being difficult to maintain and update. This paper tackles the aforementioned problems presenting a generic modeling technique to facilitate the specification of the personalization. Personalization specifications can be reused across different websites and different development environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
