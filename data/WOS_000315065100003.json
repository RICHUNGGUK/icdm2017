Under this cognitive and linguistic approach, we explore preference relations, examining their semantic decomposition through fuzzy preference structures and the specification of meaningful opposites. In particular, we introduce the Preference-Aversion (P-A) model, which allows analyzing, under an independent aggregation methodology, the possible gains and losses, like pros and cons, towards a given set of alternatives. As an attractive feature of this proposal, we show that the P-A model allows distinguishing between need and desire, contrary to common preference models where both notions are indistinguishable.
