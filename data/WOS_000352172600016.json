Method: The software performs analysis by cross-correlating signals from the same patients. The criteria applied by the software include best channels, signal window, cross-correlation limits and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Software features include signal display comparing different tests and groups of sectors (quadrants, rings and hemispheres). Results: The software's performance and capabilities are demonstrated on the results obtained from a patient with acute optic neuritis who underwent 9 follow-up mfVEP tests. Numerical values and graphics are presented and discussed for this case. Conclusions: The authors present a software application used to study progression in mfVEP signals. It is also useful in research projects designed to improve mfVEP techniques. This software makes it easier for users to manage the signals and allows them to choose various ways of selecting signals and representing results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
