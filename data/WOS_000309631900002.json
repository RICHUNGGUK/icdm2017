After exploring the local geometry and saddle point property of 3D medial axis transform, the mathematical programming method is employed to construct the saddle point programming models. Based on the optimality conditions that the optimal solutions should satisfy, a generic algorithm for computing various medial axis points is developed. In order to identify the junction points and localize the problem, the boundary and the skeletal curves are divided into skeletal segments, and it is proved to be efficient and accurate by numerical examples.
