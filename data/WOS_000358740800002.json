The experimentation carried out shows that our proposal outperforms the algorithms studied whenever the automata have more than a (quite small) number of states and symbols.", "paper_title": "A Split-Based Incremental Deterministic Automata Minimization Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000358740800002"}
