In this paper, we investigate and evaluate (1) the effect of color space transformation on skin detection performance and finding the appropriate color space for skin detection, (2) the role of the illuminance component of a color space, (3) the appropriate pixel based skin color modeling technique and finally, (4) the effect of color constancy algorithms on color based skin classification. The comprehensive color space and skin color modeling evaluation will help in the selection of the best combinations for skin detection. Nine skin modeling approaches (Ada-Boost, Bayesian network, J48, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayesian, Random Forest, RBF network, SVM and the histogram approach of Jones and Rehg (2002)) in six color spaces (IHLS, HSI, RGB, normalized RGB, YCbCr and CIELAB) with the presence or absence of the illuminance component are compared and evaluated. Moreover, the impact of five color constancy algorithms on skin detection is reported. Results on a database of 8991 images with manually annotated pixel-level ground truth show that (1) the cylindrical color spaces outperform other color spaces, (2) the absence of the illuminance component decreases performance, (3) the selection of an appropriate skin color modeling approach is important and that the tree based classifiers (Random forest, J48) are well suited to pixel based skin detection. As a best combination, the Random Forest combined with the cylindrical color spaces, while keeping the illuminance component outperforms other combinations, and (4) the usage of color constancy algorithms can improve skin detection performance.
