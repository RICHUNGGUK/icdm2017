First, a region based fourth order PDE is proposed, which conductance coefficients are chosen adaptively in terms of the domain type. Thus, the proposed method can preserve the advantages of forth order PDE and avoid leaving isolated black and white speckles. Furthermore, the region based fourth order PDE and two discontinuity measures are incorporated into a LCC fourth order PDE, where the joint use of the two discontinuity measures leads to a complementary effect for edge preservation. The proposed LCC fourth order PDE is tested on two typical images, including texture image and natural scene image, which show the superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A local structural adaptive partial differential equation for image denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400005"}
