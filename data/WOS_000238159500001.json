It has already been shown that the notion of autosymmetry is a valid measure of regularity, however such a notion has been studied thus far either in the theoretical framework of self-dual Boolean functions, or for the synthesis of a particular family of three-level logic networks. In this paper we show that the degree of autosymmetry of an arbitrary function can be computed implicitly in a very efficient way, and autosymmetry can then be exploited in any logic minimization context. Our algorithms make crucial use of Binary Decision Diagrams. A set of experimental results on the synthesis of standard benchmark functions substantiates the practical relevance of our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Exploiting regularities for Boolean function synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000238159500001"}
