The biped is simplified as an inverted pendulum with a foot-link. The controller consists of a general regression neural network (GRNN) feedback control, which stabilizes the inverted pendulum in a region around the upright position, and a PID feedback control, which keeps the pendulum at the upright position. The GRNN controller is also designed to minimize an energy-related cost function while satisfying the constraints between the foot-link and the ground. The optimization has been carried out using the genetic algorithm (GA) and the GRNN is directly trained during optimization iteration process to provide the closed loop feedback optimal controller. The stability of the controlled system is analyzed using the concept of Lyapunov exponents, and a stability region is determined. Simulation results show that the controller can keep the inverted pendulum at the upright position while nearly minimizing an energy-related cost function and keeping the foot-link stationary on the ground. The work contributes to bipedal balancing control, which is important to the development of bipedal robots. Crown Copyright (c) 2006 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
