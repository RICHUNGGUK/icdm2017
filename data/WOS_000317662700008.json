The real-time thermal monitor network employing thermal cameras is proposed to cooperatively localize hotspots and extract their characteristics (i.e., temperature, size, and shape). These characteristics are adopted to classify the causes of hotspots and make energy-efficient thermal management decisions such as job migration. Specifically, a sculpturing algorithm for extracting and reconstructing shape characteristics of hotspots is proposed to minimize the network overhead. Experimental results show the validity of all the algorithms proposed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Thermal camera networks for large datacenters using real-time thermal monitoring mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000317662700008"}
