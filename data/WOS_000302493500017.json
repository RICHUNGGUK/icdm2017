According to official statistics, it shows by the end of 2010, there have been 2,487,893 elderly people over 65 years old in Taiwan, occupying 10.74% of total population, and the number is growing continuously. According to the latest population projection conducted by Council for Economic Planning and Development (CEPD), it is estimated that in 2017, Taiwan will become an aged society, while in 2025 become a super aged society. In comparison with some European countries, such as Germany, France and United Kingdom, it demonstrates rapid population aging in Taiwan. Due to the coming of an aged society, homecare service becomes more and more important. Smart phones have the characteristics of personalization, multi-function and portability, therefore, it is suitable to develop a mobile care system with high portability on the platform. This study utilizes Android open platform to develop a homecare system for the elderly combining with alarm clock, GPS global positioning system and call catcher. Alarm application reminds the patients to take the medicine regularly, while call catcher prevents the elderly from being fraud. And further, combining with GPS, it is also effective to prevent the elderly from getting lost.", "paper_title": "An Android Alarm Clock Application Combining with Function of SMS and GPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000302493500017"}
