Advances in information technology have prompted the development of systems that can facilitate automatic translation between sign language and spoken language. More recently, systems translating between Arabic sign and spoken language have become popular. This paper reviews systems and methods for the automatic recognition of Arabic sign language. Additionally, this paper highlights the main challenges characterizing Arabic sign language as well as potential future research directions.", "paper_title": "Image-Based and Sensor-Based Approaches to Arabic Sign Language Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340436000012"}
