The inexact variation is shown to have the same convergence properties accepting a residue in both the primal and dual Newton step equation also for feasible iterates.", "paper_title": "On the convergence of an inexact primal-dual interior point method for linear programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000236456400072"}
