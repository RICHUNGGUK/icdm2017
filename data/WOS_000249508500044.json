This problem is a three-dimensional layout optimization problem with behavioral constraints, and is difficult to solve in polynomial time. In this study, we firstly used a Hopfield neural network (HNN) to allocate the given apparatuses and equipment to the bearing plate surfaces in the satellite module. Then, we integrated genetic algorithm/particle swarm optimization (GA/PSO) and quasi-principal component analysis (QPCA) to deal with the further detailed layout optimization. The numerical experimental results showed the feasibility and efficiency of our method for layout optimization of a satellite module. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
