The obtained splines are a direct generalization of bivariate polynomial splines on planar partitions. They are defined as composite functions consisting of rational functions and are parametrized by a single parameter domain, which is a piecewise planar surface, such as a triangulation of a cloud of 3D points. The idea of the construction is to utilize linear rational transformations (or transition maps) to endow the piecewise planar surface with a particular C-infinity-differentiable structure appropriate for defining rational splines.
