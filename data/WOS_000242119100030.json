Such spaces are built from a set of interesting word co-occurrences, which are properly arranged into taxonomies to define orthogonal hierarchical dimensions. As a result, users can explore and analyze the contents of large document collections by making use of well-known OLAP operators (On-Line Analytic Processing) over these spaces.", "paper_title": "Inferring multidimensional cubes for representing conceptual document spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000242119100030"}
