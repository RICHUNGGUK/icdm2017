In particular, the planned routes can be quickly modified to account for the occurrence of new customer requests, which might imply diverting a vehicle away from its current destination. In this paper, a previously developed problem-solving approach for a vehicle routing problem with dynamic requests and dynamic travel times is extended to account for more sophisticated communication means between the drivers and the central dispatch office. Computational results are reported to empirically demonstrate the benefits of this extension. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
