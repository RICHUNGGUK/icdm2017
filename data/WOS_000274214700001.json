However, factors such as intentional periodic disconnection by the mobile hosts (MH) result ill further needs for managing access modes so as to let the mobile hosts procure highest benefit through the disconnections. We address this Issue in this paper and propose Solutions for the MH to retrieve the broadcast data. Our performance results show that the proposed algorithms indeed achieve almost the optimal performance, but require only 5-30% of the cost of all algorithm that is otherwise designed.", "paper_title": "Benefit-oriented data retrieval in data broadcast environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000274214700001"}
