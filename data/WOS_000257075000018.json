For illustrative volume visualizations it is difficult to specify the mapping between the 3D data and the visual representation that preserves the intention of the user. The semantic layers concept establishes this mapping with a linguistic formulation of rules that directly map data features to rendering styles. With semantic layers fuzzy logic is used to evaluate the user defined illustration rules in a preprocessing step. In this paper we introduce interaction-dependent rules that are evaluated for each frame and are therefore computationally more expensive. Enabling interaction-dependent rules, however allows the use of a new class of semantics, resulting in more expressive interactive illustrations. We show that the evaluation of the fuzzy logic can be done on the graphics hardware enabling the efficient use of interaction-dependent semantics. Further we introduce the flat rendering mode and discuss how different rendering parameters are influenced by the rule base. Our approach provides high quality, illustrative volume renderings at interactive frame rates, guided by the specification of illustration rates.", "paper_title": "Interaction-dependent semantics for illustrative volume rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000257075000018"}
