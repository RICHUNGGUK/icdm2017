Using the methods of Ergodic theory, we associate to any Mobius number system its transaction quotient T >= 1 and show that the norm of the state matrix after n transactions is of the order T-n. We argue that the Bimodular Mobius number system introduced in Kurka [10] has transaction quotient less than 1.2, so that it computes the arithmetical operations faster than any standard positional system.", "paper_title": "Fast Arithmetical Algorithms in Mobius Number Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000305706700005"}
