We consider a four-terminal relay-eavesdropper channel which consists of multiple relay-eavesdropper channels as subchannels. For the discrete memoryless model, we establish outer and inner bounds on the rate-equivocation region. The inner bound allows mode selection at the relay. For each subchannel, secure transmission is obtained through one of two coding schemes at the relay: decoding-and-forwarding the source message or confusing the eavesdropper through noise injection. For the Gaussian memoryless channel, we establish lower and upper bounds on the perfect secrecy rate. Furthermore, we study a special case in which the relay does not hear the source and show that under certain conditions the lower and upper bounds coincide. The results established for the parallel Gaussian relay-eavesdropper channel are then applied to study the fading relay-eavesdropper channel. Analytical results are illustrated through some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Secure Communication Over Parallel Relay Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000301506500002"}
