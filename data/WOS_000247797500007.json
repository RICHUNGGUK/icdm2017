We present two randomized distributed algorithms, CDSColor and CDSTop which take into account the effect of wireless interference and the consequent loss of messages during the execution of the algorithm. These algorithms produce a CDS of constant size and constant stretch ratio with high probability, and converge in polylogarithmic running time. Specifically, algorithm CDSColor requires the nodes to know (estimates of) the maximum degree A and the size of the network n and converges in O (Delta log(2) n) time. Algorithm CDSTop requires the nodes to know their three-hop topology and (an estimate of) the network size n and converges in O (log(2) n) time. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first distributed interference-aware CDS algorithms for wireless ad hoc networks which break the linear running-time barrier. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
