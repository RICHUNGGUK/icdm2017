The proposed guidance law combines the well-known PNG law and cooperative acceleration command, which is based on the feedback of state error between the current missile and the mean value of participant missiles. The state variable in this paper is used as the approximate calculation of time-to-go. The cooperative acceleration command is designed to adjust the flight path and impact time, which leads the multi-missiles to hit the common target simultaneously. During the engagement, the velocities of missiles are not changed and presetting impact time is not needed. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed guidance law.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Salvo Attack Using Guidance Law of Multiple Missiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000370189200018"}
