Pruesse, F. Ruskey, Gray codes from antimatroids. Order 10 (1993) 239-252] presented an algorithm for generating a Gray code for the ideals of a poser, where two adjacent ideals differ by one or two elements. Their algorithm takes O(n) amortized time per ideal. Squire [M. Squire, Enumerating the ideals of a poser, http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/465417.html] presented a recurrence for the ideals of a poset that enabled him to find an algorithm for generating these ideals in O(log n) amortized time per ideal, but not in Gray code order. We use Squire's recurrence to find a Gray code for the ideals of a poser, where two adjacent ideals differ by one or two elements. In the worst case our algorithm has the same complexity as that of Pruesse and Ruskey and in the other cases its complexity is better and approaches that of Squire's algorithm. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
