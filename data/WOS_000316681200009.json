Tagging technologies such as RFID (NFC) and QR codes, which are increasingly available on mobiles, can enable in situ engagement with these digital object memories. However, there is a lack of an agreed format for the description of the structure of object memories that are applicable across different application domains. We propose, based on two large-scale research projects and industry inputs, an Object Memory Model (OMM) that aims to define a generic and extensible structure for digital object memories. This structure builds on widely used web protocols and best practices with the aim to provide an open and flexible architecture for the augmentation of real-world objects with a digital memory. We outline and discuss the OMM model and provide examples of digital memories that are linked to real-world objects. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
