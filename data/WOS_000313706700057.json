The paper shows how an observer-based drive control can efficiently reject the harmonic torque disturbances providing smooth angular velocity. The proposed control design is based on the state-space torque harmonics representation and Luenberger observer that proved to be adequate. The designed control algorithms are verified using an experimental setup with a permanent magnet synchronous motor with well-detectable torque harmonics. The rejection of additive position periodic torque disturbances is experimentally demonstrated for two first harmonics and that for different angular velocities.", "paper_title": "Observer-Based Compensation of Additive Periodic Torque Disturbances in Permanent Magnet Motors", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700057"}
