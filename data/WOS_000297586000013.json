Network signal-transmission delays and signal-quantization effects are simultaneously considered. The network is with two time-varying additive delays and limited capacity. First, a quantized output-feedback networked control system (NCS) model is established to describe the impulsive NCSs through a channel with limited capacity. Then, based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and a parallel-distributed compensation scheme, a delay-dependent stabilization approach is developed for the impulsive NCSs, which guarantees that the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable. Finally, a simulation example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Quantized Control Design for Impulsive Fuzzy Networked Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000297586000013"}
