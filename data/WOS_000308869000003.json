This research sought to determine optimum flight-path routes that make maximum utilization of UAV terrain-masking opportunities and flight range capability to avoid radar detection. The problem was formulated as one of constrained optimization in three dimensions; advantageous solutions were identified using Algorithm A*. Topographical features were exploited by the algorithm to avoid radar detection. The model included provisions for preferred altitude ranges, adjustable aircraft climb-and descent-rate envelopes, movement costs based on fractional detection probability, radar horizon masking, and simulated radar cross-section lookup tables.", "paper_title": "RANGE-LIMITED UAV TRAJECTORY USING TERRAIN MASKING UNDER RADAR DETECTION RISK", "paper_id": "WOS:000308869000003"}
