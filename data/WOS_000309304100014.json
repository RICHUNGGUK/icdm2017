Two versions of finite strip methods (FSM), namely semi-analytical and B-spline methods are developed. The mechanical properties of FGM are assumed to change in thickness direction according to a power-law function. The temperature effects are ignored. The strain terms are expressed in terms of the Koiter-Sanders theory of shallow shells. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of the developed methods in predicting parametric behavior of the subject structures, some representative results are obtained and compared with those in the literature wherever available.
