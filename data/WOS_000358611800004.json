However, application development is still one of the main hurdles to a wide adoption of IoT technology. Application development is done at a low level, very close to the operating system and requires programmers to focus on low-level system issues. The underlying APIs can be very complicated and the amount of data collected can be huge. This can be very hard to deal with as a developer. In this paper, we present a runtime model based approach to IoT application development. First, the manageability of sensor devices is abstracted as runtime models that are automatically connected with the corresponding systems. Second, a customized model is constructed according to a personalized application scenario and the synchronization between the customized model and sensor device runtime models is ensured through model transformation. Thus, all the application logic can be carried out by executing programs on the customized model. An experiment on a real-world application scenario demonstrates the feasibility, effectiveness, and benefits of the new approach to IoT application development.", "paper_title": "Runtime model based approach to IoT application development", "paper_id": "WOS:000358611800004"}
