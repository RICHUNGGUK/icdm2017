All the decision rules of FLC are automatically generated by the Lyapunov stability criterion. The proposed control scheme can be easily derived with minimum information of the controlled plant. Furthermore, the fuzzy inference scheme can successfully be applied to stabilize the nonlinear discrete-time systems. We introduce three discrete-time systems, including a linear plant, a nonlinear plant, and a delayed plant, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FLC.", "paper_title": "Design of Lyapunov function based fuzzy logic controller for a class of discrete-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000255140000001"}
