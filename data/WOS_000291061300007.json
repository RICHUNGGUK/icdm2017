Cyberterrorism is the exploitation of computer network tools to incur malfunction or shut down critical infrastructures with several keyboard punches, which is dramatically different from traditional terrorism. Due to the ubiquitous multimedia communication tools, they have radically transformed the ways concerning data transmission. Unfortunately, it also incurs unprecedented opportunities for committing cyber crimes that we were not able to foresee two decades ago. Undoubtedly, the mushrooming proliferation of mobile phones spectacularly triggers the information security leakage while most people heavily rely on mobile phones for daily communication. As cybercrime or cyberterrorism surges, digital forensics (DF) of mobile communication devices still enormously lags behind than computer forensics. Hence, in this research paper, we provide a hypothetical case review concerning the DF of a potential cyberterrorist attack that was triggered by a mobile multimedia smart phone utilizing a popular web 2.0 application program via ubiquitous Wi-Fi access points. The corresponding DF of the mobile device was conducted in a step-by-step manner as well as the crime scene reconstruction based on the digital evidence collected, analyzed, and preserved.", "paper_title": "Potential cyberterrorism via a multimedia smart phone based on a web 2.0 application via ubiquitous Wi-Fi access points and the corresponding digital forensics", "paper_id": "WOS:000291061300007"}
