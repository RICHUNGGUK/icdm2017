To guess a primal solution to the Lagrangean dual, we average solutions to the Lagrangean subproblem. Branching decisions are then based on this estimated (fractional) primal solution. Extensive numerical results reveal that the method is much faster and more robust than other state-of-the-art methods for solving the CFLP exactly.", "paper_title": "A Simple but Usually Fast Branch-and-Bound Algorithm for the Capacitated Facility Location Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000310834700007"}
