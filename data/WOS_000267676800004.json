In this study, we design machine cushions based on the concepts of wave guiding and suppression and with structures called \"area ratio modified\" (ARM) structures. The guiding direction of the internal guiding cylinders is one major factor that affects the machine cushion's capabilities to absorb impact and suppress vibration. In order to compare and further investigate the machine cushion's capabilities and limitations, we designed a simple, passive machine cushion as well as three ARM machine cushions, each with a different guiding direction of its internal guiding cylinders. Simulation results show that the ARM machine cushion with cylinders guided vertically upward has the best impact suppression capability. The derived dynamic equations and the simulation results obtained can be used also for evaluating the feasibility and limitations of machine cushion design in the future. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
