Several sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring the existence, uniqueness and global exponential stability of equilibrium point for the considered neural networks by the idea of vector Lyapunov function method, M-matrix theory and analytic technique. Moreover, the estimation for exponential convergence rate index is proposed. An example with simulations is provided to verify the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
