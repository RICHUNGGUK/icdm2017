For strict self-assembly, where tiles are not allowed to be placed outside the target structure, it is an open question whether any self-similar fractal can self-assemble. This has motivated the development of techniques to approximate fractals with strict self-assembly. Ideally, such an approximation would produce a structure with the same fractal dimension as the intended fractal, but with specially labeled tiles at positions corresponding to points in the fractal. We show that the Sierpinski carpet, along with an infinite class of related fractals, can approximately self-assemble in this manner. Our construction takes a set of parameters specifying a target fractal and creates a tile assembly system in which the fractal approximately self-assembles. This construction introduces rulers and readers to control the self-assembly of a fractal structure without distorting it. To verify the fractal dimension of the resulting assemblies, we prove a result on the dimension of sets embedded into discrete fractals. We also give a conjecture on the limitations of approximating self-similar fractals.", "paper_title": "Self-Assembling Rulers for Approximating Generalized Sierpinski Carpets", "paper_id": "WOS:000321908000006"}
