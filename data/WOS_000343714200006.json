This study examines whether these touch screen panels have distinctive effects on user perception. Data from a between-subjects experiment (N = 80) in which participants were exposed to four panels indicate that the panel type has a significant effect on users' perceived sense of control, ease of use, satisfaction, and viewing quality.", "paper_title": "Does panel type affect haptic experience?
