Both hardware and software ecosystems have now matured, with fully IEEE compliant double precision and memory correction being supported and a rich set of software tools and libraries being available. This in turn has lead to their increased adoption in a growing number of fields, both in academia and, more recently, in industry. In this review we investigate the adoption of GPUs as accelerators in the field of Finite Element Structural Analysis, a design tool that is now essential in many branches of engineering. We survey the work that has been done in accelerating the most time consuming steps of the analysis, indicate the speedup that has been achieved and, where available, highlight software libraries and packages that will enable the reader to take advantage of such acceleration. Overall, we try to draw a high level picture of where the state of the art is currently at.", "paper_title": "GPU Acceleration for FEM-Based Structural Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000322523700001"}
