Our paper presents an integration of a Combined Multiple Models (CMM) technique with an evolutionary approach that is used for timing of parameters. Proposed hybrid classifier was tested in microarray analysis domain. This domain was chosen intentionally, because of the nature of Combined Multiple Models classifiers that are specialized in solving problems with high dimensionality and contain low number of samples. Evolutionary timing of parameters in combination with validation dataset enables fine tunings of parameters that are usually set to pre-defined values. Using this technique we made another step in leveling the accuracy of comprehensible classifiers to those represented by ensembles of classifiers.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary tuning of Combined Multiple Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600164"}
