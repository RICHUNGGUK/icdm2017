Then we study the network achievable average sum-rate maximization problem under sum transmit power budget constraint at SU communication nodes. In order to solve the trade-off problem between SU's sensing time and data transmission time based on opportunistic spectrum access (OSA) and the power allocation problem based on FD-MIMO transmit mode, we propose a simple trisection algorithm to obtain the optimal sensing time and apply an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to tackle the FD-MIMO based network achievable sum-rate maximization problem. Simulation results show that our proposed sensing time optimization and AO-based optimal power allocation strategies obtain a higher achievable average sum-rate than sequential convex approximations for matrix-variable programming (SCAMP)-based power allocation for the FD transmission mode, as well as equal power allocation for the half duplex (HD) transmission mode.", "paper_title": "Joint Opportunistic Spectrum Access and Optimal Power Allocation Strategies for Full Duplex Single Secondary User MIMO Cognitive Radio Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000007"}
