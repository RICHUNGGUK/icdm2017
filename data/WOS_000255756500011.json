While PMF was the first commonly used protein identification method, provided higher throughput than the tandem MS-based method, its accuracy is lower than that of the tandem MS method. Thus, it is desirable to develop PMF-based algorithm with higher protein identification accuracy to facilitate proteome research. Results: We propose a peak bagging method for single MS-based protein identification. It combines results from multiple PMF algorithms, where each PMF algorithm takes a random peak subset as input. Evaluation with a set of real MALDI-TOF MS spectra shows that the new peak bagging method provides consistent improvements over the single PMF algorithm.", "paper_title": "Peak bagging for peptide mass fingerprinting", "paper_id": "WOS:000255756500011"}
