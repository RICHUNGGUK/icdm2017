The performance suffers degradation under non-uniform traffic conditions. The timeslot-sharing algorithm with a dynamic grouping is proposed to decrease the degradation under the non-uniform traffic matrices. According to a given traffic matrix, the algorithm decomposes the given traffic matrix into a transmission matrix and a residual matrix. The algorithm aims to obtain a transmission matrix with most entries and to approach a uniform traffic matrix, Also, its complexity is evaluated. In the simulations, the system with the proposed algorithm provides a superior performance based on throughput, packet delay and node's buffer size. The results show that the algorithm is an efficient solution to improve the performance under uniform and non-uniform traffic distributions. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
