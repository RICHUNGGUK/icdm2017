The first approach makes use of classical neuro-SM technology, while the second combines neuro-SM with prior knowledge input and source difference method. The formulas for obtaining the transconductance and output conductance in two approaches are derived. The I - V characteristics as well as their conductances obtained by the formulas in two approaches are compared to the measured data. Experimental results, which confirm the validity of our approaches, are also presented. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
