The first one detects possible dead-end problems during the graph grammar based anisotropic refinements of the mesh. The second one employs an enhanced graph grammar model that is actually dead-end free. We apply the resulting algorithm to the simulation of resistivity logging measurements for estimating the location of underground oil and/or gas formations. The graph grammar based Petri net models allow to fix the self-adaptive mesh refinement algorithm and finish the adaptive computations with the required accuracy needed by the numerical solution.", "paper_title": "PETRI NETS MODELING OF DEAD-END REFINEMENT PROBLEMS IN A 3D ANISOTROPIC HP-ADAPTIVE FINITE ELEMENT METHOD", "paper_id": "WOS:000361869000007"}
