In this paper, a new Bayesian approach for analysing longitudinal data is proposed. This innovative approach takes into account the possibility of having nonlinear regression structures on the mean and linear regression structures on the variance-covariance matrix of normal observations, and it is based on the modelling strategy suggested by Pourahmadi [M. Pourahmadi, Joint mean-covariance models with applications to longitudinal data: Unconstrained parameterizations, Biometrika, 87 (1999), pp. 667-690.]. We initially extend the classical methodology to accommodate the fitting of nonlinear mean models then we propose our Bayesian approach based on a generalization of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm of Cepeda [E.C. Cepeda, Variability modeling in generalized linear models, Unpublished Ph.D. Thesis, Mathematics Institute, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, 2001]. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methodology by analysing one example, the cattle data set, that is used to study cattle growth.", "paper_title": "Bayesian modelling of the mean and covariance matrix in normal nonlinear models", "paper_id": "WOS:000266244900006"}
