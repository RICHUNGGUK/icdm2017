In the relevant literature there are already proposed solutions to the dynamism support problem. One particular contribution offered in this study over previous approaches is the systematic framework support for post-structural-change state synchronization among models with related couplings, in a way that benefits from the strongly typed execution environment SiMA provides. In addition to introducing theoretical extensions to basic SiMA, we report the results of performance measurements to illustrate the added value of dynamism extensions over the basic version, using a sample wireless sensor network simulation.", "paper_title": "Supporting dynamic simulations with Simulation Modeling Architecture (SiMA): a Discrete Event System Specification-based modeling and simulation framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000304709200006"}
