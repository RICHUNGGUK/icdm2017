The model is only dependent on bias, size, and technology of MOSFETs, and hence is suitable for low-noise RF IC design. Noise parameters of MOSFETs are achieved and good agreement between calculated and measured results is demonstrated.", "paper_title": "Analytical modeling of thermal noise in deep submicron MOSFETs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263975800007"}
