They are the exponential diffusion kernel, the Laplacian exponential diffusion kernel, the von Neumann diffusion kernel, the regularized Laplacian kernel, the commute-time (or resistance-distance) kernel, the random-walk-with-restart similarity matrix, and finally, a kernel first introduced in this paper (the regularized commute-time kernel) and two kernels defined in some of our previous work and further investigated in this paper (the Markov diffusion kernel and the relative-entropy diffusion matrix). The kernel-on-graphs approach is simple and intuitive. It is illustrated by applying the nine kernels to a collaborative-recommendation task, viewed as a link prediction problem, and to a semisupervised classification task, both on several databases. The methods compute proximity measures between nodes that help study the structure of the graph. Our comparisons suggest that the regularized commute-time and the Markov diffusion kernels perform best on the investigated tasks, closely followed by the regularized Laplacian kernel.
