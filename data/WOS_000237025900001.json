This investigation presents a dynamic method for eliminating global gouges. Moreover, this study proposes using pair-wise bridges to merge pockets and islands. The proposed pair-wise bridge method leaves very small sized scallops. Additionally, an alternative Boolean method is designed to solve the problem of pocket containing numerous islands.", "paper_title": "Tool path generation for arbitrary pockets with islands", "paper_id": "WOS:000237025900001"}
