Uncertain variables are used to describe the estimations of customers' positions, and an expected distance minimization model is proposed. In addition, a hybrid intelligent algorithm for solving the proposed model problem is provided. To illustrate the application of the new model and show the effectiveness of the solution algorithm, a numerical example is also presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling uncapacitated facility location problem with uncertain customers' positions", "paper_id": "WOS:000358755600015"}
