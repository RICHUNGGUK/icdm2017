The NFC-equipped phone (NFC phone) that embeds NFC technology into a cellular phone makes it increasing attractive for business uses, such as for making payments or ticketing. This paper presents a novel architecture for NFC phone-driven, personalized, context-aware smart spaces. With this architecture, users can employ the phone, which carries predefined personal desires, to control devices, such as home appliances. The appliances are automatically controlled and driven in response to a request sent from the phone by using predefined ontology and rule-based reasoning. We also implement a prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the architecture, evaluate its performance, and show its efficiency.", "paper_title": "NCASH: NFC Phone-Enabled Personalized Context Awareness Smart-Home Environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000276688800004"}
