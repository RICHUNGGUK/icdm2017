The theoretical results of KM algorithms are re-obtained. Different from current KM algorithms, centroid computation methods that use different root-finding routines are provided. Such centroid computation methods can obtain the exact solution and are different from the current approximate methods using sampled data. Further improvements and analysis of the centroid problem using root-finding and integral computation techniques are also possible.", "paper_title": "Connect Karnik-Mendel Algorithms to Root-Finding for Computing the Centroid of an Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000293750700004"}
