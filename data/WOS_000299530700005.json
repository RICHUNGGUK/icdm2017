The proposed architecture features a very high data processing rate as well as excellent error correction capability. A low-complexity syndrome computation architecture and a high-speed dual-processing pipelined simplified inversonless Berlekamp-Massey (Dual-pSiBM) key equation solver architecture were applied to the proposed concatenated BCH decoder with an aim of implementing a high-speed low-complexity decoder architecture. Two-parallel processing allows the decoder to achieve a high data processing rate required for 100 Gb/s optical communication systems. Also, the proposed two-iteration concatenated BCH code structure with block interleaving methods allows the decoder to achieve 8.91dB of net coding gain performance at 10(-15) decoder output bit error rate to compensate for serious transmission quality degradation. Thus, it has potential applications in next generation forward error correction schemes for 100 Gb/s optical communications.", "paper_title": "A High-Speed Low-Complexity Concatenated BCH Decoder Architecture for 100 Gb/s Optical Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000299530700005"}
