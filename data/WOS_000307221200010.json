In the presented paper generator standstill frequency response tests is used as an approach to derive dynamic models and equivalent circuits descriptive of machine behavior for dynamic studies by using Excel Macros. The method is described and applied to a case study. The extraction process for obtaining the parameters is demonstrated. Evaluation of the method with 20 senior under graduate students and 20 junior power system engineers is very positive in terms of their developing confidence in and understanding of this test and deriving the dynamic model.
