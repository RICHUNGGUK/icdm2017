In this article we develop a comprehensive framework to categorize interworking solutions by defining a generic set of interworking levels and its related key interworking mechanisms. The proposed framework is used to analyze some of the most relevant interworking solutions being considered in different standardization bodies. More specifically, I-WLAN and GAN approaches for WLAN and cellular integration, solutions for WiMAX and 3GPP LTE/SAE interworking, and the forthcoming IEEE 802.21 standard are discussed from the common point of view provided by the elaborated framework.", "paper_title": "INTERWORKING IN HETEROGENEOUS WIRELESS NETWORKS: COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK AND FUTURE TRENDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282380800005"}
