New solutions in the promising feasible solution search space are constructed using combination of scatter and random search. The procedure of identifying tradeoff-cutting planes and scatter search continues for either a predetermined fixed number of iterations or until no solutions in the promising feasible solution search space are found. We formulate a coal production planning problem with fuzzy profit and fuzzy coal quality decision-maker utilities, and apply our procedure for additive and multiplicative decision-maker utilities.
