The gain-boost class-C inverter behaves as a sub-threshold amplifier, thereby minimizing power dissipation. The proposed ADC chip is fabricated in a SMIC 65-nm CMOS process with a die area of 0.63 mm(2). With 1.2 V of supply voltage, the ADC chip achieves a peak signal-to-noise-plus-distortion-ratio (SNDR) of 92 dB and a dynamic range (DR) of 97 dB over the 20 kHz audio band, consuming only 1.13 mW. These results make the ADC particularly suitable for portable electronics applications.", "paper_title": "A low-power inverter-based Sigma Delta analog-to-digital converter for audio applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000333614700022"}
