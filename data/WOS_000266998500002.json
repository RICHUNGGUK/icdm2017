By constructing a special coupling matrix, a new method is proposed to realize cluster synchronization. In particular, the coupling configuration matrix is not assumed to be symmetric or irreducible and the inner coupling matrix is not assumed to be diagonal or positive definite. Moreover, several sufficient conditions for Cluster synchronization are derived, based on Lyapunov stability theory and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique. Finally, an example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
