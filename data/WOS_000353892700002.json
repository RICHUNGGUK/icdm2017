In this paper, the complexity of some algorithms to obtain this representation is analyzed. Moreover, some properties and constructions of new codes from given ones in terms of this representation are described. Algorithms to compute the minimum distance of binary nonlinear codes, based on known algorithms for linear codes, are also established, along with an algorithm to decode such codes. All results are written in such a way that they can be easily transformed into algorithms, and the performance of these algorithms is evaluated.", "paper_title": "Efficient representation of binary nonlinear codes: constructions and minimum distance computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000353892700002"}
