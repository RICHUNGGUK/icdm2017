To solve the over-generalization problem encountered by existing methods, GP-Close employs the notion of generalization closure for systematic over-generalization reduction. Empirical experiments conducted on real world RDF data sets show that our method can substantially reduce pattern redundancy and perform much better than the original generalized association rule mining algorithm Cumulate in term of time efficiency.", "paper_title": "Mining RDF metadata for generalized association rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000241155300022"}
