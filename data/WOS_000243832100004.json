It contains a brief overview of the mechanical structure and an accurate description of the prototype kinematical behavior. In particular, two different numerical methods for solving the kinematical inversion process are described in details. Moreover, the aim of this project is the development of new technologies for the realization of bio-mechanical limbs for motorial gait rehabilitation, as well as for human gate study and analysis. In particular, the pneumatic actuator has been adopted in this work, representing an alternative solution with respect to the widely used electric motor. This paper proposes also a brief description of the main gait parameters generation as well as the control strategies and architecture. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
