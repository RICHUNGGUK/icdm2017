In these methods it is the velocity instead of the pressure the extrapolated unknown. Moreover, predictor-corrector schemes are suggested, again motivated by the new monolithic system. Key implementation aspects are discussed, and a complete stability analysis is performed. We end with a set of numerical examples in order to compare these methods with classical pressure-correction schemes.
