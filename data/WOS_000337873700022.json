We derive the closed analytical expression for the Uehling potential and evaluate corrections on vacuum polarization for the 1(1)S-state of the two-electron He-3 and He-4 atoms and for some two-electron ions, including the Li+, Be2+, B3+ and C4+ ions. The correction for vacuum polarization in two-electron He atoms has been evaluated as Delta E-ueh approximate to 7.253 +/- 0.0025 x 10(-7) a.u. The analogous corrections in the two-electron He-like ions rapidly increase with the nuclear charge Q (Delta E-ueh approximate to 2.7061 x 10(-6) a.u. for the Li+ ion and 2.3495 X 10(-5) a.u. for the C4+ ion). The corresponding corrections have also been evaluated for the electron-nucleus and electron-electron interactions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
