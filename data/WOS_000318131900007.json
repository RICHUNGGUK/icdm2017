The metaheuristic consists of a memetic algorithm with an embedded tabu search, using a combination of well-known and problem-specific neighbourhoods. This solution procedure clearly outperforms the only other existing metaheuristic in the literature. For smaller instances, whose optimal solution is known, it is able to consistently find the optimal solution. For the other instances, it obtains several new best known solutions.
