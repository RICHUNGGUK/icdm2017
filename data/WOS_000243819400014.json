The \"two-level\" mixture model allows effective classification in a non-normal setting. The natural constraints of the problem make the model identifiable. The effectiveness of the proposal is shown by simulation studies and an application to the 1997 Italian Labour Cost Survey. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
