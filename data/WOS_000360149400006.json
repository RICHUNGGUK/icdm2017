In 1981 Horn and Schunck (HS) introduced two basic assumptions: \"brightness value constancy\" and \"smooth variation\" to estimate a smooth OF field over the entire image -global approach-. In parallel, Lucas and Kanade (LK) assumed constant motion patterns for image patches, estimating piecewise-homogeneous OF fields -local approach-. Several variations of these approaches exist today. Here we present the combined local-global (CLG) approach by Bruhn et al. which encompasses properties of HS-OF and LKOF, aiming to improve the OF accuracy for small-scale variations, while delivering the HS-OF dense and smooth fields. A multiscale implementation is provided for 2D images, together with two numerical solvers: Successive Over-Relaxation and the faster Pointwise-Coupled Gauss-Seidel by Bruhn et al.. The algorithm works on gray-scale (single channel) images, with color images being converted prior to the OF computation.", "paper_title": "An Implementation of Combined Local-Global Optical Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000360149400006"}
