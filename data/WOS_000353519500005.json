The vehicle-to-grid technology, for instance, literally turns electric vehicles into a mobile battery, enabling new areas of applications (e.g., to provide regulatory energy, to do grid-load balancing, or to buffer surpluses of energy) and business perspectives. Utilising a vehicle's battery, however is not without a price-in this case: the driver's mobility. Given this dependency, it is interesting that most available works consider the application of electric vehicles for energy and grid-related problems in isolation, that is, detached from mobility-related issues. The distributed artificial intelligence laboratory, or DAI-Lab, is a third-party funded research lab at Technische Universitat Berlin and integrates the chair for agent technologies in business applications and telecommunication. The DAI-Lab has engaged in a large number of both, past and upcoming projects concerned with two aspects of managing electric vehicles, namely: energy and mobility. This article aims to summarise experiences that were collected during the last years and to present developed solutions which consider energy and mobility-related problems jointly.", "paper_title": "A common approach to intelligent energy and mobility services in a smart city environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000353519500005"}
