In this work, a novel decode-process-and-forward (DPF) scheme is proposed for video summary transmission, where a relay node with video processing capability is involved to generate a concise version of the summary frame, called summary of summary (SoS). The SoS information is effectively consumed by the destination side to enhance its error concealment capability, leading to an improved video reconstruction quality. This article proposes a generic cross-layer optimization framework for cooperative video summary transmission, which jointly considers the source coding, relay processing parameters, power allocation, and error concealment strategy to achieve the best video quality. The problem is solved by using Lagrangian relaxation and dynamic programming. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing cooperative and non-cooperative transmission schemes.", "paper_title": "VIDEO SUMMARY DELIVERY OVER COOPERATIVE WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303393200013"}
