Weak resonant double Hopf bifurcations are completely analyzed in the parameter space of the coupling weight and the coupling delay by the perturbation-incremental scheme (PIS). Numerical simulations are given for justifying the theoretical results. To the best of our knowledge, the paper is the first one to introduce inertia to a four-neuron delayed system and clarify the relationship between system parameters and dynamical behaviors.", "paper_title": "WEAK RESONANT DOUBLE HOPF BIFURCATIONS IN AN INERTIAL FOUR-NEURON MODEL WITH TIME DELAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000299289900005"}
