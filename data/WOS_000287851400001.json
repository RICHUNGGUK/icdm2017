The concepts of efference copy and inverse model are defined, and multiple biological mechanisms are described, including those that form the basis of integration, extrapolation, and comparison/cancellation operations. Open questions for future research include the biological basis of continuous and distributed versus modular control, and somatosensory-motor coordination.", "paper_title": "What is the biological basis of sensorimotor integration?", "paper_id": "WOS:000287851400001"}
