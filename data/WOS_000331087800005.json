One of the main obstructions in designing Service Advertising, Discovery and Delivery (SADD) protocol for MAD MANETs is the fact that, in an attempt to increase their own visibility, network nodes tend to flood the network with their advertisements. In this paper, we present a SADD protocol for MAD MANET, based on Bloom filters, that effectively prevents advertising floods due to such misbehaving nodes. Our results with the ns-2 simulator show that our SADD protocol is effective in counteracting advertising floods, it keeps low the collision rate as well as the energy consumption while ensuring that each peer receives all messages broadcasted by other peers.", "paper_title": "A multi-hop advertising discovery and delivering protocol for multi administrative domain MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000331087800005"}
