Relying on convex and stochastic optimization tools, the novel approach to resource allocation includes: i) development of jointly optimal subcarrier, power, and rate allocation for weighted sum-average-rate maximization; ii) judicious formulation and derivation of the optimal resource allocation for maximizing the utility of average user rates; and iii) development of the stochastic resource allocation schemes, and rigorous proof of their convergence and optimality. Simulations are also provided to demonstrate the merits of the novel schemes.", "paper_title": "Resource Allocation for Wireless Multiuser OFDM Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000291922500022"}
