In this paper, we use examples from both old and new games of different genres to explore the theory and design space of visualization for games. Drawing on these examples, we define a design space for this novel research topic and use it to formulate design patterns for how to best apply visualization technology to games. We then discuss the implications that this new framework will potentially have on the design and development of game and visualization technology in the future.", "paper_title": "Toward Visualization for Games: Theory, Design Space, and Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000308414100014"}
