In order to understand the charge transfer between the active species, in this work we analyze the influence of the geometry of monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia using reactivity descriptors such as electronic che -aEuro parts per thousand mical potential (mu), charge transfer () and molecular hardness (eta). We have found that the most preferred surface is tetragonal zirconia (tZrO (2)) indicating also that low charge transfer systems will generate less stable intermediates, that will allow to facilitate desorption process.", "paper_title": "Influence of the monoclinic and tetragonal zirconia phases on the water gas shift reaction.
