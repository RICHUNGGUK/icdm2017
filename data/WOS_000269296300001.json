The finite element method (FEM) is used to implement the adopted Cosserat formulation. As a result, the interfaces between the layers need not be explicitly modelled. Instead, the internal characteristic length, i.e., the layer thickness and also the interaction conditions between the layers are incorporated into the governing equations of the solution. This paper introduces a new 3D geometric stiffness matrix based on the principle of virtual work. The proposed geometric stiffness matrix is applied to the linear buckling analysis of a number of benchmark problems with various geometries, boundary conditions, and interaction conditions between the layers. In all cases, the FEM Cosserat solution exhibits a high level of consistency with the analytical solution. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
