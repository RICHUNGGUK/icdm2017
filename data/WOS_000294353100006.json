This paper describes the fundamental steps of our approach: instrumentation of the application; collection of exhaustive samples of runtime data about relevant quality attributes of the application, as well as characteristics of its runtime environment; synthesis of a utility function through statistical correlation over the collected data points; and embedding of code corresponding to the equation of the synthesized utility function within the application, which enables the computation of utility values at run time. We describe a number of case studies, with their results and implications, to motivate and discuss the significance of application-level utility, illustrate our statistical synthesis method, and present our framework for instrumentation, monitoring, and utility function embedding/evaluation.", "paper_title": "Synthesis of application-level utility functions for autonomic self-assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000294353100006"}
