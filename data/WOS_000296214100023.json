Design/methodology/approach - Questions and propositions are formed by examining personal work in intelligent, interactive system design. Findings - Proper consideration of gestural representation and intentionality leads to enhanced potential for collective expression in human/machine interaction. Originality/value - This approach extends ideas of conversation theory to improvisational contexts based on spontaneous, collective expression.", "paper_title": "Human:machine:human: Gesture, Sound and Embodiment", "paper_id": "WOS:000296214100023"}
