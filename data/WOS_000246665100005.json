However, the scalability of existing CVE systems is limited due to the constraints in processing power and network speed of each participating host. In this paper, a mobile agent based framework for large-scale CVE, MACVE, is proposed to support a large number of concurrent participants in a CVE with a large amount of evolving virtual entities. In MACVE, the CVE system is decomposed into a group of collaborative mobile agents, each of which is responsible for an independent system task. These agents can migrate or clone dynamically at any suitable participating host including traditional servers and qualified user hosts to avoid the potential bottleneck, which can improve the scalability of CVE. Our prototype system has demonstrated the feasibility of the proposed framework.", "paper_title": "MACVE: A mobile agent based framework for large-scale collaborative virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000246665100005"}
