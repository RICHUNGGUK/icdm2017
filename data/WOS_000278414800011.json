The Michaelis complex, which is constructed from a recent X-ray structure of the human brain aspartoacylase with a stable tetrahedral intermediate analogue, is reproduced in 1 ns molecular dynamics simulations at 300 K. The simulation shows that the substrate is tightly held in the active site by a hydrogen bond network and the putative nucleophilic water molecule is reasonably close to the nucleophilic center. The catalysis is further modeled with the density functional theory (DFT) in a truncated active-site model at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The DFT calculations indicate the reaction proceeds via a water promoted pathway with Glu178 serving as the general base and general acid. Transition state stabilization for nucleophilic addition is achieved by formations of the weak coordination bond between the substrate carbonyl oxygen atom and the zinc ion as well as of the strong hydrogen bonds between the substrate carbonyl oxygen atom and Arg63.
