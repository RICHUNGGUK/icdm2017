The subspace-based line detection (SLIDE) method proposed to estimate the center and the radius of a single circle. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for estimating several radii while extending the circle estimation to retrieve circular-like distorted contours. Particularly, we develop and validate a new model for virtual signal generation by simulating a circular antenna. The circle center is estimated by the SLIDE method. A variable speed propagation scheme toward the circular antenna yields a linear phase signal. Therefore, a high-resolution method provides the radius. Either the gradient method or the more robust combination of dividing rectangles and spline interpolation can extend this method extend this method for free form object segmentation. The retrieval of multiple non concentric circles and rotated ellipses is also considered. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we compare them with a least-squares method, Hough transform, and gradient vector flow. We apply the proposed method to hand-made images while considering some real-world images.", "paper_title": "Subspace-based and DIRECT algorithms for distorted circular contour estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000248831100019"}
