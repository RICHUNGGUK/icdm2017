Nevertheless, while original models have sharp features or multiple self-intersecting surfaces, it is still a challenge for previous algorithms to produce a semi-regular mesh with sharp features preservation as well as high mesh regularity. Therefore, this study proposes a robust semi-regular remeshing algorithm that uses a two-step surface segmentation scheme to build the high quality base mesh, as well as the regional relationship between the original surface and subdivision domain surface. Using the regional relationship, the proposed algorithm substantially enhances the accuracy and robustness of the backward projection process of subdivision vertices based on normal displacement. Furthermore, the mesh regularity of remeshed models is improved by the quadric mesh relaxation scheme. The experimental results demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed algorithm's semi-regular remeshing to preserve geometric features and have good triangle aspect ratio.", "paper_title": "A robust feature-preserving semi-regular remeshing method for triangular meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000293922400002"}
