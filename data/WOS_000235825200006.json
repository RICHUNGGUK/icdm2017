SMMP is an open-source FORTRAN package for molecular simulation of proteins within the standard geometry model. It is designed as a simple and inexpensive tool for researchers and students to become familiar with protein simulation techniques. This announcement describes the first major revision of this software package and its newly added features.", "paper_title": "An enhanced version of SMMP-open-source software package for simulation of proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000235825200006"}
