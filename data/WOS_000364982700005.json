In this paper, we propose a simple, effective and fast approach for the estimation of the motion blur-kernel, through a bi-l(0)-l(2)-norm regularization imposed on both the intermediate sharp image and the blur-kernel. Compared with existing methods, the proposed regularization is shown to be more effective and robust, leading to a more accurate motion blur-kernel and a better final restored image. A fast numerical scheme is deployed for alternatingly computing the sharp image and the blur-kernel, by coupling the operator splitting and augmented Lagrangian methods. Experimental results on both a benchmark image dataset and real-world motion blurred images show that the proposed approach is highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods in both deblurring effectiveness and computational efficiency.
