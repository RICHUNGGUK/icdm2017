In the interactive bicycle simulator the most important component is the rider-bicycle dynamic model. The Newton-Eulei method is adopted to formulate this model. Real-time data gathered by sensors and identified from a terrain database system are used for calculation of the rider-bicycle dynamics. Simple and effective devices are constructed and driven by the outputs of the rider-bicycle dynamic model. These devices are successfully applied to the interactive bicycle simulator.", "paper_title": "Implementation of the interactive bicycle simulator with its functional subsystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247557100006"}
