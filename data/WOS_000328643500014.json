We propose network design algorithms that are based on multistage integer linear programming (ILP) or heuristics. Numerical experiments prove that by employing waveband converters or both waveband and wavelength converters, hierarchical optical path networks can be cost effective over wide traffic demand ranges and a broad converter cost range.", "paper_title": "Effectiveness of Wavelength/Waveband Conversion and Its Allowable Cost Bound for Hierarchical Optical Path Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328643500014"}
