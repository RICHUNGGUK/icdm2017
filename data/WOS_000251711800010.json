Based on the theory of complex networks and computer simulation, we analyze the robustness to time-delay in linear consensus problem with different network topologies, such as global coupled network, star network, nearest-neighbor coupled network, small-world network, and scale-free network. It is found that global coupled network, star network, and scale-free network are vulnerable to time-delay, while nearest-neighbor coupled network and small-world network are robust to time-delay. And it is found that the maximum node degree of the network is a good predictor for time-delay robustness. And it is found that the robustness to time-delay can be improved significantly by a decoupling process to a small part of edges in scale-free network.", "paper_title": "Time-delay robustness of consensus problems in regular and complex networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000251711800010"}
