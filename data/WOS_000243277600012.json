On the basis of optical code division multiplexing (OCDM) technology, a novel OCDM-based multigranularity optical cross-connect (MG-OXC) is proposed. Compared with the traditional lambda-based MG-OXC, its switching capability has been extended to support fiber switching, waveband switching, lambda switching, and OCDM switching. In a network composed of OCDM-based MG-OXCs, a single wavelength can be shared by distinct label switched paths (LSPs) called OCDM-LSPs, and OCDM-LSP switching can be implemented in the optical domain. To improve the network flexibility for an OCDM-LSP provisioning, two kinds of switches enabling hybrid optical code (OC) - wavelength conversion are designed. Simulation results indicate that a blocking probability reduction of 2 orders can be obtained by deploying only five OCs to a single wavelength. Furthermore, compared with time-division-multiplexing LSP (TDM-LSP), owing to the asynchronous accessibility and the OC conversion, OCDM-LSPs have been shown to permit a simpler switch architecture and achieve better blocking performance than TDM-LSPs.
