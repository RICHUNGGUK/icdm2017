Calculation is detailed for a cold relativistic electron beam entering a cold magnetized plasma, and for arbitrarily oriented wave vectors. We show how one can elaborate on this example to account for temperatures, arbitrarily oriented magnetic field or a different kind of plasma.

The present Mathematica notebook performs the symbolic computation in terms of some usual dimensionless variables. Method of solution: The linearized relativistic fluid equations are directly entered and solved by Mathematica to express the first-order expression of the current. This expression is then introduced into a combination of Faraday and Ampere-Maxwell's equations to give the dielectric tensor. Some additional manipulations are needed to express the result in terms of the dimensionless variables. Restrictions on the complexity of the problem: Temperature effects are limited to small, i.e. non-relativistic, temperatures. The kinetic counterpart of the present Mathematica will usually not compute the required integrals. Typical running time: About 1 minute on a Intel Centrino 1.5 GHz Laptop with 512 MB of RAM.
