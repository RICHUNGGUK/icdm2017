These mechanisms are implemented by concurrency control policies in version control systems that may inhibit (i.e. 'to lock') or allow (i.e., 'not to lock') parallel development. This work presents a novel approach named Orion that analyzes the project's historical changes and suggests the most appropriate concurrency control policy for each software element. This suggestion aims at minimizing conflict situations and thus improving the productivity of the development team. In addition, it identifies critical elements that do not work well with any of these policies and are candidates to refactoring. We evaluated Orion through two experimental studies and the results, which indicated it was effective, led us to a prototype implementation. Apart from the Orion approach this paper also presents the planning, execution, and analysis stages of the evaluation, and details of prototype internals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
