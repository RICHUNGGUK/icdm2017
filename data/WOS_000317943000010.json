Based on a micromechanical analysis, the origin of deviatoric stress is decomposed into two components: contact force anisotropy and fabric anisotropy. Using a micro-macro approach, the back stress is interpreted as an contribution to the change of the fabric's principal direction. The evolution of the back stress is deduced from the stress-fabric relationship and determined with reference to the deviation of the principal directions between the rate of the reduced stress tensor and the actual reduced stress tensor. With this micro-macro framework, a mixed (isotropic-kinematic) hardening model is developed based on the classical isotropic hardening theory. A laboratory simple shear test is first analyzed to validate the proposed model and illustrate the kinematic-hardening mechanism which is usually displayed under non-proportional loading. The analysis further focuses on the anisotropic aspect of localized failure. It has been discovered that the fabric anisotropy can play an important role in the occurrence of shear banding. An increasing degree of fabric anisotropy tends to delay the initiation of the strain localization and result in higher failure strength. The effects of fabric anisotropy have also been illustrated by comparing the theoretical predictions and measured results on the shear band inclination angle, shear strain level and dilatancy at bifurcation.
