The aim of this overview is to show that discrete and continuous features coexist in any natural phenomenon, depending on the scales of observation. Accordingly, different models, either discrete or continuous in time, space, phase space or coqjugate space can be considered. Some caveats about their limits of validity and their interrelationships (discretisation and continuous limits) are pointed out. Difficulties and gaps arising from the singular nature of continuous limits and from the information loss accompanying discretisation are discussed.", "paper_title": "The discrete versus continuous controversy in physics", "paper_id": "WOS:000247037800003"}
