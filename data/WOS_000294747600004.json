To this end, we focus on multidimensional modeling in order to reveal the drivers of time-variant system performance. Online Analytical Processing functionality provides fast and flexible organization, aggregation and visualization of information. We illustrate the advantages of such an approach with data from simulation studies of the Upper Mississippi River waterway system. (C) 2011 Elsevier By.
