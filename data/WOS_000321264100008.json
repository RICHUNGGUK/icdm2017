However, RS codes suffer from having a fixed length. In many applications where the length is static, the appropriate length can be obtained from an RS code by shortening or puncturing. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are a generalization of RS codes, whose subfield-subcodes (SFSC) are extensively studied. In this paper we show that a particular class of GRS codes produces many SFSC with large dimension. We present two algorithms for searching through these codes and a list of new best-known codes obtained.", "paper_title": "The dimension of subcode-subfields of shortened generalized Reed-Solomon codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000321264100008"}
