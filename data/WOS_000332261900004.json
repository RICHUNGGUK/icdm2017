We point out an error in estimating the time complexity of the algorithm proposed in that paper, using a simple example. We also illustrate, with a different example, that an ostensibly time-saving scheme used by that algorithm, called exterior region elimination, cannot be applied in general to derive the correct shortest interior path. Finally, we propose an alternate algorithm that solves the same problem with an improved worst-case running time. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
