However, a rigorous comparison of such proposed algorithms still remains a challenge, since every proposal considers a different benchmark for its experimental evaluation. A lack of clear consensus on an objective and scientific way for comparing results has made researchers uncertain of fundamental as well as relative contributions and limitations of each proposal. In response to the growing necessity for an objective method of comparing traffic classifiers and to shed light on scientifically grounded traffic classification research, we introduce an Internet traffic classification benchmark tool, NeTraMark. Based on six design guidelines (Comparability, Reproducibility, Efficiency, Extensibility, Synergy, and Flexibility/Ease-of-use), NeTraMark is the first Internet traffic classification benchmark where eleven different state-of-the-art traffic classifiers are integrated. NeTraMark allows researchers and practitioners to easily extend it with new classification algorithms and compare them with other built-in classifiers, in terms of three categories of performance metrics: per-whole-trace flow accuracy, per-application flow accuracy, and computational performance.", "paper_title": "NeTraMark: A Network Traffic Classification Benchmark", "paper_id": "WOS:000289780800003"}
