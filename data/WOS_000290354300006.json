To reduce the wavelength requirement, we study routing and wavelength assignment for realizing hypercube communications on WDM ring networks with additional links. We design the embedding schemes and derive the numbers of wavelengths required on WDM chordal ring networks of both degrees 3 and 4. Based on our proposed embedding schemes, we provide the analysis of chord length with optimal number of wavelengths to realize hypercube communications on 3-degree and 4-degree chordal rings. Results show that the wavelength requirement for realizing hypercube communications on optical chordal ring networks is significantly lower than that on optical ring networks. In addition, our research also provides solutions for embedding hypercube graph on chordal rings in graph embedding theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
