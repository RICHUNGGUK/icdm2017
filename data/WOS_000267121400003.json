Based on the experimental findings, an extended discussion is carried out to select a rational compressive model for concrete that represents the dominant failure modes of deformed concrete tunnels. Three main dominant final failure modes are described: structural failure due to the plastic rotation of softening hinges, tensile failure caused by localized cracks, and material failure due to concrete deterioration. A parametric analysis of the material properties of concrete shows that the compressive strength of concrete has a dominant effect on the load-carrying capacity, although the compressive fracture energy of concrete remarkably influences the post-peak deformation behavior of the tunnel. Moreover, the soil pressure, which is regarded as a distributed external load, plays an important role in controlling the final failure modes and the deformation behavior of concrete tunnels. The size effect on the load-carrying capacities of different-sized concrete tunnels is also discussed based on the numerical simulations.", "paper_title": "Failure Mechanism of Deformed Concrete Tunnels Subject to Diagonally Concentrated Loads", "paper_id": "WOS:000267121400003"}
