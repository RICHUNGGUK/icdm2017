The design of flight control systems for airbreathing hypersonic vehicles is a highly challenging task due to the unique characteristics of the vehicle dynamics. Motivated by recent results on a velocity-based linearization approach and LP V control theory, a velocity-based LPV modeling and control framework combined with a novel implementation method of nonlinear gain-scheduling controller has been developed, which provides a nonlinear tracking control structure. Within this framework, an accurate LP V modeling of nonlinear systems and advanced design of self-scheduled controllers are implemented, which relaxes the restriction to near equilibrium operation in traditional gain scheduling approaches. The framework is applied to a nonlinear longitudinal dynamic model of the airbreathing hypersonic vehicle. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A VELOCITY-BASED LPV MODELING AND CONTROL FRAMEWORK FOR AN AIRBREATHING HYPERSONIC VEHICLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100020"}
