However, models currently used assume that a honest entity involved in a key exchange is trusted as a whole. In many practical contexts, the entity is divided in an authentication device storing a private key and having low computing power, and a computing device, that performs part of the computations required by protocol runs. The computing device might be a PC connected to the Internet, and the authenticating device a smart card. In that case as well in many others, a compromise of the computing device is to be expected. We therefore propose a variant of the MQV and HMQV key exchange protocols secure in that context, unlike the original protocols. The security claim is supported by a proof in a model derived from the Canetti-Krawczyk one, which takes into account more general rogue behaviours of the computing device.", "paper_title": "A new key exchange protocol based on MQV assuming public computations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240537600013"}
