The first objective is to assess the associations among information technology (IT) application, knowledge management (KM), team process (TP), and R&D project performance. The second objective is to determine whether TP may mediate the effect of KM on R&D project performance. The third objective is to examine the moderating role of project characteristics in the relationship between TP and R&D project performance. The structural equation modeling (SEM) approach was used to validate the research model. These analyses suggest that TP may fully mediate the effects of KM on R&D project performance in terms of quality and development success and schedule and cost performance. The results also show that industry sector (IS) and team size (TS) have a moderating effect on the relationship between TP and R&D project performance.", "paper_title": "KM as a Facilitator for Project Performance Through Team Process: Does Information Technology Make a Difference?", "paper_id": "WOS:000341843900004"}
