Besides the \"classical\" observation table, we show that abstract observation tables can also be implemented by observation trees. The advantage of the latter is that they often require fewer queries to the teacher.", "paper_title": "MAT learners for tree series: an abstract data type and two realizations", "paper_id": "WOS:000289790500002"}
