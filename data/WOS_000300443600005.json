Motivated by applications, we study the state complexities of two particular combined operations: catenation combined with star and catenation combined with reversal. We show that the state complexities of both of these combined operations are considerably less than the compositions of the state complexities of their individual participating operations.", "paper_title": "STATE COMPLEXITY OF TWO COMBINED OPERATIONS: CATENATION-STAR AND CATENATION-REVERSAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000300443600005"}
