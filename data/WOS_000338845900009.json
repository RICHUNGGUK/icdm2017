This paper focuses on robust design of coordinated set planning of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission, with respect to the feedback delay and link error. The non-ideal channel models involving various uncertainty conditions are given. After defining a penalty factor, the robust net ergodic capacity optimization problem is derived, whose variables to be optimized are the number of coordinated base stations (BSs) and the divided area's radius. By the maximum minimum criterion, upper and lower bounds of the robust capacity are investigated. A practical scheme is proposed to determine the optimal number of cooperative BSs. The simulation results indicate that the robust design based on maxmin principle is better than other precoding schemes. The gap between two bounds gets smaller as transmission power increases. Besides, as the large scale fading is higher or the channel is less reliable, the number of the cooperated BSs shall be greater.", "paper_title": "Robust Design of Coordinated Set Planning with the Non-Ideal Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000338845900009"}
