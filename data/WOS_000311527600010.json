From the results of simulation for blind equalization applications in multipath channels with impulsive and slowly varying direct current (DC) bias noise, it is observed that Gaussian kernel of the proposed algorithm cuts out the large errors due to impulsive noise, and the output affected by the DC bias noise can be effectively controlled by the lag tau intrinsically embedded in the proposed function.", "paper_title": "Lagged Cross-Correlation of Probability Density Functions and Application to Blind Equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000311527600010"}
