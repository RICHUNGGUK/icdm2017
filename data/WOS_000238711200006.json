Both methods capitalize on the random key GA approach to produce chromosomes that are viable for any combination of allele values. In addition, the effect of four problem-specific mutation methods is assessed for one of the encoding methods. The novel mutation methods are shown to have a substantial effect on performance. Optimal GA parameter settings for the problem-specific mutation methods are found empirically.", "paper_title": "Efficient chromosome encoding and problem-specific mutation methods for the flexible bay facility layout problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000238711200006"}
