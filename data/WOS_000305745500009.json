From these results, we determine the largest and second largest limit points of smallest eigenvalues of regular graphs less than -2. Moreover we determine the supremum of the smallest eigenvalue among all connected 3-regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue less than -2 and we give the unique graph with this supremum value as its smallest eigenvalue.", "paper_title": "On the limit points of the smallest eigenvalues of regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000305745500009"}
