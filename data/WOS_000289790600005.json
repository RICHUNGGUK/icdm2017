The proliferation of GeoSNs indicates that they're rapidly attracting users. GeoSNs currently offer different types of services, including photo sharing, friend tracking, and \"check-ins.\" However, this ability to reveal users' locations causes new privacy threats, which in turn call for new privacy-protection methods. The authors study four privacy aspects central to these social networks - location, absence, co-location, and identity privacy - and describe possible means of protecting privacy in these circumstances.", "paper_title": "Location-Related Privacy in Geo-Social Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289790600005"}
