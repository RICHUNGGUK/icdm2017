We use a shift sequence associated with a primitive polynomial of degree 2J over a finite field GF(2), together with a pair of completely orthogonal sequences of length m to construct near perfect sequences of odd lengths. We concatenate two near perfect sequences of same odd lengths under certain conditions to obtain new near perfect sequences of even lengths. These near perfect sequences also exist for unbounded lengths over mth roots of unity.", "paper_title": "New near perfect sequences of even lengths", "paper_id": "WOS:000330803200004"}
