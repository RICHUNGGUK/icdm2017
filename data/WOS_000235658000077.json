Compared to traditional C/S architecture, P2P network is more appropriate for mobile computing environment. However, all existing P2P protocols have not well considered the characteristics and constraints of mobile devices and wireless networks. In this paper, we will present a novel mobile P2P protocol, M-Chord, by adopting hierarchical structure and registering mechanism on the basis of Chord. The experimental results show that M-Chord system has high-efficiency and good robustness in mobile P2P network.", "paper_title": "A chord-based novel mobile peer-to-peer file sharing protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000235658000077"}
