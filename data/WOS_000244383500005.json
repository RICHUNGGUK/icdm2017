The proposed solution uses the Semantic Web standard of RDF to represent the offerings, and a deductive logical language for expressing the requirements and preferences. We motivate and explain the approach and architecture we propose, and report on a system implementing the described functionality in a multi-agent environment. Finally, we experimentally evaluate the core reasoning engine of the system. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
