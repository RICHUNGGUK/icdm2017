The intolerable I/O burden introduced by the massive amounts of RS data and the irregular RS data access patterns has made the traditional cluster based parallel I/O systems no longer applicable. We propose a RS data object-based parallel file system for remote sensing applications and implement it with the OrangeFS file system. It provides application-aware data layout policies, together with RS data object based data I/O interfaces, for efficient support of various data access patterns of RS applications from the server side. With the prior knowledge of the desired RS data access patterns, HPGFS could offer relevant space-filling curves to organize the sliced 3-D data bricks and distribute them over I/O servers. In this way, data layouts consistent with expected data access patterns could be created to explore data locality and achieve performance improvement. Moreover, the multi-band RS data with complex structured geographical metadata could be accessed and managed as a single data object. Through experiments on remote sensing applications with different access patterns, we have achieved performance improvement of about 30 percent for I/O and 20 percent overall.", "paper_title": "A Parallel File System with Application-Aware Data Layout Policies for Massive Remote Sensing Image Processing in Digital Earth", "paper_id": "WOS:000354526000001"}
