The governing equations of the flow problem are transformed into non-dimensional form and the resulting nonlinear, coupled parabolic partial differential equations have been solved numerically using an implicit finite difference scheme of Crank-Nicholson type. The flow variables such as gas velocity, dust-particle velocity and temperature, shearing stress and heat transfer coefficients are calculated numerically for various parameters occurring in the problem. It is observed that due to the presence of dust particles, the gas velocity is found to decrease.
