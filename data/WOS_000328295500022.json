And scalable and seamless mobility support is an important task in mobile identifier/locator separation networks. In this paper, by analyzing the features, such as direct separation, flexible mapping and identifier replacement, we show that the new architecture delivers data packets more efficiently and protects location privacy better than traditional mobile IP networks, and is able to implement soft handover conveniently. Then we present a distributed Hash table (DHT) based fast handover management (DFHM) scheme for the new architecture, which improves the reactive handover mode of FMIPv6 and eliminates the duplicate address detection (DAD) and return routability (RR) processes in MIPv6. And we propose a generic analysis framework for handover management. Further, we demonstrate the validity of our framework by simulation and quantificationally study the effects of network scale and movement velocity. The results show that DFHM has good scalability and low handover latency, and has great advantages in the signaling cost and fast mobility support.", "paper_title": "A DHT-based fast handover management scheme for mobile identifier/locator separation networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000328295500022"}
