The aim is to allow for the distinction between negation, opposition, and possibility in a unique formalism. The difference between negation and opposition is examplified by the difference between \"young/not young\" and \"young/old\". The difference between negation and possibility is examplified by the difference between \"(certainly) not young\" and \"possibly not young\". Furthermore this epistemic extension entails no loss of genericity in LCA.", "paper_title": "Negation, opposition, and possibility in logical concept analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000236906500009"}
