In this paper, we review the decoder SI generation techniques according to the information utilized in the SI generation process. Specifically, motion compensated extrapolation based approaches, motion compensated interpolation based approaches, and hash-based decoder motion estimation approaches in which auxiliary information is sent by the encoder side. We also review the approaches for decoder SI refinement. The review will help us get insight in the current development of the topic and understand how new and better decoder SI generation approaches can be designed.", "paper_title": "Decoder side information generation techniques in Wyner-Ziv video coding: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000351394500004"}
