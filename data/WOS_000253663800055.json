Conventional numerical methods are either too complex or time consuming. An alternative method using neural networks to address the security assessment problem and its effectiveness against conventional methods is discussed. Neural networks using pattern recognition techniques is a promising methodology for different types of security assessment. Feature selection and extraction are used for selecting best features having highest discriminating capabilities. An important feature of the approach is that it can be generalized for steady state, transient and dynamic security assessment, which is a desirable feature for on-line security analysis. The proposed approach has been tested on the WSCC 9-bus 3-generator system. Steady state, transient and dynamic security assessment classification and contingency ranking results are provided to highlight the overall classification accuracy and suitability of the approach.
