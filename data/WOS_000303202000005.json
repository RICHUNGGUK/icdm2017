In order to offer security for multicast applications, a group key has to be changed whenever a member joins or leaves the group. This incurs 1-affects-n problem, which is a constraint on scalability. Decentralized approaches solve the scalability problem by dividing a group into several subgroups that use independent group keys. These approaches, however, introduce new challenges: problem of trusting third party and inefficiency of data delivery. Proxy encryption is a good approach to solve the problem of trusting third party. In this paper, we propose a novel secure multicast scheme using the proxy cryptography. The proposed scheme provides not only scalability but also data transmission efficiency by dynamic subgrouping of group members while intermediate data-relaying third parties are not required to be trusted.", "paper_title": "Scalable and efficient approach for secure group communication using proxy cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000303202000005"}
