Furthermore, different persons may wear similar clothes, making appearance feature less discriminative. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of multiple instance to handle corrupted images. Then a novel pairwise comparison based multiple instance learning framework is proposed to deal with visual ambiguity, by selecting robust features through pairwise comparison. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two public datasets.", "paper_title": "Multiple-Shot Person Re-Identification by Pairwise Multiple Instance Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300049"}
