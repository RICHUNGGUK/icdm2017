A longer hash code yields a better precision rate of retrieved images. However, it also requires a larger storage, which limits the number of stored images. Current hashing methods employ the same code length for both queries and stored images. We propose a new hashing scheme using two hash codes with different lengths for queries and stored images, i.e., the asymmetric cyclical hashing. A compact hash code is used to reduce the storage requirement, while a long hash code is used for the query image. The image retrieval is performed by computing the Hamming distance of the long hash code of the query and the cyclically concatenated compact hash code of the stored image to yield a high precision and recall rate. Experiments on benchmarking databases consisting up to one million images show the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Asymmetric Cyclical Hashing for Large Scale Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000009"}
