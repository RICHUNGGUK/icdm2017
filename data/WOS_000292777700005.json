However, the conclusions are contradictory. Edges and luminance contrasts seem to be always involved, but literature is conflicting about contribution of the different spatial scales. It appears that experiments using man-made scenes lead to the conclusion that fixation location can be efficiently discriminated using high-frequency information, whereas mid-or low frequencies are more discriminative for natural scenes. This paper focuses on the importance of spatial scale to predict visual attention. We propose a fast attentional model and study which frequency band predicts the best fixation locations during free-viewing task. An eye-tracking experiment has been conducted using different scene categories defined by their Fourier spectrums (Coast, Open-Country, Mountain, and Street). We found that medium frequencies (0.7-1.3 cycles per degree) globally allowed the best prediction of attention, with variability among categories. Fixation locations were found to be more predictable using medium to high frequencies in man-made street scenes and low to medium frequencies in natural landscape scenes.", "paper_title": "Medium Spatial Frequencies, a Strong Predictor of Salience", "paper_id": "WOS:000292777700005"}
