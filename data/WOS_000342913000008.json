Results: We have updated maSigPro to support RNA-seq time series analysis by introducing generalized linear models in the algorithm to support the modeling of count data while maintaining the traditional functionalities of the package. We show a good performance of the maSigPro-GLM method in several simulated time-course scenarios and in a real experimental dataset.", "paper_title": "Next maSigPro: updating maSigPro bioconductor package for RNA-seq time series", "paper_id": "WOS:000342913000008"}
