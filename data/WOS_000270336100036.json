Based on inequality analysis method and combining the exponential dichotomy with fixed point theorem, some novel sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure the existence and globally exponential stability of almost periodic solution to this system. Moreover, an example is given to demonstrate the feasibility of our results. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
