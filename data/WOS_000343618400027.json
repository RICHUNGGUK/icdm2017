The approach only needs information provided by first order reliability method (FORM) results: the vector of reliability indices, beta, of the LSFs composing the system; and their correlation matrix, R. Two common geotechnical problems the stability of a slope in layered soil and a circular tunnel in rock are employed to demonstrate the simplicity, accuracy and efficiency of the suggested procedure, and advantages of the linearization approach with respect to alternative computational tools are discussed. It is also found that, if necessary, the second order reliability method (SORM)-that approximates the true LSF better than FORM-can be employed to compute better estimations of the system's reliability.
