An efficient dynamic and fixed column-shifting scheme is presented for multi-mode architectures. A novel low-complexity local switch is proposed to implement the dynamic and fixed column-shifting scheme. Furthermore, an efficient quantization method and the usage of a one's-complement scheme instead of a two's-complement scheme are explored. The proposed decoder achieves very high throughput with minimal area overhead. Post layout results using TSMC 65-nm CMOS technology shows much better throughput, as well as better area- and energy-efficiency, compared to other multi-mode LDPC decoders. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
