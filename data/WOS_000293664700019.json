It is composed of three parts: (a) a dense motion field and motion statistics method, (b) motion directional PCA for feature dimensionality reduction, (c) an improved one-class SVM for one-class classification. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in detecting abnormal events in surveillance video, while keeping a low false alarm rate. Our scheme works well in complicated situations that common tracking or detection modules cannot handle.", "paper_title": "Drastic Anomaly Detection in Video Using Motion Direction Statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664700019"}
