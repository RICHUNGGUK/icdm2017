The latest versions of GROMACS, NAMD, mpiBLAST and ClustalW-MPI can be run in parallel by simply booting the birgHPC CD or flash drive from the head node, which immediately positions the rest of the PCs on the network as computing nodes. Thus, a temporary, affordable, scalable and high-performance computing environment can be built by non-computing-based researchers using low-cost commodity hardware.", "paper_title": "birgHPC: creating instant computing clusters for bioinformatics and molecular dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000290331600022"}
