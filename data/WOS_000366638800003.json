Task scheduling in the Expert Cloud is a vital part that assigns tasks to suitable resources for execution. The purpose of this paper is to propose a method based on genetic algorithm to consider the priority of arriving tasks and the heterogeneity of HRs. Also, to simulate a real world situation, the authors consider the human-based features of resources like trust, reputation and etc. Design/methodology/approach - As it is NP-Complete to schedule tasks to obtain the minimum makespan and the success of genetic algorithm in optimization and NP-Complete problems, the authors used a genetic algorithm to schedule the tasks on HRs in the Expert Cloud. In this method, chromosome or candidate solutions are represented by a vector; fitness function is calculated based on several factors; one point cross-over and swap mutation are also used. Findings - The obtained results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed algorithm in terms of time complexity, task fail rate and HRs utilization. Originality/value - In this paper the task scheduling issue in the Expert Cloud and improving pervious algorithm are pointed out and the approach to resolve the problem is applied into a practical example.", "paper_title": "Priority-based task scheduling on heterogeneous resources in the Expert Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000366638800003"}
