This study puts forward a new methodology to identify, visualise and interpret repetitive motion patterns in groups of Moving Point Objects (MPOs). The methodology consists of three steps. First, motion patterns are qualitatively described using the Qualitative Trajectory Calculus (QTC). Second, a similarity analysis is conducted to compare motion patterns and identify repetitive patterns. Third, repetitive motion patterns are represented and interpreted in a continuous triangular model. As an illustration of the usefulness of combining these hitherto separated methods, a specific movement case is examined: Samba dance, a rhythmical dance will? many repetitive movements. The results show that the presented methodology is able to successfully identify, visualize and interpret the contained repetitive motions.", "paper_title": "A Qualitative Approach to the Identification, Visualisation and Interpretation of Repetitive Motion Patterns in Groups of Moving Point Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000360783800001"}
