By exploiting the analytical tool offered by nonlinear optimization and following the emerging \"Decomposition as Optimization\" paradigm Ill, the approach pursued in this paper allows to develop a resource allocation algorithm that is distributed, asynchronous, scalable and self-adaptive. Interestingly, the proposed algorithm enables each node of the network to distribute its outgoing traffic among all feasible next-hops in an optimal way, as measured by an assigned global cost function of general form. This optimal traffic distribution complies with several subjective as well as objective QoS requirements advanced by the supported media flows and involves only minimum information exchange between neighboring nodes. Furthermore, it allows for load-balanced multiple forwarding paths and it is able to self-perform optimal traffic re-distribution (i.e., re-routing) in the case of failure of the underlying wireless links. Finally, actual effectiveness of the overall proposed algorithm is numerically tested via performance comparisons against both DSDV-based single-path routing algorithms and interference-aware multipath routing algorithms.
