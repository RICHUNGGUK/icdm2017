We propose a task execution framework, named sTaskAlloc, to execute application energy efficiently by two main parts. First, considering that the energy consumption of an application is inversely proportional to the utilization rate of sensors, we present a hot sensor selection algorithm, HotTasking, to minimize the energy consumption of new added applications by selecting the most suitable sensor. Second, when a sensor is shared by multiple applications, proposed MergeOPT (a concurrent tasks optimization algorithm) is used to optimize energy consumption further by eliminating redundant sampling tasks. Experimental results show that sTaskAlloc can save more than 76% of energy for new added applications compared with existing methods and reduce up to 72% of sampling tasks when a sensor is shared by more than 10 applications.", "paper_title": "A Task Execution Framework for Cloud-Assisted Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333071200005"}
