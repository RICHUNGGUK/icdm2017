By utilising the input delay approach and the descriptor model transformation, an equivalent continuous-time generalised T-S fuzzy system with a state delay is obtained. Some sufficient conditions for the existence of a state feedback controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which guarantee the asymptotic stability of the whole closed-loop system. Moreover, some results are also expanded to T-S fuzzy systems with norm-bounded parameter uncertainties. In order to relax the conservatism of the obtained conditions, a feasible algorithm is provided to remove a slightly restricted condition in LMIs. An illustrative example is given to show the validity of this control strategy.", "paper_title": "Robust variable sampling control for T-S fuzzy systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000281652800007"}
