Spacing between wires can be modified so that line-to-line capacitances will be optimized for minimal power under timing constraints. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for simultaneous multilayer interconnect spacing that minimizes the total dynamic power dissipation caused by an interconnect, while maximum delay constraints are satisfied. A multidimensional visibility graph is used to represent the problem, and a layout partitioning technique is applied to solve the problem efficiently. The algorithm was evaluated on an industrial microprocessor designed using the 32 nm technology, and it achieved a 5-12% reduction in interconnect switching power. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
