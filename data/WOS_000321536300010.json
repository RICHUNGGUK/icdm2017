We reduce the number of needed images to establish the complete 3D objects by combining Wide Baseline Matching and 3D registration algorithm. We reduce the loss of edge and corner information by applying line detection and guided matching in Narrow Baseline Matching. We perform projective reconstruction with a dynamic threshold, and eliminate the ambiguity in Euclidean reconstruction by motion consistency constraint. We propose a fast linear method for motion calculation to recover the motion of key frames with a succinct method to obtain motion vector by solving linear equation set. We adopt a novel display system, which features high refresh rate, large size and high intensity screen, to provide live display of 3D objects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
