Previous DTN research mainly concentrates on information propagation and packet delivery. However, with possible participation of a large number of mobile devices, how to maintain efficient and dynamic topology becomes crucial. In this paper, we study the topology design problem in a predictable DTN where the time-evolving topology is known a priori or can be predicted. We model such a time-evolving network as a weighted directed space-time graph which includes both spacial and temporal information. Links inside the space-time graph are unreliable due to either the dynamic nature of wireless communications or the rough prediction of underlying human/device mobility. The purpose of our reliable topology design problem is to build a sparse structure from the original space-time graph such that (1) for any pair of devices, there is a space-time path connecting them with a reliability higher than the required threshold; (2) the total cost of the structure is minimized. Such an optimization problem is NP-hard, thus we propose several heuristics which can significantly reduce the total cost of the topology while maintain the \"reliable\" connectivity over time. In this paper, we consider both unicast and broadcast reliability of a topology. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on random DTNs, a synthetic space DTN, and a real-world DTN tracing data. Results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Reliable Topology Design in Time-Evolving Delay-Tolerant Networks with Unreliable Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000354455400015"}
