Specifically, we consider truthful in expectation randomized mechanisms under the assumption that a machine (player) is bound by its reports: when a machine lies and reports value (t) over tilde (ij) for a task instead of the actual one t(ij), it will execute for time (t) over tilde (ij) if it gets the task (unless the declared value (t) over tilde (ij) is less than the actual value t(ij), in which case, it will execute for time t(ij)). Our main technical result is an optimal mechanism for one task and n players which has approximation ratio (n + 1)/2. We also provide a matching lower bound, showing that no other truthful mechanism can achieve a better approximation ratio. This immediately gives an approximation ratio of (n + 1)/2 and n(n + 1)/2 for social cost and makespan minimization, respectively, for any number of tasks. We also study the price of anarchy of natural algorithms.", "paper_title": "Scheduling Without Payments", "paper_id": "WOS:000332831400002"}
