By examination of a modeling problem, we describe how to transform a nonlinear system into a bilinear one via Taylor's series expansion and then we adopt the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling technique to construct a fuzzy bilinear model. For controller design, the parallel distributed compensation (PDC) method is utilized to stabilize the fuzzy bilinear system (FBS), and some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the stability of the overall fuzzy control system via linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, we propound some sufficient conditions for robust stabilization of the FBS with parametric uncertainties. Finally, a numerical example and the Van de Vusse model are utilized to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed FBS.", "paper_title": "T-S fuzzy bilinear model and fuzzy controller design for a class of nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247285300015"}
