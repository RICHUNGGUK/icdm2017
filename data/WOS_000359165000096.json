Sufficient condition for cluster consensus is presented in terms of easily checkable algebraic topology criterion. It is found that intra-cluster balanced topologies with antisymmetric (i.e., bidirectional and opposite signed) inter-cluster links promote cluster consensus, irrelevant of the magnitudes of intra-cluster coupling weights. The effectiveness of the theoretical results is illustrated by a numerical example. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
