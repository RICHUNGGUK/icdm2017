The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are discretized using a discontinuous Galerkin arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (DG-ALE) method on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh, and coupled to a non-linear hyperelastic neo-Hookean model of a tuning fork, discretized using continuous Galerkin finite elements on an unstructured tetrahedral mesh. The fluid and structure are both integrated implicitly in time using a partitioned approach based on an implicit-explicit Runge-Kutta method. We measure radial sound distributions which show good agreement with theoretical predictions and physical experiments in the open literature. In addition we demonstrate how to measure Q factors for several common modes, emphasizing that we can accurately capture the decay rates arising purely from the interaction of the tuning fork with the air and without any damping built into the structure model.
