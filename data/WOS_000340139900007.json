This article aims at applying the empirical likelihood to construct the confidence intervals for the parameters of interest in linear regression models with nonignorable missing response data and the nonignorable missing mechanism is specified as an exponential tilting model. Three empirical likelihood ratio functions based on weighted empirical likelihood and imputed empirical likelihood are defined. It is proved that, except one that is chi-squared distributed, all the others are asymptotically weighted chi-squared distributed whenever the tilting parameter is either given or estimated. The asymptotic normality for the related parameter estimates is also investigated. Simulation studies are conducted to evaluate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimates in terms of coverage probabilities and average widths for the confidence intervals of parameters. A real data analysis is analyzed for illustration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
