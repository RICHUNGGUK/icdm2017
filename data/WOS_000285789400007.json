These problems are further exacerbated by the dynamics in wireless mobile networks. In this paper, we address the issue of trust advisory and its establishment in mobile networks, with application to ad hoc networks, including delay tolerant (DTNs). We utilize encounters in mobile societies in novel ways, noticing that mobility provides opportunities to build proximity, location, and similarity based trust. Four new trust advisor filters are introduced-including encounter frequency, duration, behavior vectors, and behavior matrices. The filters are evaluated over an extensive set of real-world traces collected from a major university. Two sets of statistical analyses are performed; the first examines the underlying encounter relationships in mobile societies, and the second evaluates DTN routing in mobile peer-to-peer networks using trust and selfishness models. We find that for the analyzed trace, trust filters are stable in terms of growth with time (three filters have close to 90% overlap of users over a period of 9 weeks) and the results produced by different filters are noticeably different. In our analysis for trust and selfishness model, our trust filters largely undo the effect of selfishness on the unreachability in a network. Thus improving the connectivity in a network with selfish nodes. We hope that our initial promising results open the door for further research on proximity-based trust.
