We propose a polylogarithmic approximation algorithm in directed graphs, while in undirected graphs we give a (6 + epsilon + o(1)) and a (4 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm for arbitrary instances and instances of unit profit, respectively. Also, an inapproximability result for the AOP is obtained as well as approximation algorithms for the Mixed Orienteering Problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
