This problem will cause the chaotic trajectory eventually periodic. In order to solve the problem, a new binary stream-cipher algorithm based on one-dimensional piecewise linear chaotic map is proposed in this paper. In the process of encryption and decryption, we employ a secret variant to perturb the chaotic trajectory and the control parameter to lengthen the cycle-length of chaotic trajectory. In addition, we design a nonlinear principle to generate a pseudo-random chaotic bit sequence as key stream. Cryptanalysis shows that the cryptosystem is of high security.", "paper_title": "Design of chaotic pseudo-random bit generator and its applications in stream-cipher cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000257761400011"}
