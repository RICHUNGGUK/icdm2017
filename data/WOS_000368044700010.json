First-order statistics of the images histogram, second-order statistics extracted from the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), PC1 and PC2 scores from image PCA, and wavelet-based texture signatures have been extracted. A vector of 25 feature-descriptors variables was generated for characterizing each sample. Partial least squares (PLS) regression has been used to predict a value for deposit roughness (R.) from the extracted image features and the value was compared with the one obtained from a stylus profilometer. The best result was obtained when a number' of 13 variables were kept and the rest discarded. A RMSE of 0.0656 was obtained for external samples and no significant differences were proven to exist for 95% confidence level between the two methods under comparison. Partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) has been shown to be an adequate algorithm to correctly classify the chromium samples between those with low and high crystallographic T(110) texture coefficient. In this case, 6 variables of the 25 originally measured are enough to get proper results. The values found for both specificity and sensitivity were 1.00 and the percentage of correctly classified (%CC) samples was 100% in the calibration, the cross-validation, and the prediction sets. The proposed method can avoid the use of the X-ray diffractometry whenever a high precision of the texture coefficient value is not necessary. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
