First, the perceptual metric is defined as the quantitative indicator of the visual perceptibility of facade details at a given viewing distance. Then, according to the human vision system, an algorithm employing 2D discrete wavelet transform and contrast sensitivity function is developed to extract the value of perceptual metric from the rendered image of the facade. Finally, a perceptual metric function is defined, based on the perceptual metric values extracted at equal interval viewing distances. The minimum detail redundancy model is then proposed for the optimal design of discrete LODs. This method provides a quantitative instruction for generating discrete LODs. The experimental results prove the effectiveness and great potential of this method. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
