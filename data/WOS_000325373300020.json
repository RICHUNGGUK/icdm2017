Firstly, the characteristic of the scattering data at each time-delay curve in the traditional back projection imaging procedure is analyzed. Secondly, a weight factor is designed for each focal point and an improved back projection imaging algorithm is presented. Thirdly, the simulation of the improved imaging algorithm is processed. The imaging results of both the simulation data and the real ground penetrating radar data show the e ff ectiveness of this imaging algorithm.", "paper_title": "An improved back projection imaging algorithm for subsurface target detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000325373300020"}
