Cross-validation or the leave-one-out method is often used for the tuning, however their computational costs are much higher than that of obtaining a classifier. Quadratically constrained maximum a posteriori (QCMAP) classifiers, which are based on the Bayes classification rule, do not have the regularization parameter, and exhibit higher classification accuracy than support vector machine (SVM). In this paper, we propose a multiple kernel learning (MKL) for QCMAP to tune the kernel parameter automatically and improve the classification performance. By introducing MKL, QCMAP has no parameter to be tuned. Experiments show that the proposed classifier has comparable or higher classification performance than conventional MKL classifiers.", "paper_title": "Multiple Kernel Learning for Quadratically Constrained MAP Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200034"}
