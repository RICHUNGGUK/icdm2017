The digitized constructed knowledge environment has changed the way that knowledge has been presented through the books. By using information technology, learners now obtain knowledge rapidly in a computer-learning environment. When a learner facing a project, the way he/she searches information to build up his/her knowledge becomes a subject which is well worthy a discussion. This research first recorded each student viewing the mission-related instructional materials on computer pages in limited time. Followed by analyzing the route of subject's cognitive processes to study the relation of students who with different creativity performances to their knowledge searching depth. The participants are vocational high school students from the innovated project design class and their projects in this experiment are creative poster design. Researchers recorded and analyzed participants' viewing routes among supplied poster-design instructional materials. Researchers expect to find out the relation by discussing the knowledge searching process between different creativity performers. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
