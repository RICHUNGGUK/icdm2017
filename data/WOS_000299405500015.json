Our method starts with the automatic localization of the OPG and its core with an anatomical atlas followed by a binary voxel classification with a probabilistic tissue model whose parameters are estimated from the MR images. The method effectively incorporates prior location, tissue characteristics, and intensity information for the delineation of the OPG boundaries in a consistent and repeatable manner. Internal classification of the segmented OPG volume is then obtained with a robust method that overcomes grey-level differences between learning and testing datasets. Experimental results on 25 datasets yield a mean surface distance error of 0.73 mm as compared to manual segmentation by experienced radiologists. Our method exhibits reliable performance in OPG growth follow-up MR studies, which are crucial for monitoring disease progression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method that addresses automatic segmentation, internal classification, and follow-up of OPG. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
