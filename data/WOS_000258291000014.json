We show that one-dimensional piecewise affine maps are equivalent to pseudo-billiard or so called \"strange billiard\" systems. We also show that use of more general classes of functions lead to undecidability of reachability problem for one-dimensional piecewise maps.", "paper_title": "Reachability problems in low-dimensional iterative maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000014"}
