The proposed method has the following advantages: (1) the evaluating values can either be represented by linguistic terms or intervals of linguistic terms, (2) if the required consensus degree is too high, then the proposed adaptive consensus support model can modify experts' preferences to improve convergence toward a higher consensus degree or a sufficient agreement for group decision making and (3) the proposed method is an interactive method, where each expert can modify the adjustments made by the system during the consensus reaching process if he/she does not agree with the adjustments made by the system. The proposed adaptive consensus support model can overcome the drawback of Mata et al.'s method (2009). It provides us with a useful way for adaptive consensus support for group decision making based on intervals of linguistic 2-tuples. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
