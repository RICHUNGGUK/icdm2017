After the original heart sound signal was pre-processed, it was analyzed by the optimum multi-scale wavelet packet decomposition (OMS-WPD), and then the wavelet-time entropy was applied to extract features from the decomposition components. The extracted features were then applied to a support vector machine (SVM) for identification of the normal and five types of abnormal heart sounds. To show the robustness of the proposed method, its performance was compared with four other popular heart sound processing methods. Extensive experimental results showed that the feature extraction method proposed in this paper has convincing identification results, which could be used as a basis for further analysis of heart sound.
