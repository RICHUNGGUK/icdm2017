Based on the graph-theoretic concepts and locally distributed information, an adaptive neural fuzzy formation controller is designed with the capability of on-line learning. The learning rules of controller parameters can be derived from the analyzing of Lyapunov stability. In addition to simulations, the proposed techniques are applied to an experimental multi-robot platform for performance validations. From simulation and experimental results, the proposed adaptive neural fuzzy protocol can provide better formation responses compared to conventional consensus algorithms.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Formation Control for Leader-Follower Mobile Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000326065100009"}
