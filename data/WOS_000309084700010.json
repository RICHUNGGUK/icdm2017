By establishing a new differential inequality and employing the properties of spectral radius of nonnegative matrix and diffusion operator, the global attracting and positive invariant sets and exponential stability of non-autonomous reaction-diffusion neural networks with time-varying delays are obtained. Our results do not require the conditions of boundedness of the coefficient of neural networks. One example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of our conclusion. (C) 2012 IMACS.
