The method is applied to the derivation of stamp equations of carbon nanotube and graphene nano-ribbon field-effect transistors (FETs) for use in general-purpose circuit simulators. We first review existing methods of modeling FETs for circuit simulation and point out some of the weaknesses in these models. We then explain how to derive model equation stamps directly from the device physical characteristic equations without the need of eliminating internal device variables and without having to construct equivalent circuits consisting of interconnections of two-terminal resistors, controlled sources, and two-terminal capacitors.", "paper_title": "On Device Modeling for Circuit Simulation With Application to Carbon-Nanotube and Graphene Nano-Ribbon Field-Effect Transistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000351764500015"}
