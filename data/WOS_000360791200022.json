In this paper, an estimation framework based on the Bayesian structural equation modeling, which is driven by pharmacogenomics, is proposed. The results show that the model compares favorably with the linear models in terms of prediction and explaining the variations in warfarin dosing.", "paper_title": "A Bayesian Estimation Framework for Pharmacogenomics Driven Warfarin Dosing: A Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000360791200022"}
