The flow field around the arc fiber has recently been calculated based on the Zhukovsky conversion. It is shown that the interception efficiency is a function of three parameters: the arc shape parameter, the flow-approaching angle, and the particle size. The results show that slim and long arc fibers have higher interception efficiency. The interception efficiency increases as the particle diameter increases. The orientation angle also affects the interception efficiency. Overall, the results demonstrate the importance of flow asymmetry and singular points on the interception efficiency. Together with our previous results on elliptic fibers published in Wang et al. [Wang WX, Xie ML, Wang LP. An exact solution of interception efficiency over an elliptical fiber collector. Aerosol Sci Technol 2012;46:843-511, a range of fiber cross-sectional shapes on the interception efficiency can now be analytically modeled. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
