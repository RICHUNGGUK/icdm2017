The actor is member of a community which share a computer environment to assist their work. Firstly, an operational issue exists to capture, to represent and to manipulate the experience: we propose an formal grammar-based model. A semantic issue then exists to express the meaning of the experience: we detail our approach based on the mechanisms of the emergence of language. A prototype is presented to illustrate our proposal, some experiments are to come.", "paper_title": "Language games for meaning negotiation between human and computer agents.", "paper_id": "WOS:000238506800017"}
