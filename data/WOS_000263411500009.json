In this paper we describe a QoS reservation mechanism for Multirate AWNs that allows bandwidth allocation on a per flow basis. By multirate we refer to those networks where wireless nodes are able to dynamically switch among several link rates. This allows nodes to select the highest possible transmission rate for exchanging data, independently for each neighbor. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
