The aim of instance selection is to reduce the data size by filtering out noisy data, which may degrade the mining performance, from a given dataset. Genetic algorithms have presented an effective instance selection approach to improve the performance of data mining algorithms. However, current approaches only pursue the simplest evolutionary process based on the most reasonable and simplest rules. In this paper, we introduce a novel instance selection algorithm, namely a genetic-based biological algorithm (GBA). GBA fits a \"biological evolution\" into the evolutionary process, where the most streamlined process also complies with the reasonable rules. In other words, after long-term evolution, organisms find the most efficient way to allocate resources and evolve. Consequently, we can closely simulate the natural evolution of an algorithm, such that the algorithm will be both efficient and effective. Our experiments are based on comparing GBA with five state-of-the-art algorithms over 50 different domain datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The experimental results demonstrate that GBA outperforms these baselines, providing the lowest classification error rate and the least storage requirement. Moreover, GBA is very computational efficient, which only requires slightly larger computational cost than GA.", "paper_title": "Instance selection by genetic-based biological algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000351472300011"}
