The proposed scheme uses the theories and properties of sampling distribution of means to achieve the requirements of robustness and security. Besides, the sampling method also provides that the ownership statements can be of any size regardless of the size of the original image. Since our method does not really insert the ownership statements into the host image, the original image will not be altered and the rightful ownership can be identified without resorting to the original image. Moreover, our method also allows plural ownership statements to be registered for a single host image without causing any damage to other hidden ownership statements. Finally, experimental results will show the robustness of our scheme for gray-level and color ownership statements against several common attacks. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
