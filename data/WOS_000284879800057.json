This gives researchers an increasing interest for solutions allowing to use efficiently several communication mediums. We propose a demonstration of our Multipath TCP implementation for Linux, that allows spreading a single TCP flow across multiple Internet paths, without requiring any change to applications. The demonstration will involve a real Internet communication with MPTCP, with simultaneous use of several paths, as well as a demonstration of MPTCP failover capability.", "paper_title": "Experimenting with Multipath TCP", "paper_id": "WOS:000284879800057"}
