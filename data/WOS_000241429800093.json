The SS-MDC scheme exploits spatial scaling of one view. In case of one channel failure, SS-MDC can reconstruct the stereoscopic video with one view low-pass filtered. SS-MDC can achieve low redundancy (less than 10%) for video sequences with lower inter-view correlation. MS-MDC method is based on multi-state coding and is beneficial for video sequences with higher inter-view correlation. The encoder can switch between these two methods depending on the characteristics of video.", "paper_title": "Schemes for multiple description coding of stereoscopic video", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800093"}
