Additionally, the tool enables the conversion of the positions of signal data from one genome assembly to another, also known as 'lifting'. We believe bwtool can be useful for the analyst frequently working with bigWig data, which is becoming a standard format to represent functional signals along genomes. The article includes supplementary examples of running the software.", "paper_title": "bwtool: a tool for bigWig files", "paper_id": "WOS:000337040200017"}
