We analyze the finite-elements discretization and demonstrate why the original flow can result in numerical instability due to division by zero. We propose a variation on the flow that removes the numerical instability in the discretization and show that this modification results in a simpler expression for both the discretized and continuous formulations. We discuss the properties of the modified flow and present empirical evidence that not only does it define a stable surface evolution for genus-zero surfaces, but that the evolution converges to a conformal parameterization of the surface onto the sphere.", "paper_title": "Can Mean-Curvature Flow be Modified to be Non-singular?", "paper_id": "WOS:000307307500018"}
