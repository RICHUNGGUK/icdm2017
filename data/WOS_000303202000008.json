Since the wireless channel varies with location and time, the results vary for the same field experiment at a different place and time. Assumptions about the wireless environment can lead to biased results. It is necessary to shield wireless transmission from uncontrolled interference in order to make the experiment repeatable. This paper describes Advanced wireleSS Environment Research Testbed (ASSERT) which uses shielded co-axial cables as the communication media for radio signals to conduct reliable, scalable and accurate wireless experiments. Shielding the transmission also protects the signal from random burst of noise introduced by the environment. The paper describes how the combination of programmable attenuators and RF splitters/combiners, which are part of ASSERT, helps in emulating complex and varying environments including those in which multipath interference plays a significant role. Our experimental results indicate that (1) tweaking the MAC layer and retransmissions at the application layer neutralize, to an extent, the impact of multipath effects when the received signal strength is extremely good, and (2) when the received signal strength falls below a certain threshold multipath interference plays a significant role.", "paper_title": "Emulation of multipath effects on a wireless testbed and its impact on MAC layer performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000303202000008"}
