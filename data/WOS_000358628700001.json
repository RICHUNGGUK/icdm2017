Almost all collections were mostly stories, and the total selection was 80% stories. Educational curricula often determined the informational titles offered, while informational books for recreational reading were more difficult to find. Stories were likely further promoted through venue connections. School and public libraries have opportunities to promote informational books and to provide wide and accessible collections for the neighbourhood's beginning readers.", "paper_title": "Finding Informational Books for Beginning Readers: An Ecological Study of a Median-Household-Income Neighbourhood", "paper_id": "WOS:000358628700001"}
