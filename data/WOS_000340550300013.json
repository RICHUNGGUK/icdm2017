Intensity inhomogeneity is an undesired phenomenon that represents the main obstacle for magnetic resonance (MR) and natural images segmentation. The complex images usually contain an arbitrary number of objects. This paper presents a new multiphase active contour model method for simultaneous regions classification of MR images and natural images without bias field correction. In this model, a simple and effective initialization method is taken to speed up the curve evolution toward final results; a new multiphase level set method is proposed to segment the multiple regions. This model not only extracts multiple objects simultaneously, but also provides smooth and accurate boundaries of the objects. The results for experiments on several synthetic and real images demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our model.", "paper_title": "A novel multiphase active contour model for inhomogeneous image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000340550300013"}
