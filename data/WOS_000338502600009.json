An analysis of the business model may establish whether the architecture change has value for the business. Therefore, in order to facilitate such analyses, we propose an approach to relate enterprise models specified in ArchiMate to business models, modeled using Osterwalder's Business Model Canvas. Our approach is accompanied by a method that supports business model-driven migration from a baseline architecture to a target architecture and is demonstrated by means of a case study.", "paper_title": "From enterprise architecture to business models and back", "paper_id": "WOS:000338502600009"}
