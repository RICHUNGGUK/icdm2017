For many purposes, there is an ever increasing demand for having these databases published on the Web, so that users can query the data available in them. An important requirement for this to happen is that query interfaces must be as simple and intuitive as possible. In this paper we present LABRADOR, a system for efficiently publishing relational databases on the Web by using a simple text box query interface. The system operates by taking an unstructured keyword-based query posed by a user and automatically deriving an equivalent SQL query that fits the user's information needs, as expressed by the original query. The SQL query is then sent to a DBMS and its results are processed by LABRADOR to create a relevance-based ranking of the answers. Experiments we present show that LABRADOR can automatically find the most suitable SQL query in more than 75% of the cases, and that the overhead introduced by the system in the overall query processing time is almost insignificant. Furthermore, the system operates in a non-intrusive way, since it requires no modifications to the target database schema. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
