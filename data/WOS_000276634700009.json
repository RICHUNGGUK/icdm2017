Metrika 44 (1996), pp. 191-197] proposed the interval estimation of the parameter theta and the joint confidence region of the two parameters of Pareto distribution. This paper proposed two methods to construct the confidence region of the two parameters of the Pareto distribution for the progressive Type II censored sample. A simulation study comparing the performance of the two methods is done and concludes that Method 1 is superior to Method 2 by obtaining a smaller confidence area. The interval estimation of parameter nu is also given under progressive Type II censoring. In addition, the predictive intervals of the future observation and the ratio of the two future consecutive failure times based on the progressive Type II censored sample are also proposed. Finally, one example is given to illustrate all interval estimations in this paper.", "paper_title": "Interval estimation for the Pareto distribution based on the progressive Type II censored sample", "paper_id": "WOS:000276634700009"}
