A smart communication standard is essential to solve some problems in wireless data transmission and optimize system performance. This paper proposes an intelligent management of multiple access schemes for contention access and contention free access with game theory. The strategies are determined by requirements of applications and channel status. Nodes in a network choose various strategies for best payoff according to different conditions including normal status, packets-oriented services, emergent situation and bad link states with specific utility functions. The novel management model supports flexible resource allocation and enhances the system performance, which are evaluated by simulations of Castalia under various conditions.", "paper_title": "Intelligent Management of Multiple Access Schemes in Wireless Body Area Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000358594900005"}
