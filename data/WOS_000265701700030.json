Improvement of memory accesses, especially improvement of spatial and temporal locality is well known technique to reduce energy and increase performance. However, after transformations that improve locality, address calculation often becomes a bottleneck. In this paper, we propose novel AGU (Address Generation Unit) exploration and mapping technique based on a reconfigurable AGU model. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques help exploring AGU architectures effectively and designers can get trade-offs of real life applications for about 10 hours.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable AGU: An Address Generation Unit Based on Address Calculation Pattern for Low Energy and High Performance Embedded Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000265701700030"}
