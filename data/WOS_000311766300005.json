Data and methods: The solution proposed is based on comparing the predictive capability of artificial neural networks (ANNs) with the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). The latter integrates artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic and can handle certain complex problems that include fuzziness in human perception, and non-normal and non-linear data. Secondary data from two surveys were combined to develop the model. Hospital HIT adoption capability and use indicators in the Canadian province of Ontario were used as inputs, while patient satisfaction indicators of healthcare services in acute hospitals were used as outputs. Results: Eight different types of models were trained and tested for each of four patient satisfaction dimensions. The accuracy of each predictive model was evaluated through statistical performance measures, including root mean square error (RMSE), and adjusted coefficient of determination R-Adjusred(2). For all four patient satisfaction indicators, the performance of ANFIS was found to be more effective (R-Adjusted(2) = 0.99) when compared with the results of ANN modeling in predicting the impact of HIT adoption on patient satisfaction (R-Adjusted(2) = 0.86-0.88). Conclusions: The impact of HIT adoption on patient satisfaction was obtained for different HIT adoption scenarios using ANFIS simulations. The results through simulation scenarios revealed that full implementation of HIT in hospitals can lead to significant improvement in patient satisfaction. We conclude that the proposed ANFIS modeling technique can be used as a decision support mechanism to assist government and policy makers in predicting patient satisfaction resulting from the implementation of HIT in hospitals (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
