Existing data-driven motion generation methods simply record and replay the motion of the vehicle. Character animation technology enables a user to control motions that are generated by a motion capture database and an appropriate motion control algorithm. We propose a data-driven motion generation method and implement a driving simulator by adapting the method of motion capture. The motion data sampled from a real vehicle are transformed into appropriate data structures called motion blocks, and then a series of motion blocks are saved into the motion database. During simulation, the driving simulator searches for and synthesizes optimal motion blocks from the motion database and generates motion streams that reflect the current simulation conditions and parameterized user demands. We demonstrate the proposed method through experiments with the driving simulator. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
