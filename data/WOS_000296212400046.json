The complex switched network (CSN) contains switching behaviors on both its nodes and topology configuration. Different from those CSNs studied in the existing literatures, the two switching signals dominating the nodes and topology are desynchronized. The two types of delays are the time-varying system delay in nodes and the time-varying coupling delay between nodes and they have different values. The inherent synchronization properties of the CSN have been studied not subject to any controllers. By defining a piecewise Lyapunov-Krasovskii function and by using the improved free-weighting matrix method, global exponential synchronizations are obtained. Illustrated example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed result. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
