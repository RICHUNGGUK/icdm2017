The approach is illustrated on the fabrication of a fractal pattern, a Sierpinsky triangle, using two approaches: by accretive growth and by carving. The notion of topological collections available in MGS enables the easy and concise modeling of self-assembly processes on various lattice geometries as well as more arbitrary constructions of multi-dimensional objects.", "paper_title": "Algorithmic self-assembly by accretion and by carving in MGS", "paper_id": "WOS:000238246200017"}
