First, each pixel intensity series in the video is modeled as a time series. Second, the chaos theory is employed to generate chaotic features. Each video is then represented by a feature vector matrix. Third, the mean shift clustering algorithm is used to cluster the feature vectors. Finally, the earth mover's distance (EMD) is employed to obtain a distance matrix by comparing the similarity based on the segmentation results. The distance matrix is transformed into a matching matrix, which is evaluated in the classification task. Experimental results show good traffic video classification performance, with robustness to environmental conditions, such as occlusions and variable lighting.", "paper_title": "Chaotic Features for Traffic Video Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333200015"}
