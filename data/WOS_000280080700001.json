To help in reducing this fatality, in this research, a new module for Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS) for automatic driver drowsiness detection based on visual information and Artificial Intelligence is presented. The aim of this system is to locate, to track and to analyze the face and the eyes to compute a drowsiness index, working under varying light conditions and in real time. Examples of different images of drivers taken in a real vehicle are shown to validate the algorithm.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Warning System for Driver Drowsiness Detection Using Visual Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000280080700001"}
