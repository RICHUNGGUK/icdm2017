Assume that the jumping parameters are generated from continue-time discrete-state homogeneous Markov process and the delays are time-invariant. By employing the Lyapunov stability theory, some inequality techniques and the stochastic analysis, sufficient conditions are derived to achieve the global exponential stability in the mean square of the stochastic BAM neural network. One example is also provided in the end of this paper to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
