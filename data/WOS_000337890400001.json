Firstly, we define a level-2 triangular fuzzy number with a triangular fuzzy centre (TFNwTFC) based on level-2 fuzzy set theory, and propose a theorem on how to transform it into an (alpha, beta)-level trapezoidal fuzzy number(TrFN). Secondly, in order to deal with the linear multi-objective decision making model with TrFN coefficients, we present an expected multi-objective model with chance constraints, and discuss its equivalent model. Then the epsilon-constraint method is employed to determine a solution to the crisp equivalent model. Finally, a supplier selection problem is used to illustrate the proposed models and approaches.", "paper_title": "A Class of Linear Multi-Objective Decision Making Model Based on Level-2 TFNwTFC Coefficients and Its Application to Supplier Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000337890400001"}
