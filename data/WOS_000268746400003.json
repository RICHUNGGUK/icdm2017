This paper evaluates a fuzzy helicopter regulator for a single-rotor PZL Kania helicopter. Unlike other models which only match stable flight ability, the model presented in this paper attempts to match the links between disturbances and hover conditions. Two simulations were performed to validate the model. In the first simulation, a helicopter was evaluated in a fixed hover position. In the second simulation, model robustness was validated by introducing wind gust. Results, both with the initial and with the modified model demonstrated the viability of the proposed regulator.", "paper_title": "Selection and Setting of an Intelligent Fuzzy Regulator based on Nonlinear Model Simulations of a Helicopter in Hover", "paper_id": "WOS:000268746400003"}
