The proposed model works over a Graphics Processing Unit using the structure of threads as cells that form a systolic mesh. Data passes through those cells, each one performing a simple computing operation. The systolic algorithm is implemented using NVIDIA's compute unified device architecture. To investigate the behavior and performance of the proposed model we test it over a NP-complete problem. The study of systolic algorithms on GPU and the different versions of the proposal show that our canonical model is a competitive solver with efficacy and presents a good scalability behavior across different instance sizes.", "paper_title": "Systolic neighborhood search on graphics processing units", "paper_id": "WOS:000329247000010"}
