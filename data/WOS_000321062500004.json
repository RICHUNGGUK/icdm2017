The geometric properties studied in this paper are the maximum diameter, the largest closest pair, the planar smallest minimum spanning tree, the planar largest minimum spanning tree and the planar smallest perimeter convex hull. We propose an O(n (1+epsilon) ) time algorithm for the maximum diameter color-spanning set problem where epsilon could be an arbitrarily small positive constant. Then, we present hardness proofs for the other problems and propose two efficient constant factor approximation algorithms for the planar smallest perimeter color-spanning convex hull problem.", "paper_title": "On some geometric problems of color-spanning sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000321062500004"}
