As two corollaries, Minkowski's and Chebyshev's type inequalities for the universal integral are obtained. The main results of this paper generalize some previous results obtained for special fuzzy integrals, e.g., Choquet and Sugeno integrals. Furthermore, related inequalities for seminormed integral are obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
