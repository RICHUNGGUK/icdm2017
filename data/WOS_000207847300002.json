The Tablet PC is an attractive technology for use in synchronous distributed learning environments because of its mobility, and its ability to not only serve as an effective note taking device but also as a high-resolution course content viewing device and a tool for interactive assessments. The research questions addressed here are: 1) \"What impact does the Tablet PC have on student perceptions of their engagement in a distributed learning environment?\" and 2) \"Can the Tablet PC be used to improve student learning in a distributed learning environment?\" In this project, the instructor and students were given a Tablet PC to use during the semester, and surveys were administered to evaluate student attitudes about the use of Tablet PC technology as a means of receiving, processing, and learning course material. The significance of this work is that it serves as a case study on the use of Tablet PCs as an effective technology for implementing established educational practices in distributed education environments.", "paper_title": "Tablet PC Technology for the Enhancement of Synchronous Distributed Education", "paper_id": "WOS:000207847300002"}
