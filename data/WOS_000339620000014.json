Design/methodology/approach - An optimal control of four independent currents is proposed in order to minimize the total losses with the respect of functioning constraints. Moreover, some geometrical parameters are added to the optimization process allowing a co-design between control and dimensioning. Findings - The optimization results prove the remarkable effect of using the freedom degree offered by a five-phase structure on iron and magnets losses. The performances of the five-phase machine with concentrated windings are notably improved at high speed (16,000 rpm). Originality/value - The effectiveness of the method allows solving the challenge which consists in taking into account inside the control strategy the eddy-current losses in magnets and iron. In fact, magnet losses are a critical point to protect the machine from demagnetization in flux-weakening region.", "paper_title": "High-speed functionality optimization of five-phase PM machine using third harmonic current", "paper_id": "WOS:000339620000014"}
