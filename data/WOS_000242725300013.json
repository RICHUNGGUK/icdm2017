In particular, Fajtlowicz formed the hypothesis - based on conjectures of the program Graffiti - that stable fullerenes tend to minimize their independence numbers. More recently, it was noticed that stable benzenoids do minimize their independence numbers [3, 5, 7, 8]. In this paper, we prove a lower bound on the independence number as a function of the number of cut-edges in the graph. Equality holds for this lower bound only for trees with perfect matchings, from which, since chemical trees with perfect matchings are generally more stable than those without, we infer that stable acyclic conjugated hydrocarbons also minimize their independence numbers - analogous to their benzenoid and also perhaps to their fullerene cousins. Together, this evidence suggests that this simple graph invariant may play some significant role in organic chemistry.", "paper_title": "Cut-edges and the independence number", "paper_id": "WOS:000242725300013"}
