The problem It deals with is the design of nonlinear tracking filters under tip to several hundreds of performance specifications. The suitability of different evolutionary computation techniques for solving multiobjective problems is explored, contrasting the performance achieved with recent multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEAs) proposals and different aggregation schemes. In particular, a new scheme is proposed to build a fitness function based on an operator that selects worst cases of multiple specifications in different situations. They have been evaluated in the design of an air traffic control (ATC) tracking filter that should accomplish a specific normative with 264 specifications. Results show their performance in terms of effectiveness and computational load, comparing their capability to scale the problem with respect to problem size.", "paper_title": "Effective Evolutionary Algorithms for Many-Specifications Attainment: Application to Air Traffic Control Tracking Filters", "paper_id": "WOS:000263161700010"}
