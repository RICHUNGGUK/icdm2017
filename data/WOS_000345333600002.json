As the major players in wireless network optimization, the BS's resource utilization and mobile user's QoS can be improved a lot by the load-balancing technology. In this paper, we propose a load-balancing strategy that uses Coordinated Multiple Points (CoMP) technology among the Base Stations (BS) to effectively extend network coverage and increase edge users signal quality. To use universally, different patterns of load-balancing based on CoMP are modeled and discussed. We define two QoS metrics to be guaranteed during CoMP load balancing: call blocking rate and efficient throughput. The closed-form expressions for these two QoS metrics are derived. The load-balancing capacity and QoS performances with different CoMP patterns are evaluated and analyzed in low-dense and high-dense traffic system. The numerical results present the reasonable CoMP load balancing pattern choice with guaranteed QoS in each system.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Analysis of Load-Balancing Based on Base-Station CoMP with Guaranteed QoS", "paper_id": "WOS:000345333600002"}
