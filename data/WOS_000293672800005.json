This multidisciplinary approach integrates close range digital photogrammetry, ground probing radar (GPR) and finite elements analysis (FEM) to analyse a masonry bridge. The resulting information from photogrammetry and radar is applied to define a 3D model, which is then used to simulate the behaviour of the bridge using FEM. Two different approaches to model the internal composition of the bridge with finite elements are presented. Sensitivity analysis is applied to study the reasons of the structural damage.
