That is, collective intelligence is built between students or between students and SNS, not between teachers and student in hierarchical educational situation, and the application plan for collective intelligence has been suggested as a new topic in cluster computing environment. This study suggests social learning platform in a specific way to realize the collective intelligence with the interaction between students, teachers and external helper (using API) in educational filed. In this study social learning platform means the aggregation of specific system that collective intelligence helps individual's creativity realize. This study is expected to help for application, expansion and creative linkage of collective intelligence which is able to use at social education in the future, also help the new relation between students and teachers in cluster computing environment.", "paper_title": "A study for the mechanism of expression of individual creativity throughout the social learning platform in cluster computing environment (focus on scenario and data collection design)", "paper_id": "WOS:000354412400012"}
