However, this algorithm suffers from poor performance due to the exponential size of the automaton relative to the size of the task set. In this paper, we build on the work of Baker and Cirinei, and rely on their formalism to characterise the complexity of this problem. We prove that it is PSpace-complete. In order to obtain an algorithm that is applicable in practice to systems of realistic sizes, we successfully apply techniques developed by the formal verification community, specifically antichain techniques (Doyen and Raskin in Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 6015, Springer, pp. 2-22, 2010) to this scheduling problem. For that purpose, we define and prove the correctness of a simulation relation on Baker and Cirinei's automaton. We show that our improved algorithm yields dramatically improved performance for the schedulability test and opens for many further improvements.
