Under the assumptions that the activation functions only satisfy global Lipschitz conditions, a new and complicated LMI condition is established on global asymptotic stability for the above neutral neural networks by means of using Homeomorphism theory, matrix and Lyapunov functional. In our result, the hypotheses for boundedness in [20,21] and monotonicity in [20] on the activation functions are removed. On the other hand, the LMI condition is also different from those in [20,21]. Finally, an example is given to show the effectiveness of the theoretical result. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
