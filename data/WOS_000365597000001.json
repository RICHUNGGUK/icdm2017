Hybrid cloud service selection optimization is distributed to and performed at two levels: hybrid cloud user agent-hybrid cloud service agent at hybrid cloud service layer and hybrid cloud service agent-hybrid cloud agent at hybrid cloud resource layer. Interactions among hybrid cloud user agent, hybrid cloud service agent, public cloud agents and private cloud agents are mediated by means of market mechanisms. Two level hybrid cloud service selection optimization maximizes the interests of hybrid cloud user agents, hybrid cloud service agent, public cloud agents and private cloud agents. Hybrid cloud service selection process includes two parts: hybrid cloud service provisioning and cloud resource allocation. The paper presents a two-level hybrid cloud service selection algorithm used to perform service provisioning and resource allocation. In the simulations, compared with other related algorithm, our proposed hybrid cloud service selection algorithms achieve the better performance with acceptable overhead. overhead.
