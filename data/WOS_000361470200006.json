Node deployment and duty cycle configuration of event detection in a large wireless sensor networks is an enormous challenge. In this paper, through in-depth analysis we find that there is a tradeoff between node duty cycle and event quality monitoring. That is, adopting larger duty cycle enables network to deploy fewer nodes. Or deploying more nodes can reduce their duty cycle. Both of them can reach the event detecting quality requirement of application. Based on the above findings, a novel subtraction deployment strategy (SDS) combined with the unequal node duty cycle in the network is presented. This strategy improves the duty cycle of nodes in non-hotspots area when reduces the number, thereby minimizing the deployment cost on the premise of meeting the detecting quality of application. We introduce a formal model to indicate the tradeoff between deployment cost and the quality of event detection. Subsequently, we present a heuristic algorithm to find near-optimal deployment solutions for practical scenarios. Both theoretical and experimental simulation results show that the proposed scheme SDS for event detection can reduce the deployed number of nodes by 11.49% and do no harm to detecting quality. In the deployment of the same node number, the weighted delay of detection can be reduced as much as 47%, and the weighted detection percentage can be increased by 1.56 times without reducing the network lifetime compared with those in uniform deployment scheme.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Heuristic Subtraction Deployment Strategy to Guarantee Quality of Event Detection for WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000361470200006"}
