In a given contract domain, it is usually possible to identify a set of well-defined common and variation points. Feature modeling is an ontology-like technique that has been widely used for capturing and managing commonalities and variabilities of product families in the context of software product line. This paper proposes a feature-based approach in order to decrease the complexity in Web service e-contract establishment. The feasibility of the approach is shown by a case study carried out within the telecom context and based on experimental software engineering concepts.", "paper_title": "Web service e-contract establishment using features", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100020"}
