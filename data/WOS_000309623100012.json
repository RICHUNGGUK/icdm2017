Although some literature reviews and comparisons have been made, they do not include the latest available heuristics and results are hard to compare as no common benchmarks and computing platforms have been employed. Furthermore, existing partial comparisons lack the application of powerful statistical tools. The result is that it is not clear which heuristics, especially among the recent ones, are the best. This paper presents a comprehensive review and computational evaluation as well as a statistical assessment of 22 existing heuristics. From the knowledge obtained after such a detailed comparison, five new heuristics are presented. Careful designs of experiments and analyses of variance (ANOVA) techniques are applied to guarantee sound conclusions. The comparison results identify the best existing methods and show that the five newly presented heuristics are competitive or better than the best performing ones in the literature for the permutation flowshop problem with the total completion time criterion.
