These dynamic topological changes bring a crucial problem in terms of network connectivity maintenance. Moreover, the high number of channel switching becomes also a problem due to dynamic topology changes in VNs. These aforementioned two challenges cause expressive degradations both in the user satisfaction and wireless communication quality in the VNs. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel queuing theory based framework for Vehicular Dynamic Spectrum Access Networks (VDSANs). Specifically, our proposed framework uses queuing theory analytics to model the dynamic behaviors of vehicles and obtain high satisfaction ratio of vehicles. Moreover, we propose six novel dynamic channel selection algorithms to provide minimal channel switching ratio while conserving the network connectivity. The thorough evaluations show that the network connectivity can be enhanced while optimizing the channel switching with our proposed queuing theoretic VDSANs paradigm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
