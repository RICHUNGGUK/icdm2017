In this paper, we introduce a new method to generate the regularity preserved superpixels. Starting from the lattice seeds, our method relocates them to the pixel with locally maximal edge magnitudes and treats them as the superpixel junctions. Then, the shortest path algorithm is employed to find the local optimal boundary connecting each adjacent junction pair. Thanks to the local constraints, our method obtains homogeneous superpixels with adjacency in lowly textured and uniform regions and simultaneously preserves the boundary adherence in the high contrast contents. Our method preserves the regularity property without significantly sacrificing the segmentation accuracy. Moreover, we extend this regular constraint for generating the supervoxels. Our method obtains the regular supervoxels, which preserves the structural relation on both spatial and temporal spaces of the video. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our simple but effective method outperforms the existing regular superpixel methods.", "paper_title": "Regularity Preserved Superpixels and Supervoxels", "paper_id": "WOS:000337955800023"}
