Applying quantum chemical calculations based on supermolecular approach, the reactions mimicking presumed steps of cisplatin activation were evaluated. The electronic structure of model systems: cis- and transplatin with free electrons, hydrated electrons, and water, was studied by using density functional (DFT) within the Huzinaga basis set and GAUSSIAN-09 package. The respective energy was evaluated with the use of B3LYP density hybrid functional. The calculations were performed for gas phase and water solution; the solvent effects were studied by using the polarizable continuum model. Analysis of the energetic and structural parameters of cisplatin vs. transplatin behavior in the model systems leads to conclusion: there are two possible ways of cisplatin biotransformation, hydrolysis and hydrated electron impact, dependent on the medium redox state.", "paper_title": "Non-empirical quantum chemical studies on electron transfer reactions in trans- and cis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000294735900030"}
