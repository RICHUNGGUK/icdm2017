The null-control vector in the GDI-based control law parameterizes all the possible control functions that drive the aircraft trajectories to the sliding surface. A simple choice of the null-control vector is made, and is shown to yield closed-loop system stability for the nominal actuator scenario. The small gain theorem is employed to provide an explicit lower limit on the actuator efficiency matrix in the event of faults/failures. The efficacy of the proposed method in tolerating control surface actuator failure is demonstrated on the ADMIRE benchmark model.", "paper_title": "Fault Tolerant Control of Aircraft Actuating Surfaces using Generalized DI and Integral SM Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000312583500017"}
