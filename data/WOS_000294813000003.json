We call this problem the Minimum Duplication Bipartition Problem. Using a generalization of the Minimum Edge-Cut Problem, we propose a polynomial time 2-approximation algorithm for the Minimum Duplication Bipartition Problem. We apply this algorithm to the inference of species trees on synthetic datasets and on two datasets of eukaryotic species.", "paper_title": "A 2-Approximation for the Minimum Duplication Speciation Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000294813000003"}
