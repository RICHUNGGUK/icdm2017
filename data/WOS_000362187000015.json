Unlike existing works that usually use conventional visual features to annotate images, features based on deep learning have shown potential to achieve outstanding performance. In this work, we propose a multimodal deep learning framework, which aims to optimally integrate multiple deep neural networks pretrained with convolutional neural networks. In particular, the proposed framework explores a unified two stage learning scheme that consists of (i) learning to fine-tune the parameters of deep neural network with respect to each individual modality, and (ii) learning to find the optimal combination of diverse modalities simultaneously in a coherent process. Experiments conducted on a variety of public datasets evaluate the performance of the proposed framework for multilabel image annotation, in which the encouraging results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.
