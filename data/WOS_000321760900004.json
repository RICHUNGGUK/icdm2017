In contrast, most robots lack common sense about the forces involved in everyday manipulation tasks. In this paper, we present data-driven methods to inform robots about the forces that they are likely to encounter when performing specific tasks. In the context of door opening, we demonstrate that data-driven object-centric models can be used to haptically recognize specific doors, haptically recognize classes of door (e.g., refrigerator vs. kitchen cabinet), and haptically detect anomalous forces while opening a door, even when opening a specific door for the first time. We also demonstrate that two distinct robots can use forces captured from people opening doors to better detect anomalous forces. These results illustrate the potential for robots to use shared databases of forces to better manipulate the world and attain common sense about everyday forces.", "paper_title": "Improving robot manipulation with data-driven object-centric models of everyday forces", "paper_id": "WOS:000321760900004"}
