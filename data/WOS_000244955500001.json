Content providers have to find adaptation solutions to serve all devices at the same time. This paper introduces a dynamic layout adaptation algorithm for web documents and an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) that supports layout adaptation. The presented layout adaptation language is based on existing World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications, i.e., XFrames and CSS. Adaptation might results in several pages within one document. There is a need for a navigation method for browsing such documents. Therefore, we introduce a navigation method that supports paging. An implementation of the adaptation algorithm and the navigation method is also discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Vertical navigation of layout adapted web documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000244955500001"}
