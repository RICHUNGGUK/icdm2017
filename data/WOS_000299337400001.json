Transactional Memory (TM) is a potential solution to this problem, and an FPGA-based system provides the opportunity to support TM in hardware (HTM). Although there are many proposed approaches to HTM support for ASICs, these do not necessarily map well to FPGAs. In particular in this work we demonstrate that while signature-based conflict detection schemes (essentially bit-vectors) should intuitively be a good match to the bit parallelism of FPGAs, previous approaches result in unacceptable multicycle stalls, operating frequencies, or false-conflict rates. Capitalizing on the reconfigurable nature of FPGA-based systems, we propose an application-specific signature mechanism for HTM conflict detection. Our evaluation uses real and projected FPGA-based soft multiprocessor systems that support HTM and implement threaded, shared-memory network packet processing applications. We find that our application-specific approach: (i) maintains a reasonable operating frequency of 125 MHz, (ii) achieves a 9% to 71% increase in packet throughput relative to signatures with bit selection on a 2-thread architecture, and (iii) allows our HTM to achieve 6%, 54%, and 57% increases in packet throughput on an 8-thread architecture versus a baseline lock-based synchronization for three of four packet processing applications studied, due to reduced false synchronization.", "paper_title": "Application-Specific Signatures for Transactional Memory in Soft Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337400001"}
