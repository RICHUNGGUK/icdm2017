We focus on the choices involved in setting up these measures, and we compare them in three simple examples, one theoretical and two applied. The contribution of this paper is to put all these information criteria into a Bayesian predictive context and to better understand, through small examples, how these methods can apply in practice.", "paper_title": "Understanding predictive information criteria for Bayesian models", "paper_id": "WOS:000341440800007"}
