We use tight bounds for the number of rational points of these curves in estimating the probabilities of the systematic authentication codes. We compare their parameters with some existing codes in the literature. We observe that the parameters are better than the existing ones in some cases.", "paper_title": "Systematic authentication codes using additive polynomials", "paper_id": "WOS:000258933600006"}
