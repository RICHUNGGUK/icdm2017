Within this system, various digital marketing strategy models are computerised, adapted and extended. On-line Monte Carlo simulation is employed to capture the stochastic behaviour of relevant factors or variables influencing digital marketing decision making. Web-based fuzzy logic is applied to model the uncertainty surrounding the input and strategic options. On-line \"IF-THEN\" rules are created to represent and automate associated planning knowledge and guidelines. Web databases are used to pass data amongst different functional components, and store and retrieve simulation results and user entries. The system has been tested using digital marketing cases with involved managers. Evaluation findings indicate that the Web-enabled knowledge automation system is efficient and effective in improving the digital marketing strategy formulation process and its output.
