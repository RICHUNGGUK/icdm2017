The resource allocation is the core component leading the network system and mobile terminals to the service robustness and performance maximization. In this paper, a numeric optimization model for optimizing terminals' transmission power and allocated RAT bandwidth for maximizing system capacity is proposed with the focal consideration of the multi-radio transmission diversity for parallel transmission through multiple links from different RATs, and different terminal characteristics on RAT supports. Also, we design a centralized and periodic scheduling algorithm including an improved coevolutionary genetic algorithm for efficiently solving the optimization problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our propose algorithm can distinctly enhance the system performance and improve the computational efficiency.", "paper_title": "Optimal resource allocation for transmission diversity in multi-radio access networks: a coevolutionary genetic algorithm approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000330681500010"}
