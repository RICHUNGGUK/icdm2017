We present an automatic 3D face recognition approach which can accurately differentiate between expression deformations and interpersonal disparities and hence recognize faces under any facial expression. The patterns of expression deformations are first learnt from training data in PCA eigenvectors. These patterns are then used to morph out the expression deformations. Similarity measures are extracted by matching the morphed 3D faces. PCA is performed in such a way it models only the facial expressions leaving out the interpersonal disparities. The approach was applied on the FRGC v2.0 dataset and superior recognition performance was achieved. The verification rates at 0.001 FAR were 98.35% and 97.73% for scans under neutral and non-neutral expressions, respectively.", "paper_title": "An Expression Deformation Approach to Non-rigid 3D Face Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000262433800005"}
