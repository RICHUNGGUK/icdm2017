The new approach has proven to be successful as binary classification problems have been concerned. Present paper presents the extension of the aforementioned technique to the. more frequent case of multi-class classification. Validation of evolutionary multi-class support vector machines is performed on the well-known benchmark problem of Fisher's Iris plants classification and results demonstrate the promise of the new approach.", "paper_title": "Evolutionary multi-class support vector machines for classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000203014800071"}
