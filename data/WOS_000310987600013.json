This article aims at providing a detailed discussion of reliability optimization for wireless telemedicine network by using a prognostics approach. The science of prognostics, which is based on the analysis of failure modes, detection of early signs of wear and aging, and fault conditions, has been applied to electronic components and systems as well as structural monitoring. Using data-driven prognostics techniques, the condition of a network can also be monitored using operational data related to data packets as they are delivered across the network. Prognostics are particularly important for wireless telemedicine networks since these networks must operate reliably irrespective of abruptly changing operating conditions in order to support life-saving missions.", "paper_title": "PROGNOSTICS AND HEALTH MANAGEMENT FOR WIRELESS TELEMEDICINE NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000310987600013"}
