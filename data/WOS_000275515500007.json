The clustering journals and ISI subject categories provide two subject classification schemes through different perspectives and levels. The two clustering results have been compared and their accordance and divergence have been analyzed. Several indicators have been used to compare the communication characteristics among different ISI subject categories. The neighbour map of each category clearly reflects the affinities between the \"core\" category and its satellites around. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
