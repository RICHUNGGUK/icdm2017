It therefore adaptively balances using both the dynamics of the simulation and the load usage of the cluster at runtime. The algorithm is implemented in the POOMA framework and applied to a particle in-cell approximation of a three dimensional elastic particle collision model. Load balancing metrics and parallel scalability is determined on an 8 quad-processor 833MHZ Compaq Alpha cluster connected by a gigabit ethernet.", "paper_title": "A runtime adaptive load balancing algorithm for particle simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000237003200086"}
