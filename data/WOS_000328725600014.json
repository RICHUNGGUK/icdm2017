Typically, the contexts are represented as the vector space using \"Bag of Words (BoW)\" technique. Despite its ease of use, BoW representation suffers from well-known limitations, mostly due to its inability to exploit semantic similarity between terms. In this paper, we apply the semantic diffusion kernel, which models semantic similarity by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information, to smooth the BoW representation for WSD systems. Semantic diffusion kernel can be obtained through a matrix exponentiation transformation on the given kernel matrix, and virtually exploits higher order co-occurrences to infer semantic similarity between terms. The superiority of the proposed method is demonstrated experimentally with several SensEval disambiguation tasks. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
