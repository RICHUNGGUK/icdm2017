Such an abstract machine could consist of a collection of vector processors, each with a small fast memory communicating via a larger global memory. Programming this type of machine will require ideas from the past as well as new concepts.", "paper_title": "Skeleton Particle-in-Cell Codes on Emerging Computer Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000350014700007"}
