Homology is easy to establish when sequences are similar (sharing an identity > 25%). However, for distant proteins, it is much more difficult to align motifs that are not similar in sequences but still share common structures or functions. This paper is a first attempt to align multiple protein sequences using both primary and secondary structure information. A new sequence model is proposed so that the model assigns high probabilities not only to motifs that contain conserved amino acids but also to motifs that present common secondary structures. The proposed method is tested in a structural alignment database BAliBASE. We show that information brought by the predicted secondary structures greatly improves motif identification.
