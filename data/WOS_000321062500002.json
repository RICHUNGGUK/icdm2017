The objective is to schedule a number of unit jobs, with release dates, deadlines, weights and heat contributions, to maximize the weighted throughput subject to a temperature threshold. We first give an optimally competitive randomized algorithm. Then we give a constant competitive randomized algorithm that allows a tradeoff between the maximum heat contribution of jobs and the competitiveness. Finally we consider the multiple processor case and give several tight upper and lower bounds.", "paper_title": "Online algorithms for maximizing weighted throughput of unit jobs with temperature constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000321062500002"}
