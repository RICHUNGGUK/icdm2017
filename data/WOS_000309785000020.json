The PBEDT is based on independent scan and implemented in a recursive way, i.e., the EDT of a d-dimensional image is able to be computed from the EDTs of its (d-1)-dimensional sub-images. In each recursion, all of the rows in the current dimensional direction are processed one by one. The points in the current processing row and their closest feature points in (d-1)-dimensional sub-images can be shown in a Euclidean plane. By using the geometric properties of the perpendicular bisector, the closest feature points of (d-1)-dimensional subimages are easily verified so as to lead to the EDT of a d-dimensional image after eliminating the invalid points. The time complexity of the PBEDT algorithm is linear in the amount of both image points and dimensions with a small coefficient. Compared with the state-of-the-art EDT algorithms, the PBEDT algorithm is much faster and more stable in most cases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
