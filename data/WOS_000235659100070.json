First, an individual intelligent learning agent that learns about underlying text documents is presented to discover the useful knowledge for enterprise decision. In order to scale the individual intelligent agent with the large number of text documents on the web, we then provide a multi-agent web text mining system in a parallel way based upon grid technology. Finally, we discuss how the multi-agent web text mining system on the grid can be used to implement text mining services.", "paper_title": "Multi-agent web text mining on the grid for enterprise decision support", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100070"}
