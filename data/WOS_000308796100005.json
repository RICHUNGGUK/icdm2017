However, the adoption process thus far has gone undocumented and enterprise architects are troubled with proper hands-on tools missing, until very recently. This single case study describes a large Dutch utility provider in their effort to understand the facets of the cloud and identifying the risks associated with it. In an action research setting, the SeCA model was used to analyse the cloud solutions and identify the risks with specific data classifications in mind. The results show how decision makers can use the SeCA model in various ways to identify the security risks associated with each cloud solution analysed. The analysis assumes that data classifications are in place. This research concludes that by using the SeCA model, a full understanding of the security risks can be gained on an objective and structural level; this is a further validation of prior empirical research that the SeCA model is a proper hands-on tool for cloud security analysis.", "paper_title": "Analysing the Security Risks of Cloud Adoption Using the SeCA Model: A Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000308796100005"}
