The use of these techniques allows for the presence of uncertainty in computer models that are developed for decision making, and to formulate the decision-making models using the experiences of previous decisions made. Since the formulation of these models differs from the classical approach of decision-making models, in this paper, the models are analyzed and a method is proposed for its implementation.
