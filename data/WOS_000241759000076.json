But it has some problems in applications, especially in MDPs of continuous state spaces. In this paper, based on the vague neural networks, we propose a Q-learning algorithm which is comprehensively considering the reward and punishment of the environment. Simulation results in cart-pole balancing problem illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Vague neural network based reinforcement learning control system for inverted pendulum", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000076"}
