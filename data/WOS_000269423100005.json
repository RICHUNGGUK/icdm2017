The algorithm CG for solving cluster-grouping problems is then introduced, and it is incorporated as a component in several existing and novel algorithms for tackling subgroup discovery, clustering and classification. The resulting systems are empirically compared to state-of-the-art systems such as CN2, CBA, Ripper, Autoclass and CobWeb. The results indicate that the CG algorithm can be useful as a generic local pattern mining component in a wide variety of data mining and machine learning algorithms.", "paper_title": "Cluster-grouping: from subgroup discovery to clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000269423100005"}
