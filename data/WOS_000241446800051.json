This paper proposes a composition-oriented and AND/OR graph-based service search method named as CoSA, which can automatically search the composition relation graph in concepts level and composition plan in implement level. Composition operator and domain characteristics are reflected in the heuristic functions. CoSA decreases the service search space and improves the search effectiveness. By unifying the service search and composition problems into one composition-oriented service search problem, CoSA enables the dynamic and automatic service composition.", "paper_title": "A composition oriented and graph-based service search method", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800051"}
