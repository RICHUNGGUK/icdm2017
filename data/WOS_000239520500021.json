This is due to the lack of an explicit definition of the links between these non-functional characteristics and the architectural decisions implementing them. In this paper, we present a solution that aims at assisting the software maintainer during an evolution activity on his demand. It requires the definition of a documentation during development, organized in the form of bindings between formal descriptions of architectural decisions and their targeted quality attributes. Through an assistance algorithm, the approach uses this documentation in order to notify the maintainer of the possible effects of architectural changes on quality requirements. We also present a prototype tool which automates our proposals. This tool and the overall approach has been experienced on a real-world software in order to validate them.", "paper_title": "On-demand quality-oriented assistance in component-based software evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000239520500021"}
