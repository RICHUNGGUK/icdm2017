Unlike small spherical soap bubbles, giant soap bubbles stretch significantly and undergo globally varying and locally consistent deformations because of time-varying surface tensions. For physically plausible surface tensions, we introduce and combine a variable-length mass spring system and Gibbs elasticity and Marangoni elasticity. Using a proposed framework, we deform our models because of general forces from surface tensions, winds, and excessive pressures. Our framework effectively generates a physically plausible animation of giant soap bubbles, differing in shape according to the user's design; generates capillary waves and vibrations while floating in the air; and shows vivid iridescent colors corresponding to the deformations, all of which have been difficult to achieve using previous soap bubble animation methods.
