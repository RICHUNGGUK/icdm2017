However, conventional scalabilities are designed for homogeneous parallel processing. There is no suitable and commonly accepted definition of scalability metric for heterogeneous systems. Isospeed scalability is a well-defined metric for homogeneous computing. This study extends the isospeed scalability metric to general heterogeneous computing systems. The proposed isospeed-efficiency model is suitable for both homogeneous and heterogeneous computing. Through theoretical analyses, we derive methodologies of scalability measurement and prediction for heterogeneous systems. Experimental results have verified the analytical results and confirmed that the proposed isospeed-efficiency scalability works well in both homogeneous and heterogeneous environments.
