In this paper, we propose an adaptive group of picture structure selection scheme, which the group of picture size and low-pass frame position are selected based on mutual information. Furthermore, the temporal decomposition process is determined adaptively according to the selected group of picture structure. A large amount of experimental work is carried out to compare the compression performance of proposed method with the conventional motion compensated temporal filtering encoding scheme and adaptive group of picture structure in standard scalable video coding model. The proposed low-pass frame selection can improve the compression quality by about 0.3-0.5 dB comparing to the conventional scheme in video sequences with high motion activities. In the scenes with un-even variation of motion activities, e.g. frequent shot cuts, the proposed adaptive group of picture size can achieve a better compression capability than conventional scheme. When comparing to adaptive group of picture in standard scalable video coding model, the proposed group of picture structure scheme can lead to about 0.2 similar to 0.8 dB improvements in sequences with high motion activities or shot cut.", "paper_title": "An adaptive GOP structure selection for haar-like MCTF encoding based on mutual information", "paper_id": "WOS:000264626900002"}
