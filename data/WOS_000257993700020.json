In response, this study suggests a new systematic approach to new mobile service creation. At first, morphological analysis is applied to identify the structure of services. Specifically, the dimension parameters are defined by decomposing the service system into basic components and the shape parameters are defined by mapping keywords extracted from business method patents through text mining. Then, by applying conjoint analysis, the promising configurations of mobile services are derived. Finally, the Kano model is applied to evaluate the requirement type of alternatives. The proposed approach can generate and evaluate the service concepts systematically. The detailed procedure of the approach is illustrated based on the case of mobile entertainment services. The proposed approach is expected to help service designers in real service creation processes. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
