Contrary to folklore, the bias does not reflect weaknesses of the underlying mathematical methods, but is mainly due to the effects of discretization of the spatial domain. We investigate two approaches to correcting the bias: a Newton-Raphson-type correction and Richardson extrapolation. In simulation experiments, Richardson extrapolation performs best.", "paper_title": "Bias correction for parameter estimates of spatial point process models", "paper_id": "WOS:000335214900001"}
