The Computing Resources for Research group at University College Cork is involved in the development of data visualisation systems for life science research. Building on the groups' skills in Multimedia, Information Technology and Learning and Cancer Research, we develop sophisticated multimedia content for researchers and practitioners in the life sciences. We have recently built a suite of animations on Breast Cancer aimed at patients, clinicians and researchers.", "paper_title": "Multimedia visualisation for Breast Cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000257497600028"}
