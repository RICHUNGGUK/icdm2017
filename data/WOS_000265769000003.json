Most of them can run in a batch mode for a set of given data points, but lack a mechanism to deal with new data points. Here we propose an extension approach, i.e., mapping new data points into the previously learned manifold. The core idea of our approach is to propagate the known coordinates to each of the new data points. We first formulate this task as a quadratic programming, and then develop an iterative algorithm for coordinate propagation. Tangent space projection and smooth splines are used to yield an initial coordinate for each new data point, according to their local geometrical relations. Experimental results and applications to camera direction estimation and face pose estimation illustrate the validity of our approach.", "paper_title": "Embedding new data points for manifold learning via coordinate propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000265769000003"}
