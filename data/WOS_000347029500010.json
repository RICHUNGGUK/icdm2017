Our human model includes all of the relevant articular bones and muscles, including 103 bones (163 articular degrees of freedom) plus a total of 823 muscle actuators embedded in a finite element model of the musculotendinous soft tissues of the body that produces realistic deformations. To coordinate the numerous muscle actuators in order to produce natural swimming movements, we develop a biomimetically motivated motor control system based on Central Pattern Generators (CPGs), which learns to produce activation signals that drive the numerous muscle actuators.", "paper_title": "Realistic Biomechanical Simulation and Control of Human Swimming", "paper_id": "WOS:000347029500010"}
