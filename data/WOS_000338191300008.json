We introduce a new method for false-positive reduction in this paper. The key idea of our approach is to exploit the textural properties of mammograms and for texture description, to use Weber law descriptor (WLD), which outperforms state-of-the-art best texture descriptors. The basic WLD is a holistic descriptor by its construction because it integrates the local information content into a single histogram, which does not take into account the spatial locality of micropatterns. We extend it into a multiscale spatial WLD (MSWLD) that better characterizes the texture micro structures of masses by incorporating the spatial locality and scale of microstructures. The dimension of the feature space generated by MSWLD becomes high; it is reduced by selecting features based on their significance. Finally, support vector machines are employed to classify ROIs as true masses or normal parenchyma. The proposed approach is evaluated using 1024 ROIs taken from digital database for screening mammography and an accuracy of Az = 0.99 +/- A 0.003 (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) is obtained. A comparison reveals that the proposed method has significant improvement over the state-of-the-art best methods for false-positive reduction problem.", "paper_title": "False-positive reduction in mammography using multiscale spatial Weber law descriptor and support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000338191300008"}
