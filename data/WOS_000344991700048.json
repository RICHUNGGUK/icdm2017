Specialized interactive visual methods are required to help analysts in understanding the characteristics of the attributes when these multiple aspects are considered concurrently. Here, we develop attribute signatures interactively crafted graphics that show the geographic variability of statistics of attributes through which the extent of dependency between the attributes and geography can be visually explored. We compute a number of statistical measures, which can also account for variations in time and scale, and use them as a basis for our visualizations. We then employ different graphical configurations to show and compare both continuous and discrete variation of location and scale. Our methods allow variation in multiple statistical summaries of multiple attributes to be considered concurrently and geographically, as evidenced by examples in which the census geography of London and the wider UK are explored.", "paper_title": "Attribute Signatures: Dynamic Visual Summaries for Analyzing Multivariate Geographical Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000344991700048"}
