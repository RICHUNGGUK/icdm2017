We introduce the Dempster-Shafer belief structure and discuss how it provides a formal mathematical framework for representing various types of uncertain information. We provide some fundamental ideas and mechanisms related to these structures. We then investigate their role in the important task of decision-making under uncertainty. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
