Due to lacking knowledge about the contents and the structure of a database, users will often only be able to provide very broad queries. Existing methods for automatically refining such queries based on user profiles often overshoot the target resulting in queries that do not return any answer. In this article, we investigate methods for automatically relaxing such over-constrained queries based on domain knowledge and user preferences. We describe a framework for information access that combines query refinement and relaxation in order to provide robust, personalized access to heterogeneous resource description framework data as well as an implementation in terms of rewriting rules and explain its application in the context of e-learning systems.", "paper_title": "Relaxing RDF queries based on user and domain preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000271750000002"}
