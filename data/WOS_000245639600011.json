In this paper, the performance of the AWE technique in conjunction with hybrid finite element/boundary integral (FE/BI) method is firstly investigated. The formulation of the AWE applied in hybrid FE/BI method is given in detail. The characteristic implementation of the application of the AWE to the hybrid FE/BI method is discussed. Numerical results demonstrate that the AWE technique can greatly speed up the hybrid FE/BI method to acquire wide-band and wide-angle backscatter radar-cross-section (RCS) by complex targets.", "paper_title": "Application of asymptotic waveform approximation technique to hybrid FE/BI method for 3D scattering", "paper_id": "WOS:000245639600011"}
