The links belong to shared risk link groups (SRLGs) that have arbitrary failure probabilities. This problem is NP-hard, so we propose heuristic algorithms for networks with large numbers of SRLGs, as well as optimal solutions for networks with smaller numbers of SRLGs. The solutions are evaluated through simulations.", "paper_title": "Highly Available Path Routing in Mesh Networks Under Multiple Link Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000297588200013"}
