The proposed PCA extension is able to perform the eigenvectors computation from a set of signals corrupted by missing data. The sensor package considered in this work contains a 2D depth sensor pointed upwards to the ceiling, providing depth images with missing data. The positioning sensor obtained is then integrated in a Linear Parameter Varying mobile robot model to obtain a self-localization system, based on linear Kalman filters, with globally stable position error estimates. A study consisting in adding synthetic random corrupted data to the captured depth images revealed that this extended PCA technique is able to reconstruct the signals, with improved accuracy. The self-localization system obtained is assessed in unstructured environments and the methodologies are validated even in the case of varying illumination conditions.", "paper_title": "Enhanced PCA-Based Localization Using Depth Maps with Missing Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000347893100009"}
