Their proof involved a difficult analysis of computation graphs associated with 2-pushdown-stack automata. We present a shorter and easier proof in terms of 1-tape Turing machines. We also discuss how the proof generalises to almost-confluent Thue systems and the differing powers of Church-Rosser, almost-confluent, and preperfect Thue systems in relation to palindromes.
