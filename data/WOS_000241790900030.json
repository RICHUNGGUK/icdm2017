First, the clustering algorithm divides the input space in several regions (local models). Subsequently, a one-layer neural network, for each local region, is used to fit the model (classifier) for a specific group of data points. Experimental results on three different data sets are showed to verify the validity of the proposed method. Besides, a comparative study with a feedforward neural network is included. This study exhibits that the presented algorithm is a fast procedure that obtains, in many cases, better results than the other technique.", "paper_title": "A fast classification algorithm based on local models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900030"}
