The result is expressed in terms of the spherical intrinsic volumes of the cone C. This allows us to perform an average analysis of the Grassmann condition number l (A) for the homogeneous convex feasibility problem there exists x is an element of C \\ 0 : Ax = 0. The Grassmann condition number is a geometric version of Renegar's condition number, which we have introduced recently in Amelunxen and Burgisser (SIAM J. Optim. 22(3): 1029-1041 (2012)). We thus give the first average analysis of convex programming that is not restricted to linear programming. In particular, we prove that if the entries of A is an element of R-mxn are chosen i. i. d. standard normal, then for any regular cone C, we have E [ln l (A)] < 1.5 ln(n) + 1.5. The proofs rely on various techniques from Riemannian geometry applied to Grassmann manifolds.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic Analysis of the Grassmann Condition Number", "paper_id": "WOS:000348764400002"}
