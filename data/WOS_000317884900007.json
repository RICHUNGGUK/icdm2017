The aim is using the preference information supplied by the decision maker to guide the search process to the regions where solutions more in accordance with his/her preferences are located, thus narrowing the scope of the search and reducing the computational effort. An example dealing with a pertinent problem in electrical distribution network is used to compare the different versions of the algorithm and illustrate how meaningful information can be elicited from a decision maker and used in the operational framework of an evolutionary algorithm to provide decision support in real-world problems.
