Connecting a more realistic model of physiology to a cognitive architecture allows one to develop more realistic computational process models that include an account for the effect of physiology on cognition. It is also useful to include some theory of affect and emotion to act as a functional layer between some representations of physiology and cognition. We chose to extend the ACT-R (adaptive control of thought - rational) cognitive architecture with physiology and affect to make the ACT-R Phi hybrid architecture. We connected the Hum Mod physiological simulation system with the ACT-R architecture; ACT-R Phi has a module that communicates between ACT-R and Hum Mod. A new affect system was also developed using an existing theoretical framework to serve as a functional layer between some of the physiological and cognitive representations. With this new architecture one can model a wide range of human behavior (e.g., the effects of homeostasis on cognition) in a more tractable fashion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
