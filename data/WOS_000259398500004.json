In order to understand the structure-activity correlation of indolinone-based PDK1 inhibitors, we have carried out a combined molecular docking and three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity C relationship (3D-QSAR) modeling study. The study has resulted in two types of satisfactory 3D-QSAR 2 2 models, including the CoMFA model (r(2) = 0.907; q(2) = 0.737) and CoMSIA model (r(2) = 0.991; q(2) = 0.824), for predicting the biological activity of new compounds. The detailed microscopic structures of PDK1 binding with inhibitors have been studied by molecular docking. We have also developed docking-based 3D-QSAR models (CoMFA with q(2) = 0.729; CoMSIA with q(2) = 0.79). The contour maps obtained from the 3D-QSAR models in combination with the docked binding structures help to better interpret the structure-activity relationship. All of the structural insights obtained from both the 3D-QSAR contour maps and molecular docking are consistent with the available experimental activity data. This is the first report on 3D-QSAR modeling of PDK1 inhibitors. The satisfactory results strongly suggest that the developed 3D-QSAR models and the obtained PDK1-inhibitor binding structures are reasonable for the prediction of the activity of new inhibitors and in future drug design.", "paper_title": "Combined 3D-QSAR Modeling and molecular docking study on indolinone derivatives as inhibitors of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1", "paper_id": "WOS:000259398500004"}
