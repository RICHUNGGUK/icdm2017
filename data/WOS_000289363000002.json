This study investigated the effect of help prompt placement on older users' interaction with a smart home interface. In the dynamic help condition, help was only given in response to system errors; in the inherent help condition, it was also given at the start of each task. Fifteen older and sixteen younger users interacted with a smart home system using two different scenarios. Each scenario consisted of several tasks. The linguistic style users employed to communicate with the system (interaction style) was measured using the ratio of commands to the overall utterance length (keyword ratio) and the percentage of content words in the user's utterance that could be understood by the system (shared vocabulary). While the timing of help prompts did not affect the interaction style of younger users, it was early task-specific help supported older users in adapting their interaction style to the system's capabilities. Well-placed help prompts can significantly increase the usability of spoken dialogue systems for older people.", "paper_title": "Making it easier for older people to talk to smart homes: the effect of early help prompts", "paper_id": "WOS:000289363000002"}
