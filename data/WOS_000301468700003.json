We have analytically derived the average delay performance of our MAC protocol, with and without the timeslot stealing mechanism. Our delay model, validated via simulations, shows that the timeslot stealing mechanism can substantially improve the protocol throughput in scenarios with varying and asymmetric traffic patterns. Evaluation results show that the timeslot reassignment procedure is efficient in handling the longer timescale changes in the traffic load, while the timeslot stealing mechanism is better in handling the shorter timescale changes in the traffic patterns.
