Our component-level CoMSO algorithm computes energy-optimal modetransition sequences for different lengths of idle intervals. Our system-level SyMSO algorithm shifts tasks within slack intervals while satisfying all timing and resource constraints in the given schedule. Experimental results on a commercial software-defined radio show that these new techniques can reduce idle energy by 50-70%, or 30-50% of total system energy over previous offline-optimal but unsequenced techniques based on localized break-even-time analysis, thanks to rich options offered by mode sequencing.", "paper_title": "Idle energy minimization by mode sequence optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000250227600002"}
