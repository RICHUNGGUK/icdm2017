However, revealing personal private locations to potentially un-trusted LBS server and others may raise serious privacy concerns if these locations are not protected adequately. In this paper, we present a survey of existing methods dealing with outdoor and indoor localization techniques and location privacy protection techniques. We propose a taxonomy that summarizes the state-of-the-art. This survey is intended to help researchers in quickly understanding existing works and challenges, and possible improvements to bring.", "paper_title": "Location Positioning and Privacy Preservation Methods in Location-based Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000361378000007"}
