For effective utilization of the capabilities of different NTM processes, utmost care is needed for the selection of the most suitable process for a given machining application. Due to the lack of experienced experts in the domain of NTM processes, there is a need for a simple scientific/mathematical tool for selecting the most suitable NTM process when a particular shape feature is to be generated on a given work material. This paper focuses on the development of a two-phase decision model in this aspect. In the first phase, the most efficient NTM processes are selected for a given shape feature and work material combination having the best combination of performance parameters with the help of input-minimized-based Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes (CCR) model of data envelopment analysis (DEA). In the second phase, those efficient NTM processes are ranked in descending order of priority using the weighted-overall efficiency ranking method of multi-attribute decision-making (MADM) theory. Two real time machining applications are cited which prove the applicability, versatility and adaptability of this two-phase NTM process selection decision-making model as the results are quite consistent with those as derived by the past researches.
