Due to the new emerging factors in the transcoding proxy and the aggregate effect of caching multiple versions of the same multimedia object, this problem becomes more important and complex as audio and video applications have proliferated over the Internet, especially in the environment of mobile computing systems. This paper addresses coordinated cache replacement in transcoding proxies. First, we propose an original model which determines cache replacement candidates on all candidate nodes in a coordinated fashion with the objective of minimizing the total cost loss for linear topology. We formulate this problem as an optimization problem and present a low-cost optimal solution for deciding cache replacement candidates. Second, we extend this problem to solve the same problem for tree networks. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our solutions by comparing with existing models.", "paper_title": "Coordinated multimedia object replacement in transcoding proxies", "paper_id": "WOS:000277300500004"}
