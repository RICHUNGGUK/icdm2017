We discuss the approach used in evolving an e-Service business model and propose a conceptual framework for identifying its key service attributes. In order to formulate an enhancement method, we conducted a customer survey; customer segmentation was identified and an e-Service enhancement priority matrix for defining the management of customer relations was developed as a way of prioritizing improvements. The e-Service enhancement priority matrix included service attributes identified as leveragable strength, high-priority improvement, low-priority improvement, and maintenance of customer relations. In analyzing the priority matrix, the correlation of system performance with overall e-Service satisfaction was relatively low, whereas the accuracy of logistics information, platform functionality, and e-Service scope had a much higher correlation. Based on this analysis, enhancement priorities were identified. While both integrated device manufacturers and design houses recognize the importance of e-Service, the firms showed a lower awareness of these new services. This indicated that such types of e-Service should be promoted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
