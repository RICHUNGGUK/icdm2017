The formulation is based on Hellinger-Reissner variational principle. The element is developed by flat shell approach by combining a membrane element with a Mindlin plate element. The proposed element has six degrees of freedom per node and permits an easy connection to other types of finite elements. Numerical examples are presented to show that the validity and efficiency of the present element for static and free vibration analysis. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
