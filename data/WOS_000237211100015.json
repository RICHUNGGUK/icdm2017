New communication paradigms are undermining its original design principles. The mobile Internet demands a level of optimum that is hard to achieve with a strictly-layered protocol stack. Questioning if layering is still an adequate foundation for autonomic protocol stack design, we study the state-of-the-art from both the layered camp and its counterpart. We then outline our vision on protocol stack design for autonomic communication with the POEM model and its internals. A novel cross-layer design approach that combines the advantages of layering and the benefits of holistic and systematic cross-layer optimization is at the core of this work. With inspirations from the natural ecosystem, we are working on the role-based Composable Functional System for self-optimization that features proactive monitoring and control. By doing so step-by-step, we envisage reaching the goal of self-tuning autonomic network with high level of autonomy and efficiency, with minimum human management complexity and user intervention.", "paper_title": "Towards self-optimizing protocol stack for autonomic communication: Initial experience", "paper_id": "WOS:000237211100015"}
