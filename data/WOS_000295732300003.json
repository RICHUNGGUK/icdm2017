Given megawatt scale power budgets, increasing data center capability requires increasing computing hardware energy efficiency. To increase the data center's capability for work, the work done per Joule must increase. We pursue this efficiency even as the nature of data center applications evolves. Unlike traditional enterprise workloads, which are typically memory or I/O bound, big data computation and analytics exhibit greater compute intensity. This article examines the efficiency of mobile processors as a means for data center capability. In particular, we compare and contrast the performance and efficiency of the Microsoft Bing search engine executing on the mobile-class Atom processor and the server-class Xeon processor. Bing implements statistical machine learning to dynamically rank pages, producing sophisticated search results but also increasing computational intensity. While mobile processors are energy-efficient, they exact a price for that efficiency. The Atom is 5x more energy-efficient than the Xeon when comparing queries per Joule. However, search queries on Atom encounter higher latencies, different page results, and diminished robustness for complex queries. Despite these challenges, quality-of-service is maintained for most, common queries. Moreover, as different computational phases of the search engine encounter different bottlenecks, we describe implications for future architectural enhancements, application tuning, and system architectures. After optimizing the Atom server platform, a large share of power and cost go toward processor capability. With optimized Atoms, more servers can fit in a given data center power budget. For a data center with 15MW critical load, Atom-based servers increase capability by 3.2x for Bing.", "paper_title": "Mobile Processors for Energy-Efficient Web Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000295732300003"}
