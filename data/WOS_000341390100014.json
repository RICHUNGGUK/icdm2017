First, we present a hardware resource management scheme for sharing of loosely coupled accelerators and arbitration of multiple requesting cores. Second, we present a mechanism for accelerator virtualization. This allows multiple accelerators to efficiently compose a larger virtual accelerator out of multiple smaller accelerators, as well as to collaborate as multiple copies of a simple accelerator. All of this work is supported by a fully automated simulation tool-chain for both accelerator generation and management. We present the applicability of our approach to four different application domains: medical imaging, commercial, computer vision, and navigation. Our results demonstrate large performance improvements and energy savings over a software implementation. We also show additional improvements that result from enhanced load balancing and simplification of the communication between the core and the arbitration mechanism.", "paper_title": "Architecture Support for Domain-Specific Accelerator-Rich CMPs", "paper_id": "WOS:000341390100014"}
