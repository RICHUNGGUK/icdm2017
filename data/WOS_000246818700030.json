But the zigzag scanning is not always efficient for the directional spatial predictions in the intra coding of H.264/AVC. In this letter, we propose an adaptive scanning using the pixel similarity of the neighboring pixels to achieve enhanced intra coding performance. The proposed method reduces the bit rate approximately 2% compared with H.264/AVC without video quality degradation.", "paper_title": "Adaptive scanning using pixel similarity for H.264/AVC", "paper_id": "WOS:000246818700030"}
