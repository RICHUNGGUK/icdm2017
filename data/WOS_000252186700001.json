An automatic computer vision system for the detection and differential spraying of weeds in crop fields is discussed. The system involves an image segmentation approach and a decision maker. The first is designed as a sequence of image processing techniques and the second is a decision maker based on the Hebbian learning paradigm under the self-organising criterion. The combination of both and the use of the second are the main findings. The method is compared favourably with other existing strategies achieving a suitable performance.", "paper_title": "Design of a computer vision system for a differential spraying operation in precision agriculture using Hebbian learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000252186700001"}
