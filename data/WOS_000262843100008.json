Due to computational complexity, almost all published studies focus on using permutation schedules to deal with this problem. To explore the potential effectiveness of treating this argument using non-permutation schedules, three prominent types of metaheuristics-a simulated annealing, a genetic algorithm and a tabu search-are proposed and empirically evaluated. The experimental results demonstrate that in general, the improvement made by non-permutation schedules over permutation schedules for the due-date-based performance criteria were significantly better than that for the completion-time-based criteria. The results of this study will provide practitioners a guideline as to when to adopt a non-permutation schedule, which may exhibit better performance with additional computational efforts, (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
