Better performance at lower cost is and will always be the ultimate goal developing high-profit products successfully. In this paper, an approach of H analysis and synthesis is proposed to design the robust controller of the media advance system to extend its allowance uncertainty bound with respect to the specifications the positioning performance as well as constraints of control effort and input disturbance. This allowable maximum uncertainty con be served as an additional design factor for the Product designer in order to further reduce the total cost of the developing control system. The experimental results of the positioning control of inkjet printer validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach integrating design and control.", "paper_title": "H-infinity robust controller design of media advance systems with time domain specifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200005"}
