Adaptive segmentation can segment an image into different size of block with different level of significance; high degree bit nodes within an irregular low-density parity check (LDPC) code can provide unequal error protection (UEP) scheme. So the adaptive segmentation and irregular LDPC coding were combined together to provide JSCC. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can support robust image transmission in a very effective way with high visual quality.", "paper_title": "JSCC based on adaptive segmentation and irregular LDPC for image transmission over wireless channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100050"}
