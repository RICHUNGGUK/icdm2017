The jobs processing times are formulated by triangular fuzzy membership functions. The total fuzzy cost function is formulated as the weighted-sum of two bi-criteria fuzzy objectives: (a) Minimizing the fuzzy cycle time and the fuzzy smoothness index of the workload of the line. (b) Minimizing the fuzzy cycle time of the line and the fuzzy balance delay time of the workstations. A new multi-objective genetic algorithm is applied to solve the problem whose performance is studied and discussed over known test problems taken from the open literature.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective fuzzy assembly line balancing using genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000304160600020"}
