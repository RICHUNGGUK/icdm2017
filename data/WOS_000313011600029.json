Flow rates of phases (oil, gas and water) are most important parameter which is detected by MPFMs. Conventional MPFM data collecting is done in long periods; because of radioactive sources usage as detector and unmanned location due to wells far distance. In this paper, based on a real case of MPFM, a new method for oil rate prediction of wells base on Fuzzy logic, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Imperialist Competitive Algorithm is presented. Temperatures and pressures of lines have been set as input variable of network and oil flow rate as output. In this case a 1600 data set of 50 wells in one of the northern Persian Gulf oil fields of Iran were used to build a database. ICA-ANN can be used as a reliable alternative way without personal and environmental problems. The performance of the ICA-ANN model has also been compared with ANN model and Fuzzy model. The results prove the effectiveness, robustness and compatibility of the ICA-ANN model. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
