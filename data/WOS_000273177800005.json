Resource management for real-time traffic has widely been recognized as one of the most challenging problems for seamless access to vehicular networks. In this paper, a novel load balancing and congestion-avoidance routing mechanism over short communication range is proposed to satisfy the stringent QoS requirement of real-time traffic in vehicular ad hoc networks. Fuzzy logic systems are used to select the intermediate nodes on the routing path via inter-vehicle communications, and H-infinity technique is used to adjust the membership functions employed in the fuzzy logic systems to adapt to the volatile characteristics of the vehicular networks. Notably, a prediction of the remaining connection time among each vehicle and its neighbors is derived to assisting in the determination of the intermediate nodes on the routing path. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed schemes, in terms of several performance metrics such as packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, control overhead, throughputs, call blocking probability and call dropping probability.", "paper_title": "A Load Balancing and Congestion-Avoidance Routing Mechanism for Teal-Time Traffic over Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000273177800005"}
