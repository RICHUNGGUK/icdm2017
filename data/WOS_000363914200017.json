Nevertheless, deciphering the amount of information hidden in MD simulations and recognizing a significant minimal set of states to be used in virtual screening experiments can be quite complicated. Here we present an integrated MD FLAP (molecular dynamics-fingerprints for ligand and proteins) approach, comprising a pipeline of molecular dynamics, clustering and linear discriminant analysis, for enhancing accuracy and efficacy in VS campaigns. We first extracted a limited number of representative structures from tens of nanoseconds of MD trajectories by means of the k-medoids clustering algorithm as implemented in the BiKi Life Science Suite (http://www.bikitech.com [accessed July 21, 2015]). Then, instead of applying arbitrary selection criteria, that is, RMSD, pharmacophore properties, or enrichment performances, we allowed the linear discriminant analysis algorithm implemented in FLAP (http://www.moldiscovery.com [accessed July 21, 2015]) to automatically choose the best performing conformational states among medoids and X-ray structures. Retrospective virtual screenings confirmed that ensemble receptor protocols outperform single rigid receptor approaches, proved that computationally generated conformations comprise the same quantity/quality of information included in X-ray structures, and pointed to the MD FLAP approach as a valuable tool for improving VS performances.", "paper_title": "A Pipeline To Enhance Ligand Virtual Screening: Integrating Molecular Dynamics and Fingerprints for Ligand and Proteins", "paper_id": "WOS:000363914200017"}
