Here we present a new imaging module which is so small that it can fit through the instrument channels of conventional endoscopes and laryngoscopes. This imaging module includes a 1/18-in. CMOS image sensor and a small integrated lens with field of view of 120. A Blackfin DSP is used for real-time video processing, including lens distortion compensation, white balance, auto exposure and edge enhancement. The output video signals are displayed on a color LCD monitor. Two white LEDs provide lighting condition. The tip of the imaging module is packaged in a cylinder of diameter 2.5 mm, making many medical applications such as intubation and endoscopy less invasive. It can also be used in machine vision, security and surveillance where small size is important.", "paper_title": "Miniaturized CMOS Imaging Module with Real-time DSP Technology for Endoscope and Laryngoscope Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000265085600002"}
