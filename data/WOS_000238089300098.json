Some typical approaches and fundamental principles behind them are also analyzed and compared. Finally we introduce a rule-driven procedure modeling approach for large-scale virtual city. Comparing with the existing approaches, the rules adopted by the proposed approach and based on urban planning principles are easy to be understood and customized. Our experiments proved the system is effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "Survey and practice of 3D city modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300098"}
