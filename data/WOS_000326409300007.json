In the proposed encoding, two communication modules assign complementary codewords that change between two valid states without an open-wire fault. Under an open-wire fault, at each module, the codewords don't reach to one of the two valid states and remains as \"invalid\" states. The detection of the invalid states makes it possible to stop sending wrong codewords caused by an open-wire fault. The detectability of the open-wire fault based on the proposed encoding is proven for m-of-n codes. The proposed code used in the multiple-valued asynchronous global communication link is capable of detecting a single open-wire fault with 3.08-times higher coding efficiency compared with a conventional multiple-valued code used in a triple-modular redundancy (TMR) link that detects an open-wire fault under the same dynamic range of logical values.", "paper_title": "Open-Fault Resilient Multiple-Valued Codes for Reliable Asynchronous Global Communication Links", "paper_id": "WOS:000326409300007"}
