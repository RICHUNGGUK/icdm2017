Unlike the current approaches, our method takes into account the special features of engineering drawings and assesses the characteristics of primitives and noise such that adaptive procedures and parameters are applied for noise reduction. For this purpose, we first analyze and categorize various types of noise in engineering drawings. The algorithms for average linewidth assessment, noise distribution assessment and noise level assessment are then proposed. These three assessments are combined to describe the features of the noise of each individual engineering drawing. Finally, median filters and morphological filters, which can adjust their template size and structural element adaptively according to different noise level and type, are used for adaptive noise reduction. Preliminary experimental results show that our approach is effective for noise reduction of engineering drawings.", "paper_title": "Adaptive noise reduction for engineering drawings based on primitives and noise assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000013"}
