We show that counting the number of s-t paths in graphs where the number of s-v paths for any v is bounded by a polynomial can be done in FUL: the unambiguous log-space function class. Several new upper bounds follow from this including and We investigate the complexity of min-uniqueness-a central notion in studying the NL versus UL problem. In this regard we revisit the class OptL[log n] and introduce UOptL[log n], an unambiguous version of OptL[log n]. We investigate the relation between UOptL[log n] and other existing complexity classes. We consider the unambiguous hierarchies over UL and UOptL[log n]. We show that the hierarchy over UOptL[log n] collapses. This implies that thus collapsing the UL hierarchy. We show that the reachability problem over graphs embedded on 3 pages is complete for NL. This contrasts with the reachability problem over graphs embedded on 2 pages, which is log-space equivalent to the reachability problem in planar graphs and hence is in UL.", "paper_title": "On the power of unambiguity in log-space", "paper_id": "WOS:000310245900004"}
