Assign to each vertex v of G a list L(v) of colors by choosing each list uniformly at random from all k-subsets of a color set C of size sigma(n). Such a list assignment is called a random (k,C)-list assignment. In this paper, we are interested in determining the asymptotic probability (as n ->infinity) of the existence of a proper coloring phi of G, such that phi(v)is an element of L(v) for every vertex v of G. We show, for all fixed k and growing n, that if sigma(n)=omega(n1/k2), then the probability that G has such a proper coloring tends to 1 as n ->infinity. A similar result for complete graphs is also obtained: if sigma(n)>= 1. 223n and L is a random (3,C)-list assignment for the complete graph K-n on n vertices, then the probability that K-n has a proper coloring with colors from the random lists tends to 1 as n ->infinity.Copyright (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
