For a given integer h >= 0, a subset F of edges in a connected graph G is an h-extra edge-cut if G - F is disconnected and every component has more than h vertices. The h-extra edge-connectivity lambda((h))(G) of G is defined as the minimum cardinality over all h-extra edge-cuts of G. A graph G, if lambda((h))(G) exists, is super-lambda((h)) if every minimum h-extra edge-cut of G isolates at least one connected subgraph of order h + 1. The persistence rho((h))(G) of a super-lambda((h)) graph G is the maximum integer m for which G - F is still super-lambda((h)) for any set F subset of E(G) with vertical bar F vertical bar <= m. Hong et al. (2012) [12] showed that min{lambda((1))(G)-delta(G)-1,delta(G)-1} <= rho((0))(G)<=delta(G)-1, where delta(G) is the minimum vertex-degree of G. This paper shows that min{lambda((2))(G)-xi(G) - 1,delta(G) - 1} <= rho((1))(G) <= delta(G) - 1, where xi(G) is the minimum edge-degree of G. In particular, for a k-regular super-lambda((1)) graph G, rho((1))(G) = k - 1 if lambda((2))(G) does not exist or G is super-lambda((2)) and triangle-free, from which the exact values of rho((1))(G) are determined for some well-known networks.
