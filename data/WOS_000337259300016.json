The proposed approach overcomes the disadvantages of the current content-based image retrieval algorithms that suffer from the semantic gap. First, we present a new multidimensional information space's vector angle cosine algorithm of high-dimensional geometry, then, we provide a detailed description of our images retrieval method including proposal of an overlapping image block method and definition of a similarity degree between images on the non-dimensional information subspaces. Finally, experimental results show the higher retrieval efficiency of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Content-based image retrieval using high-dimensional information geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000337259300016"}
