The objective of this work is to acquire the steering metrics of real cars during double-lane change tests and indicate the key parameters of the vehicle that determine these steering metrics. Harnessing the reported findings, driving simulator users can swiftly adjust key parameters to achieve a realistic on-center response. We instrumented and tested five modern passenger cars, and used a vehicle dynamics model to extract the metrics for multiple vehicular parameterizations (steering ratio, power assist gain, etc.) and test speeds. Sensitivity analysis showed that steering sensitivity was mainly influenced by the components that determine the steering ratio whereas the steering torque gradient was also affected by power assist steering settings. An example study indicated how vehicular parameterization could be adapted to achieve realistic on-center vehicle steering response and steering feedback in a driving simulator.
