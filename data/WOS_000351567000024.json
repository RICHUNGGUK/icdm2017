As DTW has quadratic time complexity, the time taken for similarity search is the bottleneck for virtually all time series data mining algorithms. In this paper, we present a parallel approach for DTW on a heterogeneous platform with a graphics processing unit (GPU). In order to exploit fine-grained data-level parallelism, we propose a specific parallel decomposition in DTW. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization technique called diamond tiling to improve the utilization of threads. Results show that our approach substantially reduces computational time.", "paper_title": "Parallelization of Dynamic Time Warping on a Heterogeneous Platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567000024"}
