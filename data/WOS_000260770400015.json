It is shown that the new time/frequency hopping sequences have at most one hit in their autocorrelation functions and at most two hits in their crosscorrelation functions except for a special case, and their family size is much larger than the conventional quadratic hopping sequences. The percentage of full collisions for the new quadratic hopping sequences is discussed. In addition, the average number of hits for the new quadratic hopping sequences, quadratic congruence sequences, extended quadratic congruence sequences and the general linear hopping sequences are also derived.", "paper_title": "On a general class of quadratic hopping sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000260770400015"}
