It is expected that the elegant coexistence of IPv4 and IPv6 is the key point of IPv6 transition. To solve the transition problem, we propose a mesh unicast framework and a multicast framework in this paper. We describe two reference models for the mesh unicast framework, and put forward two potential solutions for the multicast framework. A Linux-based prototype is implemented for IPv4 over IPv6 scenario and a test bed is deployed with 8 nodes on CERNET2. The deployment demonstrates the advantages of the framework.", "paper_title": "IETF softwire unicast and multicast framework for IPv6 transition", "paper_id": "WOS:000260122000005"}
