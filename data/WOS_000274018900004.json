Firstly, the node resilience in a network is evaluated by its redundant resources, distributed suppliers and reachable deliveries. Then, an index of the total resilience of logistic network is calculated with the weighted sum of the node resilience. Based on the evaluation approach of resilience, the reasonable structure of the logistic networks is analyzed. A model is then studied to optimize the allocation of resources with connections, distribution centers or warehouses. Our approach has been used to study the resilience of logistic networks for aircraft maintenance and service and to guarantee the security and service quality of aeronautical systems. To monitor the operation of the logistic networks and enhance resilience, the architecture of a synthesized aircraft maintenance information management system and service logistic network is designed and being developed, which is called Resilience Information Management System for Aircraft Service (RIMAS). The research results have been provided to the decision makers of the aviation management sector in the Chu Chiang Delta of China. Good comments have been achieved, which shows that the approach has potential for application in practice.", "paper_title": "Evaluation and Analysis of Logistic Network Resilience With Application to Aircraft Servicing", "paper_id": "WOS:000274018900004"}
