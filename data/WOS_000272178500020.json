The fluid behavior is described as the motion of particles involved by the SPH method. In the SPH projection method, instead of changing the fluid density, incompressibility is enforced by the pressure Poisson equation derived from pressure projection, which enable to use larger time steps. In spite of the additional pressure Poisson equation, the computational cost for the design sensitivity is not expensive since the factorized system matrix of pressure Poisson equation can be utilized. Aforementioned computational efficiency is very beneficial for the design sensitivity computation required for every time step in explicit time integration and updated Lagrangian schemes, for which an update scheme of design velocity field is developed using the velocity sensitivity. Through demonstrative numerical examples, the developed DSA method turns out to be efficient and shows excellent agreement with finite differencing.", "paper_title": "Efficient design sensitivity analysis of incompressible fluids using SPH projection method", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500020"}
