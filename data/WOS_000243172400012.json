This correspondence proposes a reduction technique based on rough sets theory capable of minimizing the case memory by analyzing the contribution of each case feature. Inspired by the application of the minimum description length principle, the method uses the granularity of the original data to compute the relevance of each attribute. The rough feature weighting and selection method is applied as a preprocessing step prior to the generation of a fuzzy rule system, which is employed in the revision phase of the proposed CBR system. Experiments using real oceanographic data show that the rough sets reduction method maintains the accuracy of the employed fuzzy rules, while reducing the computational effort needed in it generation and increasing the explanatory strength of the fuzzy rules.", "paper_title": "Reducing the memory size of a fuzzy case-based reasoning system applying rough set techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000243172400012"}
