The proposed method is mainly composed of three phases: quadrangle frame generation, point and curve networks planning, and surface patches reconstruction. In the first phase, the original triangle mesh is reduced and converted into a quadrangle mesh, the edges of which serve as the frame of the surfaces. In the second phase, the boundary data of the surfaces are prepared. These include a network of serial points, frame curves and surface normals which are also expressed as curves. In the final phase, surface initialization, harmonization mapping and surface warping are presented to yield the desired surfaces. The main advantage of the proposed method is that it can relax the pre-processing of a scanned triangle mesh, and hence, increase the efficiency and quality of the surface reconstruction. Several examples of various types of air bags are presented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
