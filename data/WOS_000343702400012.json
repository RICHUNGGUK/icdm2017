Based on the used types of features, 3D object recognition methods can broadly be divided into two categories-global or local feature based methods. Intensive research has been done on local surface feature based methods as they are more robust to occlusion and clutter which are frequently present in a real-world scene. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of existing local surface feature based 3D object recognition methods. These methods generally comprise three phases: 3D keypoint detection, local surface feature description, and surface matching. This paper covers an extensive literature survey of each phase of the process. It also enlists a number of popular and contemporary databases together with their relevant attributes.", "paper_title": "3D Object Recognition in Cluttered Scenes with Local Surface Features: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000343702400012"}
