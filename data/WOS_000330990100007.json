Any successful design of this enhanced oil recovery process will necessitate a good understanding of uncertainty. Thus, it is essential to have the ability to quantify this uncertainty in an efficient manner. Monte Carlo simulation is the traditional uncertainty quantification approach that is used for quantifying parametric uncertainty. However, the convergence of Monte Carlo simulation is relatively low, requiring a large number of realizations to converge. This study proposes the use of the probabilistic collocation method in parametric uncertainty quantification for surfactant-polymer flooding using four synthetic reservoir models. Four sources of uncertainty were considered: the chemical flood residual oil saturation, surfactant and polymer adsorption, and the polymer viscosity multiplier. The output parameter approximated is the recovery factor. The output metrics were the input-output model response relationship, the probability density function, and the first two moments. These were compared with the results obtained from Monte Carlo simulation over a large number of realizations. Two methods for solving for the coefficients of the output parameter polynomial chaos expansion are compared: Gaussian quadrature and linear regression. The linear regression approach used two types of sampling: full-tensor product nodes and Chebyshev-derived nodes. In general, the probabilistic collocation method was applied successfully to quantify the uncertainty in the recovery factor. Applying the method using the Gaussian quadrature produced more accurate results compared with using the linear regression with full-tensor product nodes. Applying the method using the linear regression with Chebyshev derived sampling also performed relatively well. Possible enhancements to improve the performance of the probabilistic collocation method were discussed. These enhancements include improved sparse sampling, approximation order-independent sampling, and using arbitrary random input distribution that could be more representative of reality.", "paper_title": "Robust quantification of parametric uncertainty for surfactant-polymer flooding", "paper_id": "WOS:000330990100007"}
