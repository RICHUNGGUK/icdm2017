However, all the previous studies on community search do not consider the influence of a community. In this paper, we introduce a novel community model called k-influential community based on the concept of k-core, which can capture the influence of a community. Based on the new community model, we propose a linear-time online search algorithm to find the top-r k-influential communities in a network. To further speed up the influential community search algorithm, we devise a linear-space index structure which supports efficient search of the top-r k-influential communities in optimal time. We also propose an efficient algorithm to maintain the index when the network is frequently updated. We conduct extensive experiments on 7 real-world large networks, and the results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Influential Community Search in Large Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000362280300006"}
