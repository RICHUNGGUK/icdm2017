It has been successfully employed in many applications in specific areas of machine vision, pattern recognition, and image processing. Although the mean shift algorithm has been used in many applications, a rigorous proof of its convergence is still missing in the literature. In this paper we address the convergence of the mean shift algorithm in the one-dimensional space and prove that the sequence generated by the mean shift algorithm is a monotone and convergent sequence.
