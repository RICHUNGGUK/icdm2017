This model uses the number of infected hosts in a domain as a factor in the worms' propagation. However, there are difficulties in explaining the characteristics of new Internet worms because they have several considerable new features: the denial of service by network saturation, the utilization of a faster scanning strategy, a smaller size in the worm's propagation packet, and to cause maximum damage before human-mediated responses are possible. Therefore, more effective factors are required instead of the number of infected hosts. In this paper, the network bandwidth usage rate is found to be an effective factor that explains the propagations of the new Internet worms with the random scanning strategy. The analysis and simulation results are presented using this factor. The simulation results show that the scan rate is more sensitive than the propagation packet for detecting worms' propagations.", "paper_title": "The Analysis of Random Propagating Worms using Network Bandwidth", "paper_id": "WOS:000279378300007"}
