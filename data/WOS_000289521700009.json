More generally, can we quickly compute the blue hull without looking at the whole polytope? This paper considers several instances of hereditary computation and provides new results for them. In particular, we resolve an eight-year old open problem by showing how to split a convex polytope in linear expected time.", "paper_title": "Computing Hereditary Convex Structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000289521700009"}
