Our analysis builds on previously obtained process limit theorems, and requires the interchange of steady state and heavy traffic limits, which are established by a coupling argument. The limit theorems yield explicit approximations of the steady state queue length and response time distribution in heavy traffic, of which the quality is supported by simulation experiments.", "paper_title": "Steady state approximations of limited processor sharing queues in heavy traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000261344600004"}
