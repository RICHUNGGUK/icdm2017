Most prominent among these inorganic compounds is bicarbonate, which originates in considerable quantities from atmospheric CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. Because microalgae cells act as a sink of anthropogenic CO2, understanding phytoplankton's carbon sequestration is a crucial link between environmental chemistry and ecology. The impact of ambient chemical and physical parameters onto phytoplankton and their chemical composition have been investigated in some detail. However, speciesspecies interactions, namely their nutrient competition, require in-depth investigations of the impact of competing species on the dynamics of biomass production as well as the amount of biomass produced. Experimental studies presented here have been based on two marine microalgae species, that is, Nannochloropsis oculata and Dunaliella parva. For investigating dynamic aspects of biomass production, the species growth rates have been measured, under otherwise identical conditions, in single-species cultures as well as in competition situations. Depending on the species and nutrient type the cells compete for, growth rates in species mixtures were found to change from 50% to 200% of the corresponding single-species cultures. Competition impacts regarding the maximum cell concentration in a culture were even more drastic as the cell production was reduced, in some cases, down to 11% of the corresponding single-cell culture's growth rate. Furthermore, a slight but significant shift in cell size distributions toward smaller cell sizes was found in competition situations. This study demonstrates that biomass production is also driven by the cells' biological environment. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. This study investigates impacts of competition among microalgae species for inorganic nutrients, namely bicarbonate, nitrate, and ammonium. It was found that nutrient competition has a considerable influence on the microalgae culture's growth rates, maximum sustainable cell concentration, and cell size distributions. This is of relevance for improving the understanding of the microalgae's role in balancing the atmosphere CO2 concentration by means of sequestering of inorganic nutrients, namely bicarbonate, into biomass.", "paper_title": "Impacts of nutrient competition on microalgae biomass production", "paper_id": "WOS:000335520900013"}
