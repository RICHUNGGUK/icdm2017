We use multigrid V-Cycle procedure to build our multiscale multigrid algorithm, which is similar to the full multigrid method (FMG). The multigrid computation yields fourth order accurate solution on both the fine grid and the coarse grid. A sixth order accurate coarse grid solution is computed by using the Richardson extrapolation technique. Then we apply our operator based interpolation scheme to compute sixth order accurate solution on the fine grid. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the solution accuracy and the computational efficiency of our new method, compared to Sun-Zhang's sixth order Richardson extrapolation compact (REC) discretization strategy using Alternating Direction Implicit (ADI) method and the standard fourth order compact difference (FOC) scheme using a multigrid method.
