VHIPM, which is based on the inverted pendulum mode (IPM), can significantly reduce the zero moment point (ZMP) error by adjusting the height in the inverted pendulum. We show the relationship between VHIPM and other popular trajectory generation methods, and compare the ZMP errors in walking when trajectories are generated by various methods including VHIPM. We also investigate the sensitivity of the ZMP error in VHIPM to the step length, walking period and mass distribution of a robot. The simulation results show that VHIPM significantly reduces the ZMP errors compared to other methods under various circumstances. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
