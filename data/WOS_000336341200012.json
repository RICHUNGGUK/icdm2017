The problem is sometimes reduced to the simplest case of recognizing matching pairs, often structured to allow for metric constraints. However, visual recognition is broader than just pair-matching: what we learn and how we learn it has important implications for effective algorithms. In this review paper, we reconsider the assumption of recognition as a pair-matching test, and introduce a new formal definition that captures the broader context of the problem. Through a meta-analysis and an experimental assessment of the top algorithms on popular data sets, we gain a sense of how often metric properties are violated by recognition algorithms. By studying these violations, useful insights come to light: we make the case for local distances and systems that leverage outside information to solve the general recognition problem.
