In this paper, we investigate the problem of medium access control (MAC) in mmWave networks. We develop a frame-based scheduling directional MAC protocol, termed FDMAC, to achieve the goal of leveraging collision-free concurrent transmissions to fully exploit spatial reuse in mmWave networks. The high efficiency of FDMAC is achieved by amortizing the scheduling overhead over multiple concurrent, back-to-back transmissions in a row. The core of FDMAC is a graph coloring-based scheduling algorithm, termed greedy coloring (GC) algorithm, that can compute near-optimal schedules with respect to the total transmission time with low complexity. FDMAC is analyzed and evaluated with simulations.", "paper_title": "Frame-Based Medium Access Control for 5G Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365182800008"}
