The sound textural content of a sample of training texture images is first encoded by a compressed LBP histogram and then the local patterns of the input training textures are learned, in a multiscale framework, through a series of HMMs according to the LBP codes which belong to each bin of this compressed LBP histogram. The hidden states of these HMMs at different scales are used as a texture descriptor that can model the normal behavior of the local texture units inside the training images. The optimal number of these HMMs (models) is determined in an unsupervised manner as a model selection problem. Finally, at the testing stage, the local patterns of the input test image are first predicted by the trained HMMs and a prediction error is calculated for each pixel position in order to obtain a defect map at each scale. The detection results are then merged by an inter-scale post fusion method for novelty detection. The proposed method is tested with a database of grayscale ceramic the images.", "paper_title": "Random texture defect detection using 1-D Hidden Markov Models based on Local Binary Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000257930400014"}
