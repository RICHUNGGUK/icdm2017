Recently, several data mining techniques have been used as a way to solve the problem of detecting construction materials. These studies have applied single classifiers to detect construction materials and distinguish them from the background by using color as a feature. Recent studies suggest that combining multiple classifiers (into what is called a heterogeneous ensemble classifier) would show better performance than using a single classifier. However, the performance of ensemble classifiers in construction material detection is not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the performance of six single classifiers and potential ensemble classifiers on three data sets: one each for concrete, steel, and wood. A heterogeneous voting-based ensemble classifier was created by selecting base classifiers which are diverse and accurate; their prediction probabilities for each target class were averaged to yield a final decision for that class. In comparison with the single classifiers, the ensemble classifiers performed better in the three data sets overall. This suggests that it is better to use an ensemble classifier to enhance the detection of construction materials in images acquired on a construction site. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
