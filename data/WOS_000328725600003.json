In order to estimate the unknown parameters of PEMFC model faster and obtain more accurate solutions, in this paper, an improved multi-strategy adaptive differential evolution (DE) is presented for the parameter optimization problems of PEMFC model. The approach is referred to as rank-MADE, for short. In rank-MADE, the multiple mutation strategies of DE are adaptively selected to avoid choosing a suitable strategy for a specific problem by trial-and-error method. Furthermore, the ranking-based vector selection technique is employed in different mutation strategies to accelerate the process of parameter optimization of PEMFC model. In order to verify the performance of rank-MADE, it is applied to estimate the parameters of the Ballard Mark V FC, the SR-12 Modular PEM Generator, the BCS 500-W stack, the Temasek FC, and the WNS-FC model. In addition, rank-MADE is compared with other advanced DE variants and other evolutionary algorithms (EAs). Experimental results show that rank-MADE is able to provide higher quality of solutions, faster convergence speed, and higher success rate compared with other DE variants. Additionally, the V-I characteristics obtained by rank-MADE agree well with the experimental data in all cases. Therefore, rank-MADE can be an effective alternative in the field of other complex parameter optimization problems of fuel cell models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
