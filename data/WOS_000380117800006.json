Suppose Alice sends classical information to Bob using a quantum channel. Suppose Bob is allowed to use only weak measurements, what would be the channel capacity? We formulate weak measurement theory in these terms and discuss the above question.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM GAUSSIAN CHANNELS WITH WEAK MEASUREMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000380117800006"}
