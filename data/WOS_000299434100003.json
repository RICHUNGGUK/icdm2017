Two inertial measurement units and four force-sensitive resistors were used to obtain knee angle and foot pressure patterns, respectively. Fuzzy logic is used to address the complexity in distinguishing gait phases based on discrete events. A novel application of the seven-dimensional vector analysis method to estimate the amount of abnormalities detected was also investigated based on the two gait parameters. Experiments were carried out to validate the application of the two proposed algorithms to provide accurate feedback in rehabilitation. The algorithm responses were tested for two cases, normal and abnormal gait. The large amount of data required for reliable gait-phase detection necessitate the utilisation of computer methods to store and manage the data. Therefore, a database management system and an interactive graphical user interface were developed for the utilisation of the overall system in a clinical environment.", "paper_title": "A computational method for reliable gait event detection and abnormality detection for feedback in rehabilitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299434100003"}
