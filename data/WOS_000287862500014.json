It is based on a discrete-time recurrent high-order neural network trained with an extended Kalman-filter based algorithm. This brief includes the stability proof based on the Lyapunov approach. The applicability of the proposed scheme is illustrated by real-time implementation for a three phase induction motor.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Recurrent Neural State Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000287862500014"}
