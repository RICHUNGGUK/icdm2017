As the dimension of the adhesive itself is usually much smaller than that of neighboring components, and still may include internal structures, the interconnection is treated as an interface zone with an underlying microstructure. The micropolar theory is used in the vicinity of the interface to model the transfer of the couple stress across the interface, and a micropolar continuum is used to model the interface across which a displacement and a rotational jump are regularized on the basis of the adopted discontinuous kinematics. The resulting elastic interface model picks up the influence of the micro-structure on the basis of an intuitive definition of the stiffness coefficients. The paper is concluded by some numerical examples focusing on a typical interconnect. A parametric study is carried out to reveal the micropolar effect with respect to the size of the micro-structure. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
