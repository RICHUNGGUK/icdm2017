SRFPCM incorporates the local spatial information and gray level information in a novel fuzzy way, aiming at guaranteeing noise insensitiveness and image detail preservation. Inspired by the idea of a robust fuzzy local information c-means clustering algorithm, this new algorithm can overcome the disadvantages of rough fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm and enhance the clustering performance at the same time. SRFPCM is employed to cluster the difference image into two clusters (changed and unchanged regions) and get the change map. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Image change detection based on an improved rough fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000348040100003"}
