To solve the nonconvex optimization problem in our model, an efficient algorithm is proposed using the constrained concave-convex procedure. Experiments with artificial data and real data demonstrate that our method is more effective than some popular methods in selecting relevant features and improving classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Mixed-norm linear support vector machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000326889800036"}
