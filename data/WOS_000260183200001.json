However, not all pairing-friendly elliptic curves have this property. In this paper, we generalize the Ate pairing and find a series of the variations of the Ate pairing. We show that the shortest Miller loop of the variations of the Ate pairing can possibly be as small as r(1/phi(k)) on some special pairing-friendly curves with large values of Frobenius trace, and hence speed up the pairing computation significantly.", "paper_title": "A note on the Ate pairing", "paper_id": "WOS:000260183200001"}
