This is a two-phase iterative algorithm where two types of messages are interchanged and updated in each iteration. The group-shuffled or layered decoding schemes applied to the SP algorithm speed up its convergence by modifying its schedule, so they yield a reduction in the number of iterations required to achieve a given performance. However, the two-phase processing is still maintained. In this paper a modification of the group-shuffled scheme suitable for high-rate LDPC codes is proposed. The modification allows the overlapping of the two-phase computation, achieving a convergence speed up close to that of the group-shuffled scheme with higher throughput. Besides, high throughput architectures are presented for the modified algorithm. As an example, the proposed architecture has been implemented for the 2048-bit LDPC code of the IEEE 802.3an standard and it was synthesized in a 90 nm CMOS process achieving a throughput of 22.40 Gbps at 14 iterations with a clock frequency of 306 MHz and a total area of 10.5 mm(2). Furthermore, the decoder performs within 0.5 dB of the floating-point 100 iterations sum-product algorithm at a PER of 10(-5).", "paper_title": "Modified Shuffled Based Architecture for High-Throughput Decoding of LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000303886100001"}
