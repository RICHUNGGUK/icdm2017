Considering the high number and the layered structure of the evolved node B (eNodeB, eNB) in the initial rollout phase, the assigning of PCI for cells would be quite complex. The PCI self-distributing problem is mapped to the well-known minimum spanning tree (MST) problem in order to optimize the PCI reuse distance and decrease the multiplexing interference. The correlation property of PCI is analyzed and taken into consideration in the assigning phase. Moreover, a suboptimal algorithm (SADPCI) is presented as it performs approximately to ADPCI but the computational complexity is lower. To demonstrate the proposal validity, performances of ADPCI and SADPCI are evaluated. Simulation results illustrate that these schemes can achieve significantly higher performance even under the condition of severe PCI deficiency.", "paper_title": "Automatic Distributing Schemes of Physical Cell Identity for Self-Organizing Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310894100001"}
