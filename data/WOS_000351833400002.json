We concentrate on the Lagrangian step which is also sufficient for Eulerian discretization using Lagrange+Remap. Starting from the conservative equation of the angular momentum, we show that a standard Riemann solver (a nodal one in our case) can easily be extended to update the new variable. This new variable allows to reconstruct all solid displacements in a cell, and is analogous to a partial Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretization. We detail the coupling with a second-order Muscl extension. All numerical tests show the important enhancement of accuracy for rotation problems, and the reduction of mesh imprint for implosion problems. The generalization to axi-symmetric case is detailed.
