Thus, ways are needed to integrate collaborative processes into such business processes. The implication for design methodologies is the need for synergies that integrate collaborative semantics with process metamodels in order to create software applications to assist people to collaborate. This paper describes a semantic model of collaboration, known as the LiveNet metamodel, and two standard process metamodels, SPEM (OMG) and the process part of the methodology metamodel ISO/IEC 24744. The paper suggests synergies between the collaborative and process metamodels and their potential convergence. The analysis carried out in the paper has revealed a number of metaclasses that could be valuably shared between metamodels to integrate process and collaborative semantics. The LiveNet collaborative metamodel has been incorporated into running software so that the theory built up here is substantiated and shown to be useful.", "paper_title": "Comparing collaborative and process semantics for cooperative information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000256502500001"}
