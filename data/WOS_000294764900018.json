For the union operation, the number of states is exactly m + n. The lower bound is established for languages over a one-letter alphabet. The key point of the argument is the following number-theoretic lemma: for all m, n >= 2 with m, n not equal 6 (and with finitely many other exceptions), there exist partitions m = p(1) + ... + p(k) and n = q(1) + ... + q(l), where all numbers p(1), ..., p(k), q(1), ..., q(l) >= 2 are powers of pairwise distinct primes. For completeness, an analogous statement about partitions of any two numbers m, n is not an element of {4, 6} (with a fewmore exceptions) into sums of pairwise distinct primes is established as well.", "paper_title": "State Complexity of Union and Intersection for Two-Way Nondeterministic Finite Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000294764900018"}
