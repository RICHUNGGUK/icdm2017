This study investigated some factors that influence the perceived fit of the recommendations a system provides and user perceptions of the preference-elicitation process. The findings indicate that the relevance, transparency, duration, and required effort of the elicitation process are important cues for value, which in turn influences the user's enjoyment of the process and the perceived fit of the recommendation with the user's preferences.", "paper_title": "Persuasion in recommender systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243049700005"}
