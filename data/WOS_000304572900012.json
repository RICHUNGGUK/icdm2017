In this paper, we focus on fusion rules for the enforcement decisions and adopt the combined fusion rule using the AND rule and the OR rule. We first derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decentralized supervisor under the combined fusion rule for a given partition of the set of forcible events. We next study how to find a suitable partition.", "paper_title": "Decentralized Supervisory Control of Timed Discrete Event Systems Using a Partition of the Forcible Event Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000304572900012"}
