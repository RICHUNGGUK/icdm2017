We empirically demonstrate, using the 74XXX and ISCAS85 suites of benchmark combinatorial circuits, that Safari achieves several orders-of-magnitude speedup over two well-known deterministic algorithms, CDA* and HA*, for multiple-fault diagnoses; further, Safari can compute a range of multiple-fault diagnoses that CDA* and HA* cannot. We also prove that Safari is optimal for a range of propositional fault models, such as the widely-used weak-fault models (models with ignorance of abnormal behavior). We discuss the optimality of Safari in a class of strong-fault circuit models with stuck-at failure modes. By modeling the algorithm itself as a Markov chain, we provide exact bounds on the minimality of the diagnosis computed. Safari also displays strong anytime behavior, and will return a diagnosis after any non-trivial inference time.", "paper_title": "Approximate Model-Based Diagnosis Using Greedy Stochastic Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000280365600004"}
