Meta-learning, a powerful approach for algorithm selection has so far been demonstrated only on univariate time-series forecasting. Multivariate time-series forecasting is known to have better performance in load forecasting. In this paper we propose a meta-learning system for multivariate time-series forecasting as a general framework for load forecasting model selection. We show that a meta-learning system built on 65 load forecasting tasks returns lower forecasting error than 10 well-known forecasting algorithms on 4 load forecasting tasks for a recurrent real-life simulation. We introduce new metafeatures of fickleness, traversity, granularity and highest ACF. The meta-learning framework is parallelized, component-based and easily extendable. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
