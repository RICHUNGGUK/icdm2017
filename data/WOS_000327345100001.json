When a vehicle is in an emergency situation, a safety-related message is transmitted to the neighboring vehicles and infrastructures. Vehicles and infrastructures exchange periodic messages on vehicle position, traffic information, and so forth to provide various services. When the traffic load is very high, the emergency message cannot be delivered immediately. To overcome this situation, a priority-based transmission scheme is considered to guarantee the transmission of the emergency message. In this paper, the performance of vehicular communication networks is analyzed in two perspectives. Firstly, an analytical Markov chain model for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) ad hoc communication networks is proposed for broadcasting messages with priority based on the IEEE 802.11p wireless access for vehicular environments (WAVE) standard. Secondly, an analytic queuing model for vehicular communication networks is proposed to evaluate the network performance to deal with safety and nonsafety messages.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis for Priority-Based Broadcast in Vehicular Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327345100001"}
