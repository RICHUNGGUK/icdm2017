Images are usually represented as bags of feature vectors, and the categorization problem is studied in the Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) framework. In this paper, we propose a novel learning technique which transforms the MIL problem into a standard supervised learning problem by defining a feature vector for each image bag. Specifically, the feature vectors of the image bags are grouped into clusters and each cluster is given a label. Using these labels, each instance of an image bag can be replaced by a corresponding label to obtain a bag of cluster labels. Data mining can then be employed to uncover common label patterns for each image category. These label patterns are converted into bags of feature vectors; and they are used to transform each image bag in the data set into a feature vector such that each vector element is the distance of the image bag to a distinct pattern bag. With this new image representation, standard supervised learning algorithms can be applied to classify the images into the pre-defined categories. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed technique in categorization accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "An automatic feature generation approach to multiple instance learning and its applications to image databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000275800200008"}
