MLMC can seek a better classification hyperplane than LMC and SVMs through integrating the within-class variance into the objective function of LMC. Also, the kernel functions in MLMC are not required to satisfy the Mercer's condition. Compared with SVMs, MLMC can use more kinds of kernel functions. Experiments on the FERET face database confirm the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A modified large margin classifier in hidden space for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800021"}
