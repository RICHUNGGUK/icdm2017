In this paper, we propose an automatic system for grading HCC biopsy images. In preprocessing, we use a dual morphological grayscale reconstruction method to remove noise and accentuate nuclear shapes. A marker-controlled watershed transform is applied to obtain the initial contours of nuclei and a snake model is used to segment the shapes of nuclei smoothly and precisely. Fourteen features are then extracted based on six types of characteristics for HCC classification. Finally, we propose a SVM-based decision-graph classifier to classify HCC biopsy images. Experimental results show that 94.54% of classification accuracy can be achieved by using our SVM-based decision-graph classifier while 90.07% and 92.88% of classification accuracy can be achieved by using k-NN and SVM classifiers, respectively.
