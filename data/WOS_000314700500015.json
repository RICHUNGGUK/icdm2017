Although many studies have been done, most of them are for 2-dimensional and non-degenerate cases. Finschi and Fukuda (Discrete Comput Geom 27:117-136, 2002) published the first database of oriented matroids including degenerate (i.e., non-uniform) ones and of higher ranks. In this paper, we investigate algorithmic ways to classify them in terms of realizability, although the underlying decision problem of realizability checking is NP-hard. As an application, we determine all possible combinatorial types (including degenerate ones) of 3-dimensional configurations of 8 points, 2-dimensional configurations of 9 points, and 5-dimensional configurations of 9 points. We also determine all possible combinatorial types of 5-polytopes with nine vertices.", "paper_title": "Complete Enumeration of Small Realizable Oriented Matroids", "paper_id": "WOS:000314700500015"}
