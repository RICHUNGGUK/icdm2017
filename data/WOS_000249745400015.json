Sufficient conditions are obtained for asymptotic stability of both homogeneous-flow system and heterogeneous-flow system with or without feedback delay by using indirect Lyapunov and Lyapunov-Razumikhin method. Our study reveals the relationship between the AIMD parameters and the average window size of competing AIMD flows. Consequently, the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)-friendly condition is derived. Numerical results with Matlab and simulation results with NS-2 are given to validate the theorems and analytical results. The analysis and the stability conditions derived can be used as a guideline to set up the AIMD/RED system parameters in order to maintain network stability and integrity, and to enhance system performance.
