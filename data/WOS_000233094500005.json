In order to transfer tacit knowledge from individuals to a knowledge repository, organizations usually deploy community-based discussion forums. Typically, discussions among participants are organized into reply-replied structures, and reply semantic relationships among these discussion ;documents exist either explicitly or implicitly Such relationships, once discovered or annotated in the knowledge repository, can facilitate subsequent knowledge navigation by providing a novel and more semantic mechanism and can support other organizational knowledge management activities (e.g., construction of expert networks). In this study, we propose a preliminary taxonomy of reply semantic relationships for discussion documents organized in reply-replied structures and develop a Semantic Enrichment between Knowledge-sharing documents (SEEK) technique that automatically annotates semantic relationships between reply pairs of documents. Specifically, we propose and evaluate six different feature models that combine keyword features, part-of-speech statistic features, and/or text statistic features.", "paper_title": "Semantic enrichment in knowledge repositories: Annotating semantic relationships between discussion documents", "paper_id": "WOS:000233094500005"}
