Thanks to the universal approximation capabilities, radial basis function neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate the unknown ocean surface ship dynamics. A stable adaptive NN tracking controller is first designed using backstepping and Lyapunov synthesis. Partial persistent excitation (PE) condition of some internal signals in the closed-loop system is satisfied during tracking control to a recurrent reference trajectory. Under the PE condition, the proposed adaptive NN controller is shown to be capable of accurate identification/learning of the uncertain ship dynamics in the stable control process. Subsequently, a novel NN learning control method which effectively utilizes the learned knowledge without re-adapting to the unknown ship dynamics is proposed to achieve closed-loop stability and improved control performance. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Identification and Learning Control of Ocean Surface Ship Using Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310388400008"}
