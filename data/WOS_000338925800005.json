In response, many bioinformatics tools are explored to manage and extract valuable information from such large datasets. Here, we firstly review the methodological strategies and introduce some well- established programs in management and analyses of SNP data. Then, possible challenges and development in this field are discussed. It hopes that these applied tools will greatly assist in exploring susceptibility for complex diseases.", "paper_title": "Bioinformatics tools for genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms management and analyses: a review", "paper_id": "WOS:000338925800005"}
