In 2004, Yang and Li introduced an access control scheme based on one-way hash function for using finite number of keys and a few public hash functions to solve the dynamic access control problem such as adding, deleting or changing the relationship between nodes. This paper, however, found that users can overstep his authority to access unauthorized information in Yang and Li's scheme, which violates their security claims. We further proposed a robust dynamic access control scheme to eliminate such kind of the attack.", "paper_title": "A Robust Dynamic Access Control Scheme in a User Hierarchy Based on One-Way Hash Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000334146400006"}
