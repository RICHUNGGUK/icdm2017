Simulation-based training offers a valuable alternative for mastering these skills, but requires a faithful replication of complex guidewire behaviour inside the vasculature. This paper presents the integration of real flexural modulus (FM) measurements into our guidewire model that mimics the flexibility of standard guidewires. The variation of FM along the length of each wire was determined for seven commonly used guidewires using a three-point bending test for the main body and a two-point bending test for the flexible end. Guidewire FM values were then attributed to seven different models, each formed by a series of particles connected by links of variable FM and replicating the flexible end shape. The FM integration was done through a trial and error process matching real FM to virtual bending coefficient. This mass-spring representation captures the required range of behaviour and enables accurate deformation within virtual vasculature.", "paper_title": "Simulation of endovascular guidewire behaviour and experimental validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291277300004"}
