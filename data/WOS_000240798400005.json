The test is bulk amorphous silica, primarily in the small-strain regime. We also examine some practical issues that arise when the technique is used to model mechanical failure. For context, we present results of classical molecular dynamics simulations of fracture mechanisms of amorphous silica.", "paper_title": "Implementation of consistent embedding for a larger system - Amorphous silica", "paper_id": "WOS:000240798400005"}
