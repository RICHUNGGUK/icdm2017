We propose a strategy for capturing the intruder in the popular interconnection topology, the star network. According to the proposed strategy, a team of collaborative software agents are responsible for capturing a hostile intruder (e.g., a virus). These agents asynchronously move along the network links, and the intruder has the capability of escaping arbitrarily fast.", "paper_title": "Detecting Threats in Star Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000263762400004"}
