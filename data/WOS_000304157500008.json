In contrast to previous parallel scalar multiplication methods, our method can be implemented into scalable parallel computers. The optimal time complexity is k point doublings (D) plus log k point additions (A), denoted as kD+(logk)A, where k is the bit length of the scalar. If our method is applied to Koblitz curves, the optimal time complexity can be reduced to (logk)A. Furthermore, previous simple side-channel-protected scalar multiplication methods can be integrated into our method for resisting against simple side-channel attacks.
