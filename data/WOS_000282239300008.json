It is found that the distribution is unsatisfactory if N (the modulus) is not chosen properly. Based on this finding, we present an attack on the public-key algorithm based on Chebyshev polynomials over Z(N). Then, we modify the original algorithm to make it suitable for practical purpose. Its security under some existing models is also discussed in detail.", "paper_title": "On the Security of Public-Key Algorithms Based on Chebyshev Polynomials over the Finite Field Z(N)", "paper_id": "WOS:000282239300008"}
