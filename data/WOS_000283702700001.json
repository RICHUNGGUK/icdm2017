Denote T(S) = (T(s(1)), T(s(2)), ..., T(s(m)), ...). In this paper, we first present counter examples to show that the main result in [A.M. Youssef, G. Gong, On linear complexity of sequences over GF(2(n)), Theoret. Comput. Sc., 352 (2006) 288-292] is not correct in general since Lemma 3 in that paper is incorrect. Then we determine the minimal polynomial of T(S) if the canonical factorization of the minimal polynomial of S without multiple roots is known and thus present the solution to the main problem which was considered in the above paper but incorrectly solved. Additionally, as a special case, we determine the minimal polynomial of T(S) if the minimal polynomial of S is primitive. Finally, we give an upper bound on the linear complexity of T(S) when T exhausts all possible linear transformations of GF(q(n)) over GF(q). This bound is tight in some cases. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
