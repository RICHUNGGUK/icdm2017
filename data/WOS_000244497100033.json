Furthermore, using the identities on one-dimensional Kloosterman sums found by Tor Helleseth and Victor Zinoviev, Hollmann and Xiang, etc., we present some new identities on Kloosterman sums in this note. Meanwhile, we also provide a new approach to producing new Kloosterman sums' identities.", "paper_title": "Some new identities on Kloosterman sums", "paper_id": "WOS:000244497100033"}
