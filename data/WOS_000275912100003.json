In the case of 2-D digital images (i.e. images defined on a\"currency sign(2)) such procedures are usually based on the notion of simple point. In contrast to the situation in a\"currency sign (n) , na parts per thousand yen3, it was proved in the 80s that the exclusive use of simple points in a\"currency sign(2) was indeed sufficient to develop thinning procedures providing an output that is minimal with respect to the topological characteristics of the object. Based on the recently introduced notion of minimal simple set (generalising the notion of simple point), we establish new properties related to topology-preserving thinning in 2-D spaces which extend, in particular, this classical result to cubical complexes in 2-D pseudomanifolds.", "paper_title": "Topological Properties of Thinning in 2-D Pseudomanifolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000275912100003"}
