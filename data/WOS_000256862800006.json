In the proposed algorithm, multiple interfering noise sources are regarded as one virtually integrated noise source in each subband, and the spectrum of the integrated noise is then estimated using its virtual direction of arrival. To do this, we suggest a direction finder for the integrated noise using only two microphones that performs well even in speech active periods. The noise spectrum estimate is further improved by integrating a single-channel noise estimation approach and then subtracted from that of the noisy signal, finally enhancing the desired target signal. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated and compared with the traditional algorithms in various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the traditional algorithms in various conditions in terms of objective and subjective speech quality measures.", "paper_title": "A two-microphone noise reduction method in highly non-stationary multiple-noise-source environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862800006"}
