Two nodes communicate with each other if their distance is less than some given threshold value. When F admits a density f which is strictly positive on [0,1], we give conditions on f under which the property of graph connectivity for the induced geometric random graph obeys a very strong zero-one law when the transmission range is scaled appropriately with n large. The very strong critical threshold is identified. This is done by applying a version of the method of first and second moments.", "paper_title": "One-dimensional geometric random graphs with nonvanishing densities II: a very strong zero-one law for connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000308727400005"}
