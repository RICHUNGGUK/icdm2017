In the proposed approach, the frequency BW is divided into some sub-bands. Then, the narrowband antennas are designed for the consecutive frequency sub-bands, and the antennas are connected together by a proposed active circuit, so that their frequency BWs combined. The proposed active circuit may be used to connect as many as antenna needed for the design. An active microstrip antenna is designed for the frequency BW of 4-10 GHz with a gain better than 5 dB by the proposed method. Fabrication and measurement results show the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
