In this paper, we propose an improved energy function to challenge this problem by consistently reducing the Euclidean distance between the inspected centroid of the real boundary and the estimated one of the snake. Experimental work shows the proposed framework outperforms the classical GVF algorithm in different circumstances. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
