Through analysis and experiments, it has been shown to be better than SVM in favor of reduction of time complexity. However, the major disadvantages of GEPSVM lie in two aspects: (1) some complex XOR problems cannot be effectively classified; (2) it may fail to get a stable solution due to the matrix singularity occurring. By defining a new principle, we propose an original algorithm, called multi-weight vector support vector machines (MVSVM). The proposed method not only keeps the superior characteristics of GEPSVM, but also has its additional edges: (1) it performs well on complex XOR datasets; (2) instead of generalized eigenvalue problems in GEPSVM, MVSVM solves two standard eigenvalue problems to avoid the matrix singularity of GEPSVM; (3) it has comparable or better generalization ability compared to SVM and GEPSVM; (4) it is the fastest among three algorithms. Experiments tried out on artificial and public datasets also indicate the effectiveness of MVSVM. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
