To this end, the equivalent integral form of the original problem is obtained then by using its lower and upper functions the solutions in the parametric forms are determined. The proposed method is illustrated with numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A new method for solving fuzzy linear differential equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000290324300004"}
