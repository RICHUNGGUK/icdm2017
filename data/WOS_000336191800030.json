The Score-based Physarum Learner first initializes a fully connected Physarum-Maze with random conductances. In each Physarum Solver iteration, the source and sink nodes are changed randomly, and the conductances are updated. Connections exceeding a predefined conductance threshold are considered as Bayesian Network edges, and the score of the connected nodes are examined in both directions. A positive or negative feedback is given to the edge conductance based on the calculated scores. Due to randomness in selecting connections for evaluation, an ensemble of Score-based Physarum Learner is used to build the final Bayesian Network structure. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
