A complete debug flow is presented that considers practical considerations such as area, on-chip non-determinism and signal propagation delay. This flow, along with a low-overhead breakpoint circuit, allows for state-accurate breakpointing capabilities without the need to monitor the entire state of the chip. The flow and associated hardware was tested using a hardware prototype, which consists of an OpenRISC processor instrumented with the debug hardware connected to a PC running the formal verification algorithms. Traces hundreds of cycles long were obtained using the methodology presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "Formal-Analysis-Based Trace Computation for Post-Silicon Debug", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500007"}
