We assume that the lifetime of products follows a Weibull distribution. Two levels of constant stress higher than the use condition are used. The sample size and the acceptability constant that satisfy given levels of producer's risk and consumer's risk are found. In particular, the optimal stress level and the allocation proportion are obtained by minimizing the generalized asymptotic variance of the maximum likelihood estimators of the model parameters. Furthermore, for validation purposes, a Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to assess the true probability of acceptance for the derived sampling plans.", "paper_title": "Accelerated life test sampling plans for the Weibull distribution under Type I progressive interval censoring with random removals", "paper_id": "WOS:000280055600006"}
