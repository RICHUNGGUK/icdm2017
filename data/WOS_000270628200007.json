Following the approach of J. Butcher, E. Hairer and G. Warmer, we develop a new kind of tree set to derive order conditions for the extended Runge-Kutta-Nystrom-type methods. The numerical stability and phase properties of the new methods are analyzed. Numerical experiments are accompanied to show the applicability and efficiency of our new methods in comparison with some well-known high quality methods proposed in the scientific literature.
