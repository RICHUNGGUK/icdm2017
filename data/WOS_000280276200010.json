We focus on the case where there are multiple disjoint polyominoes (of different colours) that are hv-convex, i.e., any intersection with a horizontal or vertical line is contiguous. We show that reconstruction of such polyominoes is polynomial if the number of colours is constant, but NP-hard for an unbounded number of colours. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
