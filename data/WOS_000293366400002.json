If a job uses the resource, its processing time may decrease. However, at any time the resource can only be used by at most one job. The objective is to minimize the makespan. For the offline version, we present an FPTAS. For the online version where jobs arrive over list, we propose an online algorithm with competitive ratio of 1.781, and show a lower bound of 1.686 for any online algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
