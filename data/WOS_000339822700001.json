The model arises from the properties of the receptive field linear dynamics of orientation and speed-selective cells in the visual cortex, that can be embedded in the definition of a geometry where the connectivity between points is driven by the contact structure of a 5D manifold. Then, we compute the stochastic kernels that are the approximations of two Fokker Planck operators associated to the geometry, and implement them as facilitation patterns within a neural population activity model, in order to reproduce some psychophysiological findings about the perception of contours in motion and trajectories of points found in the literature.", "paper_title": "A Cortical-Inspired Geometry for Contour Perception and Motion Integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000339822700001"}
