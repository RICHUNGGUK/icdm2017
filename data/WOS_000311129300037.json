The theorems on existence and global exponential stability of anti-periodic mild solution are established. Moreover, theoretical results further show that diffusion terms contribute to existence and stabilization of anti-periodic mild solution. Finally, an illustrative example and numerical simulations are given to show effectiveness of results in this paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
