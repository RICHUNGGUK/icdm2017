Current and emerging developments in mobile computing integrated with developments in pervasive agent technologies such as mobile agent will have a radical impact on future health-care delivery systems. In this paper we present the design and architecture of a mobile multi-agent based information platform -MADIP-to support the intensive and distributed nature of wide-area (e.g., national or metropolitan) monitoring environment. To exemplify the proposed methodology, an e-health monitoring environment was built on top of MADIP as an illustration. Aglets Software Development Kit (ASDK) was adopted for prototyping, concept-proofing, and evaluation. By integrating the proposed platform with light-weight, portable monitoring devices (e.g., portable vital sign monitor), continuous long-term health monitoring can be performed without interfering with the patients' everyday activities and without restricting their mobility. The optimal utilization of medical resources can be also achieved. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
