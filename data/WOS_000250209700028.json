The stability analysis of the proposed scheme leads to the introduction of the sign matrix of the flux jacobian. It appears that this formulation is equivalent to the VFRoe scheme introduced in the homogeneous case and has a natural extension here to non-homogeneous systems. Comparative numerical experiments for the Shallow Water and Euler equations with source terms, and a model,problem of two-phase flow (Ransom faucet) are presented to validate the scheme. The numerical results present a convergence stagnation phenomenon for certain forms of the source term, notably when it is singular. Convergence stagnation as been also shown in the past for other numerical schemes. This issue is addressed in a specific section where an explanation is given with the help of a linear model equation, and a cure is demonstrated.) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
