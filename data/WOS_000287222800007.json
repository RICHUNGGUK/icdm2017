Design/methodology/approach - The electric field integral equation and its magnetic counterpart (MFIE) are discretized via special shape functions built numerically through the MLS procedure. This approach is applied to the particular problem concerning the scattering of a TM plane wave by an infinite conductor cylinder. An error norm is established in order to verify the quality of the obtained results. Findings - Results show that the discretization process which employs MLS shape functions presents very good precision and fast convergence to the solution, when compared to results provided by another numerical method, the method of moments. Originality/value - MLS shape functions occur in meshless methods intended to solve problems based on differential formulation. This paper shows that these shape functions can also be applied successfully to problems coming from an integral formulation.", "paper_title": "An integral meshless-based approach in electromagnetic scattering", "paper_id": "WOS:000287222800007"}
