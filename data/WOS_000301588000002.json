However, in a biological system, there can be several synapses for each pair of connected neurons. In this study, inspired by this biological observation, synapses in a spiking neural P system are endowed with integer weight denoting the number of synapses for each pair of connected neurons. With the price of weight on synapses, quite small universal spiking neural P systems can be constructed. Specifically, a universal spiking neural P system with standard rules and weight having 38 neurons is produced as device of computing functions; as generator of sets of numbers, we find a universal system with standard rules and weight having 36 neurons.", "paper_title": "Spiking Neural P Systems with Weighted Synapses", "paper_id": "WOS:000301588000002"}
