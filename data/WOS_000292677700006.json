Based on the vector field and the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) control method, the small unmanned aerial vehicle can realize precise trajectory following control under wind disturbance. Through vector filed method, system constructs the corresponding vector fields for the planed research trajectory, generates the desired course inputs for the small aerial vehicle. Furthermore, the LQR control method is proposed and utilized as the inner control loop to realize the precise attitude control. Lyapunov stability arguments are used to demonstrate the asymptotic decay of trajectory following errors in the presence of wind disturbances. Experimental flight results are given to show that the small unmanned aerial vehicle can get the high trajectory following performance in the polar environment.
