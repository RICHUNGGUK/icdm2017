In this study, we propose a novel objective quality assessment method for 3D meshes based on curvature information; according to characteristics of the human visual system (HVS), two new components including visual masking and saturation effect are designed for the proposed method. Besides, inspired by the fact that the HVS is sensitive to structural information, we compute the structure distortion of 3D meshes. We test the performance of the proposed method on three publicly available databases of 3D mesh quality evaluation. We rotate among these databases for parameter determination to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed scheme. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can predict consistent results in terms of correlation to the subjective scores across the databases.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Quality Assessment for 3D Triangle Mesh Based on Curvature", "paper_id": "WOS:000365315500006"}
