From the viewpoint of stored energy, a new regulation method to conserve and share the stored energy can be found. The energy stored in inductors and capacitors is transferred to loads so that the load keeps the energy dissipation constant. Though numerical simulation, the method is validated for a parallel converter system.", "paper_title": "Regulation of Parallel Converters with Respect to Stored Energy and Passivity Characteristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125700016"}
