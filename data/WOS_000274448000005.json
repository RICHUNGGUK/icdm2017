Investigation on the convergence of the models demonstrated that models with higher thermal gradient showed fluctuation with higher amplitude Further. more, phase change phenomenon and accumulation of the liquid phase in the sharp corners of the micro heat pipe were modelled. The effective thermal conductivity, pressure and velocity field for both phases along the length of the micro heat pipe were calculated and compared to the literature. In addition, the overloading conditions were simulated and an effective length was defined for the micro heat pipe. Consequently, the influence of liquid filling ratio on the effective length of micro heat pipe was investigated. Finally, a three-dimensional network of microchannels with two-phase How was simulated where the circulation of the two phases was captured. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
