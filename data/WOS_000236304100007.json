The Internet demands the design of flexible and adaptable multimedia services so as to offer better quality presentations to the user. In this context, agent technology is emerging as a promising solution to provide flexible and adaptable services in distributed environments. The authors propose a subsystem called Protocol Engineering and Technology unit - Agent-based Subsystem for MultimediA Communications (PET-ASMAC) at the client side, which is an intelligent multimedia communication assistant to facilitate multimedia presentation to Internet users. The PET-ASMAC comprises a set of static and mobile agents, which perform certain autonomous tasks (QoS routing, resource allocation, synchronisation and playout) that satisfy the full-service requirements of an application, and coordinate with each other to provide smooth and continuous multimedia presentations. PET-ASMAC is simulated in several network scenarios to evaluate its effectiveness. The subsystem considers presentations from a single server to a client. However, it can be easily extended for multipoint-to-point communication. The results are encouraging and the observed benefits of the agent technology in multimedia communications are flexibility, adaptability, customisability, maintainability, re-usability and support to component-based software engineering.", "paper_title": "Agent-based subsystem for multimedia communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236304100007"}
