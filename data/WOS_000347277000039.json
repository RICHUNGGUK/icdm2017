The classification tasks include: PE present vs. absent, acute PE vs. others, central PE vs. others, and subsegmental PE vs. others. Statistical learning algorithms were trained with features extracted using the NLP tool and gold standard labels obtained via chart review from two radiologists. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for the four tasks were 0.998, 0.945, 0.987, and 0.986, respectively. We compared our classifiers with bag-of-words Naive Bayes classifiers, a standard text mining technology, which gave AUC 0.942, 0.765, 0.766, and 0.712, respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
