The bound states and the corresponding normalized eigenfunctions of the Woods-Saxon potential are computed by using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The results are consistent with the ones obtained in the case of generalized Woods-Saxon potential. The solutions of the Schrodinger equation by using the same approximation are also studied as a special case, and obtained the consistent results with the ones obtained before.", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATE l-STATE SOLUTIONS OF A SPIN-0 PARTICLE FOR WOODS-SAXON POTENTIAL", "paper_id": "WOS:000266126300012"}
