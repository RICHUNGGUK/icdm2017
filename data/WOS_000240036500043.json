By changing the connections of coarse grain Carry-Save Adders (CSAs), the datapath provides a high performance for both RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). In addition, we introduce another reconfigurability for the flip-flops in order to make the best of hardware resources. The results of FPGA implementation show that better performance is obtained for ECC on the same hardware platform.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable modular arithmetic logic unit for high-performance Public-Key cryptosystems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500043"}
