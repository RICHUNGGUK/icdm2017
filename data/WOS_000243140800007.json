Two greedy strategies are shown to be at best O(Delta(2)) and (4 Delta + 2 Delta root 4+1/Delta + 1)-competitive respectively, where Delta is the ratio between the longest and shortest length of order. After that we mainly present an improved strategy, named WAL, which takes advantage of the knowledge of Delta and is proved to be (3 Delta + o(Delta))-competitive for Delta>9. Furthermore, two lower bounds for deterministic strategies, (1.366 Delta + 0.366) and 6.33, are given for the cases of nonuniform and uniform length respectively.", "paper_title": "On-line production order scheduling with preemption penalties", "paper_id": "WOS:000243140800007"}
