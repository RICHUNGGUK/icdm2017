Much of the work on wireless sensor networks with integrated control has been conducted in academic research. To promote commercially-available wireless sensing and control networks, valve control hardware and software were developed to be compatible with a commercial wireless sensor node. The work was conducted in collaboration with a wireless network vendor such that the research results and the product itself could ultimately be available to growers. The valve actuation system included development of custom node firmware, actuator hardware and firmware, an internet gateway (base computer) with control, and communication and web interface software. Single hop radio range (line-of-sight) for the mesh network reached 1610 m. Thirty-four valve actuators were installed in the field to control 54 valves and monitor 6 water meters. Solar panel energy production by a node exceeded the likely energy demand for valve control. Analysis of the packet success rate was not completed, but missing data were not apparent. Valve control hardware withstood 6000 short-circuited and 11,000 normal actuations during stress tests. The valve control network was estimated to have a payback period of about 3.5-4.5 years, though some vineyard growers claimed to see payback in less than 3 years. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
