This paper provides an example where different micromeritic properties of an API were obtained by crystallization under different conditions, resulting in different tableting behavior. While the API form purity was maintained during the crystallization process change, significant changes were incurred in the surface geometry, porosity and surface area of the API. The batches consisting of particles with greater surface irregularity and porosity gave tablets of higher mechanical strength.", "paper_title": "Evacuated Tube Collectors - Influence of Thermophysical Properties in Numerical Simulations by CFD", "paper_id": "WOS:000349781600019"}
