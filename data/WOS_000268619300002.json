The fuzzy logic system is used to approximate the unknown system function and the AFSMC algorithm is designed by used of sliding mode control techniques. Based on the Lyapunov theory, the proportional integral control law is designed to eliminate the chattering action of the control signal. The simplicity of the proposed scheme facilitates its implementation and the overall control scheme guarantees the global asymptotic, stability in the Lyapunov sense if all the signals involved are uniformly bounded. Simulation studies have shown that the proposed controller shows superior tracking performance. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
