The deployed mobile sensor agents are capable of making point observation in the natural environment. There are two approaches to modelling the pollutant distribution proposed in this article. One is a model-based approach where the sensor agents sample environmental pollutant, build up an environmental pollutant model and move towards the region where high density pollutant exists. The modelling technique used is a distributed support vector regression and the motion control technique used is a distributed locational optimising algorithm (centroidal Voronoi tessellation). The other is a model-free approach where the sensor agents sample environmental pollutant and directly move towards the region where high density pollutant exists without building up a model. The motion control technique used is a bacteria chemotaxis behaviour. By combining this behaviour with a flocking behaviour, it is possible to form a spatial distribution matched to the underlying pollutant distribution. Both approaches are simulated and tested with a group of real robots.", "paper_title": "Mobile sensor networks for modelling environmental pollutant distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000292760000006"}
