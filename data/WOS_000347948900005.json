Conventionally, this issue has been addressed in the batch scenario where the whole data set is given at once, and the change detection must be done in a retrospective way. This paper addresses this issue in a sequential scenario where multivariate data are sequentially input and the detection must be done in a sequential fashion. We propose a new method for sequential tracking of variable dependencies. In it we employ a Bayesian network as a representation of variable dependencies. The key ideas of our method are: (1) we extend the theory of dynamic model selection, which has been developed in the batch-learning scenario, into the sequential setting, and apply it to our issue, (2) we conduct the change detection sequentially using dynamic programming per a window where we employ the Hoeffding's bound to automatically determine the window size. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed method is able to perform change detection more efficiently than a conventional batch method. Further, we give a new framework of an application of variable dependency change detection, which we call Ad Impact Relation analysis (AIR). In it, we detect the time point when a commercial message advertisement has given an impact on the market and effectively visualize the impact through network changes. We employ real data sets to demonstrate the validity of AIR.", "paper_title": "Sequential network change detection with its applications to ad impact relation analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000347948900005"}
