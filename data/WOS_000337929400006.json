Such an approach leads to a correction formula to the total energy of a charged periodic system and allows a comparison between the electronic band structure of the ionized defect to its corresponding neutral one. The correction formula can be related to the potential alignment method and Makov-Payne correction widely adopted in charged periodic systems. The new approach suggests both an alternative interpretation and improvements to the popular Makov-Payne and potential alignment scheme. P-doped Si, which has a shallow donor level, and an isolated vacancy in crystalline Si, which has a deep defect level within the Si energy gap, are chosen as prototypical systems to demonstrate our method.
