However, such approaches require some a priori information about the eigenvalues of the covariance matrices. The behavior of the EM algorithm near a degenerated solution is investigated. The obtained theoretical results would suggest a new kind of constraint based on the dissimilarity between two consecutive updates of the eigenvalues of each covariance matrix. The performances of such a \"dynamic\" constraint are evaluated on the grounds of some numerical experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
