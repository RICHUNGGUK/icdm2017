But service level of contents provider has not reached the expected level of customers in the context of CRM yet. In this paper, we develop a structural equation model for customer satisfaction index (CSI) to measure the level of digital contents service quality reflecting the aspects of contents quality, service quality and provider quality. Our proposed model is applied to various types of contents such as on-line games, mobile contents, internet VOD services and e-music. The results give us the controllable feedback information to effectively improve customer satisfaction for each kind of digital content industry. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
