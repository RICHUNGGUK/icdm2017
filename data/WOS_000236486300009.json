There are two main problems related to the training of separating systems in this case: the requirement of entropy estimation and the risk of local convergence. In order to overcome both difficulties, we propose a training paradigm based on entropy estimation through order statistics and on an evolutionary-based learning algorithm. Simulation results indicate the validity of the novel approach.", "paper_title": "Blind source separation of post-nonlinear mixtures using evolutionary computation and order statistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300009"}
