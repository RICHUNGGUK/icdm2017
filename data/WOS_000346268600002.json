Initially, large increases in accuracy are obtained using the enrichment functions without stabilisation terms. Then, optimal coefficients for the stabilisation parameter of the unresolved scale model are calibrated using a goal-oriented model-constrained optimisation technique, resulting in further improvements. As both the determination of the enrichment functions and the optimisation of the coefficients requires high-accuracy reference data, a scaling procedure is introduced to allow their use over range of conditions. Numerical experiments confirm that the scaling procedure is effective.
