The GPCR family includes the dopamine receptor subtype D2 (D2DR), but unfortunately-as is true of most GPCRs-no experimental structures are available for these receptors. In this publication, we present the molecular model of D2DR based on the previously published crystal structure of the dopamine D3 receptor (D3DR). A molecular modeling study using homology modeling and docking simulation provided a rational explanation for the behavior of the arylpiperazine ligand. The observed binding modes and receptor-ligand interactions provided us with fresh clues about how to optimize selectivity for D2DR receptors.", "paper_title": "Determination of key receptor-ligand interactions of dopaminergic arylpiperazines and the dopamine D2 receptor homology model", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600027"}
