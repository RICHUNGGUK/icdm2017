A Lagrangian formulation established on pressure, as a potential equation, is employed. In this method, the approximate solution is expressed by a linear combination of exponential basis functions (EBFs), with complex-valued exponents, satisfying the governing equation. Constant coefficients of the solution series are evaluated through point collocation on the domain boundaries via a complex discrete transformation technique. The numerical solution is performed in a time marching approach using an implicit algorithm. In each time step, the governing equation is solved at the beginning and the end of the step, with the aid of an intermediate geometry. The use of EBFs helps to find boundary velocities with high accuracy leading to a precise geometry updating. The developed Lagrangian meshless algorithm is applied to variety of linear and nonlinear benchmark problems. Non-linear sloshing fluids in rigid rectangular two-dimensional basins are particularly addressed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
