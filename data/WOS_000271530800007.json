The paper describes a method to combine small nonlinear, invertible machines with group linear Cellular Automaton (CA) to obtain large non-linear machines with predictable cyclic structures. We show with large number of experimental results that through proper choice of the rules of the linear CA we may obtain highly non-linear invertible mappings without affecting the group properties of the linear CA. We also study a class of non-linear CA, with OR-gates to realize their transition functions. In order to predict the group properties of the CA we develop a method using the graphical representation of its transition matrix. We prove that the graph of the transition matrix of all OR-NCA (OR based Non-linear CA) which forms a group does not have certain forbidden patterns. The proposed prediction of the group properties of the OR-NCA is much faster than an exhaustive simulation of the machine.", "paper_title": "Group Properties of Non-linear Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000271530800007"}
