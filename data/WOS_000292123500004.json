In recent years many efforts have been done to solve NP-complete and time consuming problems with the help of DNA computing. In this paper, we use sticker model (one of the most well-known models of DNA computing) to present three DNA algorithms for solving three different NP-complete graph-based problems for the first time: domatic partition, kernel and induced path. Also we have simulated these algorithms to show their correctness. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
