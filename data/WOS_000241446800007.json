This paper presents a Semantic Wiki, a Wiki extended to include the ideas of Semantic Web. The proposed Semantic Wild uses a simple Wiki syntax to write labeled links which represent RDF triples. By enabling the writing of labeled links, Semantic Wild may provide an easy-to-use and flexible environment for an integrated management of content and metadata, so that Semantic Wiki may be used as a lightweight knowledge management system.", "paper_title": "Semantic Wiki as a lightweight knowledge management system", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800007"}
