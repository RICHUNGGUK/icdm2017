A review is provided of accuracy and comprehensibility measures, and a novel metric is introduced that allows one to measure the justifiability of classification models. Furthermore, taxonomy of domain constraints is introduced, and an overview of the existing approaches to impose constraints and include domain knowledge in data mining techniques is presented. Finally, justifiability metric is applied to a credit scoring and customer churn prediction case. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
