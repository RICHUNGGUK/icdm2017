The Locus Lookup tool enables researchers to de. ne windows of genomic sequence likely to contain loci of interest where only genetic or physical mapping associations are reported. Using the Locus Lookup tool, researchers will be able to locate specific genes more efficiently that will ultimately help them develop a better maize plant. With the availability of the well-documented source code, the tool can be easily adapted to other biological systems.", "paper_title": "The Locus Lookup tool at MaizeGDB: identification of genomic regions in maize by integrating sequence information with physical and genetic maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000274342800029"}
