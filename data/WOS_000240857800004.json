Numerical procedures and techniques are developed to compute velocities and accelerations from GPS-determined positions. A method based on the correlation analysis of raw gravity reading and vertical acceleration of aircraft is used to correct for gravimeter times. A method and a computer program for crossover adjustment of gravity values along survey lines are developed. This method allows flexible selection of a fixed survey line to overcome the rank defect problem. A computer program is developed to compute gravity anomalies while applying corrections of gravimeter position and filtering. Upward and downward continuations of gravity anomalies are performed using Fast Fourier Transform. Using observed airborne gravity data along a survey line and simulated data in Taiwan, all the programs have been validated and produced reliable results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
