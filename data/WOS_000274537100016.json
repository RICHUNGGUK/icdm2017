We consider two cases of second-order digital filters: distinct real poles and multiple real poles. The proposed approach reduces the constrained optimization problem to an un-constrained optimization problem by appropriate variable transformation. We can express the L-2-sensitivity by a simple linear combination of exponential functions and formulate the L-2-sensitivity minimization problem by a simple polynomial equation. As a result, L-2-sensitivity is expressed in closed form, and its minimization subject to L-2-scaling constraints is achieved without iterative calculations.", "paper_title": "Closed Form Solutions to L-2-Sensitivity Minimization Subject to L-2-Scaling Constraints for Second-Order State-Space Digital Filters with Real Poles", "paper_id": "WOS:000274537100016"}
