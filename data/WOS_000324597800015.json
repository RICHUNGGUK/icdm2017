Through only considering the selected superpixels, the interference of cluttered background on the object can be alleviated effectively and thus the classification performance is significantly enhanced. In particular, for an image, HPS first selects the discriminative superpixels for the characteristics of certain class, which can together match the object template of this class well. In addition, these superpixels compose a class-specific matching region. Through performing such superpixel selection for several most probable classes, respectively, HPS generates multiple class-specific matching regions for a single image. Then, HPS merges these matching regions into an integral object region through exploiting their pixel-level intersection information. Finally, such object region instead of the original image is used for image classification. An appealing advantage of HPS is the ability to alleviate the interference of cluttered background yet not require the object to be segmented out accurately. We evaluate the proposed HPS on four challenging image classification benchmark datasets: Oxford-IIIT PET 37, Caltech-UCSD Birds 200, Caltech 101, and PASCAL VOC 2011. The experimental results consistently show that the proposed HPS can remarkably improve the classification performance.", "paper_title": "Image Classification via Object-Aware Holistic Superpixel Selection", "paper_id": "WOS:000324597800015"}
