On the other hand, simpler ad-hoc definitions tailored to special scenarios have often been flawed. Motivated by this unsatisfactory situation, we give an information-theoretic security definition of secure function evaluation which is very simple yet provably equivalent to the standard, simulation-based definitions.", "paper_title": "Information-theoretic conditions for two-party secure function evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000238574200032"}
