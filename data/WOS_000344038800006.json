Framed around the issue of universal access to Internet, computers, and technology (ICT) for digital natives, this paper demonstrates patterns of library location related to race and income. This research then raises important questions about library location, and, in turn, how this impacts access to ICT for young people in the community.", "paper_title": "Social Contexts of New Media Literacy: Mapping Libraries", "paper_id": "WOS:000344038800006"}
