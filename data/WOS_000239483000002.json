Therefore, in this paper a dynamic threshold learning algorithm (DTLA) is proposed as the substitute for the conventional LSE algorithm. This method uses multiple dynamic threshold parameters to gradually remove some training patterns that can be classified correctly by current Radial Basis Function (RBF) network out of the training set during training process, which changes the unbalanced training problem into a balanced training problem and improves the classification rate of the small group. Moreover, we use the dynamical threshold learning algorithm to classify the remote sensing images, when the unbalanced level of classes is high, a good effect is obtained.", "paper_title": "Classifying unbalanced pattern groups by training neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000002"}
