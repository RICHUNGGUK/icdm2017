By employing a new and tighter integral inequality and constructing an appropriate type of Lyapunov functional, delay-dependent stability criteria are derived for the control problem. Because neither any model transformation nor free weighting matrices are employed in our theoretical derivation, the developed stability criteria significantly improve and simplify the existing stability conditions. Also, the maximum allowable upper delay bound and controller feedback gains can be obtained simultaneously from the developed approach by solving a constrained convex optimization problem. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "New Approach on Robust Delay-Dependent H-infinity Control for Uncertain T-S Fuzzy Systems With Interval Time-Varying Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000268527100012"}
