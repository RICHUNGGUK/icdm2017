The system outage probability, diversity gain and coding gain are then investigated, and closed-form expressions are presented. Simulation results verify the accuracy of our derived outage probability expressions and highlight the performance of the proposed relay selection policy.", "paper_title": "Traffic-knowledge-based relay selection for asymmetric two-way AF relaying networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400021"}
