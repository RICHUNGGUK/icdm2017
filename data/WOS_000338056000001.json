Geometric dilution of precision (GDOP) can be used to measure the positioning precision of the localization system. In order to select the optimal node combination, traditional algorithms based on GDOP need to spend much time on calculating every possible combination of nodes. This paper proposes GDOP assisted nodes selection (GANS) algorithm to calculate GDOP value of the current geometric distribution. Sensor node's contribution to the overall GDOP value is adopted as the evaluation criteria. The nodes whose contribution value is greater than the threshold will be selected. The anchor nodes subset, which participates in the positioning, will be real-time determined. Simulation results show that the GANS algorithm can effectively reduce the energy consumption of the system, while the positioning accuracy has no obvious loss. Meanwhile, computational complexity is also obviously decreased.", "paper_title": "Target Positioning with GDOP Assisted Nodes Selection Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000338056000001"}
