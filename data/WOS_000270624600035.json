Dimension reduction is achieved by assuming that the data have been generated by a linear factor model with latent variables modeled as Gaussian mixtures. Variable selection is performed by shrinking the factor loadings though a penalized likelihood method with an L1 penalty. A maximum likelihood estimation procedure via the EM algorithm is developed and a modified BIC criterion to select the penalization parameter is illustrated. The effectiveness of the proposed model is explored in a Monte Carlo simulation study and in a real example. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
