The proposed method employs (i) a coarse-to-fine strategy using multi-scale volume pyramids for correspondence search and (ii) high-accuracy POC-based local block matching for finding dense volume correspondence with subvoxel displacement accuracy. This paper also proposes its GPU implementation to achieve fast and practical computation of volume registration. Experimental evaluation shows that the proposed approach exhibits higher accuracy and lower computational cost compared with conventional method. We also demonstrate that the GPU implementation of the proposed method can align two volume data in several seconds, which is suitable for practical use in the image-guided radiation therapy.", "paper_title": "Fast and Robust 3D Correspondence Matching and Its Application to Volume Registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000318054200007"}
