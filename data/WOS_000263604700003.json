In order to address this problem, a novel algorithm, which yields efficient 3-D representations in the rate distortion sense, is proposed. The algorithm utilizes two views of a scene to build a mesh-based representation incrementally, via adding new vertices, while minimizing a distortion measure. The experimental results indicate that, in scenes that can be approximated by planes, the proposed algorithm is superior to the dense depth map and, in some practical situations, to the block motion vector-based representations in the rate-distortion sense.", "paper_title": "Rate-Distortion Efficient Piecewise Planar 3-D Scene Representation From 2-D Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000263604700003"}
