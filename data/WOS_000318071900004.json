A Markov-chain Monte Carlo method is used to obtain the Bayes estimates of the parameters. An intensive simulation experiment is conducted to study the performance of the proposed Bayesian estimation procedure. Discussions and suggestions are provided based on the simulation results. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the Bayesian estimation procedure developed here and some concluding remarks are provided.", "paper_title": "Bayes estimation of MoranDownton bivariate exponential distribution based on censored samples", "paper_id": "WOS:000318071900004"}
