These algorithms primarily focus on finding the fewest number of addition/subtraction operations that generate the MCM. Although the complexity of an MCM design is decreased by reducing the number of operations, their solutions may not lead to an MCM design with optimal area at gate-level since they do not consider the implementation costs of the operations in hardware. This article introduces two approximate algorithms that aim to optimize the area of the MCM operation by taking into account the gate-level implementation of each addition and subtraction operation which realizes a constant multiplication. To find the optimal tradeoff between area and delay, the proposed algorithms are further extended to find an MCM design with optimal area under a delay constraint. Experimental results clearly indicate that the solutions of the proposed algorithms lead to significantly better MCM designs at gate-level when compared to those obtained by the solutions of algorithms designed for the optimization of the number of operations.
