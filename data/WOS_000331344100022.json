In this paper, we propose a parallel-snake model combined with balloon force for lane detection. Parallel-snake is defined as two open active contours with parallel constrain. The lane boundaries on the left and right sides are assumed as parallel curves, parallel-snake is deformed to estimate these two boundaries. As lane regions between left and right boundaries usually have low gradient, snake will lose external force on these regions. Furthermore, inspired by balloon active contour model, the balloon force is introduced into parallel-snake to expand two parallel curves from center of road to the left and right lane boundaries. Different from closed active contour, stretching force is adopted to prevent the head and tail of snake from converging together. The experimental results on three different datasets show that parallel-snake model can work well on images with shadows and handle the lane with broken boundaries as the parallel property.", "paper_title": "Parallel-Snake with Balloon Force for Lane Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000331344100022"}
