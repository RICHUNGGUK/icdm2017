We treat the resulting nonlinear and the corresponding linear discrete systems by a fully coupled monolithic approach to maintain high accuracy and robustness, particularly with respect to different rheological behaviors and also regarding different problem sizes and types of nonlinearity. Here, local pressure Schur complement techniques are presented as a generalization of the classical Vanka smoother. The discussed methodology is implemented for the well-known flow around cylinder benchmark configuration for generalized Newtonian as well as non-Newtonian flows including non-isothermal, shear/pressure dependent and viscoelastic effects.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.", "paper_title": "Monolithic Newton-multigrid solution techniques for incompressible nonlinear flow models", "paper_id": "WOS:000312539700005"}
