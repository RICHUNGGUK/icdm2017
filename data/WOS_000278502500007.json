Since this set of polynomial functions express primary outputs and next states with respect to primary inputs and present states, it is not necessary to perform justification/propagation phase which leads to a minimum number of backtracks. It improves fault coverage and reduces test generation time over logic-level techniques. We assess then the effectiveness of high-level test generation with a simple gate-level automatic test pattern generation algorithm. Experimental results show robustness and reliability of our method compared to other contemporary approaches in terms of fault coverage and CPU time.", "paper_title": "Coverage Driven High-Level Test Generation Using a Polynomial Model of Sequential Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000278502500007"}
