Their weight distribution is known in only a few cases. In this paper, the weight distribution of the irreducible cyclic codes in a number of other cases is determined. The number of nonzero weights in the codes dealt with in this paper varies between one and four.", "paper_title": "The Weight Distribution of Some Irreducible Cyclic Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600005"}
