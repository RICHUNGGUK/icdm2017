It is crucial to extract informative binding region propensities from large quantities of bioactivity data. To address this issue, we propose a machine learning approach that enables identification of both chemical substructures and amino acid properties that are associated with ligand binding, which can be applied to virtual ligand screening on a GPCR-wide scale. We also address the question of how to select plausible negative noninteraction pairs based on a statistical approach in order to develop reliable prediction models for GPCR ligand interactions. The key interaction sites estimated by our approach can be of great use not only for screening of active compounds but also for modification of active compounds with the aim of improving activity or selectivity.", "paper_title": "Chemical Genomics Approach for GPCR-Ligand Interaction Prediction and Extraction of Ligand Binding Determinants", "paper_id": "WOS:000321074700001"}
