Starting with the implementation of base functions, our focus is on the stability and expandable of the platform to offer new functions easily according to our needs latter. To improve the independence of the module, the function into layers and dividing the data are separated into blocks. To reach efficient system implementation, the 3D building is translated into a 2D graphics by turning the map into a group of nodes. Furthermore, the element called node plug is used to enhance the expansibility of the system. Experiments are carried out to analyze the crowd's evacuation efficiency in a given building. The impact caused by mass behavior, the structure of the building and the number of people inside are also construed qualitatively in the experiments.", "paper_title": "A crowd evacuation system in emergency situation based on dynamics model", "paper_id": "WOS:000241762900030"}
