They are used for everything from, searching to describing a document. A Keyword extraction algorithm can be defined as a combination of a keyword representation and a selection/weighting scheme. The most common selection/weighting schemes are based on collection statistics or using supervised machine learning algorithms. In these cases, keywords can, typically, only be extracted from documents that belong to a collection or using a large amount of annotated training data. The importance of extracting keywords without a document collection has been gradually increasing due to the Internet. In, this paper, a keyword, extraction algorithm designed with news in mind that requires neither a document collection or training data is presented. It, uses noun phrases as its keyword representation and takes in document statistics to derive its weighting scheme. Through experimentation it is shown. that the quality of the keywords extracted from, the proposed algorithm are better than. standard algorithms for both information retrieval and humans.", "paper_title": "Single document keyword extraction for Internet news articles", "paper_id": "WOS:000254981200013"}
