We develop a fluid-flow model to describe the behaviors of TCP Veno in wired/wireless networks. This model is further linearized to study TCP Veno's stability issue through the linear feedback control theory. The analysis points out how the RED queue oscillates under different network parameters such as link capacity, round-trip time. Simulations are carried to validate our theoretical analysis. Furthermore, based on the analysis results obtained in this paper, we are able to provide guidelines for tuning RED parameters to stabilize the router queue, and improve the co-existence between TCP Veno and TFRC (TCP-friendly Rate Control) flows.
