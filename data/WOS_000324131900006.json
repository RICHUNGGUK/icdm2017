The conditioning, stiffness, velocity and payload indices are developed to compare the performance of the two parallel manipulators, one with one additional branch, and the other with two additional branches. The optimum performance region with desirable performance is investigated. The simulations show that the redundant manipulator with one additional branch has a larger optimum performance region with the given conditioning, velocity, payload and stiffness performance. The results are not only important for designers to design the 3-DOF parallel manipulator, but also helpful for researchers to determine how many additional branches are added to develop a redundant parallel manipulator.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis and Comparison of Planar 3-DOF Parallel Manipulators with One and Two Additional Branches", "paper_id": "WOS:000324131900006"}
