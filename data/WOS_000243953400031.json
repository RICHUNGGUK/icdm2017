From the simulation results, our design performs very closely to the quasi-orthogonal code with constellation rotation over 4-QAM and 16-QAM in the case of four Tx antennas over quasi-static Rayleigh fading channels. Moreover, the proposed codes would not cause any constellation expansion over QAM symbols in contrast with the quasi-orthogonal codes with constellation rotations.", "paper_title": "Generally dimensional and constellation expansion free space-time block codes for QAM with full diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000243953400031"}
