Plugging the parametric surface to the implicit surface yields a plane algebraic curve G(v, t) = 0. By analyzing the topology graph G of G(v, t) = 0 and the singular points on the intersection curve C we associate a space topology graph to C, which is homeomorphic to C and therefore leads us to an approximation for C in a given precision.
