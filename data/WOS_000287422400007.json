Compared to MVA, moM recursively computes higher-order moments of queue lengths instead of mean values, an approach that remarkably reduces the computational costs of exact solutions, especially on models with large numbers of jobs. In this paper, we show that the MoM recursion can be generalized to include multiple recursive branches that evaluate models with different numbers of queues, a solution approach inspired by the Convolution algorithm. Combining the approaches of MoM and Convolution simplifies the evaluation of normalizing constants and leads to large computational savings with respect to the recursive structure originally proposed for MOM.
