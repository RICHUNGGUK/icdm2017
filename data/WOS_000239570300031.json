In this paper, we propose a novel task model for the purpose of flexible scheduling in reliable real-time systems. In the proposed dual-mode r-reliable task model, a task periodically releases fast mode jobs or reliable mode jobs with the constraint that reliable mode jobs must be executed at least once for any r consecutive periods to guarantee the reliability of task. We also propose scheduling algorithms and compare performance through simulation results.", "paper_title": "Dual-mode r-reliable task model for flexible scheduling in reliable real-time systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239570300031"}
