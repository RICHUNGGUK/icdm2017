We study the mathematical structure of these families of fuzzy sets and show that each family is a complete and separable metric space when endowed with the generalized Hausdorff metric. Moreover, we show that for n = 1, the families of polygonal fuzzy numbers are isomorphic to some convex and closed convex cone of a finite dimensional space. We obtain generalizations and extensions of some previous results on polygonal fuzzy numbers and simplified proofs of some well-known results about approximation of fuzzy n-dimensional quantities. Finally, some developments about the approximation of families of fuzzy sets are introduced. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
