When an image query submits, a short list of candidates from the database is selected according to simple features of stroke transect. Then the selected candidates are ranked by shape matching using two-dimensional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). After that, similar calligraphic characters are retrieved and ranked, then the query is recognized as the label of the most similar retrieved characters. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
