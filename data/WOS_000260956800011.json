In this paper, we present a novel diffusion algorithm for which the filtering kernels vary according to the perceptual saliency of boundaries. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by experiments on various medical images.", "paper_title": "Image Diffusion Using Saliency Bilateral Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000260956800011"}
