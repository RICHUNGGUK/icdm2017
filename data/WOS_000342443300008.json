Target searching is probably among the most critical tasks, consisting of finding configurations corresponding to various criteria (e.g., maximum, minimum, reference). During the search, users need to be aware of proximal results to compare values and make decisions. A new audio-haptic coupling strategy is proposed to improve the search for targets in complex environments, enabling the simultaneous use of both audio and haptic channels for value comparisons at different spatial configurations. This is accomplished through the use of tempo in both sensorial signals creating a connection between the two channels enabling an intuitive and efficient comparison. Including spatialized audio improves a user's situation awareness. The benefit of this intermodal metaphor is evaluated for a 2D nonvisual and abstract environment. Results show improvements relative to simple haptic exploration.", "paper_title": "Intermodal Audio-Haptic Metaphor: Improvement of Target Search in Abstract Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000342443300008"}
