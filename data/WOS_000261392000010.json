The article consists of two parts: a theoretical part and a practical illustration. In the theoretical part, we recall the definition of the AR(2)-index and show that an alternative definition, the so- called AR(1)(2), does not have the properties expected for this type of index. A practical example shows the existence of some of these mathematical properties and illustrates the difference between different h-type indices. Clearly the h-index itself is the most robust of all. It is shown that excluding so-called non-WoS source articles may have a significant influence on the R- and, especially, the g-index.", "paper_title": "The Age-Dependent h-Type AR(2)-Index: Basic Properties and a Case Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000261392000010"}
