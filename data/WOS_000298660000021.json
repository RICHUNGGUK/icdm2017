By using the synthesis method, we can design a multi-modal and 2-dimensional piecewise affine system from the given data on a desired limit cycle trajectory. Moreover, we prove that the obtained system has a unique and stable limit cycle and it corresponds to the desired limit cycle trajectory. It also turns out that the rotation direction and the period of the limit cycle can be controlled by changing the parameters in the system. Some simulation results show the effectiveness of our new synthesis method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
