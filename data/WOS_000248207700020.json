Instead of a parametric model, a penalized likelihood smoothing algorithm is developed. The penalty is chosen to favor a log-concave result. The standard EM algorithm (\"split and fit\") can be used. Theoretical results and applications are presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Non-parametric log-concave mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000248207700020"}
