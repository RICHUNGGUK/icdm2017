In this article, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach with a Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis algorithm is investigated to perform the Bayesian framework for FE updating under uncertainty. A major advantage of this algorithm is that it adopts global and local adaptive strategies, which makes the FE model updating be robust to uncertainty. Another merit of the studied method is that it not only quantitatively predicts structural responses, but also calculates their statistical parameters such as the confidence interval. Impact test data of a grid structure are investigated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented FE model updating technique, in which the uncertainty parameters include the vertical and longitudinal spring stiffness that simulate the boundary conditions, the end-fixity factor for modeling semi-rigid connections, and the elastic modulus for simulating the uncertainty associated with material property.", "paper_title": "Advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo Approach for Finite Element Calibration under Uncertainty", "paper_id": "WOS:000321438700005"}
