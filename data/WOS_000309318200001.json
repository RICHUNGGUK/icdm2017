Compared with the existing particle filters and fast wavelet transform filters, the performance of the filter output is remarkably improved by the developed filtering algorithm. The total computation time of the filtering algorithm is both less than that of the particle filter and fast wavelet transform filter. Further, the filtering algorithm is applied to a class of portable vital signs monitoring system, by which the effectiveness of the filtering algorithm is clearly demonstrated. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
