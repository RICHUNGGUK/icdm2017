Although more research attention has been given to Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, original software components are also widely used in the software industry. Original components are smaller in size, they have a narrower functional scope and they usually find more uses when it comes to specific and dedicated functions. Therefore, their need for interoperability is equal or greater, than that of COTS components. A quality framework for developing and evaluating original components is proposed in this paper, along with an application methodology that facilitates their evaluation. The framework is based on the ISO9126 quality model which is modified and refined so as to reflect better the notion of original components. The quality model introduced can be tailored according to the organization-reuser and the domain needs of the targeted component. The proposed framework is demonstrated and validated through real case examples, while its applicability is assessed and discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
