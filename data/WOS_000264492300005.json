BPEL processes are transformed into the SAL language to carry out (i) verification of safety and reachability properties and (ii) fault modeling by using the SAI symbolic model checker. Compared to existing solutions for model checking BPEL processes, the main added value of the paper is that (i) potential error propagation paths can also be assessed in addition to traditional verification tasks, and (ii) our approach scales up to relatively large workflows thanks to abstraction techniques and the use of the advanced SAL model checker.", "paper_title": "Formal analysis of BPEL workflows with compensation by model checking", "paper_id": "WOS:000264492300005"}
