The latter models prove to be superior, as they provide a better adjustment, with less parameters, with lower parameter uncertainty, and without instability problems. These novel results for modelling the human arm are in line with published literature suggesting that muscles may be profitably modelled with fractional derivatives. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
