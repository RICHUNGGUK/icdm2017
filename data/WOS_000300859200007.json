Because the use of color is typically a usability issue, it rarely causes security failures. However, using color when designing CAPTCHAs, a standard security technology that many commercial websites apply widely, can have an impact on usability and interesting but critical implications for security. Here, the authors examine some CAPTCHAs to determine whether their use of color negatively affects their usability, security, or both.", "paper_title": "CAPTCHA Design Color, Usability, and Security", "paper_id": "WOS:000300859200007"}
