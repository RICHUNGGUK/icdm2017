We examined a variety of wavelet transform-based statistical markers as potential candidates for the prediction of patient status post-cardioversion. Considering a 'success' as a patient who remains in normal sinus rhythm for one month post cardioversion and 'failure' as a patient who does not, it was shown the proposed non-parametric classification system can achieve 89% specificity at 100% sensitivity using a non-parametric classification method.
