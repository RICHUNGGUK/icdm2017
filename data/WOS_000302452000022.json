However, they are difficult to build and are usually domain-specific. In response to this situation, we propose a model-driven method for the development of domain-independent collaborative modeling tools. This method consists of a methodological framework, a conceptual framework and a technological framework. The methodological framework defines the phases to be carried out when applying the method, whilst the conceptual framework is made up of the meta-models used in the method and the transformation processes established between them. Finally, the technological framework consists of the integration of some plug-ins from the Eclipse Modeling Project with some add-ons which provide collaborative functionality. Some case studies that exemplify this development method for specific domains are explained in detail, together with comparisons with similar approaches. Thus, an initial evaluation of this approach is provided and some advantages over those other approaches are identified. A further evaluation process in the form of an empirical study of use has also been carried out. Hence, the method proves to be useful for any user who does not have advanced knowledge of groupware programming and who needs to use a collaborative modeling tool in his/her work. Moreover, each framework implies a contribution that can be used in different contexts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
