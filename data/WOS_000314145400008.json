However, little work focuses on the detailed follow-ups of ball hitting events. This paper proposes a HMM-based ball hitting event exploration system for broadcast baseball video. Utilizing the strictly-defined layout of the baseball field, the proposed system first detects the game-specific spatial patterns in the field, such as the field lines, the bases, the pitch mound, etc. Then, the play region the currently camera-focused region of the baseball field is identified for frame type classification. Since the temporal patterns of presenting the game progress follow a prototypical order, we consider the classified frame types as observation symbols and recognize ball hitting events using HMM. Experiments conducted on broadcast baseball video show encouraging results in frame type classification and ball hitting event recognition. Three practical applications, including highlight clip extraction by user-designated query, storyboard construction, and similar event retrieval, are introduced to address the applicability of our system.
