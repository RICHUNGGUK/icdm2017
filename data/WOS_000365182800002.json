It can be predicted that the upcoming fifth generation mobile communication technology (5G) can no longer be defined by a single business model or a typical technical characteristic. 5G is a multi-service and multi-technology integrated network, meeting the future needs of a wide range of big data and the rapid development of numerous businesses, and enhancing the user experience by providing smart and customized services. In this paper, we propose a cloud-based wireless network architecture with four components, i.e., mobile cloud, cloud-based radio access network (Cloud RAN), reconfigurable network and big data centre, which is capable of providing a virtualized, reconfigurable, smart wireless network.", "paper_title": "Cloud-based Wireless Network: Virtualized, Reconfigurable, Smart Wireless Network to Enable 5G Technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000365182800002"}
