The problem often resides in the fact that flows belonging to the same service class are assigned the same MAC parameters, regardless their respective bit rate, which leads to throughput fairness rather than perceived QoS fairness. Harmonizing the MAC parameters of traffic classes' flows may further lead to suboptimal situations, since certain network configurations (in terms of per-class traffic load) cannot be accommodated without readjusting the basic MAC parameters. In this paper, we propose a new cross-layer MAC design featuring a delay-sensitive backoff range adaptation, along with a distributed flow admission control. By monitoring both the MAC queue dynamics of each traffic class and the overall network contention level, our MAC adaption scheme reacts based on the degree to which application QoS metrics (delay) are satisfied. Aside from that, we use a distributed admission control mechanism to accept new flows while protecting the active one. Simulation results show that compared to the Enhanced Distributed Coordination Function (802.11e Enhanced Distributed Control Access (EDCA)) and AEDCF (Adaptive EDCF), our protocol consistently excels in terms of network utilization, bounded delays, and service-level fairness.", "paper_title": "On sustained QoS guarantees in operated IEEE 802.11 Wireless LANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000257018400002"}
