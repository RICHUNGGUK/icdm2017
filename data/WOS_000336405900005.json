Trying to tackle this issue, the research community and industry have proposed myriad techniques to curb the energy consumed by IT systems. This article surveys techniques and solutions that aim to improve the energy efficiency of computing and network resources. It discusses methods to evaluate and model the energy consumed by these resources, and describes techniques that operate at a distributed system level, trying to improve aspects such as resource allocation, scheduling, and network traffic management. This work aims to review the state of the art on energy efficiency and to foster research on schemes to make network and computing resources more efficient.", "paper_title": "A Survey on Techniques for Improving the Energy Efficiency of Large-Scale Distributed Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000336405900005"}
