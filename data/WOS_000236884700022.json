Generically, it has been solved by a general multi-party computation technique (via a circuit formulation). However, such a solution is inefficient in either round complexity or communication complexity. In this work, we propose an efficient construction without a circuit. Our protocol is constant round and efficient in communication complexity as well. Furthermore, we show it is directly secure in the non-adaptive malicious model (i.e., without a compiler, as is used in many general constructions).", "paper_title": "A round and communication efficient secure ranking protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884700022"}
