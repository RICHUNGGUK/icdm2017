This realm offers cutting edge ultrafast laser laboratory applications, which pose multiple objectives, noise, and possibly constraints on the high-dimensional search. In this study we introduce the topic of multi-observable quantum control (MOQC), and consider specific systems to be Pareto optimized subject to uncertainty, either experimentally or by means of simulated systems. The latter include a family of mathematical test-functions with a practical link to MOQC experiments, which are introduced here for the first time. We investigate the behavior of the multi-objective version of the covariance aatrix adaptation evolution strategy (MO-CMA-ES) and assess its performance on computer simulations as well as on laboratory closed-loop experiments. Overall, we propose a comprehensive study on experimental evolutionary Pareto optimization in high-dimensional continuous domains, draw some practical conclusions concerning the impact of fitness disturbance on algorithmic behavior, and raise several theoretical issues in the broad evolutionary multi-objective context.", "paper_title": "Quantum control experiments as a testbed for evolutionary multi-objective algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000308239200002"}
