This paper presents a novel approach towards TF generation for DVR, where the traditional low-level color and opacity parameter manipulations are not necessary. The IF generation process is hidden behind a simple and intuitive spherical self-organizing map (SSOM) visualization. The SSOM represents a visual form of the topological relations among the clusters. The user interacts with the SSOM lattice to find interesting regions in the volume. The color and opacity values are generated automatically from the voxel features based on the user's perception. We also use harmonic colors to present a visually pleasing result. Due to the independence of SSOM from feature type, our proposed method is flexible in nature and can be integrated with any set of features. The GPU implementation provides real-time volume rendering and fast interaction. Experimental results on several benchmark volume datasets show the effectiveness of our proposed method.
