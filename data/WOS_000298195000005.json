Optimal material distribution is achieved in topology optimization by setting up a selection field in the design domain to determine the presence/absence of material there. We generalize this approach in this paper by presenting a paradigm in which the material left out by the selection field is also utilised. We obtain conjugate shapes when the region chosen and the region left-out are solutions for two problems, each with a different functionality. On the other hand, if the left-out region is connected to the selected region in some pre-determined fashion for achieving a single functionality, then we get conjoined shapes. The utilization of the left-out material, gives the notion of material economy in both cases. Thus, material wastage is avoided in the practical realization of these designs using many manufacturing techniques. This is in contrast to the wastage of left-out material during manufacture of traditional topology-optimized designs. We illustrate such shapes in the case of stiff structures and compliant mechanisms. When such designs are suitably made on domains of the unit cell of a tiling, this leads to the formation of new tilings which are functionally useful. Such shapes are not only useful for their functionality and economy of material and manufacturing, but also for their aesthetic value.", "paper_title": "Design of conjugate, conjoined shapes and tilings using topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000298195000005"}
