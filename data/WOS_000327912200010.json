MapReduce can work on various platforms; however, MapReduce is not suitable for iterative programs because the performance may be lowered by frequent disk I/O operations. In order to improve system performance and resource utilization, we propose a novel MapReduce framework named Dynamically Iterative MapReduce (DIMR) to reduce numbers of disk I/O operations and the consumption of network bandwidth by means of using dynamic task allocation and memory management mechanism. We show that DIMR is promising with detail discussions in this paper.", "paper_title": "Dynamically Iterative MapReduce", "paper_id": "WOS:000327912200010"}
