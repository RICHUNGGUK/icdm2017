(Comput Math Appl 51: 1127-1136, 2006) proposed a method to evaluate DMU's. A radius of gyration was employed to rank fuzzy numbers; however, there were some problems with the ranking method. This paper attempts to reveal the issues of Deng's method and proposes a revised method that can avoid these problems for ranking fuzzy numbers. Since the revised method is based on Deng's method, it is easy to rank fuzzy numbers in a way similar to the original method.", "paper_title": "A new effect of radius of gyration with neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000325026400006"}
