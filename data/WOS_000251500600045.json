The proposed EM approach can directly compute not only the eigen-system of sample covariance matrix in data space but also that of kernel matrix. Thus, the proposed algorithm provides an unified framework for EM-based principal component analysis (PCA) and kernel PCA (KPCA). Particularly, when it is applied to KPCA, it is a dual form of the commonly used constrained EM algorithm for performing KPCA. And thus it is a beneficial complementarity or dual description of the constrained EM method. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
