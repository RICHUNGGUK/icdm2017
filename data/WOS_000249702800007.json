Without prudence, users' and service providers' requests or service information, their identities, and their presence information may be sacrificed. We identify that the problem may be as difficult as a chicken- and- egg problem, in which both users and service providers want the other parties to expose sensitive information first. In this paper, we propose a progressive and probabilistic approach to solve the problem. Users and service providers expose partial information in turn and avoid unnecessary exposure if there is any mismatch. Although 1 or 2 bits of information are exchanged in each message, we prove that the process converges and that the false- positive overhead decreases quickly. Experiments and hypothesis tests show that security properties hold. We implemented the approach and the performance measurements show that the approach runs efficiently on PDAs.", "paper_title": "Private and secure service discovery via progressive and Probabilistic exposure", "paper_id": "WOS:000249702800007"}
