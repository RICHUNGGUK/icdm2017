The presence of mobile terminals has extended the paradigm to the so called pervasive grid networks, where multiple heterogeneous devices are interconnected to form a distributed computing resource. In such a scenario, there is the need of efficient techniques for providing reliable wireless connections among network nodes. This paper deals with the proposal of a suitable resource management scheme relying on a routing algorithm able to perform jointly the resource discovery and task scheduling for implementing an efficient pervasive grid infrastructure in a wireless ad hoc scenario. The proposed solutions have been considered within two different parallelization processing schemes, and their effectiveness has been verified by resorting to computer simulations.
