The key ideas of the proposed CAM architecture are (i) four-level data storage function implementing by a SET-based static memory cell and (ii) four-level data matching function employing periodic drain-current characteristics of SETS with dynamic phase-shift control. A simple multi-gate SET can be used to realize four-level data matching within a compact CAM cell circuit. As a result, the proposed two-bit-per-cell CAM architecture reduces both the number of transistors and the cell area to 1/3 compared with the conventional CAM architecture.", "paper_title": "Design of a two-bit-per-cell content-addressable memory using single-electron transistors", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989700003"}
