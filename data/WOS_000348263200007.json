However, the computation of these models are hindered by their complicated Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization (MCEM) algorithm. In this article, a class of pseudo-likelihood functions is developed for conducting statistical inference with crossed random-effects latent class models in diagnostic medicine. Theoretically, the maximum pseudo-likelihood estimation is still consistent and has asymptotic normality. Numerically, our results show that not only the pseudo-likelihood approach significantly reduces the computational time, but it has comparable efficiency relative to the MCEM algorithm. In addition, dimension-wise likelihood, one of the proposed pseudo-likelihoods, demonstrates its superior performance in estimating sensitivity and specificity.
