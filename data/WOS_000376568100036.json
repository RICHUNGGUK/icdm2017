To achieve more fine-grained delegation on conditions, Fang, Wang and Ge introduced the notion of fuzzy conditional proxy re-encryption (FC-PRE), whereby the conditions is viewed a set of descriptive keywords. The proxy with a re-encryption key for a condition word set can convert a ciphertext encrypted with a condition word set, if and only if and are close to each other as measured by the \"set overlap\" distance metric. Nonetheless, they left an open problem on how to construct a non-interactive FC-PRE scheme. Furthermore, their scheme is only proved secure in the random oracle model. In this paper, we answer the above problems affirmatively by presenting a non-interactive fuzzy conditional proxy re-encryption scheme. Moreover, our scheme is proved secure without random oracles.", "paper_title": "Research on Non-interactive Construction based on Fuzzy Conditional Proxy Re-encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000376568100036"}
