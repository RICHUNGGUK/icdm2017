TDPL is a differential power analysis (DPA) resistant dual-rail logic style whose power consumption is insensitive to unbalanced load conditions, based on a three phase operation where, in order to obtain a constant energy consumption, an additional discharge phase is performed after pre-charge and evaluation. In this work, the TDPL basic gates operation is shortly summarized and the TDPL flip-flop implementation is reported. A part of an encryption algorithm is used as case a study to prove the effectiveness of the proposed circuit. Simulation results in a 65 nmCMOS process show an improvement in the energy consumption balancing in excess of 10 times with respect to the state of the art.", "paper_title": "A Flip-Flop for the DPA Resistant Three-Phase Dual-Rail Pre-Charge Logic Family", "paper_id": "WOS:000307125500019"}
