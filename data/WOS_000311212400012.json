The relative importance of these metrics varies from plant to plant, and often some metrics are in conflict with each other (sustainability vs. profitability). In this paper we discuss the current plant environment and how various metrics can be aligned by focusing on energy efficiency. Power-steam systems are the major energy drivers for most plants, and we discuss possible operational changes that might improve energy efficiency, as well as the role of process control. Managing the interplay of real-time optimization and regulatory control is a challenge for the future, as well as interfacing with the implementation of smart power grids by the utility industry. Combined heat and power along with energy storage presents interesting control and optimization opportunities to maximize energy efficiency. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
