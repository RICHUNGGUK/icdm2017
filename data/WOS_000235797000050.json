When the waveforms extracted front a spike train are aligned incorrectly, however, the projection performance of the PCA deteriorates drastically, and the clustering errors multiply. This drawback is taken care of by the frequency domain PCA in this paper. By experiments, it is shown that the proposed approach maintains good projection performance tinder considerable alignment errors of the waveforms. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
