There are a few areas of application of mathematical optimization models with a richer or more diverse history than in reservoir systems optimization. However, actual implementations remain limited or have not been sustained. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are probabilistic search algorithms that are capable of solving a variety of complex multi-objective optimization problems, which may include non-linear, non-convex and multimodal functions. GA is a population based global search method that can escape from local optima traps and find the global optima. However GAs have some drawbacks such as inaccuracy of the intensification process near the optimal set. In this paper, a new model called Self-Learning Genetic Algorithm (SLGA) is presented, which is an improved version of the SOM-Based Multi-Objective GA (SBMOGA) presented by Hakimi-Asiabar et al. (2009) [45]. The proposed model is used to derive optimal operating policies for a three-objective multi-reservoir system. SLGA is a new hybrid algorithm which uses Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) algorithms to add a memory to the GA and improve its local search accuracy. SOM is a neural network which is capable of learning and can improve the efficiency of data processing algorithms. The VNS algorithm can enhance the local search efficiency in the Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs). To evaluate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed methodology, it is used for developing optimal operating policies for the Karoon-Dez multi-reservoir system, which includes one-fifth of Iran's surface water resources. The objective functions of the problem are supplying water demands, generating hydropower energy and controlling water quality in downstream river. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
