Most conventional touch screen keyboards on mobile devices rely heavily on visual feedback, while auditory feedback seldom includes any useful information about what is being inputted by the user. The auditory feedback usually simply replicates the sounds produced by a physical keyboard. This paper describes the development of an enhanced auditory feedback mechanism for a Korean touch screen keyboard called the enhanced auditory feedback (EAF) mechanism. EAF has subtle phonetic auditory feedback generated using the acoustic phonetic features of human speech. While typing with EAF, users can acquire non-invasive auditory clues about the keys pressed. In this work, we compare conventional auditory feedback for a touch screen keyboard used in touch screen mobile devices with that of EAF and explore the possibility of using enhanced auditory feedback for touch screen keyboards.
