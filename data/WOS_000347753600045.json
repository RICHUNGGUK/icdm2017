Based on the Lyapunov stability theory, algebraic graph theory, matrix theory and the helpful stochastic Halanay inequality technique, some sufficient conditions are presented to guarantee the cooperative exponential synchronization for multi-agent chaotic DNNs with switching topology. Compared with the existing works about synchronization (or consensus) of multi-agent systems, the proposed method in this paper can provide a more general framework for the cooperative synchronization of nonlinear multi-agent systems with or without time delays, stochastic and impulsive disturbances. The famous master-slave (drive-response) synchronization of chaotic DNNs is a special case of this paper, and therefore the derived results can also be favorable for practical application in secure communication. Simulation results finally verify the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization control algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
