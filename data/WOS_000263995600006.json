On the one hand, high performance and low costs are generally required to cope with more and more demanding application requirements, while, on the other hand, real-time capabilities are often needed in an increasing number of automation scenarios. Communication solutions based on Ethernet technologies are becoming popular in many industrial and factory environments and a number of soft/hard real-time competing products have been proposed in the last few years. This paper focuses on the Ethernet Powerlink standard, in general, and on some of its real-time characteristics. in particular. In fact, we present some basic results concerning both cyclic and acyclic real-time traffic in Ethernet Powerlink networks, obtained by extensive simulation, which can be used as a basic step for a better understanding of the real-time behavior of this protocol.
