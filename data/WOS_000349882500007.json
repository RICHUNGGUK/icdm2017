This paper introduces polarized film shading system (PFSS) - an alternative approach based on opto-mechanical modules whose opacity is a function of the rotation of polarized film elements. PFSS in regular tessellations: triangular, square and hexagonal are discussed. Simulations for each type of tessellation are presented and visualized. Visual attractiveness of emergent CA patterns manifested by \"particles\" and \"solitons\" is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
