This paper takes a weighted bipartite graph as a fault propagation model and presents a heuristic fault localization algorithm based on the idea of incremental coverage, which is resilient to inaccurate fault propagation model and the noisy environment. Furthermore, a sliding window mechanism is proposed to tackle the inaccuracy of this algorithm in the presence of improper time windows. As shown in the simulation study, our scheme achieves higher detection rate and lower false positive rate in the noisy environment as well as in the presence of inaccurate windows, than current fault localization algorithms.", "paper_title": "Probabilistic fault localization with sliding windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000303426100018"}
