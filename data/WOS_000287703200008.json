Recently, cell separation is introduced into tissue P systems, which enables systems to generate an exponential workspace in a polynomial time. In this work, the computational power of tissue P systems with cell separation is investigated. Specifically, a uniform family of tissue P systems with cell separation is constructed for efficiently solving a well-known NP-complete problem, the partition problem.", "paper_title": "Tissue P systems with cell separation: attacking the partition problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000287703200008"}
