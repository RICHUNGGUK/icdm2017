The presented numerical method is based on an Arbitary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) interface-tracking method. Collocated second-order Finite Volume/Finite Area methods are employed to discretise the governing equations. Since strong coupling effects among the surfactant species are present, a block-coupled solution procedure is adopted for interfacial surfactant transport. Various sorption models are included. The method is verified by a set of analytical test cases and validated against experimental results regarding droplet formation processes as they are studied in interfacial science in the context of Profile Analysis Tensiometry (PAT) for determination of surface tension.
