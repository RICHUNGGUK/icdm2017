Z-shaped, Gaussian and S-shaped membership function circuits with compact structures are designed, performing well with low power, high speed and small areas. A current minimization circuit is provided with high accuracy and high speed. A follower-aggregation defuzzification block composed of several multipliers for center of gravity (COG) defuzzification is presented without using a division circuit. Based on these blocks, a two-input one-output singleton fuzzy controller with nine rules is designed under a CMOS 0.6 mu m standard technology provided by CSMC. HSPICE simulation results show that this controller reaches an accuracy of +/-3% with power consumption of only 3.5mW (at +/-2.5V). The speed of this controller goes up to 0.625M Fuzzy Logic Inference per Second (FLIPS), which is fast enough for real-time control.", "paper_title": "CMOS CIRCUIT DESIGN OF A TAKAGI-SUGENO FUZZY LOGIC CONTROLLER", "paper_id": "WOS:000266614200012"}
