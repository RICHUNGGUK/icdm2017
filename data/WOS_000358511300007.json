For an m input circuit, the proposed scheme can correct m <= D-w <= 3(m/2) -1 multiple error combinations out of all the possible 2(m) - 1 errors, which is superior to many existing approaches. From the mathematical and practical evaluations, the best case error correction is m/2 bit errors. Tests on 80-bit parallel and, for the first time, on 163-bit Federal Information Processing Standard/National Institute of Standards and Technology (FIPS/NIST) standard word-level Galois field (GF) multipliers, suggest that it requires only 106% and 170% area overheads, respectively, which is lower than the existing approaches, while error injection-based behavioral analysis demonstrates its wider error correction capability.", "paper_title": "A Low-Complexity Multiple Error Correcting Architecture Using Novel Cross Parity Codes Over GF(2(m))", "paper_id": "WOS:000358511300007"}
