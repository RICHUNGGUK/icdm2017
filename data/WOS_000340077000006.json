The change is usually processed in two steps: refactoring and data migration, which is ineffective and error prone. We provide a formal model for solution which is capable to migrate database according to a refactoring in the application code. The feasibility of the change and its data-secure processing is addressed as well.", "paper_title": "Application and Relational Database Co-Refactoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000340077000006"}
