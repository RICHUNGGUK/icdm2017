According to the vector which is generated by QOS parameters, the algorithm processes the matching of resources and tasks, and then provides users with resources which meet their requirements. Experimental results show that the min-min task scheduling algorithm for cloud computing has better performance in such aspects as task execution time, rate of discarding task and QOS satisfaction compared with traditional min-min scheduling algorithm.", "paper_title": "Task Scheduling Algorithm based-on QoS Constrains in Cloud Computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000370262800026"}
