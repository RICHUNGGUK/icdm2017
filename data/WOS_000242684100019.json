The first algorithm uses HOSVD for construction of the class models and achieves classification results with error rate lower than 6%. The second algorithm uses the HOSVD for tensor approximation simultaneously in two modes. Classification results for the second algorithm are almost down at 5% even though the approximation reduces the original training data with more than 98% before the construction of the class models. The actual classification in the test phase for both algorithms is conducted by solving a series least squares problems. Considering computational amount for the test presented the second algorithm is twice as efficient as the first one. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
