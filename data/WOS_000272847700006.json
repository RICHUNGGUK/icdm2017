It also does not hold for syllables or words in the syllable-based languages, Chinese or Vietnamese. However, when single words are combined together with word n-grams in one list and put in rank order, the frequency of tokens in the combined list extends Zipf's law with a slope close to -1 on a log-log plot in all five languages. Further experiments have demonstrated the validity of this extension of Zipf's law to n-grams of letters, phonemes or binary bits in English. It is shown theoretically that probability theory alone can predict this behavior in randomly created n-grams of binary bits.", "paper_title": "Extending Zipf's law to n-grams for large corpora", "paper_id": "WOS:000272847700006"}
