Container terminals play an important role in the transportation chain, in order to response rapidly for the requirement of modern logistics, better resource allocation, lower cost, and higher operation efficiency are needed. In this paper, we introduce the quay crane dynamic assignment (QCDA) in berth allocation planning problem (BAP) and formulate a multi-objective mathematical model considering each berth for container ship with QCDA and number of Quay Crane's Move. In order to solve this QCDA in BAP problem, we propose a multi-objective hybrid Genetic Algorithm approach with a priority-based encoding method. To demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed mohGA approach, numerical experiment is carried out and the best solution to the problem is obtained.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective hybrid genetic algorithm for quay crane dynamic assignment in berth allocation planning", "paper_id": "WOS:000290574400013"}
