To complete the boundary of the patch, a second spline curve is to be given. Up to now this interpolation problem could be solved, but without the possibility of choosing both endpoints for the rulings. We circumvent such difficulty by resorting to degree elevation of the developable surface. This is useful for solving not only this problem, but also other problems dealing with triangular developable patches.", "paper_title": "Interpolation of a spline developable surface between a curve and two rulings", "paper_id": "WOS:000350792700001"}
