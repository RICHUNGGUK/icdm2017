They have a tight relation with the information systems. Our goal is to develop a system to support the diagnosis and the classification of epilepsy in children. Around 50 million people in the world have epilepsy. Epilepsy diagnosis can be an extremely complex process, demanding considerable time and effort from physicians and healthcare infrastructures. Exams such as electroencephalograms and magnetic resonances are often used to create a more accurate diagnosis in a short amount of time. After the diagnosis process, physicians classify epilepsy according to the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9). Physicians need to classify each specific type of epilepsy based on different data, e.g., types of seizures, events and exams' results. The classification process is time consuming and, in some cases, demands for complementary exams. This work presents a text mining approach to support medical decisions relating to epilepsy diagnosis and ICD-9-based classification in children. We put forward a text mining approach using electronically processed medical records, and apply the K-Nearest Neighbor technique as a white-box multiclass classifier approach to classify each instance, mapping it to the corresponding ICD-9-based standard code. Results on real medical records suggest that the proposed framework shows good performance and clear interpretations, albeit the reduced volume of available training data. To overcome this hurdle, in this work we also propose and explore ways of expanding the dataset.", "paper_title": "Decision Support System to Diagnosis and Classification of Epilepsy in Children", "paper_id": "WOS:000344576000006"}
