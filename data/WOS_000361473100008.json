The interest of extended formulations is due to the fact that many interesting polytopes have extended formulations with a lot fewer inequalities than any linear description in the original space. This motivates the development of methods for, on the one hand, constructing extended formulations and, on the other hand, proving lower bounds on the sizes of extended formulations. Network flows are a central paradigm in discrete optimization, and are widely used to design extended formulations. We prove exponential lower bounds on the sizes of uncapacitated flow-based extended formulations of several polytopes, such as the (bipartite and non-bipartite) perfect matching polytope and TSP polytope. We also give new examples of flow-based extended formulations, e.g., for 0/1-polytopes defined from regular languages.", "paper_title": "Uncapacitated flow-based extended formulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000361473100008"}
