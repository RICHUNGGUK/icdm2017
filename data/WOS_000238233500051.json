It is well known that signal-correlated distortion is audible when the audio signal is quantized at bit rates lower than the lower bound of perceptual coding. We show that this problem can be overcome by applying the dithering quantization process in each subband. Consequently, the quantization noise is rendered into a signal-independent white noise; this noise is then estimated and removed by spectral subtraction at the decoder. Experimental results show an effective improvement by the proposed method over the conventional one in terms of better SNR and human. listening test results. The proposed method can be combined with other existing or future coding methods such as perceptual coding to improve their performance at low bit rates.", "paper_title": "Dithered subband coding with spectral subtraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000238233500051"}
