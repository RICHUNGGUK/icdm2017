CAFES comprises several built-in models, including application, communication architecture, energy consumption and timing models. It also includes a set of generic and specific algorithms and additional supporting tools, which jointly with the cited models allow the designer to describe and evaluate applications requirements and constraints on specified communication architectures. Several examples of the use of CAFES underline the usefulness of the framework. Some of these are approached in this paper: (i) a realistic application captured at high-level that has its computation time estimated after mapping at the clock cycle level; (ii) a multi-application system that is automatically mapped to a large intrachip network with related tasks occupying contiguous areas in the chip layout; (iii) a set of mapping algorithms explored to define trade-offs between run time and energy savings for small to large intrachip communication architectures.
