The model considers order planning and inventory matching of both finished and unfinished products. It combines multiple objectives, i.e., cost of earliness/tardiness penalty, tardiness penalty within delivery time window, production cost, inventory matching cost, and order cancelation penalty. This paper also proposes an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) method, where strategies to repair infeasible solutions and inventory-rematching scheme are introduced. Parameters of PSO and the rematching scheme are also analyzed. Three sets of real data from a steel manufacturing company are used to perform computational experiments for PSO, local search, and improved PSO. Numerical results show the validity of the model and efficacy of the improved PSO method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
