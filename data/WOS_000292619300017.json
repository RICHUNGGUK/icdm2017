The results of this letter show that these sequences are quite good from the linear complexity viewpoint. By modifying these sequences, another class of frequency hopping sequences are obtained. The modified sequences also have low Hamming autocorrelation and large linear complexity.", "paper_title": "On the Linear Complexity of Chung-Yang Sequences over GF(q)", "paper_id": "WOS:000292619300017"}
