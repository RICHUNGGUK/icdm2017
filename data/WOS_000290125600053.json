The security of the system is derived from some assumed hard problem based on ergodic matrices over GF(2). In this note, we show that breaking this system, with a security parameter n (public key of length 4n(2) bits, secret key of length 2n bits and block length of length n(2) bits), is equivalent to solving a set of n(4) linear equations over GF(2) which renders this system insecure for practical choices of n.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of a Public Key Encryption Scheme Using Ergodic Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125600053"}
