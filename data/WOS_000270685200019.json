We present retrieve-ensembl-seq, an application that considerably eases the retrieval of sequences from the Ensembl database, via our user-friendly web site or web services. The user provides Ensembl identifiers or gene names, and the program returns corresponding upstream, downstream, intronic, exonic, UTR or whole gene sequences. retrieve-ensembl-seq also offers a multiple organism mode to retrieve sequences from homologous genes at any taxonomical level. And we introduce various original filters such as the masking of coding fragments and the avoidance of sequence redundancy for genes with multiple transcripts. retrieve-ensembl-seq is included in the software suite regulatory sequence analysis tools (RSAT), allowing instant submission of retrieved sequences to further analysis tools.", "paper_title": "Retrieve-ensembl-seq: user-friendly and large-scale retrieval of single or multi-genome sequences from Ensembl", "paper_id": "WOS:000270685200019"}
