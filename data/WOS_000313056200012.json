Several schemes under the framework of Dual RSA have been proposed by Sun et al. (IEEE Trans Inf Theory 53(8):2922-2933, 2007). We here concentrate on the Dual CRT-RSA scheme and present certain range of parameters where it is insecure. As a corollary of our work, we prove that the Dual Generalized Rebalanced-RSA (Scheme III of Sun et al.) can be efficiently broken for a significant region where the scheme has been claimed to be secure. Next we consider the Common Prime RSA as proposed by Wiener (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 36:553-558, 1990). We present new range of parameters in Common Prime RSA where it is not secure. We use lattice based techniques for the attacks.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalytic results on 'Dual CRT' and 'Common Prime' RSA", "paper_id": "WOS:000313056200012"}
