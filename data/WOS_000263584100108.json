An adaptive fuzzy neural network is employed to model the nonlinear relationships between the removal rate of pollutants and the chemical dosages, in order to adapt the system to a variety of operating conditions and acquire a more flexible learning ability. The system includes a fuzzy neural network emulator of the reaction process, a fuzzy neural network controller, and an optimization procedure based on a performance function that is used to identify desired control inputs. The gradient descent algorithm method is used to realize the optimization procedure. The results indicate that reasonable forecasting and control performances have been achieved through the developed system. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
