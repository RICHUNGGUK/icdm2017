We give two proofs of this result, one probabilistic and the other using generating functions and singularity analysis. Moreover, the latter proof yields a more general estimate for generating functions, which is used to prove a conjecture by Bousquet-Melou and Janson (Bousquet-Melou and Janson, Ann Appl Probab 16 (2006) 1597-1632), saying that the vertical profile of a randomly labelled conditioned Galton-Watson tree converges in distribution, after suitable normalization, to the density of ISE (Integrated Superbrownian Excursion).
