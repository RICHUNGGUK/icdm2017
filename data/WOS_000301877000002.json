This work presents a solution to this problem using the DuQMoGeM, a moment based method written in a weighted residual formulation. The proposed methodology consists of using automatic integration packages in the DuQMoGeM to eliminate the integration errors in the evaluation of the moments of the population balance equation. The results show that the source of the errors in the generalized moments is related to the accuracy of the numerical integration of the aggregation and breakage terms. The use of automatic integration packages in the DuQMoGeM allows the error control of the calculated moments. However, for some problems, accurate values of a small set of moments do not guarantee the accurate representation of the number density distribution function due to the finite moment inversion problem.
