Set definability and properties of the approximation space. including best approximations, are considered as well. Finding best approximations is a NP-hard problem. Finally. we present LEM2-like algorithms for determining local lower and upper coverings for a given incomplete data set. Lower and upper approximations, associated with these coverings, are sub-optimal.", "paper_title": "Approximation Space and LEM2-like Algorithms for Computing Local Coverings", "paper_id": "WOS:000259929900015"}
