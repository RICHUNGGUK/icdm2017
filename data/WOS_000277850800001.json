We consider a cluster such that for all of its vertices, the number of links connecting a vertex to its cluster is higher than the number of links connecting the vertex to any other cluster. Based on this fundamental view, we propose a graph-clustering algorithm that identifies clusters even if they contain vertices more strongly connected outside than inside their cluster; hence, the proposed algorithm is proved exceptionally efficient in clustering densely interconnected graphs. Extensive experimentation with artificial and real datasets shows that our approach outperforms earlier alternate clustering techniques. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
