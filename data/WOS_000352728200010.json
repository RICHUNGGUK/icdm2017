In this paper we devise ENIGMA, an architecture for the back-end of BLCS systems able to provide adequate levels of access and transfer performance, availability, integrity, and confidentiality, for the data it stores. ENIGMA exploits LT rateless codes to store fragments of sectors on storage nodes organized in clusters. We quantitatively evaluate how the various ENIGMA system parameters affect the performance, availability, integrity, and confidentiality of virtual disks. These evaluations are carried out by using both analytical modeling (for availability, integrity, and confidentiality) and discrete event simulation (for performance), and by considering a set of realistic operational scenarios. Our results indicate that it is possible to simultaneously achieve all the objectives set forth for BLCS systems by using ENIGMA, and that a careful choice of the various system parameters is crucial to achieve a good compromise among them. Moreover, they also show that LT coding-based BLCS systems outperform traditional BLCS systems in all the aspects mentioned before.", "paper_title": "Exploiting Rateless Codes in Cloud Storage Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352728200010"}
