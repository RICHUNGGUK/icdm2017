However, in real-world social networks, users have their own interests (which can be represented as topics) and are more likely to be influenced by their friends (or friends' friends) with similar topics. We can increase the influence spread by taking into consideration topics. To address this problem, we study topic-aware influence maximization, which, given a topic-aware influence maximization (TIM) query, finds k seeds from a social network such that the topic-aware influence spread of the k seeds is maximized. Our goal is to enable online TIM queries. Since the topic-aware influence maximization problem is NP-hard, we focus on devising efficient algorithms to achieve instant performance while keeping a high influence spread. We utilize a maximum influence arborescence (MIA) model to approximate the computation of influence spread. To efficiently find k seeds under the MIA model, we first propose a best-effort algorithm with 1 - 1/epsilon approximation ratio, which estimates an upper bound of the topic-aware influence of each user and utilizes the bound to prune large numbers of users with small influence. We devise effective techniques to estimate tighter upper bounds. We then propose a faster topic-sample-based algorithm with epsilon . (1 - 1/epsilon) approximation ratio for any epsilon is an element of (0, 1], which materializes the influence spread of some topic-distribution samples and utilizes the materialized information to avoid computing the actual influence of users with small influences. Experimental results show that our methods significantly outperform baseline approaches.", "paper_title": "Online Topic-Aware Influence Maximization", "paper_id": "WOS:000362280800004"}
