To meet this requirement, a feature-preserved morphing method for panel design under complex rigid constraints, abbreviated as FPM, is proposed in this paper. It can also be applied in the parameterization design and modeling for auto-body using digital models. The contrastive implementation results of the experiments conducted using CAD data by the methods of FPM and FFD (Free-Form Deformation) are presented separately, which demonstrate the applicability and validity of FPM in the field of feature-preserved parameterization morphing design.
