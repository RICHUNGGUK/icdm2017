This article explores how contextual information can be used to create intelligent and useful recommender systems. It provides an overview of the multifaceted notion of context, discusses several approaches riff incorporating contextual information in the recommendation process, and illustrates the usage of such approaches in several application areas where different types of contexts are exploited. The article concludes by discussing the challenges and figure research directions for context-aware recommender systems.", "paper_title": "Context-Aware Recommender Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000295862400007"}
