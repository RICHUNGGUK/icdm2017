The surfaces considered are formed by sliding a Bezier curve (profile curve) along another Bezier curve (trajectory curve). The curves are located in perpendicular planes. The method employs a three-axis CNC milling machine equipped with suitable ball-end cutter and is based on the locus-tracing concept. The algorithm described, utilizes a real-time CNC interpolator providing the highest possible accuracy, of which the milling machine is capable. The surface quality is controlled by keeping the distance between scallops within a programmed value. Finally, the whole machining task can be programmed in a single block of the part program.
