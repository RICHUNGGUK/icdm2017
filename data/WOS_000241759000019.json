In this paper, we describe several linear fusion strategies, in particular the Majority Vote, Simple Average, Weighted Average, and Perceptron Average, which are used to combine a group of component multilayer perceptrons with optimal architecture for the classification of breast lesions. In our experiments, we utilize the criteria of mean squared error, absolute classification error, relative error ratio, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve to concretely evaluate and compare the performances of the four fusion strategies. The experimental results demonstrate that the Weighted Average and Perceptron Average strategies can achieve better diagnostic performance compared to the Majority Vote and Simple Average methods.", "paper_title": "Breast cancer diagnosis using neural-based linear fusion strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000019"}
