Particle swarm optimization, originally developed for global optimization over continuous spaces, is extended to deal with the problem of feature extraction. A formulation utilizing two swarms of particles was developed to optimize simultaneously a desired performance criterion and the number of selected features. Candidate feature sets were evaluated on a regression problem. Artificial neural networks were trained to construct linear and nonlinear models of chemical concentration of glucose in soybean crops. Experimental results utilizing real-world hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the viability of the method. The particle swarms-based approach presented superior performance in comparison with conventional feature extraction methods, on both linear and nonlinear models.", "paper_title": "Particle swarms for feature extraction of hyperspectral data", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840000004"}
