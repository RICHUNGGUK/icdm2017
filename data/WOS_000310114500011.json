The fundamental concepts and ideas which underlie the proposed method is inspired from nature and based on the observation of water cycle process and how rivers and streams flow to the sea in the real world. A comparative study has been carried out to show the effectiveness of the WCA over other well-known optimizers in terms of computational effort (measures as number of function evaluations) and function value (accuracy) in this paper.
