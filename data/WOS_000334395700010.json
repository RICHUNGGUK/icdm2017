We show that a technique developed in a previous paper, for analyzing flooding in a Markovian sequence of Erdtis-Renyi graphs, is robust enough to be used also in different contexts. We establish this fact by analyzing flooding in a sequence of graphs drawn independently at random according to a model of random graphs with given expected degree sequence. In the prominent case of power-law degree distributions, we prove that flooding takes almost surely O(log n) steps even if, almost surely, none of the graphs in the sequence is connected. In the general case of graphs with an arbitrary degree sequence, we prove several upper bounds on the flooding time, which depend on specific properties of the degree sequence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
