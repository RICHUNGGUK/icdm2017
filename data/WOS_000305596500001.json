To study the relationship between the structure of several PPAR gamma full agonists and the trans-activation activity of PPAR gamma, we have performed a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR) study of tyrosine-based derivatives, based on the 3D alignment of conformations obtained by docking. Highly predictive 3D-QSAR models, with Pearson-R values of 0.86 and 0.90, were obtained for the transactivation activity and binding affinity of PPAR gamma, respectively. These models are in good agreement with the structural characteristics of the binding pocket of PPAR gamma and provide some structural insights for the improvement of PPAR gamma full agonist bioactivities.
