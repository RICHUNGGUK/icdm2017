Here the problem is extended to 3-dimensional polyhedra, with the guards now boundary segments who rotate half-planes of illumination. After carefully detailing the 3-dimensional model, several results are established. The first is a nearly direct extension of the planar one-way sweep strategy using what we call filling guards, a generalization that succeeds despite there being no well-defined notion in 3-dimensional space of planar \"clockwise rotation.\" Next follow two results: every polyhedron with r > 0 reflex edges can be searched by at most r(2) suitable placed boundary guards, whereas just r edguards suffice if the polyhedron is orthogonal. (Minimizing the number of guards to search a given polyhedron is easily seen to be NP-hard.) Finally we show that deciding whether a given set of boundary guards has a successful search schedule is strongly NP-hard. A number of peripheral results are proved en route to these central theorems, and several open problems remain for future work.", "paper_title": "SEARCHING POLYHEDRA BY ROTATING HALF-PLANES", "paper_id": "WOS:000309921300004"}
