These three fields are compared with respect to molecular representation, inference mechanisms, basic concepts and application areas. A chemical space, a fundamental concept of chemoinformatics, is considered with respect to complex relations between chemical objects (graphs or descriptor vectors). Statistical Learning Theory, one of the main mathematical approaches in structure-property modeling, is briefly reviewed. Links between chemoinformatics and its \"sister\" fields - machine learning, chemometrics and bioinformatics are discussed.", "paper_title": "Chemoinformatics as a Theoretical Chemistry Discipline", "paper_id": "WOS:000287259000002"}
