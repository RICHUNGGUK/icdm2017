We show that there is a gap between the edit automata that one can possibly write (e.g., by Ligatti et al in their IJIS running example) and the edit automata that are actually constructed according the theorems from Ligatti's IJIS paper or from Talhi et al. \"Ligatti's automata\" are just a particular kind of edit automata. Thus, we re-open a question which seemed to have received a definitive answer: you have written your security enforcement mechanism (aka your edit automata); does it really enforce the security policy you wanted?.", "paper_title": "Do you really mean what you actually enforced?", "paper_id": "WOS:000293960400004"}
