Despite the success, conventional SVM active learning has two main drawbacks. First, the performance of SVM is usually limited by the number of labeled examples. It often suffers a poor performance for the small-sized labeled examples, which is the case in relevance feedback. Second, conventional approaches do not take into account the redundancy among examples, and could select multiple examples that are similar (or even identical). In this work, we propose a novel scheme for explicitly addressing the drawbacks. It first learns a kernel function from a mixture of labeled and unlabeled data, and therefore alleviates the problem of small-sized training data. The kernel will then be used for a batch mode active learning method to identify the most informative and diverse examples via a min-max framework. Two novel algorithms are proposed to solve the related combinatorial optimization: the first approach approximates the problem into a quadratic program, and the second solves the combinatorial optimization approximately by a greedy algorithm that exploits the merits of submodular functions. Extensive experiments with image retrieval using both natural photo images and medical images show that the proposed algorithms are significantly more effective than the state-of-the-art approaches.
