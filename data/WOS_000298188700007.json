In this way, a fixed image is translated such that a sequence of moving images is produced, which are called the 0 pseudo-motion images. In fact, we can consider the translation of a function to be a motion of eyeshot. When a function is translated, its wavelet coefficients will oscillate. From this property, we can detect the special areas of the image. Some experiments were conducted, which are used to find the position of license plates of vehicles in digital images. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the method.", "paper_title": "WAVELET DECOMPOSITION OF PSEUDO-MOTION IMAGE AND APPLICATION TO FREQUENCY SEGMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000298188700007"}
