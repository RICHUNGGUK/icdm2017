A switch architecture to provide packet switching by solving contention in wavelength and time domains is considered, relying on available optical and electrical technology. Physical and logical aspects regarding switch feasibility and management, in relation to the hybrid nature of the switch, are addressed. Scheduling algorithms to support multi-service packet forwarding are compared with optimally exploit optical and electrical subsystems according to traffic characteristics and needs. The main outcomes of the paper suggest criteria to design high-capacity packet switches, based on present-day technology constraints and quality of service requirements, to achieve a fair balance between optical transparency and loss performance.", "paper_title": "Evaluation of packet scheduling in hybrid optical/electrical switch", "paper_id": "WOS:000301333100011"}
