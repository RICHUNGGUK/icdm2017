It is vitally important but extremely challenging to fight such unwanted traffic. We need a series of defensive mechanisms to identify unwanted packets, filter them out, and further defeat their associated attacks. In this paper, we propose a lightweight, scalable packet authentication mechanism, named Lightweight Internet Permit System (LIPS), as a first line of defense to effectively filter out the most common forms of unwanted traffic, spoofed and unsolicited packets, such that in-depth security schemes can take care of the remaining issues more efficiently. LIPS is a simple extension of IP, in which each packet carries an access permit issued by its destination host or gateway, and the destination verifies the access permit to determine to accept or drop the packet. LIPS provides preliminary traffic-origin accountability that supports two salient features to confine unwanted traffic: (1) filter out the most common forms of unwanted packets and defeat associated attacks; (2) help us identify compromised hosts/domains such that we are able to build active defense schemes to deal with various attacks through real-time inter-domain collaboration. In this paper, we first present the design and prototype implementation of LIPS on Linux 2.4 kernel, and then use analysis, simulations, and experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of LIPS in protecting critical resources with light overheads.
