A new CMOS active inductor with a nearly constant quality factor is proposed. Two 4-GHz LC oscillators with and without constant-Q active inductors have been implemented in UMC-0.13 mu m 1.2 V CMOS technology and analyzed using SpectreRF from Cadence with BSIM3V3 device models. Simulation results demonstrate the phase noise of the oscillator with the constant-Q active inductor is -118dBc/Hz at 1 MHz frequency offset.", "paper_title": "A new constant-Q CMOS active inductor with applications to low-noise oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000261965500013"}
