We consider two constant degree tree communication models and several cost measures. First, we analyze whether a tree selected at random provides a good randomized approximation algorithm, and we show that such a construction fails for some of the measures. Secondly, we provide approximation algorithms for the case in which the communication requirements are given by a random graph in two different random models, namely the classical G(n,p) and random geometric graphs. Finally, we conclude with some open problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Communication tree problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000248966100015"}
