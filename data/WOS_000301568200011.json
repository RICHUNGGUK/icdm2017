In these systems, the number of the receivers is equal to that of the transmit antennas. Based on the criterion of maximum system sum-capacity, we study two per-layer joint transmit and receive filters design schemes with receive antenna beamforming (RAB) and receive antenna selection (RAS), respectively. Moreover, the differences of the equivalent channel gains and capacities between these two schemes are analyzed theoretically. Simulation results show that by these per-layer schemes, the system sum-rate is improved significantly with respect to the per-user processing scheme.", "paper_title": "Per-layer transmit and receive filters design for Tomlinson-Harashima precoding in multiuser MIMO systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301568200011"}
