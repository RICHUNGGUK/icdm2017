Later, the Object Management Group endorsed it as a request for proposals to deal with SEMAT concerns. The KUALI-KAANS Research Group responded to the request as a submitter by creating the KUALI-BEH proposal. The objective of this paper is to present the roadmap KUALI-BEH followed throughout the OMG standardization process: its origins, fusion with the ESSENCE proposal and eventual appearance as a standard. The subsequent lessons learned highlight the lack of aligned definitions among IT standards and the standardization process shortcomings, to which improvements are suggested. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
