This formulation is considered in the Arbitrary-Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework with the constraint that the mesh velocity and the fluid velocity coincide. The link between the vertex velocity and the fluid motion is obtained by a formulation of the momentum conservation on a class of multi-scale encased Volumes around mesh vertices. The vertex velocity is derived with a nodal Riemann solver constructed in Such a way that the mesh motion and the face fluxes are compatible. Finally, the resulting scheme conserves both momentum and total energy and, it satisfies a semi-discrete entropy inequality. The numerical results obtained for some classical 2D and 3D hydrodynamic test cases show the robustness and the accuracy of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
