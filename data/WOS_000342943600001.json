The closed-form expressions for the exact outage probability and bit error rate (BER) of the secondary system are derived and validated by simulations. Asymptotic outage analysis in high SNR regime reveals that the diversity order is determined by the minimum fading severity parameter of all the secondary transmission links, irrespective of the CSI imperfection. It is shown that the fading severity of the secondary transmission links has more influence on the outage performance than that of the interference links. We also conclude that, for secondary nodes whose transmit power is restricted by the interference constraint of the primary user, increasing the number of relaying hops is an effective way to improve their transmission performance. Besides, increasing the number of available relays in each relay cluster can mitigate the performance degradation caused by CSI imperfection.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Multihop Wireless Sensor Networks over Nakagami-m Fading Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000342943600001"}
