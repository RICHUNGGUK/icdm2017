In this model, we used higher-order moment method, multi-scale technique and the Chapman-Enskog expansion, and multi-entropy-level to obtain sound wave equation with isentropic equation. As numerical examples, the Doppler effects in the sound wave propagation, the sound scattering from circular cylinder are simulated. The numerical results show that this model can be used to simulate sound wave propagation.
