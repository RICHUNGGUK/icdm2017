We show how to find a cycle through v of length exp(Omega(root log l/ log log l)) in polynomial time. This implies the same bound for the longest cycle, longest vw-path, and longest path. The previous best bound for longest path is length Omega((log l)(2)/ log log l) due to Bjorklund and Husfeldt. Our approach, which builds on Bjorklund and Husfeldt's, uses cycles to enlarge cycles. This self-reducibility allows the approximation method to be iterated.", "paper_title": "Finding paths and cycles of superpolylogarithmic length", "paper_id": "WOS:000246299400006"}
