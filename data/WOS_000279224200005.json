In the existing microflows LBM models, the Knudsen layer correction function has been introduced into the models. According to the kinetic theory rigorously, we choose a proper expression of correction function, and then determine its adjustable parameter. A substitute high-order boundary conditions treatment is adopted to capture the velocity slip, without any difficulties in computing the high-order velocity derivatives. The numerical results of two typical microflows show that: the present results agree with the analytical solutions better than the existing LBM simulations. Evident improvements can also be found, especially for finite Kn microflows.", "paper_title": "LATTICE BOLTZMANN SIMULATION OF GASEOUS FINITE-KNUDSEN MICROFLOWS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279224200005"}
