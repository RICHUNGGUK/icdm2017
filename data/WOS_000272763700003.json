Conventional acoustic analogies and Kirchhoff methods are rewritten for the various propagation equations and used to obtain near-field acoustic results. The accuracy of the various coupling- methods in identifying the noise-generating mechanisms is evaluated In this way, this paper provides more insight into the practical Use of various hybrid CAA techniques to predict the acrodynamically generated sound field by flow over rectanaular cavities.
