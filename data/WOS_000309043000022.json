Sparse representation classifier is based on sparse representation and computed by L1-norm minimization problem on facial components. The features of \"important\" training samples are selected to represent test sample. Furthermore, fuzzy integral is utilized to fuse individual classifiers for facial components. Experiments for frontal views and partially occluded facial images show that this method is efficient and robust to partial occlusion on facial images.", "paper_title": "Facial Expression Recognition via Sparse Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000309043000022"}
