With the ever increasing amounts of information stored on the web or archived within a computing system, high performance data processing architectures are required to process this data in real time. The aim of the work presented in this paper is the development of a hardware text mining IP-Core for use in FPGA based systems. In this paper we will describe the pre-processing engine we have developed for the PRESENCE II PCI card, to accelerate the identification of significant words within a document, logging their frequency and position. The performance of this system is then compared to an equivalent software implementation using the Lucene software package.", "paper_title": "Hardware support for language aware information mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100053"}
