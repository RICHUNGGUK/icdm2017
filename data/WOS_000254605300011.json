The proposed decomposition method imposes a penalty on the resultant periodic subsignals in order to improve the sparsity of decomposition and avoid the overestimation of periods. This penalty is defined as the weighted sum of the 12 norms of the resultant periodic subsignals. This decomposition is approximated by an unconstrained minimization problem. In order to solve this problem, a relaxation algorithm is applied. In the experiments, decomposition results are presented to demonstrate the simultaneous detection of periods and waveforms hidden in signal mixtures.", "paper_title": "A sparse decomposition method for periodic signal mixtures", "paper_id": "WOS:000254605300011"}
