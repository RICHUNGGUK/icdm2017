This is achieved as a result of the combination of two technologies: algorithmic skeletons and software components. This paper is a case study on the use of SBASCO. Specifically, we present a scientific application to study the propagation of reaction waves in two-dimensional irregular domains which can be divided into overlapping rectangular regions. Domain decomposition techniques are used to solve a system of two non-linear reaction-diffusion equations. The structure of the application is established by means of a high-level skeleton, which captures all the communication and synchronization details that take place in parallel component interaction, thereby releasing the programmer from coding them. In addition, the use of software components facilitates the development process and allows the creation of more flexible and adaptable software.", "paper_title": "Using SBASCO to solve reaction-diffusion equations in two-dimensional irregular domains", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389400121"}
