According to the queue length of parent and child nodes, each child node chooses one of the parents as the next hop to the sink and controls the delay before transmission begins. It balances traffics among parents and mitigates congestion based on congestion level of a node. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces buffer drop probabilities and their deviation and increases the end-to-end delivery success ratio in wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Stochastic Congestion Control in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000274505900043"}
