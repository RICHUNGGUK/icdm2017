We model outliers within such processes, assuming that we observe a contaminated process with additive Poisson distributed contamination, affecting each observation with a small probability. Our particular concern are additive outliers, which do not enter the dynamics of the process and can represent measurement artifacts and other singular events influencing a single observation. Retrospective analysis of such outliers is difficult within a non-Bayesian framework since the uncontaminated values entering the dynamics of the process at contaminated time points are unobserved. We propose a Bayesian approach to outlier modeling in INGARCH processes, approximating the posterior distribution of the model parameters by application of a componentwise Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Analyzing real and simulated data sets, we find Bayesian outlier detection with non-informative priors to work well in practice when there are some outliers in the data.", "paper_title": "Retrospective Bayesian outlier detection in INGARCH series", "paper_id": "WOS:000349551100014"}
