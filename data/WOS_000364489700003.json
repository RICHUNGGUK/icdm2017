They are considered as one of the prime drug targets since mutations and aberrant TF-DNA interactions are implicated in many diseases. Identification of TF-binding sites on a genomic scale represents a critical step in delineating transcription regulatory networks and remains a major goal in genomic annotations. Recent development of experimental high-throughput technologies has provided valuable information about TF-binding sites at genome scale under various physiological and developmental conditions. Computational approaches can provide a cost-effective alternative and complement the experimental methods by using the vast quantities of available sequence or structural information. In this review we focus on structure-based prediction of transcription factor binding sites. In addition to its potential in genome-scale predictions, structure-based approaches can help us better understand the TF-DNA interaction mechanisms and the evolution of transcription factors and their target binding sites. The success of structure-based methods also bears a translational impact on targeted drug design in medicine and biotechnology.", "paper_title": "Structure-Based Prediction of Transcription Factor Binding Sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000364489700003"}
