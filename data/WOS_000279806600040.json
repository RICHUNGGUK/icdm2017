Instead of modeling the complex hydrodynamics of numerous small bubbles explicitly, our method approximates the average motion of these bubbles using a continuum multiphase solver. Then, the subgrid interactions among bubbles are computed using our new stochastic solver. Using the proposed scheme, we can efficiently simulate complex scenes with millions of bubbles.", "paper_title": "A Practical Simulation of Dispersed Bubble Flow", "paper_id": "WOS:000279806600040"}
