In this paper, we proposed an improved training strategy to improve the convergence of neural network. Instead of using all samples, the neural network is optimized by a simplified sample set through the sample selecting process. The experimental results on 470 and 1034 categories of handwritten Chinese characters respectively indicate that, the training strategy can significantly reduce the convergence time without degrading the recognition performance, showing its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A training strategy of class-modular neural network classifier for handwritten chinese character recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300072"}
