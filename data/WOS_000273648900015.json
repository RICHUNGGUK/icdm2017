The noise covariance parameters included in the systems are estimated by calculating the quadratic variation of observation data. The market price of risk parameters are then identified with the aid of the maximum likelihood method.", "paper_title": "PARAMETER ESTIMATION OF TERM STRUCTURES MODELED BY STOCHASTIC HYPERBOLIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900015"}
