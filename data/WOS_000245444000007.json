We prove that the new model has fixed-point dynamics. Although there might be several fixed points, a precise description of the fixed points is given. Moreover, we provide a simple closed formula for counting the number of fixed points originated by initial conditions made of a single column of grains. Bounds for the transient length are also given.", "paper_title": "Advances in symmetric sandpiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000245444000007"}
