By treating the chemical potential and angular velocity as the continuation parameters simultaneously under the additional constraint of normalization condition, the proposed algorithm can effectively compute numerical solutions for a rich variety of physical phenomena observed in physical experiments with very little cost. Comparisons with various numerical methods on some sample test problems are reported. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
