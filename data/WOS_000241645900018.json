Rewriting game theory is discrete and comes with a graph-based framework for understanding compromises and interactions between players and for computing Nash equilibria. The formalism explicitly represents the dynamics of its Nash equilibria and, therefore, is a suitable foundation for the study of steady states in discrete modelling. We apply the formalism to the discrete analysis of gene regulatory networks introduced by R. Thomas and S. Kauffman. Specifically, we show that their models are specific instances of a C/P game deduced from the K parameter.", "paper_title": "Rewriting game theory as a foundation for state-based models of gene regulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241645900018"}
