Nevertheless, regarding energy-constrained hard real-time systems, few model-driven methods are available and, usually, most methods (model-driven or not) consider simplified system specifications, such as absence of intertask relations. This paper presents a model-driven method for software synthesis of hard real-time embedded applications with energy constraints. A formal model based on time Petri nets is adopted in order to provide a basis for pre-runtime schedule generation and property analysis/verification", "paper_title": "Model-driven software synthesis for hard real-time applications with energy constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000288147100001"}
