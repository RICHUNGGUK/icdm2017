It leads to speed up the encoding time. Since our proposed kick-out method is based on Jacquin's full search method, both methods need to search the whole image and the decoded image quality are the same. Based on five typical testing images, our proposed method has 22% execution time improvement ratio in average when compared with Jacquin's full search method. Combining our proposed method with Truong et al.'s DCT inner product method, Lai et al.'s kick-out method, or both methods, the encoding-time performance can be improved further.
