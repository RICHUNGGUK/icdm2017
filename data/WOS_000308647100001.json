More precisely, a flow model recently introduced by Avestimehr et al. (Proceedings of the Allerton conference on communication, control, and computing 2007) used in the context of wireless information networks is a special case of the presented model. We define a notion of source-destination cut and derive a max-flow min-cut theorem. Additionally, we present various properties of polylinking networks that can be seen as generalizations of properties for classical flows. Using submodular function minimization and submodular flow algorithms, one can efficiently determine a maximum flow, a minimum source-destination cut, as well as a minimum cost flow. These algorithms lead to new efficient algorithms for the information flow model.", "paper_title": "A flow model based on polylinking system", "paper_id": "WOS:000308647100001"}
