The single-mode of the piezoelectric panel can be regarded as a second-order system. The unmodeled error of the current controlled mode, harmonic effects, uncontrolled mode effects, etc., are regarded as the lumped disturbances which can be estimated by the DOB, and the estimated value is used for the feed-forward compensation design. Then, an optimal linear quadratic regulator (LQR) strategy is employed for the feedback design. In order to solve the difficulty of determining the weight matrices of LQR, a chaos optimization method based on logistic map is proposed. So the weight matrices can be tuned automatically. Combining with a new transient performance function, the optimal weight matrices can be obtained. The composite controller can effectively suppress the lumped disturbances of the all-clamped panel. Experiment comparisons with conventional LQR are given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
