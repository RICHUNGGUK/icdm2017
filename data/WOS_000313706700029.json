This phenomenon has been a key bottleneck to the use of piezoelectric mechanisms in fast and precision scanning applications. This paper presents a systematic model identification and composite control strategy without hysteresis measurement for such applications. First, least squares estimation using harmonic signals is applied to achieve the Preisach density function. Next, the hysteresis output is estimated, such that the non-hysteretic dynamics can be identified. The discrete composite control strategy is proposed with a feedforward-feedback structure. The feedforward controller is the primary component designed for the performance. The secondary proportional-integral (PI) feedback controller is employed to suppress disturbances for robustness. Finally, the identification and composite control strategy is implemented with a dSPACE 1104 board for a real piezoelectric actuator setup. The experimental results indicate that adequate scanning performance can be sustained at a rate higher than the first resonant frequency.", "paper_title": "Discrete Composite Control of Piezoelectric Actuators for High-Speed and Precision Scanning", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700029"}
