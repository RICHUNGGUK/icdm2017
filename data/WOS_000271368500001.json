It includes the surface processes model CASCADE into the finite element solver ABAQUS/Standard (TM). The finite element method allows for geomechanical simulations of the subsurface with geometrically complex structures in 3D. Additionally, in the commercial software ABAQUS (TM) various types of theological behavior are already implemented. CASCADE simulates erosion and sedimentation as the combination of fluvial transport and hillslope processes. For the integration of CASCADE into ABAQUS/Standard (TM) an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian modeling technique is used, which makes a coupled and automated simulation possible. Two benchmark models that are easy to reproduce demonstrate the functionality of CASQUS. Our tool aims at a better understanding of the feedback between mass redistribution at the Earth's surface and processes within a heterogenous subsurface, and at a quantification of the involved processes.
