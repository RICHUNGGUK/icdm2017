A D-reducible function, depending on all its n input variables, can be studied and synthesized in a space of dimension strictly smaller than n. We show that the D-reducibility property can be efficiently tested, in time polynomial in the representation of f, that is, an initial SOP form of f. A D-reducible function can be efficiently decomposed, giving rise to a new logic form, that we have called DredSOP. This form is shown here to be generally smaller than the corresponding minimum SOP form. Our experiments have also shown that a great number of functions of practical importance are indeed D-reducible, thus validating the overall interest of our approach.", "paper_title": "Dimension-Reducible Boolean Functions Based on Affine Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000289069700001"}
