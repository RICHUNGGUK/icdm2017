The antenna effect is a phenomenon of plasma-induced gate oxide degradation caused by charge accumulation on conductors. It directly influences reliability, manufacturability and yield of VLSI circuits, especially in deep-submicron technology using high-density plasma. Furthermore, the continuous increase of the problem size of IC routing is also a great challenge to existing routing algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multilevel full-chip routing with antenna avoidance using built-in jumper insertion approach. Compared with the. state-of-the-art multilevel routing, the experimental results show that our approach reduced 100% antenna-violated gates and results in fewer wirelength, vias, and delay increase.
