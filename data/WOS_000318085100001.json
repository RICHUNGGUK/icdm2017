The sensor nodes report their observations to the base station (BS), and the BS should implement the parameter estimation with sensors' data. Best linear unbiased estimation (BLUE) is a common estimator in the parameter estimation. Due to the end-to-end packet delay, it takes some time for the BS to receive sufficient data for the estimation. In some soft real-time applications, we expect that the estimation can be completed before the deadline with a probability. The existing approaches usually guarantee the real-time constraint through reducing the number of hops during data transmission. However, this kind of approaches does not take full advantage of the soft real-time property. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient scheduling algorithm especially for the soft real-time estimations in WSNs. Through the proper assignment of sensors' state, we can achieve an energy-efficient estimation before the deadline with a probability. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Soft Real-Time Scheduling for Parameter Estimation in WSNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000318085100001"}
