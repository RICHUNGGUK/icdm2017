In addition, scalability and flexibility should be supported as the number of customers increases. Because Electronic Commerce is beyond the national border, the system should be implemented across different subnets for its efficiency and business needs. This paper proposes the design and implementation of a distributed system infrastructure across different subnets for Electronic Commerce. When the Electronic Commerce system is owned and managed by a small enterprise, the cost should be considered as well as fault tolerance, high availability and scalability. The proposed infrastructure was evaluated and discussed in the aspect of economics such as implementation and management cost, performance and overhead.", "paper_title": "Distributed Electronic Commerce cluster for small enterprise", "paper_id": "WOS:000341081900006"}
