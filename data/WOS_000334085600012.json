In our model, we assume that the metastability of under-saturated traffic at the signal is caused by a dependence of the mean time of driver acceleration from a queue at the signal on the driver's stopped time within the queue. With the use of Nagel Schreckenberg model, we demonstrate that this mechanism of the metastability of city traffic can lead to the time-delayed traffic breakdown at the signal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
