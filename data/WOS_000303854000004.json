In this paper, a novel method is presented to facilitate the clustering. The method determines the appropriate number of clusters and provides suitable representatives for each cluster by inference from a Bayesian network. Furthermore, by means of the Bayesian network, the contents of the Web pages are converted into vectors of lower dimensions. The method is also extended for hierarchical clustering, and a useful heuristic is developed to select a good hierarchy. The experimental results show that the clusters produced benefit from high quality.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC HEURISTICS FOR HIERARCHICAL WEB DATA CLUSTERING", "paper_id": "WOS:000303854000004"}
