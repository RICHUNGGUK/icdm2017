This paves the way for realizing a possible cold atom quantum computer in which entangling gates operate by bringing two individual atoms in the proximity of each other and letting them to interact. The speed of our protocol is determined by the tunneling amplitudes of the atoms and thus is much faster than the speed of the dynamics resulted from superexchange interaction in spin chains. Our scheme is robust against possible imperfections and perhaps its main advantage is its simplicity where all of its requirements have been already achieved in recent experiments.", "paper_title": "LONG DISTANCE ENTANGLEMENT GENERATION THROUGH COHERENT DIRECTED TRANSPORT OF NERTRAL ATOMS IN IN UNMODULATED OPTICAL LATTICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000340579700005"}
