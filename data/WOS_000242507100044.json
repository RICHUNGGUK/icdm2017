Since several tasks are executed on the device concurrently, scheduling of both task execution and reconfiguration is an important problem. In our model, the dynamically reconfigurable device is represented by a two-level hierarchical automaton, and execution of each periodic task is represented by a timed discrete event system. We propose a composition rule to get an automaton, which represents non-preemptive execution of periodic tasks on the dynamically reconfigurable device. We introduce a method to get a feasible execution sequence of tasks by using state feedback control.", "paper_title": "Scheduling of periodic tasks on a dynamically reconfigurable device using timed discrete event systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000242507100044"}
