This bibliometric study was made using the data retrieved from the Web of Knowledge (WoK) following a dual strategy-on the one hand through the filter of the category Information Science & Library Science, and on the other hand through a subject search. In this way a significant number of works has been retrieved, some of which are in journals indexed in SCI or A&HCI and not in the SSCI. The results show a significant increase in all co-authorship, including publications in English and those involving international collaboration. As with the increase in Spanish participation in social science (WoK), this growth, coupled with the significant increase in Spanish scientific production in the area of LIS, suggests that the discipline in Spain has entered a more mature phase-although so far it has focused particularly on bibliometric studies.", "paper_title": "Scientific collaboration in Library and Information Science viewed through the Web of Knowledge: the Spanish case", "paper_id": "WOS:000300325800008"}
