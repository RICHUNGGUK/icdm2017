The ordinary frame-based scheduling principle is well-known for providing fair service with low implementation complexity. However, existing frame-based scheduling algorithms cannot properly handle location-dependent burst errors in wireless networks. To utilize the advantages of frame-based scheduling algorithms in error-prone wireless networks, we propose an elastic compensation model that provides not only smooth compensations without any service disruptions of flows but also flexible compensations to flows that experience frequent errors to provide flows with fairness of service. From our analysis and simulation studies, we found that the proposed compensation model shows smooth compensation performance without any service disruption periods and good fairness performance when channel errors occur.
