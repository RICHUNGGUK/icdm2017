These proteins, involved in the transport of multiple drugs across the cell envelope in bacteria, exhibit broad substrate specificity and act like efflux pumps. In this work, a protein belonging to the RND protein family, AcrB of Escherichia coli was used as a working model to predict in silico the compounds transported by 47 RND proteins. From AcrB we extracted and clustered 14 amino acids directly involved in substrate interactions. This clustering provides enough information to identify 16 groups that correlates with the ligand they extrude, such as proteins expelling aromatic hydrocarbons (SrpB cluster) or proteins expelling heavy metals (CnrA cluster). The relationship between conserved, cluster-specific and variable residues indicates that although the ligand-binding domain is conserved in structure, it has enough flexibility to recognize specifically a diversity of molecules.
