A concrete CBPd scheme is also proposed. The scheme is semantically secure against adaptive chosen plaintext attack (IND-CBPd-Rev-CPA) under the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption in the standard model. We also give an enhanced scheme that is secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks (IND-CBPd-Rev-CCA) in the standard model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
