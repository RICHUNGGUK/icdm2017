This reliability measure is based on the usual notion that the more reliable a prediction, the less liable to be wrong. Here we will define a general reliability measure suitable for any arbitrary recommender system. We will also show a method for obtaining specific reliability measures specially fitting the needs of different specific recommender systems. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
