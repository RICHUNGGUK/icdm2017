A set of user attributes are introduced and defined to describe the basic user profiling in accordance with the analysis of information behaviors, and several centrality based measures are proposed and developed to describe the users' importance and contributions with regards to a group of users based on their social connections in the DSUN (Dynamically Socialized User Networking) model. The experimental results are discussed to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Multi-dimensional attributes and measures for dynamical user profiling in social networking environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214900002"}
