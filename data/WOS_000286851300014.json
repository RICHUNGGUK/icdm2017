However, for this particular period shift to the cooperative partnership paradigm, only a few empirical studies exist on implementing a practical strategy for collaborative commerce, such as collaborative product commerce (CPC). This research explores the implementation of the CPC system by Taiwanese enterprises from the perspective of organizational fit - the core spirit of CPC - and discusses its relationship with \"implementation success,\" \"implementation satisfaction,\" \"inter-organizational trust,\" and \"organizational interdependence.\" Findings indicate that successful implementation of CPC should consider the fit between the CPC system and the facilitative processes of the corporation. Additionally, inter-organizational trust and interdependence should be considered because these also affect CPC system implementation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
