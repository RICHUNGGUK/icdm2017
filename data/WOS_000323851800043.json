Specially, each pixel of every facial image sub-block gains eight edge response values by convolving the local 3 x 3 neighborhood with eight Kirsch masks, respectively. ELDP just utilizes the directions of the most prominent edge response value and the second most prominent one. Then, these two directions are encoded into a double-digit octal number to produce the ELDP codes. The ELDP dominant patterns (ELDPd) are generated by statistical analysis according to the occurrence rates of the ELDP codes in a mass of facial images. Finally, the face descriptor is represented by using the global concatenated histogram based on ELDP or ELDPd extracted from the face image which is divided into several sub-regions. The performances of several single face descriptors not integrated schemes are evaluated in face recognition under different challenges via several experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is more robust to non-monotonic illumination changes and slight noise without any filter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
