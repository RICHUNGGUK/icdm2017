Menu design features play a significant role from the perspective of customer satisfaction. Therefore, researchers have investigated various features in menu design. 3D menus have been investigated because these can display more items and provide a natural and intuitive interface. Small screens of the type used on mobile phones are limited in the amount of available space, and thus it might be more beneficial to use 3D menus in cell phones. A review of previous menu design studies for human-computer interaction suggests that menu design guidelines for computers and mobile phones need to be reappraised, especially toward the use of 3D interfaces in cell phones. The main objective of this article is to propose an overall framework for 3D menu interfaces in cell phones. The second objective is to propose guidelines for 2D and 3D menu design in computers and cell phones based on a literature review. Three main factors that might influence the performance of menu retrieval task in cell phones are included in the proposed model: the presentation type, the number of items, and menu type.", "paper_title": "Menu Design for Computers and Cell Phones: Review and Reappraisal", "paper_id": "WOS:000287699500005"}
