This method is composed of two sequential processes: a feature extraction and a rule decision. In the process of feature extraction, the time-frequency representation (TFR) has been designed for maximizing the separability between classes representing different faults. The diagnosis is realised in two levels: the first one allows the detection of different faults-bearing fault, stator fault and rotor fault. The second one refines this detection by the determination of severity degree of faults, which are already identified on the previous level. The diagnosis is independent of the level of load. This method is validated on a 5.5 kW induction motor test bench. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
