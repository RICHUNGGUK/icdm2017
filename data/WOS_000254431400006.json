First of them, dedicated to WCDMA standard, depicts a 15.5 and 2.85 dB, S(21) and noise figure (NF), respectively, under 2 mA current consumption. The second realization operates at 23 GHz for Mini-Link application. It provides a 14 dB gain and 7 dB at 22 GHz NF for an 8.2 mA current consumption under 2.5 V. Both circuits were designed according to a design flow, here depicted, based on input matching, NF and gain optimisation. A large part of the article also deals with high frequency layout considerations. Indeed useful techniques dedicated to integrated microstrip waveguides and RF inter-connections are proposed based on 3D electromagnetic field simulations.", "paper_title": "2 to 23 GHz BiFET low noise amplifier design flow and implementations in 0.25 mu m SiGeBiCMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000254431400006"}
