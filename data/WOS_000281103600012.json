In order to reduce business risk in developing international markets, using the alliance model is a key strategy for information service firms. On the other hand, firms should handle more accurate business information to support their business intelligence (BI) system to make better business decisions. This research uses a hybrid fuzzy-Delphi-AHP approach to propose a more comprehensive framework with specific business elements, and also points out six performance indices for firms to adjust business strategy. Results of this study could have considerable value for the information services industry to develop international markets. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
