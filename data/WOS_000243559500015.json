Are there also similarities between scientometric and Web indicators of collaboration for possible use in technology policy making? Usually, the bibliometric method used to study collaboration is the investigation of co-authorships. In this paper, Web hyperlinks and Web visibility indicators are examined to establish their usefulness as indicators of collaboration and to explore whether similarities exist between Web-based structures and bibliographic structures. Three empirical studies of collaboration between institutions and individual scientists show that hyperlink structures at the Web don't reflect collaboration structures collected by bibliographic data. However Web visibility indicators of collaboration are different from hyperlinks and can be successfully used as Web indicators of collaboration.", "paper_title": "Reflection of co-authorship networks in the Web: Web hyperlinks versus Web visibility rates", "paper_id": "WOS:000243559500015"}
