One of the primary steps of the hardware/software codesign is the hardware/software partitioning. A good partitioning scheme is a tradeoff of some constraints, such as power, size, performance, and so on. Inspired by both negative selection model and evolutionary mechanism of the biological immune system, an evolutionary negative selection algorithm for hardware/software partitioning, namely ENSA-HSP, is proposed in this paper. This ENSA-HSP algorithm is proved to be convergent, and its ability to escape from the local optimum is also analyzed. The experimental results demonstrate that ENSA-HSP is more efficient than traditional evolutionary algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
