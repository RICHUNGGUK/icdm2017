For lossy applications, minimizing the precision of FP multiplication operations under the acceptable accuracy loss is a well-known approach for reducing the energy consumption of FP multipliers. This paper proposes a multiple-precision FP multiplier to efficiently trade the energy consumption with the output quality. The proposed FP multiplier can perform low-precision multiplication that generates 8-, 14-, 20-, or 26-bit mantissa product through an iterative and truncated modified Booth multiplier. Energy saving for low-precision multiplication is achieved by partially suppressing the computation of mantissa multiplier. In addition, the proposed multiplier allows the bitwidth of mantissa in the multiplicand, multiplier, and output product to be dynamically changed when it performs different FP multiplication operations to further reduce energy consumption. Experimental results show that the proposed multiplier can achieve 59 %, 71 %, 73 %, and 82 % energy saving under 0.1 %, 1 %, 5 %, and 11 % accuracy loss, respectively, for the RGB-to-YUV & YUV-to-RGB conversion when compared to the conventional IEEE single-precision multiplier. In addition, the results also exhibit that the proposed multiplier can obtain more energy reduction than previous multiple-precision iterative FP multipliers.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Multiple-Precision Floating-Point Multiplier for Embedded Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000319468200004"}
