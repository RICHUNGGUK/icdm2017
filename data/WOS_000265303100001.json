In this method, the leave-one-out cross-validation with varying LVs number is run on different selected MW and, consequently, that revealing optimal results is selected. The method is applied to the simultaneous determination of H(+), NH(3)OH(+) and NH(4)(+) in Raschig synthesis mixtures, which is of industrial importance. A comparison in the modeling power of PLS is made between non-processed data set and data set processed by the MW method.
