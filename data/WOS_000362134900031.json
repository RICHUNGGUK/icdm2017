First, we look into the global aspects of integration of different educational systems and list some funding opportunities. Then, we describe our double-degree program curriculum, suggest the timeline of enrollment and studies, and give some examples of student research topics. Finally, we discuss the issues of joint programs with Russia and suggest possible solutions, analyze the results of the first three student intakes and reflect on the lessons learnt, and share our thoughts and experiences that could be of interest to the international community expanding the educational markets to the vast countries like Russia, China or India. The paper is written for education professionals and contains useful information for potential students.
