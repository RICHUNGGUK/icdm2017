We show that the error of the approximation in a weighted Sobolev norm is of order O(h2/3+ t1/3) under some realistic regularity assumptions on the exact solution, where h and t denote the mesh parameters in space and time, respectively. Numerical examples are presented to confirm our theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Convergence of a finite element approximation to a degenerate parabolic variational inequality with non-smooth data arising from American option valuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000278706700004"}
