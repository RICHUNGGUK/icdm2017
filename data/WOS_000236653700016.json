Reactions of premixed reactants call for efficient designs of micromixers. This paper presents the investigations of a relatively little known micromixer embedded with barriers. The micro-resolution particle image velocimetry is used to measure the flow in the micromixer. The obtained results are in good agreement with numerical simulation. The results show that the barriers embedded in the microchannel lead to a large variation of velocity gradient, and make the fluid stretch and fold in the micromixer, which results in a substantial enhancement of the mixing efficiency.", "paper_title": "Velocity measurement of flow in the microchannel with barriers using micro-PIV", "paper_id": "WOS:000236653700016"}
