This analysis has been indispensable for the identification of novel or modified peptides in a biological sample. Currently, the speed of de novo sequencing algorithms is not heavily affected by the number of post-translational modification (PTM) types in consideration. However, the accuracy of the algorithms can be degraded due to the increased search space. Most peptides in a proteomics research contain only a small number of PTMs per peptide, yet the types of PTMs can come from a large number of choices. Therefore, it is desirable to include a large number of PTM types in a de novo sequencing algorithm, yet to limit the number of PTM occurrences in each peptide to increase the accuracy. In this paper, we present an efficient de novo sequencing algorithm, DeNovoPTM, for such a purpose.
