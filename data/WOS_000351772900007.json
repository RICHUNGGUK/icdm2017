For indoor evacuation, due to the different characteristics of indoor and outdoor environments, it is not easy to monitor and query evacuation objects using existing methods. Therefore, in this study, a geographical information system (GIS)-oriented location model called the velocity range and marked cell (VRMC) model is established, which includes three processes: (1) the generation of indoor geometric spaces called indoor marked cells (IMCs) and two auxiliary structures, the connection matrix and the tendency cells, oriented by GIS; (2) the construction of a VRMC-tree index based on Equation (1) for efficiently supporting new emergency queries; and (3) usage of the interaction between the objects' velocities and the IMCs as an update strategy to filter the indoor positioning results. As demonstrated by simulative and real positioning data sets, the proposed model improves the query efficiency for evacuation objects, compared with existing indoor indexes and update strategies, and makes further progress toward resolving the trade-off between emergency query precision and server-side update costs.", "paper_title": "A GIS-oriented location model for supporting indoor evacuation", "paper_id": "WOS:000351772900007"}
