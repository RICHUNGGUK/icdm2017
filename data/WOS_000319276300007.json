A 16.8 Gbit/s binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) FD F-OFDM system over 480 km fiber transmission is experimentally demonstrated to validate the feasibility. BPSK and four amplitude phase-shift keying (4ASK) FD optical F-OFDM with optimized system parameters are numerically investigated and compared with IM direct-detection (DD) F-OFDM and IM FD conventional OFDM at the same spectral efficiency. It is shown that the proposed scheme, while avoiding the use of a coherent receiver, exhibits greatly improved dispersion tolerance over DD optical F-OFDM. It is robust to the phase noise induced in the full-field reconstruction. As a result, significant performance advantages over FD conventional OFDM is obtained.", "paper_title": "Intensity-Modulation Full-Field Detection Optical Fast OFDM", "paper_id": "WOS:000319276300007"}
