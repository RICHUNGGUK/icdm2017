This makes dynamic rescheduling necessary to respond to the disturbances and to improve the efficiency of the disturbed FMS. Compared with the static scheduling, the dynamic rescheduling relies on more effective and robust search approaches for its critical requirement of real-time optimal response. In this paper, a filtered-beam-search (FBS) -based heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the dynamic rescheduling problem in a large and complicated job shop FMS environment with realistic disturbances. To enhance its performance, the proposed algorithm makes improvement in the local/global evaluation functions and the generation procedure of branches. With respect to a due date-based objective (weighted quadratic tardiness), computational experiments are studied to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in comparison with those of other popular methods. The results show that the proposed FBS-based algorithm performs very well for dynamic rescheduling in terms of computational efficiency and solution quality. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
