Based on a bisimplicial graph representation we analyze the parameterized complexity of two problems central to such a decomposition: The FREE SQUARE BLOCK problem related to finding smallest subsystems that can be solved separately, and the BOUNDED BLOCK DECOMPOSITION problem related to determining a decomposition where the largest subsystem is as small as possible. We show both problems to be W[1]-hard. Finally we relate these problems to crown structures and settle two open questions regarding them using our results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
