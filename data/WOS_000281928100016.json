Grid workflow provides convenience for grid user to management and executes grid services. But it emphasizes process and no time-management, so a temporally constrained grid workflow model is pointed out based on grid flow with temporally constraint to schedule resources and manage time. Design/methodology/approach - The temporally constrained grid workflow model is distributed model: the federate has local temporal constraints and interactive temporal constraints among federates. The problem to manage time is a temporally distributed constraint satisfaction problem given deadline time and duration time of grid services. Multi-asynchronous weak-commitment search (AWS) algorithm is an approach to resolve DCSP, so a practical example of a simulation project-based grid system was presented to introduce application of Multi-AWS algorithm. Findings - The temporally constrained grid workflow is based temporal reasoning and grid workflow description about grid services. Originality/value - The new problem about scheduling resources and managing time in the grid-based simulation is pointed out; and the approach to resolve the problem is applied into a practical example.", "paper_title": "A scheduling model for temporally constrained grid workflow for distributed simulation system on grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000281928100016"}
