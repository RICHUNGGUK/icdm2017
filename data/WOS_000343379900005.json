The VPM method treats two different discretized moments of the physical fields, i.e. the volume integrated average (VIA) and the point values (PV) at the vertices of each cell, as the computational variables, which distinguishes it from conventional FVM. Given the local degrees of freedom in terms of VIA and PVs, we have properly designed the interpolation polynomials of reconstruction for quadrilateral and hexahedral mesh elements, which are then used to build a numerical formulation for incompressible viscous fluid dynamics. Numerical results of benchmark tests in both 2 and 3 dimensions are presented to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method, which shows significant improvement in comparison with conventional FVM. The proposed formulation provides a practical solver that is well-balanced between numerical accuracy and algorithmic complexity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
