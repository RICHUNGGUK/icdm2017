Tweets are now not only a means of status update and one-on-one communication, but they are also widely used for trend setting and marketing. The probability that the user will see a Tweet when he was offline at the time it was tweeted is very low. In order to increase the Tweet impact, it is important to determine the number of individuals online so that maximum number of users see the Tweets. This research focuses on identifying the individual users from Saudi Arabia based on the parameters already set for the conduct of this study. The time-stamped data for 1000 selected individuals is retrieved from Twitter and is analyzed accordingly. The number of online users is observed by recording the 'last seen' status. The retrieval of data is based on a number of experiments that was run at same time on all days of the week to reduce the inconsistent patterns. The data is then analyzed to see the time slots where the online user percentage is higher as compared to other time slots. The results of the study are focused to identify and recommend the timings when the Tweets are better valued and the impact is considerable.", "paper_title": "When are Tweets Better Valued?
