In this paper, we are interested in another aspect of queueing theory, the constructions of queues via switched delay lines (SDLs). We consider three types of discrete-time queues: linear compressors, nonovertaking delay lines, and flexible delay lines. These three types of queues correspond to certain conditional nonblocking switches and (in a strict sense) nonblocking switches in switching theory. Analogous to their counterparts in switching theory, there exist multistage constructions for these three types of queues. Specifically, we develop a two-stage construction of a linear compressor. For nonovertaking delay lines and flexible delay lines, however, we develop a three-stage construction. Moreover, a flexible delay line can also be constructed by a layered Cantor network. As applications of these constructions, we show two optical switch architectures that achieve exact emulation of output-buffered switches.", "paper_title": "Constructions of Linear Compressors, Nonovertaking Delay Lines, and Flexible Delay Lines for Optical Packet Switching", "paper_id": "WOS:000272844300025"}
