To the aim of theoretically and conceptually discuss the knowledge endowment required to a 'T-shaped' innovator, focus is on the notion of dynamic capabilities as characterizing the human side of service innovation. After a short introduction (Section 1), a model of the affirmation of the knowledge economy and the emergence of the consequent need for T-shaped innovators according to an escalation framework is presented (Section 2). Then, on the basis of the interpretation of T-shaped knowledge developed by adopting a Viable Systems Approach ((VSA)) perspective, conceptual links between the notions of incremental and radical innovation, on the one hand, and of capabilities and competences, on the other hand, are explored (Section 3). The paper findings provide a taxonomy of T-shaped innovators' capabilities that turn out to be more and more crucial to develop innovation in a context of growing complexity (Section 4). Finally, it moves on to discuss the organizational and technological aspects of management of T-shaped innovators (Section 5), outlining some managerial implications and future research paths (Section 6).", "paper_title": "Service economy, knowledge, and the need for T-shaped innovators", "paper_id": "WOS:000356936800018"}
