In particular, this randomness is controlled by a randomness level parameter, which influences the control parameters values' dynamics and their propagation through suitable individuals improvement contributions during ellitistic selection. Thereby, the randomness level parameter defines the chaotic behavior of self-adaptive control parameter values' instances. A Differential Evolution (DE) algorithm for Real Parameter Single Objective Optimization is utilized as an application of this mechanism, to analyze the impact of the randomness level parameter as used inside the evolutionary algorithm parameter adaptation and control mechanism, yielding statistically significant different algorithm performances and ranks on different randomness level parameter values. Moreover, the impacts of different randomness configurations on the number of improvements, improvement scales, and adaptation frequencies, are shown, in order to present a deeper insight into the influences and causes using different randomness level parameter configurations, to present the influence of randomization frequency on propagation stability. Since DE variant algorithms with the mechanism of control parameters self-adaptation are widely applied, this study might help in increasing the performances of these different variants and their applications.
