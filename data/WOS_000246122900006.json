Various radio access technologies have been deployed all over the world. The 4G mobile system was proposed to integrate all of these radio access technologies into a common network called the open wireless architecture (OWA) platform. As one of the main features of a 4G mobile system, always best connected (ABC) services enable users to choose the best available access networks in a way that best suits their needs. A new architecture capable of supporting ABC service is proposed in this study. There are three parts to the proposed architecture. First, a novel access discovery mechanism that integrates service location protocol and location-based service is presented. Second, a new personalized network selection scheme is put forward. Users can select their personalized \"best\" network by changing weight factors and constraints in a single objective optimization problem. Third, a seamless handover mechanism based on Mobile IPv6 is proposed. The mechanism supports end-to-end quality of service. Through analysis, this architecture demonstrates that it has benefits not only for network operators, but also for users.", "paper_title": "A new 4G architecture providing multimode terminals always best connected services", "paper_id": "WOS:000246122900006"}
