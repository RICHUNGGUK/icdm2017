Most of the current approaches to this problem are basically syntactic, as they focus either on the use of statistical techniques or on the analysis of the co-occurrences between the terms. This paper presents a novel topic discovery methodology, based on the mapping of hashtags to WordNet terms and their posterior clustering, in which semantics plays a centre role. The paper also presents a detailed case study in the field of Oncology, in which the discovered topics are thoroughly compared to a golden standard, showing promising results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
