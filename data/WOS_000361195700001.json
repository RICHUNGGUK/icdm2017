This paper models the MAC protocol of CSMA/CA using timed automata on the message communication and the energy harvesting and analyzes the protocol through model checking of the major CTL properties. The modeling and analysis of CSMA/CA protocol with the comparative experiments give some performance results and also reveal that timing error may cause deadlock, and the accessibility is satisfied if no deadlock exists.", "paper_title": "Modeling and Analyzing CSMA/CA Protocol for Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361195700001"}
