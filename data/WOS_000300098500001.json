As ambiguity and vagueness are natural and ever-present in real-life situations requiring solutions, it makes perfect sense to attempt to address them using fuzzy quadratic programming problems. This work presents two methods used to solve linear problems with uncertainties in the set of constraints, which are extended in order to solve fuzzy quadratic programming problems. Also, a new quadratic parametric method is proposed and it is shown that this proposal contains all optimal solutions obtained by the extended approaches with their satisfaction levels. A few numerical examples are presented to illustrate the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Extending and relating different approaches for solving fuzzy quadratic problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000300098500001"}
