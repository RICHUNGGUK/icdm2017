An aspect of this framework is how user input can be used to direct the learning process. We discuss some scenarios that illustrate the use of the INA framework in the context of advertising and show how a user's learned habits and intentions can be used to provide targeted and timely advertisements to the user We also provide some preliminary results on applying some of the learning techniques in a pilot study conducted among a group of volunteers whose activities and movements were monitored over time.
