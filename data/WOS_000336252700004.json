There are many sources of uncertainties in the process of cloud service trustworthiness evaluation. In addition to the intrinsic uncertainties, cloud service providers face the problem of discrepant evaluation information given by different users from different perspectives. To address these problems, we develop a novel fuzzy gap evaluation approach to assess cloud service trustworthiness and to provide evaluation values from different perspectives. From the evaluation values, the perception-importance, delivery-importance, and perception-delivery gaps are generated. These three gaps reflect the discrepancy evaluation of cloud service trustworthiness in terms of perception utility, delivery utility, and importance utility, respectively. Finally, the gap measurement of each perspective is represented by a belief structure and aggregated using the evidential reasoning approach to generate final evaluation results for informative and robust decision making. From this hybrid two-stage evaluation process, cloud service providers can get improvement suggestions from intermediate information derived from the gap measurement, which is the main advantage of this evaluation process.", "paper_title": "A novel two-stage model for cloud service trustworthiness evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336252700004"}
