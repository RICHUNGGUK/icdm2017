We make progress towards these goals by presenting a communicating automata perspective on neuronal networks. Specifically, we describe neuronal networks and their biological mechanisms using Data-rich Communicating Automata, which extend classic automata theory with rich data types and communication. We use two case studies to illustrate our approach. In the first case study, we model a number of learning frameworks, which vary in respect of their biological detail, for instance the Backpropagation (BP) and the Generalized Recirculation (GeneRec) learning algorithms. We then used the SPIN model checker to investigate a number of behavioral properties of the neural learning algorithms. SPIN is a well-known model checker for reactive distributed systems, which has been successfully applied to many non-trivial problems. The verification results show that the biologically plausible GeneRec learning is less stable than BP learning. In the second case study, we presented a large scale (cognitive-level) neuronal network, which models an attentional spotlight mechanism in the visual system. A set of properties of this model was verified using Uppaal, a popular real-time model checker. The results show that the asynchronous processing supported by concurrency theory is not only a more biologically plausible way to model neural systems, but also provides a better performance in cognitive modelling of the brain than conventional artificial neural networks that use synchronous updates. Finally, we compared our approach with several other related theories that apply formal methods to cognitive modelling. In addition, the practical implications of the approach are discussed in the context of neuronal network based controllers.", "paper_title": "Analysing neurobiological models using communicating automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000343878400004"}
