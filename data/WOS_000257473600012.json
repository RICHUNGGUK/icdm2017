Such a procedure aims to provide the set of Pareto-optimal solutions of a multiobjective combinatorial optimization problem. Unlike previous works on this issue, the bounding is performed here via a set of points rather than a single ideal point. The main idea is that a node in the search tree can be discarded if one can de. ne a separating hypersurface in the objective space between the set of feasible solutions in the subtree and the set of points corresponding to potential Pareto-optimal solutions. Numerical experiments on the biobjective spanning tree problem are provided that show the efficiency of the approach in a biobjective setting.", "paper_title": "A multiobjective branch-and-bound framework: Application to the biobjective spanning tree problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000257473600012"}
