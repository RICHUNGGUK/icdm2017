The typical display combines images acquired before the intervention with graphical representations of the instruments and also can include intraoperative image updates of the anatomy. Tracking systems indicate the location of surgical instruments relative to the patient's body, which helps guide the physician to the specific anatomical target. The authors' Image-Guided Software Toolkit contains the basic software components for developing an image-guided surgery system, including a component for controlling the tracker as well as a display component for overlaying images of patient anatomy and surgical instruments.", "paper_title": "IGSTK: An open source software toolkit for image-guided surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000236612600010"}
