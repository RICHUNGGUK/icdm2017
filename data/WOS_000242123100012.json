This paper presents a design and implementation of a secured GIS Web Service for mobile devices. As many mobile devices are equipped with GPS (Global Positioning System), it is required to handle the position information more effectively. We have extended the proxy program in the client device to actively send the context information to the server. Based on the context information the server determines the optimal service mode to a particular client. Because the Web service interfaces open network domain, proper security model should be incorporated for classified information. A working example of location-based secured GIS Web Service is presented. By using Web Service standards and XML messages we can achieve the maximal interoperability for heterogeneous mobile devices.", "paper_title": "Intelligent secure Web service using context information", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100012"}
