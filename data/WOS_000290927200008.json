In this work, the piroxicam polymorphic forms 1 and 2 were studied using near-infrared chemical imaging (NIR-CI) technology to map the distribution of both species in pharmaceutical formulations. In this direction, the partial least squares (PLS) method was used to construct calibration models of concentrations per pixel of the sample. The RMSEP results for both models of the polymorphic forms remained below 4% (w/w). It was also possible to distinguish local and global information of the constituents through this method. These results seem to be a suitable tool for quality process control and final product quality assurance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
