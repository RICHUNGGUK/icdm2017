Harmony search algorithm (HSA) is a music-inspired population-based meta-heuristic search and optimization algorithm. The concept behind the algorithm is to find a perfect state of harmony determined by aesthetic estimation. This paper starts with an overview of the harmonic phenomenon in music and music improvisation used by musicians and how it is applied to the optimization problem. The concept of harmony memory and its mathematical implementation are introduced. A review of HSA and its variants is presented. Guidelines from the literature on the choice of parameters used in HSA for effective solution of optimization problems are summarized.", "paper_title": "Harmony Search Algorithm and its Variants", "paper_id": "WOS:000365890200001"}
