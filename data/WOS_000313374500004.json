It is known that soft clustering using fuzzy c-means or its variants can provide a better and more meaningful data partition than hard clustering, which motivates us to develop a novel entropy regularized soft K-means algorithm for discriminant analysis (ResKmeans) in this paper. ResKmeans performs soft clustering and subspace selection simultaneously and thus gives rise to a generalized linear discriminant analysis (GELDA) which captures both the intra-cluster compactness and the inter-cluster separability. Furthermore, we clarify both the relationship between GELDA and conventional LDA and the inherent relationship between subspace selection and soft clustering. Experimental results on real-world data sets show ResKmeans is superior to other popular clustering algorithms. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
