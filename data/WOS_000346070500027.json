The optimality conditions for the resulting parametric programming problem are given by a set of simultaneous parametric polynomial equations which are solved analytically to give the parametric optimal solution as a function of the relaxed integer variables. Evaluation of the parametric optimal solution for integer variables fixed at their integer values followed by screening of the evaluated solutions gives the optimal solutions. (C) 2014 The Author.
