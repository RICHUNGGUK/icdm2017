Therefore, a structural recognition and mapping of eigenvalues, representing the dynamics, to circuit elements via circuit variables is presented. Additionally, the introduction of reachability analysis is significantly restricting the investigated state space to the relevant parts, avoiding false negatives. The newly introduced methods are compared to existing ones by application to industrial examples.", "paper_title": "Advanced methods for equivalence checking of analog circuits with strong nonlinearities", "paper_id": "WOS:000278402900003"}
