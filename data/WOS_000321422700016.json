The existing signal model is not appropriate to approximate parameters in this case. In this paper, we propose a new signal model to accurately estimate parameters of the target. We use a novel approach, the fractional ambiguity function, to estimate Doppler frequency parameters in the fractional Fourier transform domain. Furthermore, we also develop two sub-array models to accurately estimate the direction-of-departure and direction-of-arrival by employing the proposed fractional cross-ambiguity function based MUSIC (FCAF-MUSIC) algorithm and the fractional cross-ambiguity function based ESPRIT (FCAF-ESPRIT) algorithm. Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
