The performance of an SCR-DeNO(x) system is sensitive to the installment of its components such as turning vanes and hybrid grids. In this work, three-dimensional CFD simulations are carried out to analyze the breakage failure of an SCR-DeNO(x) system for a certain 350 MW coal-fired power plant. Research results are consistent with the phenomena that occur in the industrial application. It reveals that the breakage failure in the industrial application is likely to be caused by the inappropriate installation of the turning vane 3 locating closest to the catalyst, especially the angle of the turning vane 3. The analysis further shows that the lifetime or the breakage of the catalyst layers depends highly on the gas velocity, the fly ash distribution and its particle velocity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
