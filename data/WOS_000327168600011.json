In most previous studies, however, these important aspects were not considered. Emotion recognition has been considered as a classification problem. In this paper, we attempt new approaches to utilize a person's situational information and personality for use in understanding emotion. We propose a method of extracting situational information and building a personalized emotion model for reflecting the personality of each character in the text. To extract and utilize situational information, we propose a situation model using lexical and syntactic information. In addition, to reflect the personality of an individual, we propose a personalized emotion model using KBANN (Knowledge-based Artificial Neural Network). Our proposed system has the advantage of using a traditional keyword-spotting algorithm. In addition, we also reflect the fact that the strength of emotion decreases over time. Experimental results show that the proposed system can more accurately and intelligently recognize a person's emotion than previous methods.", "paper_title": "Personalized Emotion Recognition Considering Situational Information and Time Variance of Emotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000327168600011"}
