The approach allow us to approximate Pareto front more accurately than other known algorithms in competitive time. To show and check advantageous properties of the proposed approach, the new solution algorithm, called VESA, was implemented for the case of bi-criteria flow shop scheduling problem and tested against a number of high-quality benchmarks known in the literature. Vector processing technologies are used to enhance the efficiency of solution search and acceptance rates for the extended simulated annealing metaheuristic. Results are compared using, among others, the independent Hyper-Volume Indicator (I-H) measure. Computer test of VESA confirms excellent approximation of the Pareto front. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
