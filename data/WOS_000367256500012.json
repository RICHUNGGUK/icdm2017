The challenge is to reason about the combination of local directory update and global pathname traversal (including '..' and symbolic links) which may overlap the directories being updated. Existing reasoning techniques are either based on first-order logic and do not scale, or on separation logic and can only handle linear pathnames (no '..' or symbolic links). We introduce fusion logic for reasoning about local update and global pathname traversal, introducing a novel effect frame rule to propagate the effect of a local update on overlapping pathnames. We apply our reasoning to the standard recursive remove utility (rm -r), discovering bugs in well-known implementations.", "paper_title": "Reasoning about the POSIX File System Local Update and Global Pathnames", "paper_id": "WOS:000367256500012"}
