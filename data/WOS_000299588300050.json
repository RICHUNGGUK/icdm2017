However, there are still more researches on ECC than on HECC. One of the reasons is that the computation of scalar multiplication cannot catch up. The Kummer surface can speed up the scalar multiplication in genus two curves. In this paper, we find that the scalar multiplication formulas of Duquesne in characteristic p > 3 on the Kummer surface are not correct. We verify and revise the formulas with mathematical software. The operation counts become 29M + 2S for new pseudo-addition formulas and 30M + 10S for doubling ones. And then we speed up the scalar multiplication on the Kummer surface with Euclidean addition chains.", "paper_title": "Scalar Multiplication on Kummer Surface Revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000299588300050"}
