Available work in this research field considered the infinite buffer scenario, so that buffer overflow will never occur. Obviously, in realistic ad hoc networks, the node buffer size is strictly bounded, which leads to unavoidable packet loss. Once a packet is dropped by a relay node, the bandwidth consumption for the previous transmission is actually wasted. We define the extra wasted bandwidth as the packet loss (PL) overhead. A theoretical analysis framework based on G/G/1/K queuing model is provided, to estimate the PL overhead for any specific routing protocols. Then, with this framework, we propose a distributed routing algorithm termed as novel load-balancing cognitive routing (NLBCR). The OPNET network simulator is further conducted to compare the performance among the NLBCR, AODV and CRP. The results indicate that NLBCR can reduce routing overhead to a considerable extent, as well as improve the network throughput and decrease the end-to-end delay.", "paper_title": "On the packet loss overhead in buffer-limited ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000339380200030"}
