CTG consists of the simultaneous recording of fetal heart rate (FHR) signal and uterine contractions and its interpretation is usually performed through visual inspection by trained obstetric personnel. To reduce inter-and intraobserver variabilities and to improve the efficacy of prenatal diagnosis, new quantitative parameters, extracted from the CTG digitized signals, have been proposed as additional tools in the clinical diagnosis process. In this paper, a new parameter computed on FHR time series and based on the phase-rectified signal average curve (PRSA) is introduced. It is defined as acceleration phase-rectified slope (APRS) or deceleration phase-rectified slope (DPRS) depending on the slope sign of the PRSA curve. The new PRSA parameter was applied to FHR time series of 61 healthy and 61 intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses during CTG nonstress tests. Performance of APRS and DPRS was compared with 1) the results provided by other parameters extracted from the PRSA curve itself but already existing in the literature, and 2) other clinical indices provided by computerized cardiotocographic systems. APRS and DPRS indices performed better than any other parameter in this study in the distinction between healthy and IUGR fetuses. Our results suggest this new index might reliably contribute to the quality of early fetal diagnosis.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Assessment of Fetal Well-Being Through CTG Recordings: A New Parameter Based on Phase-Rectified Signal Average", "paper_id": "WOS:000324581200009"}
