To overcome the problem, revision operators for revising default theories have been investigated by many researchers. But none of them has discussed the postulates which are desirable to be satisfied by the operators for revision of default theories, especially the operators for iterated revision. In this paper, we reformulate the existing postulates for belief revision and iterated belief revision. to default logic, and show that some of the reformulated postulates are rational to govern the process of revising default theories while others are not. A representation theorem for those reasonable postulates is provided.", "paper_title": "ITERATED REVISION IN DEFAULT LOGIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000272567000011"}
