In 2006, the IEEE P1363.3 committee has defined the ID-based public-key system with bilinear pairings as one of public-key cryptography standards. In this, an authenticated key agreement (AKA) protocol is one important issue that provides mutual authentication and key exchange between two parties. Owing to the fast growth of mobile networks, the computational cost on the client side with low-power computing devices is a critical factor in designing an AKA protocol suited for mobile networks. In this paper, we present an efficient and secure ID-based mutual authentication and key exchange protocol using bilinear pairings. Performance analysis and experimental data are given to demonstrate that our proposed protocol is well suited for a client-server environment with low-power mobile devices. In comparison with the recently proposed ID-based protocols, our protocol has the best performance on the client side.", "paper_title": "An ID-Based Mutual Authentication and Key Exchange Protocol for Low-Power Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000280704000014"}
