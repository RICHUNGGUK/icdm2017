In order to reduce the computation complexity, PCA is first used to reduce the dimension. In addition, before using F-LDA, we transform the pooled within-class scatter matrix into an identity matrix. The proposed method is tested on AR and UMIST face databases. Experiment results show that our method gains higher classification accuracy than other existing methods used in the experiment.", "paper_title": "PCA plus F-LDA: A new approach to face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000251719800006"}
