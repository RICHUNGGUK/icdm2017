We exhibit a theory T-1 such that satisfiability is decidable, but satisfiability in infinite models is undecidable. It follows that satisfiability in T-1 boolean OR T-2 is undecidable, whenever T-2 has only infinite models, even if signatures are disjoint and satisfiability in T-2 is decidable. In the second part of the paper we strengthen the Nelson-Oppen decidability transfer result, by showing that it applies to theories over disjoint signatures, whose satisfiability problem, in either arbitrary or infinite models, is decidable. We show that this result covers decision procedures based on rewriting, complementing recent work on combination of theories in the rewrite-based approach to satisfiability.", "paper_title": "Decidability and undecidability results for Nelson-Oppen and rewrite-based decision procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085600042"}
