It has therefore received a considerable amount of research interest, which in its turn has led to a wide range of approaches for measuring semantic similarity. However, these measures are usually limited to handling specific types of linguistic item, e.g., single word senses or entire sentences. Hence, for a downstream application to handle various types of input, multiple measures of semantic similarity are needed, measures that often use different internal representations or have different output scales. In this article we present a unified graph-based approach for measuring semantic similarity which enables effective comparison of linguistic items at multiple levels, from word senses to full texts. Our method first leverages the structural properties of a semantic network in order to model arbitrary linguistic items through a unified probabilistic representation, and then compares the linguistic items in terms of their representations. We report state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets pertaining to three different levels: senses, words, and texts. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
