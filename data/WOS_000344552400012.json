Different parallel implementations of the Power method and the proposed variants are analyzed using different data distribution strategies. The reported experiments show the behavior and effectiveness of the designed algorithms for realistic test data using either OpenMP, MPI or an hybrid OpenMP/MPI approach to exploit the benefits of shared memory inside the nodes of current SMP supercomputers.", "paper_title": "Parallel relaxed and extrapolated algorithms for computing PageRank", "paper_id": "WOS:000344552400012"}
