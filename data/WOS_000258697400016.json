The CoMFA study has been performed with a training, set of 59 compounds, testing 3 three alignments and four charge schemes (DFT, HF, AM1, and PM3) and using defaults probe atom (Csp(3) +1 charge), cutoffs (30 kcal center dot mol(-1) for both steric and electrostatic fields), and grid distance (2.0 angstrom). The best model (N = 59), derived from Alignment 1 and PM3 charges, shows q(2) = 0.691, SE(cv) = 0.475, optimum number of components = 6, r(2) = 0.930, SEE = 0.226, and F-value = 115.544. The steric and electrostatic contributions for the best model were 43.2% and 56.8%, respectively. The external predictive ability (r(2) pred 0.918) of the resultant best model was evaluated using a test set of 15 compounds. In order to design more potent DABO analogues as anti-HIV/AIDS agents, attention should be taken in order to select a substituent for the 4-oxopyrimidine ring, since, as revealed by the best CoMFA model. there are a steric restriction at the C2-position, a electron-rich group restriction at the C6-position (para-substituent of the 6-benzyl group), and a steric allowed region at the C5-position.", "paper_title": "3D-QSAR CoMFA of a series of DABO derivatives as HIV-1 reverse transcriptase non-nucleoside inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000258697400016"}
