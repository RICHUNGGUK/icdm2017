A set G of points on the terrain is called a guarding set if every point on the terrain is seen by some point in G. In the 1.5D terrain guarding problem we are given a 1.5D terrain and the goal is to find the minimum guarding set for the given input terrain. It is proved that this problem is NP-hard and the only previous theoretical results for this problem involve approximation. In this paper, we turn to fixed-parameter tractability. We present \"depth of terrain onion peeling\" as a new geometric parameter. Based on this parameter, we give an upper bound for the treewidth of the terrain visibility graph. By presenting a dynamic programming algorithm, we show that the 1.50 terrain guarding problem is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to this parameter. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
