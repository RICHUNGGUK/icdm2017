A meet-in-the-middle approach has been followed for constructing the feasible design space. It is constructed as the intersection of an application-bounded specification space and a circuit-realizable specification space. The least squares support vector machine principle is used to accurately identify the actual geometry of the feasible design space. The reduced design space speeds up the exploration procedure. The benefit of our methodology is the ability to obtain practically correct circuit-level specifications of the component blocks of the system in a single pass. The effectiveness of the procedure has been demonstrated by considering a complete system. The simulation results satisfy the desired specifications of the system, validating the overall procedure.", "paper_title": "A fast exploration procedure for analog high-level specification translation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258030600012"}
