For any fixed genus the locus of such curves is a rational variety. We show that for every point in this locus the field of moduli is a field of definition. Moreover, there exists a rational model y(2) = F(x) or y(2) = x F(x) of the curve over its field of moduli where F(x) can be chosen to be decomposable in x(2) or x(5). While similar equations have been given in (Bujalance et al. in Mm. Soc. Math. Fr. No. 86, 2001) over R, this is the first time that these equations are given over the field of moduli of the curve.", "paper_title": "Hyperelliptic curves with reduced automorphism group A(5)", "paper_id": "WOS:000243923900002"}
