First, the stability margin is investigated based on the minimum distance of the Mikhailov hodograph to the origin or on the minimum distance of the closed-loop poles to the unit circle. The gradients with respect to the output state controller matrix are derived and applied for stepwise, improving the dynamics of the closed-loop system. Second, the maximum admissible uncertainty of the plant is considered based on the unstructured type of uncertainty. For robustification, gradients to attain maximum admissible uncertainty are introduced.", "paper_title": "Robustness gradients for discrete-time control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237164000001"}
