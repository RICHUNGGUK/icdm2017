Unlike most midlevel feature learning methods, which focus on the process of coding or pooling, we emphasize that the mechanism of image composition also strongly influences the feature extraction. To effectively explore the image content for the feature extraction, we model a multiplicity feature representation mechanism through meaningful hierarchical image decomposition followed by a fusion step. In particularly, we first propose a new hierarchical image decomposition approach in which each image is decomposed into a series of hierarchical semantical components, i.e., the structure and texture images. Then, different feature extraction schemes can be adopted to match the decomposed structure and texture processes in a dissociative manner. Here, two schemes are explored to produce property related feature representations. One is based on a single-stage network over hand-crafted features and the other is based on a multistage network, which can learn features from raw pixels automatically. Finally, those multiple midlevel features are incorporated by solving a multiple kernel learning task. Extensive experiments are conducted on several challenging data sets for visual classification, and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Decomposition and Extraction: A New Framework for Visual Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000340099800006"}
