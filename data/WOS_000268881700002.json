Using bibliometric method, we quantitatively analyze international collaboration publication output between China and the G7 countries based on Science Citation Index. The results indicate that international collaboration publication output between China and the G7 countries has shown exponential growth aroused by the growth of science in China. USA is the most important collaboration country and the international collaboration between China and the G7 countries display differences at each research field.", "paper_title": "International scientific collaboration of China with the G7 countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000268881700002"}
