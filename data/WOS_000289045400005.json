The purpose of this paper is to describe development of a new discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based approach for detection of winding interturn faults. Design/methodology/approach - The following approach was accomplished for development of the proposed fault detection method in this study. The DWT was first applied to decompose the terminal current signals of a transformer, which in turn were obtained from simulations using a finite elements method model of the transformer, into a series of wavelet components. Based on the characteristic features associated with interturn faults extracted from the decomposed waveforms of the terminal currents, a detection scheme was developed. An experimental setup was used to validate the proposed detection method. Findings - The results of this study demonstrate the efficacy of DWT applied on terminal currents of the transformer to identify interturn faults on the windings well before such faults lead to a catastrophic failure. It is believed that, based on the present findings, there definitely exists scope for improving interturn fault diagnosis with wavelet transform. Research limitations/implications - Performing more detailed studies to find all relevant characteristics of the wavelet transform in this application, identifying the location of the faulted turns along winding, applying the method for indicating early stages of turn insulation deterioration and evaluating other type of wavelets for this application would be some future directions of this research. Practical implications - With the proposed method, it is becoming possible to detect early signs of the fault occurrence, so that the necessary corrective actions can be taken to prevent long-lasting outages and reduce down times of the faulty power transformer. The method will be particularly useful as a complement for the classical protection devices of the power transformers. Originality/value - Some recent studies have been carried out regarding the application of DWT for discrimination between an internal fault and other disturbances such as magnetizing inrush and external faults. This paper extends those studies for the detection of interturn faults using more quantitative and qualitative characteristics features.", "paper_title": "A DWT-based approach for detection of interturn faults in power transformers", "paper_id": "WOS:000289045400005"}
