The important cognition is the fact that without an application infrastructure it is not possible to design a universal data format for data exchange which allows mutual transformation of any data without non returnable distortion. The paper shows the data, exchange scenarios that help to solve this problem. The proxy management and differential conversion are introduced. The proxy management is based on storing an additional data in the transformed files. The main pillar of the differential conversion is the log of changes and identifiers' mapping. Both strategies are focused on the problems of the cyclic conversions used during the iterative model/drawing creation and both involve the agents that manage additional data structures, which help to correct the data during backward import.", "paper_title": "Data exchange in CAD during iterative work with heterogeneous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500004"}
