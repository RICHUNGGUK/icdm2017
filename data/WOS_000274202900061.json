The nonlinear fuzzy network model were adopted to test and verify the sample data. The method of convenience sampling was employed and the questionnaires were distributed through e-mail sending, or were brought back by selected consumers, or were filled in on-line by access to the designated website. A total of 550 questionnaires were returned, giving a response rate of 35.6%. It concluded from the factor loading that among the three independent variables in this study, product marketing attracts customers most in respect to the \"Marketing Mix\", The possibility of misunderstanding information is higher in respect to the \"Perceived Risk\" of information from customers. The close relationship of the family works more effectively for decision making in respect to the \"Subjective Norms\". The three latent independent variables of \"Marketing Mix\", \"Perceived Risk\" and \"Subjective Norms\" are the three key factors that directly or indirectly influence the \"Attitude\" and the \"Behavioral Intention\" in this study.
