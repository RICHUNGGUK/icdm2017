The adaptation is based on (a) the quality of service parameters of available services, allowing for tailoring their execution to the diverse needs of individual users and (b) collaborative filtering techniques, allowing clients to further refine the adaptation process by considering service selections made by other clients, in the context of the same business processes. The proposed framework also caters maintaining the transactional semantics that invocations to multiple services offered by the same provider may bear. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
