To many, the massive data generated or captured by IoT are considered having highly useful and valuable information. Data mining will no doubt play a critical role in making this kind of system smart enough to provide more convenient services and environments. This paper begins with a discussion of the IoT. Then, a brief review of the features of \"data from IoT\" and \"data mining for IoT' is given. Finally, changes, potentials, open issues, and future trends of this field are addressed.", "paper_title": "Data Mining for Internet of Things: A Survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000338700900006"}
