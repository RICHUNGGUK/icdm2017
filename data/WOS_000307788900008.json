A key feature in P1687 is to include Segment Insertion Bits (SIBs) in the scan path to allow flexibility both in designing the instrument access network and in scheduling the access to instruments. This paper presents algorithms to compute the overall access time (OAT) for a given P1687 network. The algorithms are based on analysis for flat and hierarchical network architectures, considering two access schedules, i.e., concurrent schedule and sequential schedule. In the analysis, two types of overhead are identified, i.e., network configuration data overhead and JTAG protocol overhead. The algorithms are implemented and employed in a parametric analysis and in experiments on realistic industrial designs.", "paper_title": "Access Time Analysis for IEEE P1687", "paper_id": "WOS:000307788900008"}
