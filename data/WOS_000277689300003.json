A tactical supply chain planning problem has been formulated as a fuzzy mixed integer linear programming model where data are ill-known and modeled by fuzzy numbers with modified s-curve membership functions. The fuzzy model provides alternative decision plans to the decision maker (DM) for different degrees of satisfaction. Finally, the proposed model is tested by using data from a real automobile supply chain.", "paper_title": "FUZZY LINEAR PROGRAMMING FOR SUPPLY CHAIN PLANNING UNDER UNCERTAINTY", "paper_id": "WOS:000277689300003"}
