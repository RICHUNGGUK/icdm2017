In this paper, a novel MIMO-OFDM system is proposed, in which the modulation and demodulation of the symbols are implemented by the fractional Fourier transform instead of traditional Fourier transform. Through selecting the optimal order of the fractional Fourier transform, the modulated signals can match the time-varying channel characteristics, which results in a mitigation of the intercarrier interference. Furthermore, an algorithm is presented for selecting the optimal order of fractional Fourier transform, and the impact of system parameters on the optimal order is analyzed. Simulation results show that the proposed system can concentrate the power of desired signal effectively and improve the performance over rapidly time-varying channels with respect to the traditional MIMO-OFDM system.", "paper_title": "MIMO-OFDM system based on fractional Fourier transform and selecting algorithm for optimal order", "paper_id": "WOS:000258286200014"}
