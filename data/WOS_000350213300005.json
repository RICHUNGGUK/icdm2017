Based on the human vision mechanism, we propose a new method, which creates a saliency map of the input image that can quantitatively evaluate the degree to which the target and surrounding background differ with respect to color brightness and space distribution. Then, we use this saliency map to evaluate the effect of camouflage design. Experimental results demonstrate that the saliency map is an effective approach for evaluating camouflage design.", "paper_title": "Camouflage texture evaluation using a saliency map", "paper_id": "WOS:000350213300005"}
