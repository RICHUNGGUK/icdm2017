Atlas enables fine-grained, accurate and scalable application classification in SDN. It employs a machine learning (ML) based traffic classification technique, a crowd-sourcing approach to obtain ground truth data and leverages SDN's data reporting mechanism and centralized control. We prototype Atlas on HP Labs wireless networks and observe 94% accuracy on average, for top 40 Android applications.", "paper_title": "Application-Awareness in SDN", "paper_id": "WOS:000327465900060"}
