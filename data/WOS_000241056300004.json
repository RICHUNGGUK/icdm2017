These algorithms aim for a reconstruction from the features that is visually close to the image from which the features are extracted. Degrees of freedom that are not fixed by the constraints are disambiguated with the help of a so-called prior (i.e. a user defined model). We propose a linear reconstruction framework that generalizes a previously proposed scheme. The algorithm greatly reduces the complexity of the reconstruction process compared to non-linear methods. As an example we propose a specific prior and apply it to the reconstruction from singular points. The reconstruction is visually more attractive and has a smaller L(2)-error than the reconstructions obtained by previously proposed linear methods.", "paper_title": "A linear image reconstruction framework based on Sobolev type inner products", "paper_id": "WOS:000241056300004"}
