In addition to good performance, the method has two attracting properties: It does not change the structure of the main controller, and therefore, the theoretically proven characteristics of the system are untouched. and it is simply implementable in practice. The proposed controller structure is applied on a flexible joint robot (FJR). The robust stability of the closed loop system for an n-DOF FJR is thoroughly analyzed and the proposed controller is implemented on a laboratory setup to show the ease of implementation and the resulting closed-loop performance. The main controller used for the n-DOF FJR consists of a composite structure, with a PD controller on the fast dynamics and a PD controller on the slow dynamics. The bandwidth of the fast controller is decreased during critical occasions with the fuzzy logic supervisor, which adjusts the loop gain to a proper level. Using Lyapunov direct method, the robust stability of the overall system is analyzed in presence of modeling uncertainties, and it is shown that if the PD and the PID gains are tuned to satisfy certain conditions. the closed loop system becomes UUB stable.
