Moreover, this article extends the algorithm to provide a heuristic solution for the inventory replenishment model with a two-segment linear function in demand called the 'two-segment piecewise linear demand model'. In addition, this article proposes a general procedure for solving both models. Meanwhile, several examples taken from the literature illustrate our algorithm for these two models with convincing results. Furthermore, this study shows that when the demand is a two-segment piecewise linear function over time, it is better to use the proposed algorithm rather than devising a decoupled solution approach by treating segments separately. Finally, a sensitivity analysis of two factors, demand and cost, is performed. The model is highly extensible and applicable, so it can serve as an inventory planning tool to solve the replenishment problem.", "paper_title": "Modelling of the inventory replenishment problem with a two-segment piecewise linear demand", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400003"}
