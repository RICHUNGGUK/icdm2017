Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) improves lumen visualization, but lumen segmentation remains challenging owing to varying intensities, CEUS-specific artifacts and lack of tissue visualization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel method using simultaneously acquired BMUS&CEUS image sequences. Initially, the method estimates nonrigid motion (NME) from the image sequences, using intensity-based image registration. The motion-compensated image sequence is then averaged to obtain a single \"epitome\" image with improved signal-to-noise ratio. The lumen is segmented from the epitome image through an intensity joint-histogram classification and a graph-based segmentation. NME was validated by comparing displacements with manual annotations in 11 carotids. The average root mean square error (RMSE) was 112 +/- 73 mu m. Segmentation results were validated against manual delineations in the epitome images of two different datasets, respectively containing 11 (RMSE 191 +/- 43 mu m) and 10 (RMSE 351 +/- 176 mu m) carotids. From the deformation fields, we derived arterial distensibility with values comparable to the literature. The average errors in all experiments were in the inter-observer variability range. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study exploiting combined BMUS&CEUS images for atherosclerotic carotid lumen segmentation.", "paper_title": "Lumen Segmentation and Motion Estimation in B-Mode and Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Images of the Carotid Artery in Patients With Atherosclerotic Plaque", "paper_id": "WOS:000352533200014"}
