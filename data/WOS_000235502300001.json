We also modify Tanaka et al's definition and extend the new usage on vague fault-tree analysis in terms of finding most important basic system component for managerial decision-making. In numerical verification, the fault of automatic gun is presented as a numerical example. For advanced experiment, a fault tree for the reactor protective system is adopted as simulation example and we compare the results with other methods. This paper also develops vague fault tree decision support systems (VFTDSS) to generate fault-tree, fault-tree nodes, then directly compute the vague fault-tree interval, traditional reliability, and vague reliability interval.", "paper_title": "The reliability of general vague fault-tree analysis on weapon systems fault diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000235502300001"}
