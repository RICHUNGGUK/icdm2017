A statistical design methodology is then developed to improve the economic merit of a design considering frequency binning and product price profile. A low-complexity sensitivity-based gate sizing algorithm is developed to improve economic gain of a design over its initial yield-optimized design. Finally, we present an integrated design methodology for simultaneous sizing and bin boundary determination to enhance profit under an area constraint. Experiments on a set of ISCAS'85 benchmarks show in average 19% improvement in profit for simultaneous sizing and bin boundary determination, considering both leakage power dissipation and delay bounds compared to a design initially optimized for 90% yield at iso-area in 70-nm bulk CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Profit aware circuit design under process variations considering speed binning", "paper_id": "WOS:000257196500003"}
