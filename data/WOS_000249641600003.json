The time delays are assumed to appear in both the state and the control input. The purpose is the design of a state-feedback fuzzy controller such that the resulting closed-loop system is asymptotically stable in the mean square. A delay-dependent condition for the solvability of this problem is obtained in terms of relaxed linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). By solving these LMIs, a desired controller can be obtained. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the present results. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
