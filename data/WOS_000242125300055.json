Each agent is assumed to operate on an infinite sequence of behaviors modeled by a finite state machine, which is represented by a discrete asynchronous mathematical model on a higher-level. The results on the convergence of the synchronous model are used in the proof of convergence of the asynchronous system. Numerical simulations are also performed to verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Asynchronous cyclic pursuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000242125300055"}
