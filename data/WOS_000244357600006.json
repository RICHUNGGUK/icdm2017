The semi-empirical quantum chemical method (PM3) in Gaussian98 was employed to calculate a set of molecular descriptors of pigments. Using multiple linear regression (MLR), we obtained empirical functions with high correlation coefficient between retention times and quantum-chemical descriptors. This analysis indicated that the proposed QSRR models were satisfactory. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
