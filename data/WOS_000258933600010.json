This result is based on our observation that the index, where the first byte of the keystream output is chosen from, is approximately twice more likely to be 2 than any other value. Our technique is further used to theoretically prove Roos's experimental observation (A class of weak keys in the RC4 stream cipher, 1995) related to weak keys.", "paper_title": "On non-negligible bias of the first output byte of RC4 towards the first three bytes of the secret key", "paper_id": "WOS:000258933600010"}
