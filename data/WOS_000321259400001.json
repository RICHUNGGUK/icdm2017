It also shows the educational results obtained in the teaching experiences where it has been used. The environment created makes it possible to replace real practices with virtual simulations where the student must make the proper metrological decisions and make the necessary calculations to determine the instruments' expanded uncertainty. This software has shown to be a very useful and efficient tool in training the distance learning students in the course titled: Calibration Plan for Ensuring Quality in Industrial Laboratories, offered by Technical University of Madrid. Furthermore, some very notable academic results have been achieved among students from two pilot groups for the Mechanical Engineering degree program. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
