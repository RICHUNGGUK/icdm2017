In this work, we will study this technique on wireless Ad-Hoc networks. To reduce the cost and complexity, we propose a modified Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to obtain the maximum flow and encoding nodes in a network. We also find a Conflict Phenomenon in undirected networks that can not be solved by network coding. Furthermore, we will show that the maximum flow value from a source to a destination is approximately Poisson distributed, and the number of encoding nodes is close to geometric distribution.", "paper_title": "On network coding in wireless ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000206343700003"}
