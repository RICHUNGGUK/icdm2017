This extends previous results by Hon et al. [ISAAC 2003] achieving O(log n/log log n) time for rank and select but Theta(polylog(n)) amortized time for inserting and deleting bits, and requiring n + o(n) bits of space; and by Raman et al. [SODA 2002] which have constant query time but a static structure. In particular, our result becomes the first entropy-bound dynamic data structure for rank and select over bit sequences. We then show how the above result can be used to build a dynamic full-text self-index for a collection of texts over an alphabet of size sigma, of overall length n and zero-order entropy H-o. The index requires nHo + o(n log o) bits of space, and can count the number of occurrences of a pattern of length m in time O(m log n log sigma). Reporting the occ occurrences can be supported in O(occ log(2) n log sigma) time, paying O(n) extra space. Insertion of text to the collection takes O(log n log sigma) time per symbol, which becomes O(log(2) n log sigma) for deletions. This improves a previous result by Chan et al. [CPM 2004]. As a consequence, we obtain an O(n log n log sigma) time construction algorithm for a compressed self-index requiring nH(o) + o(n log sigma) bits working space during construction.", "paper_title": "Dynamic entropy-compressed sequences and full-text indexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421700028"}
