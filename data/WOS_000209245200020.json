The formal process algebra communicating sequential processes (CSP) was used to specify the system functionality. Automated model checking established, beyond reasonable doubt, important system properties, such as freedom from deadlock and livelock. Once these properties were established, the functionality was translated into an implementation which realizes high speed data transmission between two independent IC chips. Normal and failure case testing ensured that the implementation complies with the specification. This work shows how formal and model driven design methodologies speed up the process of turning ideas into physical problem solutions. More specifically, formal modeling gave usfirm understanding and deep insight of the system functionality which enabled us to implement and to select correct system components.", "paper_title": "FORMAL AND MODEL DRIVEN DESIGN OF A HIGH SPEED DATA TRANSMISSION CHANNEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200020"}
