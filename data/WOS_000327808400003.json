A new approach is introduced that identifies the specific yield hyper-planes associated with all critical sections avoiding all irrelevant alternatives. This results into substantial reduction of the size of the yield and complementarity conditions. In addition, it has a beneficial effect in addressing multi-linear hardening and/or softening holonomic behavior by controlling the size of the problem. Numerical examples are presented that verify the efficiency of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
