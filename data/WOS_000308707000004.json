In this paper we show that computing the stretch factor of a rectilinear path in L-1 plane has a lower bound of Omega(n log n) in the algebraic computation tree model and describe a worst-case O(sigma n log(2) n) time algorithm for computing the stretch factor or maximum detour of a path embedded in the plane with a weighted fixed orientation metric defined by sigma >= 2 vectors and a worst-case O (n log(d) n) time algorithm to d >= 3 dimensions in L-1-metric. We generalize the algorithms to compute the stretch factor or maximum detour of trees and cycles in O (sigma n log(d+1) n) time. We also obtain an optimal O (n) time algorithm for computing the maximum detour of a monotone rectilinear path in L-1 plane.", "paper_title": "COMPUTING THE STRETCH FACTOR AND MAXIMUM DETOUR OF PATHS, TREES, AND CYCLES IN THE NORMED SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000308707000004"}
