Action-GDL provides a unifying perspective of several dynamic programming DCOP algorithms that are based on GDL, such as DPOP and DCPOP algorithms. We empirically show how Action-GDL using a novel distributed post-processing heuristic can outperform DCPOP, and by extension DPOP, even when the latter uses the best arrangement provided by multiple state-of-the-art heuristics.", "paper_title": "Constructing a unifying theory of dynamic programming DCOP algorithms via the generalized distributive law", "paper_id": "WOS:000289680900004"}
