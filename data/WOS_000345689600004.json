Unconstrained likelihood inferences for generalized linear models (GLMs) with nonignorable missing covariates have been studied extensively in the literature. However, parameter orderings or constraints may occur naturally in practice, and thus the efficiency of a statistical method may be improved by incorporating parameter constraints into the likelihood function. In this paper, we consider constrained inference for analysing GLMs with nonignorable missing covariates under linear inequality constraints on the model parameters. Specifically, constrained maximum likelihood (ML) estimation is based on the gradient projection expectation maximization approach. Further, we investigate the asymptotic null distribution of the constrained likelihood ratio test (LRT). Simulations study the empirical properties of the constrained ML estimators and LRTs, which demonstrate improved precision of these constrained techniques. An application to contaminant levels in an environmental study is also presented.", "paper_title": "Constrained inference for generalized linear models with incomplete covariate data", "paper_id": "WOS:000345689600004"}
