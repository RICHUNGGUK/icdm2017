Such low cost and reliable structures without active control and with a minimum number of sensors can be efficient only if the system design parameters are mutually adapted through an integrated optimal design approach. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the effectiveness of a passive WT with regard to the variations of PMSG electrical parameters. Design/methodology/approach - This work is more specifically devoted to the sensitivity analysis of a passive WT system according to the electrical variable variations of a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG). It also investigates the interest of a robust design approach for reducing the sensitivity of the WT efficiency to the most influencing variables. Findings - It is shown that efficiency of the passive WI system is rather sensitive to the variation of the stator flux and DC voltage at the system output. Originality/value - A robust design approach is investigated in order to reduce the passive WT sensitivity to the stator flux and DC voltage variations.", "paper_title": "Robust design of a passive wind turbine system", "paper_id": "WOS:000305299400016"}
