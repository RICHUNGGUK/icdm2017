In this work, we studied the electronic structure of bisnoaradamantene, as well as those of its cation and dication, which are previously unreported carbonium ions. According to QTAIM and MO analysis, there is a 3c-2e bonding system in the bisnoradamantenyl cation and a 4c-2e bonding system in the bisnoradamantenyl dication. A topological study indicated that, on going from bisnoradamantene to its dication, pi-bond interaction with the bridgehead carbon atom increases. Additional study of the bisnoradamantanyl dication also indicated that it has two multicenter bonding systems. Comparison of the D3BIA and NICS aromaticity indices of these molecules and other derivatives indicates that these indices are well correlated, and analysis of these indices shows that the cationic and dicationic bisnoradamantenyl species are homoaromatic.", "paper_title": "Electronic structures of bisnoradamantenyl and bisnoradamantanyl dications and related species", "paper_id": "WOS:000319362500033"}
