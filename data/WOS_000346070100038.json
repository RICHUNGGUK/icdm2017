This paper presents a novel methodology based on the integration of textural Multivariate Image Analysis (MIA) and multivariate statistical process control (MSPC) for process monitoring. The proposed approach combines MIA and p-control charts, as well as T2 and RSS images for defect location and visualization. Simulated images of steel plates are used to illustrate the monitoring performance of it. Both approaches are also applied on real clover images. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
