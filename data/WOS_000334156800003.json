HEB can provide better quality of service to packets with real-time requirements and improve MANET power efficiency. In our algorithm, the buffer is divided into real-time and non-real-time partitions. We consider the number of hops passed, the power levels of the transmitting node, the predicted number of remaining hops, and waiting time in the buffer to determine packet transmission priority. In addition, specialized queue management and a probabilistic scheduling algorithm are proposed to decrease retransmissions caused by packet losses. Mathematical derivations of loss rates and end-to-end delays are also proposed. Coincidence between mathematical and simulation results is also shown. Finally, the HEB is compared with first in first out, random early detection, and hop-aware buffering scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduces loss rates, power consumption, and end-to-end delays for real-time traffic, considerably improving the efficiency of queue management in MANET.
