Our algorithm runs in O*((2+phi)(k)) time, where phi < 1.619 is the golden ratio, surpassing the previously fastest O*((1+2 root 2)(k))-time deterministic algorithm due to Cao et al. (2010) [6]. In our development we follow the approach of Cao et al.; however, thanks to a new reduction rule, we obtain not only better dependency on the parameter in the running time, but also a solution with simple analysis and only a single branching rule.
