It is the state-of-the-art technology for seasonal adjustment used in many statisfical offices. It is possible to include a moving holiday effect, a trading day effect and user-defined regressors, and additionally incorporates automatic and creates an output data set containing the adjusted time series and intermediate calculation. The original output from X-12-ARIMA is somehow static and it not always an easy task for users to extract the required information for further processing. The R package x12 provides wrapper functions and an abstraction layer for batch processing of X-12-ARIMA. It allows summarizing, modifying and storing the output from X-12-ARIMA within a well-defined class-oriented implementation. On top of the class-oriented (command line) implementation the graphical user interface allows access to the R package x12 without requiring too much R knowledge. User can interactively select additive outlines, level shifts and temporary changes and see the impact immediately. The provision of the powerful X-12-ARIMA seasonal adjustment program available directly from within R, as well as of the new facilities for marking outliers, batch processing and change tracking, makes the package a potent and functional tool.", "paper_title": "Seasonal Adjustment with the R Packages x12 and x12GUI", "paper_id": "WOS:000349843100001"}
