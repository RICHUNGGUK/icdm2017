The proposed scheme adopts a symbol-rate sequential search with simple cross-correlation metric to recover symbol timing over the frequency domain. Simulation results show that the detection error is less than 2% at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) <= 5 dB. Performance loss is not significant when carrier frequency offset (CFO) <= 100 ppm. Using an in-house 65-nm CMOS technology, the proposed solution occupies 84.881 k gates and consumes 5.2 mW at 1.0 V supply voltage. This work makes the FD ADC more attractive to be adopted in high throughput OFDM systems.", "paper_title": "Low-Complexity Sequential Searcher for Robust Symbol Synchronization in OFDM Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000302640200016"}
