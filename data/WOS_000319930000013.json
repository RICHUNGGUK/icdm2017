These implications are shown to be different from the known (S, N)-, R-, QL-, generalized-h and h-generated, and Yager's f-and g-implications. Generalizations of three classical logic tautologies with implications are investigated. A series of necessary and sufficient conditions are established, under which the corresponding functional equations are satisfied.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Implications Derived From Generalized Additive Generators of Representable Uninorms", "paper_id": "WOS:000319930000013"}
