The stability condition of the model is obtained through the linear stability analysis. The reductive perturbation method is taken to derive the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation to describe the traffic flow near the critical point. Moreover, the coexisting curve and the spinodal line are obtained by the first and second derivatives of the thermodynamic potential, respectively. The analytical results show that considering the interruption effects could further stabilize traffic flow.", "paper_title": "THE TDGL EQUATION FOR CAR-FOLLOWING MODEL WITH CONSIDERATION OF THE TRAFFIC INTERRUPTION PROBABILITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000306971000006"}
