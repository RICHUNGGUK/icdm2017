In this paper, we explore the effects of defining the problem of finding an optimal instruction selection and scheduling as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). We incorporate methods based on sub-graph isomorphism and global constraints designed for scheduling. We experiment using several media applications on a custom architecture, a generic VLIW architecture and a RISC architecture, all three with several cores. Our results show that defining the problem with constraints gives flexibility in modeling, while state-of-the-art constraint solvers enable optimal solutions for large problems, hinting a new method for code generation.
