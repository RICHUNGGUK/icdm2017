By employing a centralized optical frequency comb, both the wireline and the wireless services for each DWDM user can be simultaneously supported. Besides, each baseband channel can be transparently upconverted to multiple radio-frequency (RF) bands for different wireless standards, which can be flexibly filtered at the end user to select the on-demand RF band, depending on the wireless applications. For demonstration, we transmit a 2.5 Gbit/s signal through the proposed system and successfully achieve a bit-error-rate (BER) performance well below the 7% overhead forward error correction limit of the BER of 2 x 10(-3) for both the wireline and the wireless signals in the 60 GHz band after 25 km single-mode fiber plus up to 6 m wireless distance.", "paper_title": "Centralized Optical-Frequency-Comb-Based RF Carrier Generator for DWDM Fiber-Wireless Access Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000330477700001"}
