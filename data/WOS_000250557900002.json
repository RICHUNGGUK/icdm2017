We further show efficient implementation of the embedding that yield solutions to various computational problems involving edit distance. These include sketching, communication complexity, nearest neighbor search. For all these problems, we improve upon previous bounds.", "paper_title": "Low distortion embeddings for edit distance", "paper_id": "WOS:000250557900002"}
