In [3], we had established a complete characterization of general matchgates, in terms of a set of useful Grassmann-Plucker identities. With this correspondence, we give a corresponding set of identities which completely characterizes planar-matchgates and their signatures. Applying this characterization we prove some negative results for holographic algorithms. On the positive side, we also give a polynomial time algorithm for a simultaneous node-edge deletion problem, using holographic algorithms. Finally we give characterizations of symmetric signatures realizable in the Hadamard basis.", "paper_title": "Some results on matchgates and holographic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474500061"}
