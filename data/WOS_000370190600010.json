However, tangential force, which fluctuates due to factors such as weather and rail conditions, is difficult to actually measure. We consider how to estimate tangential force based on observed in railway operation. First, we try using a dynamical model to improve the input accuracy in estimating tangential force. Second, we propose a way to estimate tangential force by using fuzzy inference with modified input. Third, we show through numerical experiments that our proposed method works appropriately and effectively.", "paper_title": "On Estimation of Tangential Force in Railways Brake Systems by Fuzzy Inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000370190600010"}
