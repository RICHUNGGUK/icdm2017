Examples for this article are taken from the games of Sudoku, N-queens and related games. We will show the computational complexity of many decision and search problems related to Sudoku, a number of similar games and their generalization. Furthermore, we propose a logical description of several such problems that can lead to a formulation in the language of Quantified Boolean Formulae (QBF) and, hence, their mechanization via a QBF solver. Some experiments on finding the minimum number of givens necessary/sufficient to guarantee uniqueness of solution are shown.", "paper_title": "Partial solutions with unique completion", "paper_id": "WOS:000241529700006"}
