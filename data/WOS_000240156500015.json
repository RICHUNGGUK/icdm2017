In this paper, a novel fingerprint matching algorithm is presented, which establishes both the ridge correspondences and the minutia correspondences between two fingerprints. First N initial substructure (including a minutia and adjacent ridges) pairs are found by a novel alignment method. Based on each of these substructure pairs, ridge matching is performed by incrementally matching ridges and minutiae, and then a matching score is computed. The maximum one of the N scores is used as the final matching score of two fingerprints. Preliminary results on FVC2002 databases show that ridge matching approach performs comparably with the minutia-based one. (9) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
