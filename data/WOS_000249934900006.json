The OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative) framework employs the service-oriented approach and the Java ClassLoader architecture for the runtime service deployment, that are well suited to the dynamic environment envisioned for home networking and ubiquitous computing. However, the current OSGi framework does not provide full reliability measures, especially for failure conditions, such as network, device, and application failures. This paper analyzes software reliability issues in OSGi framework and proposes a proxy-based reliable extensions. The design concept was implemented and partly tested on an open source OSGi platform, Oscar, for the smart home residential gateway test-bed.", "paper_title": "Towards reliable OSGi operating framework and applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249934900006"}
