Eudoxus produces structural and synthesizable VHDL and/or Verilog descriptions for: (a) several arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, squaring, square rooting and shifting, and (b) several testing structures that can be used as test pattern generators and test response compactors. Interaction with the user is made through a network interface. Since the end user is presented with a variety of unencrypted structural cores, each one describing an architecture with its own area, delay and power characteristics, he can choose the one that best fits his specific needs which he can further optimize or customize. Therefore, designs utilizing these cores are completed in less time and with less effort. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
