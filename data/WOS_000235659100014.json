In order to provide the business intelligence system with the ability of process-driven decision making, we introduce the concept of business process management to the current business intelligence system. With the implementation of case-base reasoning and rule-base reasoning technology, the process models can be built and managed efficiently. In this paper we also provide a strategy for data mining experience reuse. Process models in our system are all defined based on XML.", "paper_title": "XML and knowledge based process model reuse and management in business intelligence system", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100014"}
