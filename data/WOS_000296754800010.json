According to domain-specific knowledge, ball, player and player's face are defined as user interested objects (UIOs) in different view-types. The UIOs are extracted by semantic analysis on soccer video, and then a region of interest (ROI) of each shot is determined jointly by three factors: terminal size, scaling factor and aspect ratio. The proposed method optimizes the retargeted region to contain more semantic content while adapting the constraint of terminal screen. The simulation results prove that the proposed CAR system wins better viewing experiences than the traditional methods such as resizing in a \"Letter box\" mechanism or cropping directly.", "paper_title": "CONTENT-AWARE RETARGETING FOR SOCCER VIDEO ADAPTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754800010"}
