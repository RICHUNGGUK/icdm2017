More precisely, numerical schemes have to be designed such that discrete solutions satisfy the same constraints as exact solutions. For instance, the underlying physical assumptions for the Euler equations are the positivity of both density and pressure variables. We consider in this paper an unstructured vertex-based tesselation in R-2. Given a MUSCL finite volume scheme and given a reconstruction method (including a limiting process), the point is to determine whether the overall scheme ensures the positivity. The present work is issued from seminal papers from Perthame and Shu (On positivity preserving finite volume schemes for Euler equations, Numer. Math. 73 (1996) 119-130) and Berthon (Robustness of MUSCL schemes for 2D unstructured meshes, J. Comput. Phys. 218 (2) (2006) 495-509). They proved in different frameworks that under assumptions on the corresponding one-dimensional numerical flux, a suitable CFL condition guarantees that density and pressure remain positive. We first analyse Berthon's method by presenting the ins and outs. We then propose a more general approach adding non geometric degrees of freedom. This approach includes an optimization procedure in order to make the CFL condition explicit and as less restrictive as possible. The reconstruction method is handled independently by means of tau-limiters and of an additional damping parameter. An algorithm is provided in order to specify the adjustments to make in a preexisting code based on a certain numerical flux. Numerical simulations are carried out to prove the accuracy of the method and its ability to deal with low densities and pressures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
