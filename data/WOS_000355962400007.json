Many types of localization algorithms have been proposed in the literature. Off-shelf sensors equipped with no specialized hardware are inexpensive and have made range-free localization schemes the most practical, especially in a large-scale sensor network. However, the range-free schemes have seldom considered the impact of the local neighborhood, the number of neighbors, or estimation of the communication hop distance of a node. In this paper, we use the local neighborhood to define the communication hop distance, called the single hop size (SHS), of a node. In addition, we propose a novel correction scheme, called SCS (SHS correction scheme), for multi-hop range-free localization. Compared to other range-free methods, SCS significantly reduces errors in position determination, even when the number of anchor nodes is low.", "paper_title": "Neighbor-based Hop Size Estimation for Dense Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000355962400007"}
