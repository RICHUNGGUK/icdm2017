In this study, we suggest the use of a new, multi-stage and scenario-based stochastic linear program with a recourse model incorporating the meteorological weather prediction information for daily, coordinated, multi-reservoir operation planning. Stages are defined as prediction lead-time spans of the weather prediction system. The multi-stage scenarios of the stochastic model are formed considering the reliability of rainfall prediction for each lead-time span. Future inflow scenarios are generated by a rainfall-runoff model based on the rainfall forecast. For short-term stage (2 days) scenarios, the regional data assimilation and prediction system (RDAPS) information is employed, and for mid-term stage (more than 2 days) scenarios, precipitation from the global data assimilation and prediction system (GDAPS) is used as an input for the rainfall-runoff model. After the 10th day (third stage), the daily historical rainfall data are used followint the ensemble strearnflow prediction (ESP) procedure. The model is applied to simulate the daily reservoir operation of the Nakdong River basin in Korea in a real-time operational environment. The expected benefit of the stochastic model is markedly superior to that of the deterministic model with average rainfall information. our study results confirm the effectiveness of the stochastic model in real-time operation with meteorological forecasts and the presence of inflow uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Multistage stochastic linear programming model for daily coordinated multi-reservoir operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000252671400003"}
