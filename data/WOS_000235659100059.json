The MIP-Grid is designed using web services technologies and standards and is based on the test-bed of ShanghaiGrid. It is composed of six modules including user management, image management, medical image management, task schedule, account and monitor. It provides support for authorization, account, schedule and monitor. The various image process algorithms are implemented as web services by Java and are deployed in the nodes of MIP-Grid. OGSA-DAI provides an,extension to the OGSA framework by allowing access to and integration of data held in heterogeneous data resources. MIP-Grid is based on OGSA-DAI middleware. The advantage of the MIP-Grid is scalability, flexibility and reusability and is potential to become a mainstream grid application enabling technology.", "paper_title": "Grid-enabled medical image processing application system based on OGSA-DAI techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100059"}
