Unequal amounts of protection are allocated to the different frames (I- or P-frame) of a group-of-pictures (GOP). and in each frame, unequal amounts of protection are allocated to the progressive bit-stream of scalable video to provide a graceful degradation of video quality as packet loss rate varies. We use a genetic algorithm (GA) to quickly get the allocation pattern, which is hard to get with other conventional methods, like hill-climbing method. Theoretical analysis and experimental results both demonstrate the advantage of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "GOP-based channel rate allocation using genetic algorithm for scalable video streaming over error-prone networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237850600001"}
