The system exhibits high reliability, fast response, and high real-time performance. A two-step power management method which uses metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) and a mechanical contactor in series was adopted to generate a reliable power switch, to limit surge currents and to facilitate automatic protection. Grounding fault diagnosis and environmental monitoring were conducted by designing a grounding fault detection circuit and by using selected sensors, respectively. The data collected from the JBs must be time-stamped for analysis and for correlation with other events and data. A highly precise system time, which is necessary for synchronizing the times within and across nodes, was generated through the IEEE 1588 (precision clock synchronization protocol for networked measurement and control systems) time synchronization method. In this method, time packets were exchanged between the grandmaster clock at the shore station and the slave clock module of the system. All the sections were verified individually in the laboratory prior to a sea trial. Finally, a subsystem for power monitoring and protection was integrated into the complete node system, installed in a frame, and deployed in the South China Sea. Results of the laboratory and sea trial experiments demonstrated that the developed system was effective, stable, reliable, and suitable for continuous deep-sea operation.", "paper_title": "Developing a power monitoring and protection system for the junction boxes of an experimental seafloor observatory network", "paper_id": "WOS:000367881600003"}
