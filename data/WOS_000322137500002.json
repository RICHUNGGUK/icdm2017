The problem can be formulated as an unconstrained quadratic programming problem, and has many applications in industry. Since the problem is known to be strongly NP-complete, we develop a number of metaheuristics for it, which are based on various encoding schemes, neighborhood structures, and search algorithms. Extensive experiments suggest that our metaheuristics with a partition based encoding scheme and an improvement graph based neighborhood outperform other methods tested in our study.", "paper_title": "Metaheuristics for robust graph coloring", "paper_id": "WOS:000322137500002"}
