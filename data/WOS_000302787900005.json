However, in spite of its computational efficiency and wide-spread prevalence, the FCM algorithm does not take the spatial information of pixels into consideration, and hence may result in low robustness to noise and less accurate segmentation. In this paper, we propose the weighted image patch-based FCM (WIPFCM) algorithm for image segmentation. In this algorithm, we use image patches to replace pixels in the fuzzy clustering, and construct a weighting scheme to able the pixels in each image patch to have anisotropic weights. Thus, the proposed algorithm incorporates local spatial information embedded in the image into the segmentation process, and hence improve its robustness to noise. We compared the novel algorithm to several state-of-the-art segmentation approaches in synthetic images and clinical brain MR studies. Our results show that the proposed WIPFCM algorithm can effectively overcome the impact of noise and substantially improve the accuracy of image segmentations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
