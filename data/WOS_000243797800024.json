This paper presents a quality function deployment (QFD) based methodology to ease out the optimal NTM process selection procedure. It includes the design of a QFD-based expert system that can automate the decision making process with the help of graphical user interfaces and visual aids. The developed expert system employs the use of a house of quality (HOQ) matrix for comparison of the relevant product and process characteristics. The weights obtained for various process characteristics are utilized to estimate an overall score for each of the NTM processes. Finally, if some of the NTM processes satisfy certain critical criteria, they are again compared with each other on the basis of their overall scores and the process having the maximum score is selected as the optimal choice.
