Proper design of such machines is essential. However, experience and experimental methods are mostly used in their design so it is difficult to achieve an optimal design. We propose an approach for research and optimized design of a fertilizer spreader in the case of an OGWFS and granular compound fertilizer. We first build a 3D discrete element method (DEM) model using a 3D CAD model of the fertilizer spreader and construct a fertilizer particle analysis model using spherical particles. A linear viscoelastic model calculates the contact force between particles and between particles and the fertilizer spreader. We analyze the working process and fertilizer amount using self-developed 3D DEM software. Finally, by changing the CAD model of the machine, we analyzed fertilizer spreaders of different structures and sizes. The DEM simulation results were compared with platform test results. The preliminary results indicate the validity and effectiveness of DEM analysis. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
