Towards providing an integrated solution for intelligent multimedia e-Learning, this paper presents a context-aware knowledge management framework named ConKMeL. Proposed framework features a semantic context-based approach for representing and integrating information and knowledge in e-Learning. Requirement analysis in university e-Learning environments shows that knowledge communications are usually in a hybrid mode across different conceptual levels. Based on the fact, a multi-layer contextual knowledge representation model called KG (knowledge graph) is presented. Corresponding key issues in development such as context-based knowledge retrieval and logical knowledge interpretation are discussed. On the application side, a scenario-based learning case study is shown to demonstrate the concepts and techniques developed in the ConKMeL framework.", "paper_title": "ConKMeL: a contextual knowledge management framework to support multimedia e-Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240363500006"}
