A fault diagnosis scheme which contains the strategies of both fault-detection and fault-evaluation is proposed in this paper. Analysis and design of the Pl observer are then discussed in detail. A statistical threshold that has the benefits of improving decision-making reliability is investigated for diagnosing a possible abnormal operation and/or a serious actuator malfunction. illustrated examples are given for evaluating the performance and feasibility of the presented fault diagnosis strategy.
