The numerical predictions are analysed in terms of settlements, increments in vertical effective stresses and excess pore pressures. Firstly, the effectiveness of the use of deep mixing columns is studied. Afterwards, a parametric analysis is performed to study the influence on the soil-columns system of the replacement ratio (columns' spacing), the deformability of the embankment and columns, and the coefficient of vertical permeability of the columns.
