It provides a juxtaposition of results obtained with different eddy-resolving modeling approaches, i.e. two Large Eddy Simulations (LES) on body-fitted curvilinear grids, a stabilized spectral method and a Detachted Eddy Simulation (DES) on an unstructured grid. The paper presents a comprehensive data base including both instantaneous and statistical data. A central achievement is the comparative assessment of the different approaches with an appreciation of the respective advantages and disadvantages of the various methods. In particular, issues on computational cost and ease of implementation are addressed in addition to the quality of results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
