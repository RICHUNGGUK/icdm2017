However, the performance of such turbulence recovery algorithms has so far been limited. In the last decade, significant progress has been achieved in non-rigid registration and in image deblurring. We revisit the turbulence recovery problem, incorporating state of the art registration and deblurring algorithms as building blocks within the sum and deblur framework. Accurate pre-registration of the input video frames narrows the spatial support of the effective blur kernel affecting the sum of the turbulent video sequence. Powerful registration is therefore crucial for successful reconstruction. We employ a two-phase registration process, consisting of rigid registration followed by non-rigid refinement. For rigid registration, we adopt the recent algorithm of Lazaridis and Petrou (2006) [1]. Using real turbulent video data, we demonstrate excellent turbulence recovery. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
