This letter describes the modeling method of competitive neural networks and elucidates its connection with the Hopfield type optimization network. A new algorithm to map the image segmentation problem onto competitive networks is proposed and its convergence is shown by the stability analysis. Finally, the improvement on the competitive neural networks based method is validated by the simulation results.", "paper_title": "An improvement on competitive neural networks applied to image segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000073"}
