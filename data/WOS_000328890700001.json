For this purpose, we propose a general framework based on the use of deformation operators for modeling the geometric variability of images around a reference mean pattern. In this setting, we describe a simple algorithm for estimating the geometric variability of a set of images. Some numerical experiments on real data are proposed for highlighting the benefits of this approach. The consistency of this procedure is also analyzed in statistical deformable models.", "paper_title": "Geometric PCA of Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000328890700001"}
