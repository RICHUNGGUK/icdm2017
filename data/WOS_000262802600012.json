The generalized conic curve R-n (a, b, c) over residue class ring Z(n) and its group structure are presented. The paper gives the representation of the order and base point on R-n (a, b, c), and introduces the representation of operation by parameters to simplify its calculation. The scheme security is based on the factoring and discrete logarithms simultaneously. This scheme is easy to accomplish for convenient embedding plaintext, computing element order and points in the conic curve. In addition, it can speed up the inverse operation and resist Pohlig-Hellman's attack and Wiener's attack. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
