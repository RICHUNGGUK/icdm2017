Subtraction of the calculated isotropic shielding value of diatomic hydrogen from each of these isotropic shielding values gave the shielding increment (Delta sigma) for each probe position. Plotting this value against Cartesian coordinates of the probe position allowed determination of the computed through-space shielding increment surfaces for these compounds. Substantial shielding was observed above the center of each ring, as expected for aromatic compounds. The magnitude of the shielding increment 2.5 angstrom above the heterocyclic ring center correlated reasonably well with the only other published method of assessing aromaticity of these systems ASE (aromatic stabilization energy) and with our calculated NICS (nucleus-independent chemical shift) values, another magnetic criterion. The magnitude of the shielding increment measured over the benzene ring midpoint did not correlate well with other measures of aromaticity, however. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
