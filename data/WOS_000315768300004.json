Compared with previous works, our scheme employs only symmetric encryption and message authentication codes. This reduces computation and communication overhead. The proposed method also supports high-level privacy without the need for tamper-proof tags as compared with the previous methods. Performance analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme requires far less computation resource than recent works, proving that less than 1 minute is enough to verify 100000 RFIDs in a conventional reader environment.", "paper_title": "A New Privacy-preserving Path Authentication Scheme using RFID for Supply Chain Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000315768300004"}
