For this purpose, a particle swarm optimizer is first developed, which reduces the probability of premature convergence to local optima in the PSO (particle swarm optimization) by exploiting the particle's local social learning based on the idea of cyclic-network topology. Next, it is shown how to obtain a fixed-structure robust controller with constraints on multiple H-infinity specifications and system stability based on the developed PSO technique incorporated with a simple constraint handling method. Finally, typical numerical examples are studied to show the applicability of the proposed methodology to the synthesis of fixed-structure robust controllers. These examples clearly verify that the developed design scheme gives a novel and powerful impetus with remarkable reliability to fixed-structure robust controller syntheses. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
