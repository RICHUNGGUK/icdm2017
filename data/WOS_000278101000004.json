The proposed explicit scheme gives the restored image solution by evolving in time the zero signal and an estimated kernel until a stopping criterion is satisfied. Numerical results indicate that our scheme is robust and converges quickly to the solution of the model for images convolved with either a Gaussian-like experimental point spread function or Gaussian blur and contaminated with Gaussian white noise.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear Inverse Scale Space Methods for Total Variation Blind Deconvolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101000004"}
