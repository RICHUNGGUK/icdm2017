Mobile devices implementing these standards require high-performance processors to perform high-bandwidth physical layer processing in real time. In this paper, we present instruction set extensions for several important communication algorithms including cyclic redundancy checking, convolutional encoding. Viterbi decoding, turbo decoding, and Reed-Solomon encoding and decoding. We also present hardware designs for implementing these extensions, along with estimates of their area, critical path delay, and power consumption. The performance benefits of these extensions are evaluated using a supercomputer-class vectorizing compiler and the Sandblaster low-power multithreaded processor for software defined radio. The proposed instruction set extensions provide significant performance improvements at relatively low cost, while maintaining a high degree of programmability. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
