In this paper, we present a solution to bidirectional people counting based on information provided by an overhead stereo system. Four fundamental aspects can be identified: the detection and tracking of human motion using an extended particle filter, the use of 3-D measurements in order to increase the system's robustness and a modified K-means algorithm to provide the number of hypotheses at each time, and, finally, trajectory generation to facilitate people counting in different directions. The proposed algorithm is designed to solve problems of occlusion, without counting objects such as shopping trolleys or bags. A processing ratio of around 30 frames/s is necessary in order to capture the real-time trajectory of people and obtain robust tracking results. We validated various test videos, achieving a hit rate between 95% and 99%, depending on the number of people crossing the counting area.", "paper_title": "Tracking People Motion Based on Extended Condensation Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000323495900010"}
