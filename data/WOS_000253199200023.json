In an earlier paper we gave a characterisation of G-transitive decompositions where Gamma is the graph product K-m x K-m and G is a rank 3 group of product action type. This characterisation showed that every such decomposition arose from a 2-transitive decomposition of K-m via one of two general constructions. Here we use results of Sibley to give an explicit classification of those which arise from 2-transitive edge-decompositions of K-m.", "paper_title": "Examples of rank 3 product action transitive decompositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000253199200023"}
