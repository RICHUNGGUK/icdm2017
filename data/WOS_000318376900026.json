The proposed methodology has three main steps: pre-processing of dataset, object based image analysis and multi-agent object recognition. Classified regions obtained from object based image analysis are used as input datasets in the proposed multi-agent system in order to modify/improve results. In the first operational level of the proposed multi-agent system, various kinds of object recognition agents modify initial classified regions based on their spectral, textural and 3D structural knowledge. Then, in the second operational level, 2D structural knowledge and contextual relations are used by agents for reasoning and modification. Evaluation of the capabilities of the proposed object recognition methodology is performed on WorldView-2 imagery over Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) which has been collected in January 2010. According to the obtained results of the object based image analysis process, contextual relations and structural descriptors have high potential to modify general difficulties of object recognition. Using knowledge based reasoning and cooperative capabilities of agents in the proposed multi-agent system in this paper, most of the remaining difficulties are decreased and the accuracy of object based image analysis results is improved for about three percent.
