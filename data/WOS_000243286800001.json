The method extracts textural measurements from the Fourier domain of the data via subband filtering using an orientation pyramid (Wilson and Spann, 1988). A novel Bhattacharyya space, based on the Bhattacharyya distance, is proposed for selecting the most discriminant measurements and producing a compact feature space. An oct tree is built of the multivariate features space and a chosen level at a lower spatial resolution is first classified. The classified voxel labels are then projected to lower levels of the tree where a boundary refinement procedure is performed with a three-dimensional (3-D) equivalent of butterfly filters. The algorithm was tested with 3-D artificial data and three magnetic resonance imaging sets of human knees with encouraging results. The regions segmented from the knees correspond to anatomical structures that can be used as a starting point for other measurements such as cartilage extraction.", "paper_title": "Volumetric texture segmentation by discriminant feature selection and multiresolution classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000243286800001"}
