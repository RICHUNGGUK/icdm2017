We also present an upper bound for the rate-distortion function for lossy source coding with side-information at many decoders. Characterising this rate-distortion function is a long-standing open problem, and it is widely believed that the tightest upper bound is provided by Theorem 2 of Heegard and Berger's paper \"Rate distortion when side information may be absent\" (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 1985). We give a counterexample to Heegard and Berger's result.", "paper_title": "Rate Distortion With Side-Information at Many Decoders", "paper_id": "WOS:000295738500024"}
