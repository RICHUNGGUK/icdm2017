It is expected to be able to generate novel concepts out of previous knowledge. Here we show its behaviour with a large dataset constructed independently by other researchers consisting of over 170 nouns (for a project named C-3). Each noun is represented with a syntax that is equivalent to the one adopted for Divago. We apply a two step experimentation procedure, which starts by \"training\" the system with \"preferred outcomes\" and then allowing it to do free generation, constrained by the pragmatic goal of a given query. We evaluate the results and make a short discussion regarding well-defined criteria of novelty and usefulness. We also present a comparison with a similar experiment done with C-3.
