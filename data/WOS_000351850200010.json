Gaussian processes seem to be very promising candidates for the first of these, and model predictive control has a proven capability for the second. We therefore propose to use the two together to obtain fault-tolerant control functionality. Our proposal is illustrated by several reasonably realistic examples drawn from flight control.", "paper_title": "FAULT TOLERANT CONTROL USING GAUSSIAN PROCESSES AND MODEL PREDICTIVE CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000351850200010"}
