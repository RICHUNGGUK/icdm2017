This algorithm uses role assignment for distributing tasks over the network nodes and fuzzy logic for making decisions. There is a clear need for the use of formal methods to validate the correctness of the protocols as well as performance and functionality prior to the deployment of such algorithms in a real environment. This paper presents a formal and rigorous study of Network rOle-based Routing Intelligent Algorithm. Prioritised-timed coloured petri nets (PTCPNs) have been chosen as an appropriate modelling language. In this way, PTCPNs have been used to describe complete and unambiguous specifications of system behaviour, whereas CPNTools is used to evaluate the correctness of the protocol using state space exploration and for performance evaluation using simulation.
