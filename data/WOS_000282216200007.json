To the specificity of erotic sound, its feature analysis is given. Based on the popular features, histograms and contours are introduced as new sets of features. At the same time due to the complexity of outside data, a general framework called in-class clustering is proposed which selects the most representative subclass for training and classification. All these efforts increase the recall rate and decrease the false positive rate. Experiments on real data from the Internet indicate that the proposed method yields superior performance with 89.17% recall rate and 10.78% false positive rate being achieved.", "paper_title": "STUDY ON THE RECOGNITION OF OBJECTIONABLE AUDIO", "paper_id": "WOS:000282216200007"}
