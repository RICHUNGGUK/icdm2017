In order to explain acceptance, we have added trust and perceived risk to the traditional variables. To this end, we have carried out a study through an online survey to a national panel of Internet users. The results of this survey check the implications considered on the basis of the Technological Acceptance Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action and the trust building principles for a given system. The conclusions and implications for management provide alternatives for companies to promote this new business by means of the new technical developments.", "paper_title": "Payment Systems in New Electronic Environments: Consumer Behavior in Payment Systems via SMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000352145700010"}
