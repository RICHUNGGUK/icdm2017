We show that any radii assignment that generates a connected network can be modified so that interference is (asymptotically) unaffected and no sensor is assigned communication radius larger than R-min, where R-min is the smallest possible radius needed to obtain strong connectivity. Combining this result with the previous network construction methods (see Halldorsson and Tokuyama (2008) [7] and von Rickenbach et al. (2009) [11]), we obtain a way to construct a connected network of low interference and bounded radii. Since the radius of a sensor is only affected by neighboring sensors, this construction can be done in a distributed fashion. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
