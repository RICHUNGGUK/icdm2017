In this paper, we study an enhanced movement-based location management scheme for 3G cellular networks where the home location registers, gateway location registers and visitor location registers form a three-tier hierarchical mobility database structure. Furthermore, we formulate analytically the cost model of location update and paging for the proposed scheme and compare the proposed scheme with the basic movement-based location management scheme. The outcomes show that the enhanced movement-based location management scheme outperforms the other scheme.", "paper_title": "Modeling and analysis for an enhanced three-tier dynamic location management in 3G", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000061"}
