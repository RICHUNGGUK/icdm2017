Modeling the organizational characteristics associated with such hybrid strategies is an important challenge for organization scientists. This study proposes the use of a novel evidence-based computational approach to the ambiguous classification of organizations (N-state Classification and Ranking Belief Simplex or NCaRBS) to model hybrid organizational strategies. Drawing on the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence methodology, the computational mechanics of NCaRBS are illustrated by modelling hybrid configurations of Miles and Snow's (Organizational strategy, structure and process, 1978) classic strategic stances: prospecting, defending and reacting. Analysis is carried out using data on the characteristics of over 100 organizations. The results show that NCaRBS is uniquely able to demonstrate the full range of ambiguity in the relationships between contingent organizational characteristics. Further potential applications of NCaRBS in the field of computational and mathematical organization theory are discussed.", "paper_title": "Evidence-based modelling of hybrid organizational strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000350231400001"}
