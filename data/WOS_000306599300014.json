Traditional visual search methods use combinations of the confidence scores of individual concept detectors to tackle such queries. In this paper we introduce the notion of bi-concepts, a new concept-based retrieval method that is directly learned from social-tagged images. As the number of potential bi-concepts is gigantic, manually collecting training examples is infeasible. Instead, we propose a multimedia framework to collect de-noised positive as well as informative negative training examples from the social web, to learn bi-concept detectors from these examples, and to apply them in a search engine for retrieving bi-concepts in unlabeled images. We study the behavior of our bi-concept search engine using 1.2 M social-tagged images as a data source. Our experiments indicate that harvesting examples for bi-concepts differs from traditional single-concept methods, yet the examples can be collected with high accuracy using a multi-modal approach. We find that directly learning bi-concepts is better than oracle linear fusion of single-concept detectors, with a relative improvement of 100%. This study reveals the potential of learning high-order semantics from social images, for free, suggesting promising new lines of research.", "paper_title": "Harvesting Social Images for Bi-Concept Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000306599300014"}
