The tool we use for determining these candidates is the Expectation-Maximization algorithm, whose goal is to optimize the likelihood for the given data points, i.e. the known Mahler measures up to degree 44, to be generated by a specific mixture of Gaussians. We will give the mean (which is a candidate to be a new limit point) and the relative amplitude of each component of the more likely gaussian mixture.", "paper_title": "The EM Algorithm applied to determining new limit points of Mahler measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000295512900014"}
