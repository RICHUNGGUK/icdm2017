However, for many scenes, especially multi-object, these hulls may contain significant artifacts known as phantom geometry. In depth hulls the phantom geometry appears behind the scene objects in regions occluded from all the reference views. In visual hulls the phantom geometry may also appear in front of the objects because there is not enough information to unambiguously imply the object positions. In this work we identify which parts of the depth and visual hull might constitute phantom geometry. We define the notion of reduced depth hull and reduced visual hull as the parts of the corresponding hull that are phantom-free. We analyze the role of the depth information in identification of the phantom geometry. Based on this, we provide an algorithm for rendering the reduced depth hull at interactive frame-rates and suggest an approach for rendering the reduced visual hull. The rendering algorithms take advantage of modern GPU programming techniques. Our techniques bypass explicit reconstruction of the hulls, rendering the reduced depth or visual hull directly from the reference views.", "paper_title": "Reduced depth and visual hulls of complex 3D scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000255285500006"}
