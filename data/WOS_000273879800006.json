This approach combines the compactness of OBBs and the simplicity of spheres. The majority of distant objects are separated using the simpler sphere tests. The remaining objects are in close proximity, where some separation axes are significantly more effective than others. We select 5 from among the 15 potential separating axes for OBBs. Experimental results show that our algorithm achieves considerable speedup in most cases with respect to the existing OBB algorithms. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
