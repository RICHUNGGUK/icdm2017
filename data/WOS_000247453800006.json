This paper provides two contributions to the study of dynamic resource management (DRM) for enterprise DRE systems. First, we describe a standards-based multi-layered resource management (ARMS MLRM) architecture that provides DRM capabilities to enterprise DRE systems. Second, we show the results of experiments evaluating our ARMS MLRM architecture in the context of a representative enterprise DRE system for shipboard computing. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
