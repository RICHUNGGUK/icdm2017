Based on the idea of MiniMax method in game theory, a novel output feedback controller is specially designed with the improved robustness to the disturbances and parameter variations. By applying the proposed algorithm in the terms of LMIs, the worst effect caused by the disturbance can be evaluated using MiniMax method, and mean while the controller is optimally designed to deal with the system under the worst condition. Finally, the effectiveness of presented AQM method is verified on the software platform of NS2.", "paper_title": "Research for AQM based on MiniMax method", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800020"}
