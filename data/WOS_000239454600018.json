This structure can be used to build a data structure that stores a simple polygon and allows ray-shooting queries along parabolic trajectories with vertical main axis. For a polygon with complexity n, we can answer such \"stone throwing\" queries in O(log(2) n) time, using O(n log n) space and O(n log(2) n) preprocessing time. This matches the best known bound for circular ray shooting in simple polygons.", "paper_title": "Throwing stones inside simple polygons", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600018"}
