However, existing literature lacks studies on improving green performance of geocast routings for the Internet of Vehicles. Therefore, this study proposes an energy efficient min delay (EEMD)-based geocast routing protocol to find optimal relay nodes by incorporating energy consumption and packet delivery delay. We introduce energy efficiency in packet forwarding as a more appropriate indicator than energy consumption. We present a green protocol model and analyze its green networking performance in packet forwarding. Extensive simulation shows that our designed EEMD protocol allows efficient energy-saving data forwarding under various vehicular traffic conditions.", "paper_title": "Energy Efficient Min Delay-based Geocast Routing Protocol for the Internet of Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000365243700005"}
