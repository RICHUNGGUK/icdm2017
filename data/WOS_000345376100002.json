In this paper, we revisit and extend the theory of . We first prove that no finite time abstract language equivalence exists for , thereby disproving a claim in the original work on . This means in particular that regions do not form a time abstract bisimulation. Nevertheless, we show that regions can still be used to build a finite automaton recognizing the untimed language of an . Then, we extend the classical notions of zones and DBMs to let them handle event clocks instead of plain clocks (as in timed automata) by introducing event zones and Event DBMs (EDBMs). We discuss algorithms to handle event zones represented as EDBMs, as well as (semi-) algorithms based on EDBMs to decide language emptiness of ECA.", "paper_title": "On regions and zones for event-clock automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000345376100002"}
