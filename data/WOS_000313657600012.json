To overcome the mismatches, a novel robust CMA is proposed for blind adaptive beamforming via the worst-case performance optimization and the oblique projection of signal steering vector, which is based on double constraints on explicit modeling of uncertainties in the desired signal array in this paper. To improve robustness, the weight vector is optimized to involve minimization of a constant modulus algorithm objective function with penalty for the worst-case signal steering vector. The theoretical analysis for our proposed algorithm in terms of SINR and convergence performance is presented in this paper. The proposed robust constrained CMA resolves the problem of interference capture, provides excellent robustness against the signal steering vector mismatches, and improves array output performance. Simulation results are presented to show the excellence of this technique and the main parameters of concern to evaluate the performance are analyzed.", "paper_title": "Robust blind adaptive beamforming under double constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000313657600012"}
