In this paper, the effects of project size and number of resource constraints on project duration are compared to the performances of pre-selected priority rules. Ten projects in different sizes have been programmed with 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11 limited-resource conditions by means of MRPL (Maximum Remaining Path Length), LFT (Latest Finish Time), MNSLCK (Minimum Slack Time), EFT (Earliest Finish Time), and LST (Latest Start Time) priority rules. When the number of resource constraints is low, the performance of MRPL is generally observed to be higher. As the number of resource constraints increases, a decrease in the performance of MRPL is observed in contrast with an increase in the performance of LFT.", "paper_title": "Effects of project size and resource constraints on project duration through priority rule-base heuristics", "paper_id": "WOS:000272847700007"}
