However, most existing motion estimation techniques have difficulties in handling large motions in the scene. In this paper, we extend our recently proposed reliability-based stereo vision technique to solving large motion estimation problem. Compared with our stereo vision approach, the new algorithm removes the constant penalty assumption and explicitly enforces the inter-scanline consistency constraint. The resulting algorithm can handle sequences that contain large motions and can produce optical flows with 100% density over the entire image domain. The experimental results indicate that it can generate more accurate optical flows than existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Estimate large motions using the reliability-based motion estimation algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000239097200005"}
