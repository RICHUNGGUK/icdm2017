Collectiveness is a metric of the degree to which the state of crowd motion is ordered or synchronized. In this letter, we present a scheme to measure collectiveness via link prediction. Toward this aim, we propose a similarity index called superposed random walk with restarts (SRWR) and construct a novel collectiveness descriptor using the SRWR index and the Laplacian spectrum of a network. Experiments show that our approach gives promising results in real-world crowd scenes, and performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Measuring Collectiveness in Crowded Scenes via Link Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000359474600023"}
