The BCL coil has an inherent uniform current which assures the rotational symmetry of the radio-frequency field around the coil axis. A comparative analysis of the signal-to-noise ratio provided by BCL coils and conventional coils has been carried out by means of numerical simulations and experiments in a 7T whole body system.", "paper_title": "A Broadside-Split-Ring Resonator-Based Coil for MRI at 7 T", "paper_id": "WOS:000319701800010"}
