These are prerequisites for the use of the very efficient exact Newton method. Four new formulations based on all possible combinations of the direct differentiation method and the continuous adjoint approach to compute the sensitivity derivatives of objective functions, constrained by the flow equations, are presented. They are compared in terms of the expected CPU cost to compute the Hessian of the objective function used in single-objective optimization problems with N degrees of freedom. The less costly among them was selected for further study and tested in inverse design problems solved by means of the Newton method. The selected approach, which will be referred to as the direct-adjoint one, since it performs direct differentiation for the gradient and, then, uses the adjoint approach to compute the Hessian, requires as many as N + 2 equivalent flow solutions for each Newton step. The major part of the CPU cost (N equivalent flow solutions) is for the computation of the gradient but, fortunately, this task is directly amenable to parallelization. The method is used to reconstruct ducts or cascade airfoils for a known pressure distribution along their solid boundaries, at inviscid flow conditions. The examined cases aim at demonstrating the accuracy of the proposed method in computing the exact Hessian matrix as well as the efficiency of the exact Newton method as an optimization tool in aerodynamic design.
