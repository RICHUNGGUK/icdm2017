One LEV is an electric city scooter powered by a lithium-ion battery pack and propelled by a wheel motor drive. The other LEV is an electric bicycle powered by a fuel cell system with the assistance of a supercapacitor bank. Power and energy design of the electric propulsion systems of the two LEVs as well as characterization of the energetic devices are illustrated.", "paper_title": "Development of Electric Propulsion Systems for Light Electric Vehicles", "paper_id": "WOS:000293753600006"}
