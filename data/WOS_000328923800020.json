First, a memristor-based recurrent neural network is designed. Then, considering the state-dependent properties of the memristor, a new fuzzy model employing parallel distributed compensation (PDC) gives a new way to analyze the complicated memristor-based neural networks with only two subsystems. Comparisons between results in this paper and in the previous ones have been made. They show that the results in this paper improve and generalized the results derived in the previous literature. An example is also given to illustrate the effectiveness of the results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
