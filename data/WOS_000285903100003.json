In this algorithm, a new linearization method is proposed, which applies more information of the function of (GLMP) than some other methods. By using this new linearization technique, the initial nonconvex problem is reduced to a sequence of linear programming problems. A deleting rule is presented to improve the convergence speed of this algorithm. The convergence of this algorithm is established, and some experiments are reported to show the feasibility and efficiency of this algorithm. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
