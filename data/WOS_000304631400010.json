An optimal threshold N has been derived to reduce energy consumption of sensor node in corresponding to various network environments. We proposed a theoretic analysis regarding the probability variation for sleep, idle, busy and transmit states with respect to data arrival rate, service rate and collision probability. We provided a systematic method to decide the queue size of sensor node to ensure there exists an optimal threshold N. The experimental results have demonstrated the correctness of theoretic analysis and the efficiency of this research. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
