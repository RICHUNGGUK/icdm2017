Starting with a review of the generic approach, in this second part of the paper we consider two modeling formalisms: elementary Petri nets and CSP. As main results we show that both cases satisfy the axioms of our component framework, so that the results concerning the semantics of architectures can be applied. Moreover, a small case study in terms of Petri Nets is presented in order to show how the results can be applied to a connector architecture based on Petri nets.", "paper_title": "A Generic Approach to Connector Architectures Part II: Instantiation to Petri Nets and CSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000276350700005"}
