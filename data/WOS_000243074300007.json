The metaphors behind the visual design of such cyberworlds are quite diverse, from replication of real universities, art museums and scientific labs to non-existing fictitious places. In this paper, we focus specifically on \"cybercampuses\", i.e. virtual worlds representing real educational institutions such as universities and schools. Based on the results of a case study that we have performed, this paper provides an initial set of requirements for a cybercampus representing an existing university. In this connection, we analyze place metaphors and associated design features of the Virtual Campus of Nanyang Technological University in Singapore, discuss the correspondence between the identified metaphors and associated educational goals, and provide directions for further development. Finally, we outline the major challenges for the future evolution of cybercampuses in the context of organizational, social and technological development.", "paper_title": "Cybercampuses: design issues and future directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000243074300007"}
