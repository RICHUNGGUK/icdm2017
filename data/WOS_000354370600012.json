The authors present a fast method to detect salient video objects using particle filters, which are guided by spatio-temporal saliency maps and colour feature with the ability to quickly recover from false detections. The proposed method for generating spatial and motion saliency maps is based on comparing local features with dominant features present in the frame. A region is marked salient if there is a large difference between local and dominant features. For spatial saliency, hue and saturation features are used, while for motion saliency, optical flow vectors are used as features. Experimental results on standard datasets for video segmentation and for saliency detection show superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Particle filter framework for salient object detection in videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000354370600012"}
