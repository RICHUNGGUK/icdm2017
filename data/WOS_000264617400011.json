This kind of team-teaching could help overcome current problems encountered in developing ESP in Taiwan. The content of the material under discussion includes general knowledge about fundamental theories, process technologies and applications within the semiconductor industry. In the design of the whole courseware, five skills for learning English (listening, speaking, reading, writing, and translation) have been considered and a 3D multimedia technique has been used to promote learning interest, student engagement, and efficiency. The design of the courseware endeavors to mainly follow principles by [Mayer, R. E. (2001). Multimedia learning. New York: Cambridge University Press]. Students report they have benefited from the courseware implementation. Initial evaluations suggest that students are satisfied with practices for learning professional knowledge and English skills provided by the courseware. They report that the multimedia-assisted environment of the courseware promotes learning effectiveness. Students with higher achievement on the posttest showed better participation and motivation, made greater use of the multimedia and had a better understanding of the English content so that they are more competent to function in a professional and learner-centered ESP course using the courseware.
