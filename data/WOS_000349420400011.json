A post-manufacture tuning approach for yield improvement of RF systems is developed in this paper that uses hierarchical behavioral models of the RF systems. The proposed method first determines module-level performances from the system-level response (signature) to an applied test using top-down model diagnosis. Then, constrained optimization is performed to determine the best module-level tuning parameter values that satisfy system-level specifications (bottom-up analysis) in a power-conscious manner. Both top-down and bottom-up analysis techniques are supported by hierarchical RF behavioral models. The relationship between module-level tuning parameters and module-level performance metrics changes from instance to instance depending on amount of process variation and this factor is included in the proposed tuning procedure. A key benefit of the proposed approach is that only a single-test application is needed at a fixed number of tuning knob settings resulting in reduction in tuning time. The efficiency of the proposed technique is demonstrated using simulation results and hardware experiment.", "paper_title": "Signature Driven Hierarchical Post-Manufacture Tuning of RF Systems for Performance and Power", "paper_id": "WOS:000349420400011"}
