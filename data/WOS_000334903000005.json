In this paper we explore the application of Resonance Energy Transfer (RET) logic to common digital circuits. We propose an Optical Logic Element (OLE) as a basic unit from which larger systems can be built. An OLE is a layered structure that works similar to a lookup table but instead uses wavelength division multiplexing for its inputs and output. Waveguides provide a convenient mechanism to connect multiple OLEs into large circuits. We build a SPICE model from first principles for each component to estimate the timing and power behavior of the OLE system. We analyze various logic circuits and the simulation results show that the components are theoretically correct and that the models faithfully reproduce the fundamental phenomena; the power-delay product of OLE systems is at least 2.5 x less than the 14 nm CMOS technology with 100 x better density.
