This model consists in a coupled system of an elliptic and a de-generate parabolic equation. The global in time existence is obtained in using Schauder theorem combined with parabolic regularization. We establish a priori estimations for the PI finite element method applied to this problem. Finally, we propose numerical simulations in easy examples. (C) 2010 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
