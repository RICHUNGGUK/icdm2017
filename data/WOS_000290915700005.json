Loss calculations for six ratings using the voltage test waveform ratio are included to compare and analyze results. A brief description of the test methodologies, that arc easy to apply, is given. An example of the application of the methodologies, the obtained measurements and obtained results are included. In some cases, the results show that eddy current losses for the analyzed ratings are greater than 60% of no-load losses. Results include the impact of no-load losses in total owning cost of transformers.", "paper_title": "Separation of core losses in distribution transformers using experimental methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000290915700005"}
