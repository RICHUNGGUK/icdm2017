However, only a few reports have an interpretable definition of directionality. Here, differently from the standard causality concept defined by Pearl, we introduce the concept of contagion in order to infer directionality at the edges, i.e., asymmetries in gene expression dependences of regulatory networks. Moreover, we present a bootstrap algorithm in order to test the contagion concept. This technique was applied in simulated data and, also, in an actual large sample of biological data. Literature review has confirmed some genes identified by contagion as actually belonging to the TP53 pathway.", "paper_title": "Inferring Contagion in Regulatory Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286146600026"}
