Imaginary part of permittivity of dielectric material which is related to the dielectric loss has been often neglected because of the relatively small values compare to that of the real part. However we have found that some aspect of the long term behavior of PDP is closely related to the dielectric losses. We have studied and compared the thermal characteristics variation and temporal image sticking phenomenon of PDP with two different kinds of dielectrics and correlated with the dielectric losses.
