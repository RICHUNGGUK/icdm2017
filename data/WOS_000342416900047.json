Gaussian mixture source, and z is additive white Gaussian noise in parallel Gaussian channels. Typically, the l(2)-norm error (squared error) is used to quantify the performance of the estimation process. In contrast, we consider the l(infinity)-norm error (worst case error). For this error metric, we prove that, in an asymptotic setting where the signal dimension N ->infinity, the l(infinity)-norm error always comes from the Gaussian component that has the largest variance, and the Wiener filter asymptotically achieves the optimal expected l(infinity)-norm error. The i. i. d. Gaussian mixture case can be extended to i. i. d. Bernoulli-Gaussian distributions, which are often used to model sparse signals. Finally, our results can be extended to linear mixing systems with i. i. d. Gaussian mixture inputs, in settings where a linear mixing system can be decoupled to parallel Gaussian channels.", "paper_title": "Wiener Filters in Gaussian Mixture Signal Estimation With l(infinity)-Norm Error", "paper_id": "WOS:000342416900047"}
