Design/methodology/approach - Three numerical implementations are described and compared from the point of view of accuracy and complexity, by means of two examples regarding simple electrostatic problems. Findings - The implementation by means of a pair of integration surfaces made of element sides leads to accuracy levels which are much better than that of a single surface (made of element sides) and only a little worse than that of a single surface connecting point in the middle of finite element sides. Practical implications - The former implementations, however, are simpler since they are practically the same as that of a standard boundary element method integral equation. Originality/value - The paper constitutes a useful guide to the implementation of the FEM-DBCI method.", "paper_title": "Numerical implementations of the FEM-DBCI integral equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000258420500020"}
