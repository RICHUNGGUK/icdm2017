It consists of a hybrid morphological model, which is a linear combination between a morphological-rank (MR) operator (nonlinear) and a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) operator (linear), referred to as morphological-rank-linear (MRL) filter. A gradient steepest descent method to adjust the MRL filter parameters (learning process), using the Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm, and a systematic approach to overcome the problem of non-differentiability of the morphological-rank operator are used to improve the numerical robustness of the training algorithm. Furthermore, an experimental analysis is conducted with the proposed system using the NASA software project database, and in the experiments, two relevant performance metrics and an evaluation function are used to assess its performance. The results obtained are compared to models recently presented in literature, showing superior performance of this kind of morphological systems for the SDCE problem. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
