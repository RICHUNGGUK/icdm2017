A rectilinear dual of G is a partition of a rectangle into vertical bar V vertical bar simple rectilinear regions, one for each vertex, such that two regions are adjacent if and only if the corresponding vertices are connected by an edge in E. A rectilinear dual is called a cartogram if the area of each region is equal to the weight of the corresponding vertex. We show that every vertex-weighted plane triangulated graph G admits a cartogram of constant complexity, that is, a cartogram where the number of vertices of each region is constant.", "paper_title": "On rectilinear duals for vertex-weighted plane graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300006"}
