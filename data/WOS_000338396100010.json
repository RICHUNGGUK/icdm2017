Projection models based on latent structures and associated visualization techniques are valuable tools within EDA. In particular, score plots are a main tool to discover patterns in the observations. This paper addresses the extension of score plots to very large data sets, with an unlimited number of observations. The proposed solution, based on clustering and approximation techniques, is referred to as the Compressed Score Plots (CSPs). The approach is presented to deal with high volume data sets and high velocity data streams. The objective is to retain the visualization capabilities of traditional score plots while making the user-supervised analysis of huge data sets affordable in a similar time scale to that of low size data sets. Efficient processing and updating approaches, visualization techniques, performance measures and challenges for future research are identified throughout the paper. The approach is illustrated with several data sets, including a data set of five million observations and more than one hundred variables. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
