The current generation of decoding algorithms is based on computing the pseudo-inverse of a matrix and does not satisfy these requirements. Here we consider video TEMs with an architecture built using Gabor receptive fields and a population of Integrate-and-Fire neurons. We show how to build a scalable architecture for video Time Decoding Machines using recurrent neural networks. Furthermore, we extend our architecture to handle the reconstruction of visual stimuli encoded with massively parallel video TEMs having neurons with random thresholds. Finally, we discuss in detail our algorithms and demonstrate their scalability and performance on a large scale CPU cluster. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
