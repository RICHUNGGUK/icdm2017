In this control system, the neuron based nonlinear PID controller is constructed by selecting the neuron inputs, and the control action of the nonlinear PID controller are determined by modifying the neuron weights on-line. The neuron based nonlinear PID controller produces the control signal in model-free way. With an example of the basis weight control of a paper machine, the experiments are made. The simulation results show that the neuron model-free controller has good control performance, fast transient response and strong robustness.", "paper_title": "Neuron based nonlinear PID control", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500139"}
