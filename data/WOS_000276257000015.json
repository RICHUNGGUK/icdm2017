In terms of linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a novel delay-dependent stability criterion is established for the considered recurrent neural networks via a new Lyapunov function. The obtained condition has less conservativeness and less number of variables than the existing ones. Numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Improved Delay-Dependent Stability Condition of Discrete Recurrent Neural Networks With Time-Varying Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000276257000015"}
