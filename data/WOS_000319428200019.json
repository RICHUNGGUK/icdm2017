Several softwares that implement various rules for optimal primer design are available. Nevertheless, as designing qPCR primers needs to be done manually, the repeated task is tedious, time consuming and prone to errors. Results: We used a set of rules to automatically design all possible exon-exon and intron-exon junctions in the human and mouse transcriptomes. The resulting database is included as a track in the UCSC genome browser, making it widely accessible and easy to use.", "paper_title": "An accessible database for mouse and human whole transcriptome qPCR primers", "paper_id": "WOS:000319428200019"}
