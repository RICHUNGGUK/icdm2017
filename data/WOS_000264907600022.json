One of the two proposed estimators is an extension of the validation likelihood estimator of Breslow and Cain [Breslow, N.E., and Cain, K.C. 1988. Logistic regression for two-stage case-control data. Biometrika. 75, 11-20]. The other is a joint conditional likelihood estimator based on both validation and non-validation data sets. We present a large sample theory for the proposed estimators. Simulation results show that the joint conditional likelihood estimator is more efficient than the validation likelihood estimator, weighted estimator, complete-case estimator and partial likelihood estimator. We also illustrate the methods using data from a cable TV study. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
