In order to fully exploit the potential of this material, particularly in two and three-dimensional structures, improved knowledge of the mechanical behavior of the material and more complex constitutive models are required. We herein present a holistic approach to mechanical material modeling of wood, including a multitude of length scales as well as computational and experimental efforts. This allows to resolve the microstructural origin of the macroscopic material behavior and to finally apply the gained knowledge to structural applications in a timber engineering framework. Focusing on elastoplasticity and viscoelasticity, exemplary results of the performed investigations are presented and their interrelations discussed. Regarding computational approaches, presented developments include multiscale models for prediction of elastic limit states and creep compliances of wood, macroscopic phenomenological models for wood plasticity and the time and moisture-dependent behavior, and their applications to investigations of dowel-joints and glued-laminated timber beams. Accompanying experiments provided additional input data for the computational analyses, therewith completing the set of material properties predicted by the multiscale models. Moreover, they served as the reference basis for model validation at both the material and the structural scale. (C) 2012 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
