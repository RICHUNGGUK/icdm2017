Since the containers must be loaded onto a ship following a predetermined order, the rearrangement should be done in a way that containers to be loaded earlier are placed on top of those to be loaded later to avoid re-handlings. To minimize time to complete a remarshalling task; re-handlings should be avoided during remarshalling. Moreover, when multiple yard cranes are used for remarshalling, interference between the cranes should be minimized. In this paper, we present a simulated annealing approach to the efficient finding of a good intra-block remarshalling plan, which is free from re-handlings at the time of loading as well as during remarshalling.", "paper_title": "Planning for intra-block remarshalling in a container terminal", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800128"}
