Using siphons and their corresponding dangerous markings, this work investigates a method to enforce control iteratively. At each iteration, a generalized mutual exclusion constraint is produced to keep only those markings under which liveness is enforced. Furthermore, a generalized elementary siphon control method is proposed such that the final supervisor is structurally simple. Examples are used to illustrate the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Liveness Enforcing Supervision of Video Streaming Systems Using Nonsequential Petri Nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000271843000006"}
