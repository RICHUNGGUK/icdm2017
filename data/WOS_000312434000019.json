Design/methodology/approach - The grey system theory has been a more widespread application in recent years and the authors have solved many forecast problems of incomplete information with it. However, the establishment of gray control models still needs certain prerequisites. Findings - Based on incomplete information or poor information, by using the viewpoint of the grey system theory and the integral generation operation in this paper, six kinds of grey control models have been established. Research limitations/implications - The paper offers very useful advice for incomplete (or poor) information control. Originality/value - The paper is aimed at control engineers and offers a new approach to the optimal choice of information control models.", "paper_title": "Analysis of some grey control system modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000312434000019"}
