A generic design problem representation is utilised and genetic optimisation is used in order to extract the optimal design solution based on customised optimisation criteria. Apart from the extraction of the optimal solution, the genetic optimisation creates records of elite solutions that can be reused as meta-knowledge to enhance the design results in the context of different frameworks. The efficiency of the proposed neuro-fuzzy approximated models and the meta-knowledge supported architectures is evaluated against the conventional and analytical models, on the basis of an example case of parametric design of oscillating conveyors.", "paper_title": "Integration of genetic optimisation and neuro-fuzzy approximation in parametric engineering design", "paper_id": "WOS:000263367600003"}
