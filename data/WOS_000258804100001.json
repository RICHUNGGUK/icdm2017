The parameters of this process (temperatures, times, chemicals, etc.) depend strongly on the density of the different woods in the cooker and have an influence oil the quality Of the pulp that is obtained. In order to optimize both the production process and the Pulp quality. one wishes to cook together woods having similar densities. However, given that the harvest areas contain limited quantities of trees and that wood densities vary significantly from one area to another, deciding how harvested wood from different areas should be mixed for processing is a significant operational decision in pulp production planning. This Situation is modelled as a scheduling problem where one has to decide which harvested area goes to each available processing units in order to minimize the variance of wood densities within each cooker for each period of the planning horizon. We also present an approximated solution approach based Oil the formulation proposed. Some result are reported and the efficiency of the method is discussed.", "paper_title": "Minimization of the wood density variation in pulp and paper production", "paper_id": "WOS:000258804100001"}
