This scheme exhibits much greater filtering power than earlier symmetric schemes and results in enhanced energy savings. In this paper, we show that LTE has fatal vulnerabilities. We also propose an improved scheme that mitigates the weakness and thereby achieves the original claims of Zhang et al. without lessening remarkable filtering power intended in LTE.
