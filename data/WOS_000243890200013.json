Several multisignature schemes have been proposed since. Chen et al. proposed a new digital multi-signature scheme based on the elliptic curve cryptosystem recently. In this paper, we show that their scheme is insecure, for it is vulnerable to the so-called active attacks, such as the substitution of a \"false\" public key to a \"true\" one in a key directory or during transmission. And then the attacker can sign a legal signature which other users have signed and forge a signature himself which can be accepted by the verifier.", "paper_title": "Attack on digital multi-signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000243890200013"}
