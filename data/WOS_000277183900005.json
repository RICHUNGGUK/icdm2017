At the same time, RIAs have multiplied the possible architectural and technological options, complicating development and increasing risks. The real challenge is selecting the right alternatives among the existing RIA variability, thus creating an optimal solution to satisfy most user requirements. To face this challenge, the authors' extended the OOH4RIA approach to generative RIA development, which introduces architectural and technological aspects at the design phase and provides a closer match between the modeled system and the final implementation.", "paper_title": "Architectural and Technological Variability in Rich Internet Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000277183900005"}
