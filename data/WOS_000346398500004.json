Spectra are decomposed into additive contributions from signal and from estimated noise. Numerical results on sample spectra are presented and suggest that this strategy offers an effective and computationally efficient framework for comprehensive noise estimation and analysis. From this analysis more effective methods of feature extraction in chemical spectra can be created. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
