The closure relations are derived on the basis of the maximum entropy principle and all the relevant scattering mechanisms of electrons with acoustic and non polar optical phonons are taken into account. The model is shown to form a system of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations. The results of the simulations validate the robustness of the numerical scheme and the accuracy of the model. In particular, the importance of taking into account the non-parabolicity is assessed, since a relevant difference in the currents is obtained in comparison with the parabolic band case.
