Pseudoknots are motifs in RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict but are also often functionally important. Results: TurboKnot is a new algorithm for predicting the secondary structure, including pseudoknotted pairs, conserved across multiple sequences. TurboKnot finds 81.6% of all known base pairs in the systems tested, and 75.6% of predicted pairs were found in the known structures. Pseudoknots are found with half or better of the false-positive rate of previous methods.", "paper_title": "TurboKnot: rapid prediction of conserved RNA secondary structures including pseudoknots", "paper_id": "WOS:000301972900006"}
