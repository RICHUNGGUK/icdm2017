In order to evolve an initial set of production rules given by medical experts we make use of the Set of Experience Knowledge Structure (SOEKS). An illustrative case of our system is also presented.", "paper_title": "Using Set of Experience Knowledge Structure to Extend a Rule Set of Clinical Decision Support System for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000301118600003"}
