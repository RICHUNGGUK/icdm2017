Several classes of these array grammars and the resulting families of picture languages are considered. Necessary conditions for picture languages to be contained in these classes are obtained and the relations between these families are also established.", "paper_title": "Array grammars with contextual operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000256228800004"}
