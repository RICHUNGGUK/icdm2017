The universal approximation capability of the generalized T-S fuzzy models is shown and an approach to robust controller design for general nonlinear systems based on this kind of generalized T-S fuzzy models is developed. The results of universal fuzzy controllers for two classes of nonlinear systems are then given, and constructive procedures to obtain the universal fuzzy controllers are also provided. An example is finally presented to show the effectiveness of our approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
