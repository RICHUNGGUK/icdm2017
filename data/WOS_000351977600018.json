The goal of these problems is to construct one or multiple tests to evaluate the test subject. This paper studies a recent formulation of the problem known as the one-dimensional minimax bin-packing problem with bin size constraints (MINIMAX_BSC). In the MINIMAX_BSC, items are initially divided into groups and multiple tests need to be constructed using a single item from each group, while minimizing differences among the tests. We first show that the problem is NP-Hard, which remained an open question. Second, we propose three different local search neighborhoods derived from the exact resolution of special cases of the problem, and combine them into a variable neighborhood search (VNS) metaheuristic, Finally, we test the proposed algorithm using real-life-based instances. The results show that the algorithm is able to obtain optimal or near-optimal solutions for instances with up to 60000-item pools. Consequently, the algorithm is a viable option to design large-scale tests, as well as to provide tests for online small-sized situations such as those found in e-learning platforms.
