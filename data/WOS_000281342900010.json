A soft decoding algorithm for integer codes will be introduced. Comparison of symbol error probability (SEP) versus signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) between soft and hard decoding using integer coded modulation shows us that we can obtain at least 2 dB coding gain. Also, we shall compare our results with trellis coded modulation (TCM) because of their similar decoding schemes and complexity.", "paper_title": "Soft Decoding of Integer Codes and Their Application to Coded Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000281342900010"}
