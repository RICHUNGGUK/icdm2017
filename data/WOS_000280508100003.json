The mechanism assembly is first described through a positioning table formalism. In order to create datum reference frames and to respect assembly requirements, an ISO based 3D tolerancing scheme is then proposed, thanks to a set of rules based on geometric patterns and TTRS (Technologically and Topologically Related Surfaces). Since it remains impossible to determine tolerance chains automatically, the designer must impose links between the frames. The CAT system that we developed here proposes ISO based tolerance specifications to help ensure compliance with the designer's intentions, saving on time and eliminating errors. This paper will detail both the set of tolerancing rules and the designer's approach. The Quick GPS system has been developed in a CATIA V5 environment using CATIA VBA and CATIA CAA procedures.
