A system being well posed means that the dynamical solution not only exists and is unique but also is stable, which means the dynamical solution converges to steady solution as time tends to infinity. To enrich the theory basis of the software system, and to simulate the dynamical solution which is also an instantaneous availability of the software system with rejuvenation, this article models the behaviour of software system by a group of ordinary and partial equations. With the theory of strong continuous semigroup, this article proves that the system is well posed. As a result, the expression and simulation of instantaneous availability of the system is presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling and well-posed analysis for software system with rejuvenation", "paper_id": "WOS:000299793600003"}
