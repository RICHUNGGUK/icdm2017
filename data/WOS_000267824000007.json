This paper proposes to use Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the pedagogical module of an educational system so that the system learns automatically which is the best pedagogical policy for teaching students. One of the main characteristics of this approach is its ability to improve the pedagogical policy based only on acquired experience with other students with similar learning characteristics. In this paper we study the learning performance of the educational system through three important issues. Firstly, the learning convergence towards accurate pedagogical policies. Secondly, the role of exploration/exploitation strategies in the application of RL to AIES. Finally, a method for reducing the training phase of the AIES.", "paper_title": "Learning teaching strategies in an Adaptive and Intelligent Educational System through Reinforcement Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000267824000007"}
