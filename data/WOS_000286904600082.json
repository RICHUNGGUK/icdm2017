This paper proposes a systematic methodology to deal with customer needs' dynamics, in terms of their relative weights, in the QFD. Compared to previous research, its contribution is three-fold. First, it proposes the use of a forecasting technique which is effective to model the dynamics of Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) based importance rating. This is owing to the fact that the AHP has been applied very extensively in the QFD and there is, unfortunately, almost no tool to model the dynamics. Second, it describes more comprehensively on how future uncertainty in the weights of customer needs may be estimated and transmitted to the design attributes. Third, it proposes the use a quantitative approach that takes into account the decision maker's attitude towards risk to optimize the QFD decision making analysis. Finally, an example based on a real-world application of QFD is provided to show the practical applicability of the proposed methodology. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
