Laboratory tests are presented together with numerical analyses where the columns are simulated by a concrete damage plasticity model that considers stiffness degradation. Seven model tests were investigated where the columns were installed in a single column pattern and in rows with different column overlap in order to investigate the influence of the degree of overlapping of the columns in the rows. The results of the numerical evaluations showed good agreement with the experimental shear stress-displacement relation and a good accuracy with respect to the fractures developed.
