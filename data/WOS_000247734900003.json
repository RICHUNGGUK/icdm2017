The scenario is that the user first interactively provides an example of a graphic object; the system instantly learns its graphical knowledge and uses the acquired knowledge to recognize the same type of graphic objects. The proposed approach represents the graphical knowledge of an object in terms of its structural components and their syntactical relationships. We summarize four types of geometric constraints for knowledge representation, based on which we develop an algorithm for knowledge acquisition. Another algorithm for graphics recognition using the acquired graphical knowledge is also proposed, which is actually a sequential examination of these constraints. In the algorithm, we first guess the next component's attributes (e.g., size, position and orientation) by reasoning from an earlier found component and the constraint between them, and then search for this hypothetical component in the drawing. If all of the hypothetical components are found, a graphic object of this type is recognized. For improving the system's recognition accuracy, we develop a user feedback scheme, which can update the graphical knowledge from both positive (missing) and negative (mis-recognized) examples provided by the user for subsequent recognition. Experiments have shown that our proposed approach is both efficient and effective for recognizing various types of graphic objects in engineering drawings.", "paper_title": "An interactive example-driven approach to graphics recognition in engineering drawings", "paper_id": "WOS:000247734900003"}
