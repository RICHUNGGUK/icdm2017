It allows to identify groups of genes which behave similarly under a subset of conditions. As a gene may play more than one biological role in conjunction with distinct groups of genes, non-exclusive biclustering algorithms are required. In this paper we propose a new method to obtain potentially-overlapping biclusters, the Possibilistic Spectral Biclustering algorithm (PSB), based on Fuzzy Technology and Spectral Clustering. We tested our method on S. cerevisiae cell cycle expression data and on a human cancer dataset, validating the obtained biclusters using known classifications of conditions and GO Term Finder for functional annotations of genes.
