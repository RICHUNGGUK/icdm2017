We observe that TCP Friendly Throughput Equation (TFTE), which many current multicast transport protocols use to estimate available rates of multicast sessions, has limits of performance in high BDP networks. XRMCCP generalizes XCP framework to support one-to-many transport congestion control. The scalability issue is addressed with an exponential timers scheme that is also used to estimate the number of receivers involved in the communication. The paper presents a number of simulation results on its performance. Besides, some design choices are evaluated.", "paper_title": "XRMCCP: A XCP framework based reliable multicast transport protocol", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100032"}
