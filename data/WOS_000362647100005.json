Amongst the multivariate image analysis tools utilized to decompose the raw data into a bilinear model, multivariate curve resolution alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) can be applied to obtain the distribution maps and pure spectra of the components of the sample image. However, a requirement is to have the data in a two-way matrix. Thus, a preliminary step consists of unfolding the raw HSI data into a single-pixel direction. Consequently, through this data manipulation, the information regarding pixel neighboring is lost, and spatial information cannot directly be constrained on the component profiles in the current MCR-ALS algorithm. In this short communication, we propose an adaptation of the MCR-ALS framework, enabling the potential implementation of any variation of spatial constraint. This can be achieved by adding, at each least-squares step, refolding/unfolding of the distribution maps for the components. The implementation of segmentation, shape smoothness, and image modeling as spatial constraints is proposed as a proof of concept.
