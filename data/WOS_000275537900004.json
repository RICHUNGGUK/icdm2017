However, it is still a very difficult task since the sizes, the shapes and the intensity contrasts of pectoral muscles change greatly from one MLO view to another. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a discrete time Markov chain (DTMC) and an active contour model to automatically detect the pectoral muscle boundary. DTMC is used to model two important characteristics of the pectoral muscle edge, i.e., continuity and uncertainty. After obtaining a rough boundary, an active contour model is applied to refine the detection results. The experimental results on images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) showed that our method can overcome many limitations of existing algorithms. The false positive (FP) and false negative (FN) pixel percentages are less than 5% in 77.5% mammograms. The detection precision of 91% meets the clinical requirement.", "paper_title": "Automatic pectoral muscle boundary detection in mammograms based on Markov chain and active contour model", "paper_id": "WOS:000275537900004"}
