This paper discusses the design of data summarization query system. Based on an initial analysis of requirement representations in data summarization, the study develops a generic organization of ontology for data summarization query system. Furthermore, this paper proposes a framework of ontology-based query language of data summarization based on the proposed ontology structure. A prototype project of data summarization ontology-based Query by Examples (QBE) for summarizing the data incompleteness demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.
