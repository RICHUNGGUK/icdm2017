In the airline coupon color design, we use colors to distinguish different object, the idea is embodied in this method. The marked characteristics suitable for object pixels classification have been found by analysis the statistic characteristics of all sorts of pixels. The experiments have proved that this method is simpler, more efficacious and can support data analysis for the whole coupon project.", "paper_title": "String extraction based on statistical analysis method in color space", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036000016"}
