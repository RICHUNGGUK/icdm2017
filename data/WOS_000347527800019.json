The offset-peak-detecting technique enhances the receiver robustness under the existence of interferences and thus improves the sensitivity. This technique also guarantees a prompt setting process of the data slicer. A passive-mixer based front-end with low noise figure and high conversion gain is employed in the receiver to reduce the noise figure. The LO signal is generated by a 433 MHz SAW oscillator. An active balun is used to convert the single-ended LO signal to differential signal which is necessary for the performance of the mixer. The receiver achieves a sensitivity of -104 dBm and a dynamic range of 95 dB at the data rate of 20 kbps. The receiver consumes a quiescent current of 4 mA under the supply voltage from 2.1 to 3.3 V.", "paper_title": "A 433 MHz-104 dBm OOK/ASK receiver with the dynamic range of 95 dB in 0.18-A mu m CMOS process", "paper_id": "WOS:000347527800019"}
