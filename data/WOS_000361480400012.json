We first introduce a Montgomery-halving algorithm which is a variation of the original Montgomery-ladder for point multiplication. This Montgomery-halving can be run in parallel with the original Montgomery-ladder in order to concurrently compute part of the scalar multiplication. We also present two point thirding formulas in some subfamilies of curves E(F-3m). We use these thirding formulas to implement scalar multiplication through (Third, Double)-and-add and (Third, Triple)-and-add parallel approaches. We also provide some implementation results of the presented parallel strategies which show a speed-up of 5-14 percent on an Intel Core i7 processor and a speed-up of 8-19 percent on a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor compared to non-parallelized approaches.", "paper_title": "New Parallel Approaches for Scalar Multiplication in Elliptic Curve over Fields of Small Characteristic", "paper_id": "WOS:000361480400012"}
