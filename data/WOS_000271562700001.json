We introduce in this paper a level-set based spatial warping method for freeform modeling, allowing shape deformation to be initialed by rigid body transformations of volumetric tools. Intuitive user operations including imprinting, deformation and smoothing are developed to shield the user from the underlying geometric complexity. Unlike mesh-based spatial warping methods, the developed method represents a digital model by implicit distance field data and describes its change of geometry by the level-set method. This guarantees the generation of topologically correct triangular mesh models and circumvents the error-prone remeshing and mesh-repairing processes, thus preventing topological errors such as self-intersections. We present this method with algorithm details, numerical experiments and modeling examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
