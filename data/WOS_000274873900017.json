In order to yield viable devices, it is necessary to ensure high performance, as well as keeping the cost low. This paper deals with the modeling and control of a 2Dof permanent magnet planar actuator. A prototype dedicated to theoretical conclusion validations is presented and its operation explained. A model, based on a permeance network. is introduced. The simulation results are compared to measurements obtained using a manufactured prototype. Three Hall effect sensors are then used to obtain the x-y position of the moving part. From these signals, simulations of a scalar control are obtained using Matlab Simulink (R).
