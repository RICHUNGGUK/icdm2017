Design/methodology/approach - The paper introduces the new concept of V-dense curve (VDC), a generalization of that of alpha-dense curve, to densify subsets of topological vector spaces not necessarily metrisable. It is proved that the feasible set of the M-problem, namely the subset D of L(1) of all probability functions, is densifiable by VDC provided that L(1) to be endowed with the weak topology. Findings - It is proved that the M-problem, consisting of finding a probability function f of D associated to the mean life of an electronic devise that minimizes the expectation defined by a certain functional on L(1), is not a well-posed problem in D. Nevertheless, by virtue of the compactness, the M-problem has solution on each weak VDC in D for arbitrary weak 0-neighbourhood V, which allows to find an approximate probability function with arbitrary precision. Originality/value - The paper has designed, by means of the VDC-method, a convergent algorithm to find approximate solutions in ill-posed global optimization problems when the feasible set is contained in a non-metrisable topological vector space.", "paper_title": "Global optimization by V-dense curves in topological vector spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835400006"}
