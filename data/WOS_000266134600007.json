The epsilon-algorithm is used to accelerate the convergence of the Neumann series to obtain the bounds of eigenvalues of structures with single interval parameter, thus increasing the computing accuracy and reducing the computational effort. Finally, the effect of uncertain parameters on natural frequencies is evaluated. Two engineering examples show that the proposed method can give better results than those obtained by the first-order approximation, even if the uncertainties of parameters are fairly large.
