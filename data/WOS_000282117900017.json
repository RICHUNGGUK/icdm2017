This paper describes an automated approach to constructing Internet-scale software systems based on autonomous software agents. In the approach, the systems are modeled by interconnected divisions and cooperative roles. The approach adopts a dynamic trial-and-evaluation strategy to select high quality autonomous agents to undertake the responsibilities of roles, and implements a special mobile agent, called delegate, carrying the interaction information specified for responsibilities of roles to facilitate the interoperations among autonomous agents. The experiments show that the approach is highly scalable and improves the overall qualities of systems remarkably. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
