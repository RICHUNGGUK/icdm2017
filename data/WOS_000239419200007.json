This paper presents a clipping algorithm for parabola segments against circular windows. Making use of the geometric features of parabola segments and circular windows and the position relations between them, this method firstly rules out some parabola segments located outside the window, and then deals with the rest by intersection calculations. Because of the position analysis and the preprocessing method, this clipping algorithm is of great efficiency. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
