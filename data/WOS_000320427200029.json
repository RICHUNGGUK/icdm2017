Unfortunately, direct simulations with the available computational resources are limited to relatively low-Reynolds numbers because of the almost numberless small scales produced by the non-linear convective term. Alternatively, we consider regularizations of the convective term that preserve the symmetry and conservation properties exactly. This yields to a class of regularizations [Verstappen R. On restraining the production of small scales of motion in a turbulent channel flow. Comput Fluids 2008:37;887-97] that restrain the production of small scales of motion in an unconditionally stable manner. In this way, the new set of equations is dynamically less complex than the original Navier-Stokes equations, and therefore more amenable to be numerically solved. It relies on a self-adjoint linear filter whose local filter length is determined from the requirement that vortex-stretching must be stopped at the scale set by the grid [Trias FX, Verstappen RWCP, Gorobets A, Soria M, Oliva A. Parameter-free symmetry-preserving regularization modeling of a turbulent differentially heated cavity. Comput Fluids 2010:39;1815-31]. To do so, a new criterion based on the invariants of the local strain tensor is proposed and tested here. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
