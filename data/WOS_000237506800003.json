We specify here the least model semantics, the fixpoint semantics, and an SLD-resolution calculus for modal logic programs in the multimodal logic KD4I(g)5(a), which is intended for reasoning about belief and common belief of agents. We prove that the presented SLD-resolution calculus is sound and complete. We also present a formalization of the wise men puzzle using a modal logic program in KD4I(g)5(a). This shows that it is worth to study modal logic programming for multi-agent systems.", "paper_title": "Reasoning about epistemic states of agents by modal logic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800003"}
