This allows us to predict the accuracy of reconstructed activity estimates and to compare reconstruction algorithms theoretically. We combine a bin-mode approach in which data is modeled as a collection of independent Poisson random variables at each spatiotemporal bin with the space-time separabilities in the imaging equation and penalties to derive rapidly computable analytic mean and variance approximations. We use these approximations to compare bias/variance properties of our dynamic PET image reconstruction algorithm with those of multiframe static PET reconstructions.", "paper_title": "Mean and covariance properties of dynamic PET reconstructions from list-mode data", "paper_id": "WOS:000234233600004"}
