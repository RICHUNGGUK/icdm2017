The metric is one of the two metrics commonly used for quantifying the distance between two spike trains; the other is the van Rossum metric. Here, we suggest an extension of the van Rossum metric to a multineuron metric. We believe this gives a metric that is both natural and easy to calculate. Both types of multineuron metric are applied to simulated data and are compared.", "paper_title": "A new multineuron spike train metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000255518000006"}
