By using this divide-by-4 unit, a low power consumption is obtained while a wide range operation is maintained. Fabricated with a standard 0.18 mu m CMOS technology, the prescaler can work properly from 1.8 to 3.1 GHz with a maximum current dissipation of 1.3 mA from a 1.8 V supply voltage. It can cover most of wireless communication standards in 1.8/1.9 GHz and 2.4 GHz bands.", "paper_title": "A low power CMOS phase-switching prescaler for 1.8-2.4 GHz wireless communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000257440000010"}
