The proposed algorithm makes use of adaptive formulations to update the adjusting parameters of HS including the pitch adjusting and bandwidth parameters and the harmony memory consideration rate during the optimization process. Meanwhile, a useful modification is proposed to improve the variety of the harmony population effectively. In order to handle both the cost and emission objective functions, the ideas of trapezoidal fuzzy membership function and weighting factor are employed. The satisfying performance of the proposed method is examined through the IEEE standard test system.", "paper_title": "A novel adaptive modified harmony search algorithm to solve multi-objective environmental/economic dispatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000336491200019"}
