In this paper, each particle corresponds to a candidate solution to the polygonal approximation problem, which is represented as a binary vector. The offset error of centroid between the original curve and the approximation polygon, and the variance of distance error for each approximation segment are adopted in the fitness function to evaluate the feasibility degree of the candidate solution. The sigmoid function of iteration times is used as the acceleration factors instead of the constant factors to improve the global searching characteristics. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can get suitable approximation results for preserving the features of original curves.", "paper_title": "An approach to polygonal approximation of digital curves based on discrete particle swarm algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000253616300005"}
