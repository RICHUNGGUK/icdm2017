If P = K[X] is any ring of polynomials in a countable set of commuting variables, we present also a general Grobner bases theory for graded two-sided ideals of the graded algebra S = circle plus S-i(i) with S-i = P sigma(i) and sigma : P -> P an abstract endomorphism satisfying compatibility conditions with ordering and divisibility of the monomials of P. Moreover, using a suitable grading for the algebra P compatible with the action of Sigma, we obtain a bijective correspondence, preserving Grobner bases, between graded Sigma-invariant ideals of P and a class of graded two-sided ideals of S. By means of the embedding iota this results in the unification, in the graded case, of the Grobner bases theories for commutative and non-commutative polynomial rings. Finally, since the ring of ordinary difference polynomials P = K[X x N] fits the proposed theory one obtains that, with respect to a suitable grading, the Grobner bases of finitely generated graded ordinary difference ideals can be computed also in the operators ring S and in a finite number of steps up to some fixed degree.
