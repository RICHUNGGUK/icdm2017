This was done by integrating a matching model fuzzy pattern recognition (FPR) and a benefit optimization model dynamic programming (DP) into geographical information system (GIS) software (ArcGIS 9.2) as a toolbar (DLL) using ArcObjects in ArcGIS and Visual Basic 6. The DSS consists of database, model base, rule base and parameter weighting database. The parameters come from soil, climate, plant characteristic, ecology, landscape and social. This database includes detailed data about plant types and their properties. The proposed system is able to integrate both the quantitative and qualitative factors together. For the qualitative factors, IF THEN rules are summarized from the questionnaire survey for the production experts. In this DSS complex problems are solved within program so that proper plant and plant distribution are automatically tracked when the dump area environmental changes. This DSS can help land consolidation managers to analyze and visualize (charts, maps) the possible plant species of dump area revegetation, such as plant characters, proper plant species, benefit of plant and the map for the plant distribution. Finally, a case study is conducted to demonstrate the procedure of the proposed system and identify the suitable proper plant species.", "paper_title": "A GIS-BASED DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR PLANT SPECIES SELECTION IN DUMP AREA REVEGETATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000283468800017"}
