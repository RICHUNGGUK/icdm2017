We will construct a new surface which is very close to the original one where it is known and that fills the hole in a homogeneous way, in such a way that the final reconstruction is of class C-1. We give results which prove the existence and uniqueness of solution of the proposed method, and we present several graphical examples which show the efficiency of the theory developed.
