The model solves the complete one-dimensional St-Venant equations together with the transport equation of a passive solute. The flow equations and the solute advection are solved with a high resolution TVD explicit Eulerian scheme. The solute dispersion is solved with a centered implicit Eulerian scheme to avoid further restriction in the allowable time step. The computational speed of the model is high in isolated furrows. In cases of large furrow networks over extended irrigation times the model is slower but affordable computational speed is achieved. The computational model has been designed to be robust, intuitive and able to supply useful visual results.
