The processing time of a batch is the longest processing time of all jobs in the batch. The objective is to minimize the makespan. We formulate the problem using Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition as a set partitioning problem. Based on the set partitioning formulation, we present a tight lower bound using column generation method. A heuristic algorithm is also developed to generate the basic solution in the column generation method. A branch and price algorithm which combines the column generation technique with branch and bound method is then presented to obtain the optimal solution of the problem. The efficiency of the proposed branch and price algorithm is ultimately compared to the branch and bound algorithm from the literature, based on the generated sample problems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
