In this paper, we study how route selection schemes can avoid these changes in routes. Modifying route selection implies a tradeoff between stability, deviation from operators' preferred routes, and availability of routes. We develop algorithms to lower-bound the feasible points in these tradeoff spaces. We also propose a new approach, Stable Route Selection (SRS), which uses flexibility in route selection to improve stability without sacrificing availability and with a controlled amount of deviation. Through large-scale simulation, a software-router implementation, and an emulation with real-world BGP update feeds, we demonstrate that SRS is a promising approach to safely stabilize route selection.", "paper_title": "Stabilizing Route Selection in BGP", "paper_id": "WOS:000350342300022"}
