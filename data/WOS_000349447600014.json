We propose a method that could potentially improve the outcome of image-based registration by using initial manual registration. Magnetic resonance images of two wrist specimens were acquired in the relaxed position and during simulated grasp. Transformations were determined from voxel-based image registration between the two volumes. The volumes were manually aligned to match as closely as possible before auto-registration, from which standard transformations were obtained. Then, translation/rotation perturbations were applied to the manual registration to obtain altered initial positions, from which altered auto-registration transformations were obtained. Models of the radiolunate joint were also constructed from the images to simulate joint contact mechanics. We compared the sensitivity of transformations (translations and rotations) and contact mechanics to altering the initial registration condition from the defined standard. We observed that with increasing perturbation, transformation errors appeared to increase and values for contact force and contact area appeared to decrease. Based on these preliminary findings, it appears that the final registration outcome is sensitive to the initial registration.", "paper_title": "Results of automatic image registration are dependent on initial manual registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000349447600014"}
