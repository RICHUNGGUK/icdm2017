Comparing with the existing researches, our PKE-AET provides two kinds of warrants that are referred to as receiver's warrants and cipher-warrants. The proposed PKE-AET is able to deal with the following complicated scenario: Assume that a receiver authorizes a receiver's warrant to a tester, which makes the tester be able to perform equality test on all of receivers' ciphertext; on the other hand, if receiver authorizes a cipher-warrant corresponding to a specific ciphertext to the tester, then the tester only acquires the equality test on that particular ciphertext. The equality between two ciphertexts can be verified by the tester without decryption after he or she receives two warrants and varies their validations. Moreover, for security analysis, we define two types of adversaries and security notions for PKE-AET in the multi-user setting. Furthermore, we prove that our PKE-AET is one-way CCA secure against type-I adversaries and IND-CCA secure against type-II adversaries. Finally, the proposed scheme leads better efficiency than most of previous equality test schemes.", "paper_title": "PKE-AET: Public Key Encryption with Authorized Equality Test", "paper_id": "WOS:000362959000034"}
