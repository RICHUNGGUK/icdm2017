The models employ fractional derivatives and are modifications of an existing fourth order partial differential equation (PDE) model which was developed by You and Kaveh as a generalization of the well-known second order Perona-Malik equation. The modifications serve to cure the ill-posedness of the You-Kaveh model without sacrificing performance. Also proposed in this paper is a simple smoothing technique which can be used in numerical experiments to improve denoising and reduce processing time. Numerical experiments are shown for comparison.", "paper_title": "Two Enhanced Fourth Order Diffusion Models for Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000293327000004"}
