It is important and valuable to find a way to save power for such networking systems. In this paper, we propose a Cross-Layer Optimization and Design (CLOD) approach to improve the energy efficiency of Internet Protocol (IP) over Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM) backbone networks under QoS constraints. CLOD makes use of the skew spatial distribution (i.e. 80-20 law) of traffic demands to construct the virtual topology of IP layer with a consideration of the cross-layer resource constraints. Also, CLOD takes advantage of the constraint-based routing to satisfy the QoS constraints in terms of allowed maximum hop count and allowed maximum link utilization. Taking into account the connection between base network design and network operation, CLOD dimensions the base network by using pattern of network operation and optimizes network power consumption by reconfiguring network to adapt traffic variation and the available resources. Simulation results indicate that CLOD can save power significantly and achieve near energy-proportional networks. In addition, an analysis on trade-off performance between the hop count and power consumption is given. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
