Our algorithm performs a clustering of the original voxels within a variational framework. A vertex replaces each cluster and the set of created vertices is triangulated in order to obtain a tetrahedral mesh, taking into account both the accuracy of the representation and the elements quality. The resulting meshes exhibit good elements quality with respect to minimal dihedral angle and tetrahedra form factor. Experimental results show that the generated meshes are well suited for Finite Element Simulations.", "paper_title": "Variational tetrahedral mesh generation from discrete volume data", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300004"}
