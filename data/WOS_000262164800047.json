Compared with existing methods, our algorithm is more feasible by performing buffer insertion not in post-process but during early physical design. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce an improved fast dummy fill amount estimation algorithm based on [4], and use some speedup techniques (tile merging, fill factor and amount assigning) for early estimation. Second, based on some reasonable assumptions, we present an optimum virtual dummy fill method to estimate dummy position and the effect on the interconnect capacitance. Then the dummy fill estimation model was verified by Our experiments. Third, we use this model in early buffer insertion after layer assignment considering the effects of dummy fill. Experimental results verified the necessity of early dummy fill estimation and the validity of our algorithm. Buffer insertion considering dummy fill during early physical design is necessary and our algorithm is promising.", "paper_title": "Dummy Fill Aware Buffer Insertion after Layer Assignment Based on an Effective Estimation Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000262164800047"}
