Disassembly, an element of product recovery, is the systematic separation of an assembly into its components, subassemblies or other groupings. Stricter environmental regulations together with dramatic decrease in natural resources and landfills have increased the importance of disassembly as all product recovery options require some level of disassembly. Due to changes made during the lifetime of a product by customers or service personnel, the number and the version of components prior to disassembly is unknown. Customers may also discriminate between and demand different versions of components. The existence of non-functional components further adds to the uncertainty associated with disassembly yield. Sensors implanted into products during their production can address this uncertainty by providing information on the number, condition and version of components prior to disassembly. In this study, we evaluate the impact of sensor embedded products (SEPs) on the various performance measures of a washing machine (WM) disassembly line controlled by a multi-kanban system, which takes into consideration the highly stochastic behavior of the line while managing material and kanban flows. First, separate design of experiments studies based on orthogonal arrays are performed for conventional products and SEPs. In order to observe the response of each experiment, detailed discrete event simulation (DES) models for both types of products are developed considering the precedence relationships among the components of a WM. Then, pair-wise t-tests are conducted to compare the two cases based on different performance measures. According to the results. SEPs provide significant reductions in all costs (viz., backorder, holding, disassembly, disposal, testing and transportation) while increasing revenue and profit. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
