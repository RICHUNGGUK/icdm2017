The well known AES-GCM cryptographic and authentication algorithm is used to secure this low speed serial communication protocol. This securization allows the use of this standard into applications where security is an issue and the computation resources are constrained. Both the hardware architecture and the protocol are presented. The implementation of the I2CSec presented in the paper has been optimized for FPGA devices. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
