We develop an abstract characterization of the access patterns found in MAS simulations based on the simulation's degree of coupling and skew. Using this characterization, we generated stereotypical test cases which we used to compare the performance of the DTRD algorithm with that of Time Warp and time windows. To determine if the test cases reliably predict performance in a real agent simulation, we compared the predictions made by the test cases with performance results from the Boids agent simulation benchmark for a range of simulation parameters. The results indicate that the test cases are useful predictors of performance in real agent simulations, that DTRD adapts to the mixtures of coupling cases found in real agent simulations and is capable of tracking changes in coupling during the simulation.", "paper_title": "Using Access Patterns to Analyze the Performance of Optimistic Synchronization Algorithms in Simulations of MAS", "paper_id": "WOS:000260957200002"}
