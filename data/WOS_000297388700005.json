DOA considers an iterative clustering approach based on distances correlation and on the similarity of ranked lists. The algorithm explores the fact that if two images are similar, their distances to other images and therefore their ranked lists should be similar as well. We also describe how DOA can be used to combine different descriptors and then improve the quality of results of CBIR systems. Conducted experiments involving shape, color, and texture descriptors demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, when compared with state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
