Based on this idea, two complexeswere designed, one inwhich C-180 accepts a C-60 molecule as a guest and the other in which C-20 was placed inside C-116. The behavior of these new assemblies was closer to that of a large endohedral complex rather than onion-like. There were marked differences between the systems. In the first system, there was minor interaction between the two cages but the association resulted in a more stable thermodynamic state. In the second system, there was strong electronic interchange between the cages, and the thermodynamic results suggest that such a combination might be useful for forming stable C-20.", "paper_title": "Symmetric nested complexes of fullerenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000373564100004"}
