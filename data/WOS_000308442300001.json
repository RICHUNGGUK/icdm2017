In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised classification approach, called semi-supervised classification with enhanced spectral kernel, which can simultaneously handle both sparse labeled data and additional pairwise constraints together with unlabeled data. Specifically, we first design a non-parameter spectral kernel learning model based on the squared loss function. Then we develop an efficient semi-supervised classification algorithm which takes advantage of Laplacian spectral regularization: semi-supervised classification with enhanced spectral kernel under the squared loss (ESKS). Finally, we conduct many experiments on a variety of synthetic and real-world data sets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ESKS algorithm.", "paper_title": "Integrating Spectral Kernel Learning and Constraints in Semi-Supervised Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000308442300001"}
