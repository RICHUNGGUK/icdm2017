We first use the representation information of a 3D model to embed messages. Our approach successfully combines both the spatial domain and the representation domain for steganography. In the spatial domain, every vertex of a 3D polygonal mesh can be represented by at least three bits using a modified multi-level embed procedure (MMLEP). In the representation domain, the representation order of vertices and polygons and even the topology information of polygons can be represented with an average of six bits per vertex using the proposed representation rearrangement procedure (RRP). Experimental results show that the proposed technique is efficient and secure, has high capacity and low distortion, and is robust against affine transformations. Our technique is a feasible alternative to other steganographic approaches.", "paper_title": "A high-capacity steganographic approach for 3D polygonal meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240381000027"}
