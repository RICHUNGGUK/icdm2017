Our extension has been conducted in many aspects. First, we use principal component analysis with missing data to construct the 2D + 3D AAM due to the missing data in the posed face images. Second, we develop an effective model selection method that directly uses the estimated pose angle from the 21) + 3D AAM, which makes face tracking pose-robust and feature extraction for facial expression recognition accurate. Third, we propose a double-layered generalized discriminant analysis (GDA) for facial expression recognition. Experimental results show the following: 1) The face tracking by the view-based 21) + 3D AAM, which uses multiple face models with one face model per each view, is more robust to pose change than that by an integrated 2D + 3D AAM, which uses an integrated face model for all three views; 2) the double-layered GDA extracts good features for facial expression recognition; and 3) the view-based 2D + 3D AAM outperforms other existing models at pose-varying facial expression recognition.", "paper_title": "Pose-robust facial expression recognition using view-based 2D+3D AAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000257020200009"}
