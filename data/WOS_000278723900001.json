For both types adaptive tests as well as max-type tests are constructed and their asymptotic and finite power properties are investigated. It turns out that both the adaptive tests have a larger asymptotic power than the max-type tests. For small sample sizes, however, some of the max-type tests are preferable. U-statistics are convenient if extreme densities may occur. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
