Mainly, the system is using fuzzy theory, mathematical programming logic and rough set theory. First, the menu set which fulfills a user's partial menu conditions out of many menu databases using fuzzy reasoning is created. Next, rough set extracts a user's taste rule. This rough set uses the information system in consideration of fuzzy weight. And a menu is proposed with mathematical programming. The proposed menu is in consideration of a users taste and nutritive values.", "paper_title": "DECISION SUPPORT BASED ON INFORMATION SYSTEM WITH FUZZY WEIGHTS FOR MENU PLANNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900028"}
