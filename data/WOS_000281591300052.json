If these two stages are combined, the duplicated scanning effort can be reduced and the encryption can be accelerated. In this paper, a fast image encryption algorithm with combined permutation and diffusion is proposed. First, the image is partitioned into blocks of pixels. Then, spatiotemporal chaos is employed to shuffle the blocks and, at the same time, to change the pixel values. Meanwhile, an efficient method for generating pseudorandom numbers from spatiotemporal chaos is suggested, which further increases the encryption speed. Theoretical analyses and computer simulations both confirm that the new algorithm has high security and is very fast for practical image encryption. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
