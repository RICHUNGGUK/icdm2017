However, the simulation and implementation results show that, it is difficult to balance the chattering awl the anti-disturbance capacity. To this end, three kinds of improved ISMC control methods are developed. First, ISMC using linear varying gain is developed. Using this method, the switching gain of ISMC controller can be smaller while still ensuring that the speed state reaches its steady slate and the steady state fluctuations can thus be reduced. Moreover, the anti-disturbance capacity of the PMSM system can also be assured. Second, an integral sliding mode control based on extended state observer (ESO) is developed. ESO can estimate both of the states and the disturbances simultaneously. By wing ESO, an estimate of the lumped disturbances is obtained, which is employed for the feedforward compensation design of the composite ISMC control law. In this case, the cow roller may take a smaller value for the switching gain without sacrificing disturbance rejection performance, which helps to reduce large chattering caused by high control gains. Third, an adaptive composite control method combining linear varying gain and ESO it developed to take advantages of both improved methods. These improved methods show advantages in reducing the chattering while ensuring the dynamic and disturbance rejection performance. Both of simulation and experiment results are provided.", "paper_title": "IMPROVED INTEGRAL SLIDING MODE CONTROL METHODS FOR SPEED CONTROL OF PMSM SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000289401100034"}
