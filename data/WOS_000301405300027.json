According to the proposed algorithm, the domain of attraction is estimated with finite number of open sets. This method is also applied to design controlling parameters to extend the domain of attraction along desired directions. Simplicity, convergence, capability of estimating domain of attraction for a large class of nonlinear system and ability to demonstrate estimation error for systems with bounded domain of attraction are some advantages of this new approach. Moreover, the directional enlargement of DA is used in order to increase the critical clearing time of power systems for the first time. The efficiency of the proposed method is verified in simulation results.", "paper_title": "A NEW APPROACH FOR ESTIMATION AND DIRECTIONAL ENLARGEMENT OF BOUNDED DOMAIN OF ATTRACTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000301405300027"}
