The algorithm is based on a G(1)-continuous blare approximation of the given planar curves. We first consider an implementation that employs a distance map which can be stored in the graphics hardware depth buffer. The depth-buffer approach is easier to implement than a different approach that is based on a biarc-tree, a hierarchical data structure for the biarc approximation of the given planar curves. Though more involved technically, the biarc-tree algorithm is more efficient both in computing time and in memory space needed for storing the data structure. We demonstrate the real-time performance of our algorithm using several experimental results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
