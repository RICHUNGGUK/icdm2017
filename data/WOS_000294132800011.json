The 2-D image is considered of the size N x N, where N is prime, a power of two, and a power of odd primes. The tensor and paired representations in the frequency-and-time domain define the image as a set of 1-D signals, which we call splitting-signals. Each of such splitting-signals is calculated as the sum of the image along the parallel lines, and it defines the direction image as a component of the original image. The unique decomposition of the image by direction images is described, and formulas for the inverse tensor and paired transforms are given. These formulas can be used for image reconstruction from projections, when splitting-signals or their direction images are calculated directly from the projection data. The number of required projections is uniquely defined by the tensor representation of the image.", "paper_title": "Principle of Superposition by Direction Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000294132800011"}
