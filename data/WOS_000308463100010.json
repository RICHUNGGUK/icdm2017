Each scheme just focuses on the ment of improve only a single network performance, i.e., network throughput, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, or packet drop ratio. However, none of these schemes improves the overall network performance because they focus on a single QoS path parameter or on set of non-QoS parameters. To improve the overall network performance, it is necessary to select a gateway with stable path, a path with the maximum residual load capacity and the minimum latency. In this paper, we propose a gateway selection scheme that considers multiple QoS path parameters such as path availability period, available capacity and latency, to select a potential gateway node. We improve the path availability computation accuracy, we introduce a feedback system to updated path dynamics to the traffic source node and we propose an efficient method to propagate QoS parameters in our scheme. Computer simulations show that our gateway selection scheme improves throughput and packet delivery ratio with less per node energy consumption. It also improves the end-to-end delay compared to single QoS path parameter gateway selection schemes. In addition, we simulate the proposed scheme by considering weighting factors to gateway selection parameters and results show that the weighting factors improve the throughput and end-to-end delay compared to the conventional schemes.", "paper_title": "Gateway Discovery Algorithm Based on Multiple QoS Path Parameters Between Mobile Node and Gateway Node", "paper_id": "WOS:000308463100010"}
