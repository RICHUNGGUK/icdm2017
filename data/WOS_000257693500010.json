The nonlinear ship steering system is transformed into a regional Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model, which has similar dynamics to the original nonlinear system. The fuzzy region concept is used to partition the plant rules into several fuzzy regions so that only one region is fired at the instant at which each input vector is introduced. The proposed concept decreases the number of fuzzy control rules needed and cancels out the influence of some items. To improve the speed of response when deriving the stability conditions with the Lyapunov stability criterion, the decay rate constraint is imposed. In this fuzzy-region controller design with a linear matrix inequality (LMI) solver, all the stability conditions are represented in terms of LMIs. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the proposed method are illustrated with a numerical simulation example.", "paper_title": "Regional fuzzy control for nonlinear ship steering systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500010"}
