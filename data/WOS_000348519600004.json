Applied methods are especially valuable in cases where lack of information or computational resources prohibit computing the state of the dike with finite element and other mathematical models. The data-driven methods are part of the artificial intelligence (AI) component of the 'Urbanflood' early warning system. This AI component includes pre-processing (e.g., gap filling and measurements synchronization procedures) of data streams, feature extraction and anomaly detection by one-side (also known as one-class) classification methods. Our approach has been successfully validated during a non-destructive piping experiment at the Zeeland dike (The Netherlands).", "paper_title": "Signal analysis and anomaly detection for flood early warning systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000348519600004"}
