The main purpose of the project management is to minimize total project and crashing cost with the reference to both direct and indirect cost and other related constraints simultaneously. This work focuses on the application of fuzzy sets to solve fuzzy multi-objective PM decision problem with the consideration of its completion time in a suitable range; and it will present an interactive solution procedure to determine the preferred compromise solution for the multi-objective PM decision problem. The proposed approach considers the imprecise nature of the input data by implementing the minimum operator and also assumes that each objective function has a fuzzy goal. And this approach focuses on minimizing the worst upper bound to obtain an efficient solution which is close to the best lower bound of each objective function. For attaining our objective, a detailed numerical example is presented to illustrate the feasibility of applying the proposed approach to actual PM decision problem at the end of this paper. Furthermore, we believe that this approach can be applied to solve other multi-objective decision making problems.", "paper_title": "APPLICATION OF SIGNED DISTANCES METHOD TO INTEGRATE LINEAR PROGRAMMING FOR FUZZY MULTI-OBJECTIVE PROJECT MANAGEMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500020"}
