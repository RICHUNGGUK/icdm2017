It does so in a more realistic context, respecting data size and heterogeneity, than has been researched in the past. In this study, we used physical-level text string search output, consisting of over two million search hits found in nearly 50,000 allocated files and unallocated blocks. Holding the data set constant, we comparatively evaluated k-Means, Kohonen SOM, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) followed by k-Means, and LDA followed by SOM. This enables true cross-algorithm evaluation, whereas past studies evaluated singular algorithms using unique, non-reproducible datasets. Our research shows an LDA + k-Means using a linear, centroid-based user navigation procedure produces optimal results. The winning approach increased information retrieval effectiveness, from the baseline random walk absolute precision rate of 0.04, to an average precision rate of 0.67. We also explored a variety of algorithms for user navigation of search hit results, finding that the performance of k-means clustering can be greatly improved with a non-linear, non-centroid-based cluster and document navigation procedure, which has potential implications for digital forensic tools and use thereof, particularly given the popularity and speed of k-means clustering.
