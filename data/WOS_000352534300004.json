In this attack, an intelligent adversary spoofs the transmitter on the estimation of channel state information (CSI) by sending the identical pilot signal as the legitimate receiver, in order to obtain a larger information rate in the data transmission phase. The pilot spoofing attack could also drastically weaken the strength of the received signal at the legitimate receiver if the adversary utilizes large enough power. Motivated by the serious problems the pilot spoofing attack could cause, we propose an efficient detector, named energy ratio detector (ERD), by exploring the asymmetry of received signal power levels at the transmitter and the legitimate receiver when there exists a pilot spoofing attack. Our analysis shows that by setting the ratio of received signal power levels at the transmitter and the legitimate receiver as the test statistic, the detecting threshold is derived without using the knowledge of the CSI of the legitimate channel as well as the illegitimate channel. Furthermore, we study the performance of the proposed ERD in various special cases in order to obtain useful insights. Numerical results are presented to further demonstrate the performance of our proposed ERD.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Ratio-Based Approach for Detecting Pilot Spoofing Attack in Multiple-Antenna Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352534300004"}
