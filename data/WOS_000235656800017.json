In this note, we give a simple proof of this result based on cut-elimination in sequent calculus. The interest of this proof besides its simplicity is that it allows in particular to generalize the result to other logics enjoying cut-elimination. We also briefly discuss the significance of the characterization itself.", "paper_title": "On constructive existence", "paper_id": "WOS:000235656800017"}
