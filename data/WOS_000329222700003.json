It is shown that the maximum efficiency of a conventional LED driver using a charge pump is determined only by the ratio of a forward voltage of an LED and a nominal output voltage of a charge pump. Theoretical analysis reveals that the efficiency does not depend on values of flying capacitors and output capacitors, clock frequency, duty cycle and on-resistance of switches. Minimizing the difference of an output voltage of a charge pump and a forward voltage of an LED is important to minimize power loss of an LED driver. In order to reduce power loss caused by charging capacitors, a novel charging procedure named multi-step charging technique is proposed. Some charge pumps using multi-step charging technique are shown and validity of the proposed multi-step charging technique is confirmed.", "paper_title": "Analysis of a charge pump for white LED driver using multi-step charging technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000329222700003"}
