This evaluation analyzes the influence of Verb Sense Disambiguation in the task. In order to do this, a whole system of Semantic Role Labeling is used and it is compared with similar methods. Our main results show how using the senses of the verbs improves the results for verb-specific roles, such as A2 or A3, and while not using them improves the results for adjuncts, such as modal or negative.", "paper_title": "The role of verb sense disambiguation in Semantic Role Labeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400066"}
