The paper proposes the model and algorithm of hybrid cloud scheduling optimization for cloud bursting. Public cloud providers and private cloud users communicate by the hybrid cloud marketplace. The hybrid cloud scheduling optimization is conducted at different levels. According to the model formulation and mathematic solutions of hybrid cloud scheduling, hybrid cloud scheduling algorithms for cloud bursting are proposed, which includes the routines of public cloud optimization, private cloud application optimization and private cloud job optimization. In the simulations, compared with other related algorithm, our proposed hybrid cloud scheduling algorithms achieve the better performance.", "paper_title": "Hybrid Cloud Scheduling Method for Cloud Bursting", "paper_id": "WOS:000358733900003"}
