Although the need for accessing a wireless network is evident, new problems, such as keeping and preserving user identity's privacy, should be greatly concerned. Attribute based signature scheme is an important cryptographic primitive which provides a powerful way for user to control their privacy. In wireless environment, the capacity of wireless channel is also valuable resources which is limited. More information can be transmitted through the wireless channel when the cost of using signature to verify the message becomes less. In order to reduce the bandwidth needed to transmit attribute based signatures and keep signer's privacy, attribute based multisignature scheme (ABMS) was proposed in this paper. Moreover, we formalize and construct the ABMS. Our scheme is existentially unforgeable against chosen message attack on Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in the standard model. The simulation shows that our ABMS scheme is more appropriate for wireless communication to guarantee integrity of the data.", "paper_title": "Attribute Based Multisignature Scheme for Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000350159400001"}
