The method is based on a prioritised match expansion technique, which starts from a sparse set of seed points, and iteratively expands them into neighbouring areas by using multiple expansion stages. Each seed point represents a surface patch and has a position and a surface normal vector. The location and surface normal of the seeds are optimised using a homography-based local image alignment. The propagation of seeds is performed in a prioritised order in which the most promising seeds are expanded first and removed from the list of seeds. The first expansion stage proceeds until the list of seeds is empty. In the following expansion stages, the current reconstruction may be further expanded by finding new seeds near the boundaries of the current reconstruction. The prioritised expansion strategy allows efficient generation of accurate point clouds and their experiments show its benefits compared with non-prioritised expansion. In addition, a comparison to the widely used patch-based multi-view stereo software shows that their method is significantly faster and produces more accurate and complete reconstructions.", "paper_title": "Fast and accurate multi-view reconstruction by multi-stage prioritised matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000359605600014"}
