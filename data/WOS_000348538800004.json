Therefore, current research is concerned with control strategies for active damping of elastic vibrations and trajectory planning. For this purpose, tailored mathematical models are required. Apart from the mathematical modelling, the identification of the model parameters constitutes a challenging task. This is mainly due to the large number of parameters to be identified and, considering the large scale, due to the fact that the boom movement cannot be measured by means of standard sensors. This paper presents a systematic approach for the mathematical modelling and identification of hydraulically actuated large-scale manipulators. The feasibility of the overall approach is demonstrated by means of measurement results of a mobile concrete pump.", "paper_title": "Modelling, simulation and identification of a mobile concrete pump", "paper_id": "WOS:000348538800004"}
