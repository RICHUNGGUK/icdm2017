Design/methodology/approach - A series of 2D and 3D models corresponding to different levels of approximation of the original problem are considered. A reliable error estimator based on dual magnetostatic formulations is used. Findings - A 3D model does not necessarily ensure more accurate results than a 2D model. Because of limitations on the number of mesh elements, the discretisation error in 3D can be of the same order of magnitude as the error introduced by the 2D approximation. Originality/vatlue - The results emphasise the need to consider errors arising from different simplifications with respect to one another, in order to avoid improvements of the model increasing the complexity but not improving the accuracy of the results.", "paper_title": "Accuracy analysis of the thrust force in 2D-3D finite element models", "paper_id": "WOS:000237037300006"}
