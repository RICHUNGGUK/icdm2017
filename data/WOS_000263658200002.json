On the basis of ToFI calculations, RECAP fragments are organized in dependency hierarchies that capture fragment co-occurrence and facilitate the identification of topology clusters and activity class characteristic RECAP fragments. By combining structural and topological environment information through ToFI, RECAP fragments that are a signature of compounds active against one of several closely related targets are consistently identified.", "paper_title": "Topological Fragment Index for the Analysis of Molecular Substructures and Their Topological Environment in Active Compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000263658200002"}
