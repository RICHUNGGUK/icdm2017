The semi-parametric EVI-estimators under consideration, the so-called peaks over random threshold (PORT)-minimum-variance reduced-bias (MVRB) EVI-estimators, are location and scale-invariant estimators, based on the PORT methodology applied to second-order MVRB EVI-estimators. Trivial adaptations of these algorithms make them work for a similar estimation of other parameters of extreme events, such as the Value-at-Risk at a level p, the expected shortfall and the probability of exceedance of a high level x, among others. Applications to simulated data sets and to real data sets in the field of finance are provided.", "paper_title": "Adaptive PORT-MVRB estimation: an empirical comparison of two heuristic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000320187500009"}
