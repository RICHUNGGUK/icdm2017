This paper proposes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller its an active queue manager for Internet routers. Due to the limitations of packet-dropping probability and the effects of propagation delays it, TCP networks, the TCP AQM network was modeled as a time-delayed system with a saturated input. Ail improved genetic algorithm is employed to derive optimal or near optimal PID controller gains such that it performance index of integrated-absolute error (IAE) is minimized, and thereby a stable queue length, low packet loss, and high link utilization for TCP networks are guaranteed. The performance of the proposed control scheme is evaluated in various network scenarios via a series of numerical simulations. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
