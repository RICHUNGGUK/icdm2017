In this paper, based on Petri net, we propose a service composition oriented Grid workflow model and its related six elementary workflow patterns: sequence, condition, iteration, concurrency, synchronization, and triggering. In addition, we present our Grid workflow analysis approaches on three aspects: workflow reachability verification, workflow deadlock verification, and workflow optimization. The experimental results show that our workflow verification and optimization mechanisms are feasible and efficient.", "paper_title": "Petri net based Grid workflow verification and optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000326805000006"}
