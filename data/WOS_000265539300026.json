In Mr-SDM, by integrating the prior knowledge of the physical material property into the training of SDM, we are able to achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency in simulating material deformation for various applications. Our Mr-SDM training process takes advantage of the accuracy of Finite Element Method (FEM) to generate a set of deforming samples which enables us to estimate the deformation parameter of an unknown object based on its material knowledge. Our experiments have shown that Mr-SDM is able to give comparable accuracy with respect to FEM while, at the same time, reducing the computation cost from O(n (2)) for FEM-based simulation to O(n) using Mr-SDM.", "paper_title": "Mr-SDM: a novel statistical deformable model for object deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000265539300026"}
