A wide range of devices to detect and deter animals causing conflict is used to prevent this, although their effectiveness is often highly variable, due to habituation to disruptive or disturbing stimuli. Automated recognition of behaviors could form a critical component of a system capable of altering the disruptive stimulus to avoid habituation. This paper presents an audio-visual-based approach for recognition of goose flocking behavior. The vocal communication and movement of the flock is used for the audio-visual recognition, which is accomplished through classifier fusion of an acoustic and a video-based classifier. Acoustic behavior recognition is based on generalized perceptual features and support vector machines, and visual behavior recognition is based on optical flow estimation and a Bayesian Rule-Based scheme. Classifier fusion is implemented using the product rule on the soft-outputs from both classifiers. The algorithm has been used to recognize goose flocking behaviors (landing, foraging and flushing) and have improved the performance compared to using audio-or video-based classifiers alone. The improvement of using classifier fusion is most evident in the case of flushing and landing behavior recognition, where it was possible to combine the advantages of both the audio-and video-based classifier.", "paper_title": "AUDIO-VISUAL RECOGNITION OF GOOSE FLOCKING BEHAVIOR", "paper_id": "WOS:000327353700001"}
