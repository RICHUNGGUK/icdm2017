A genetic-algorithm-based multivariate linear regression (GA-MLR) was applied to select the most statistically effective molecular descriptors for modelling the molecular diffusivity of pure chemicals in water. Based on the selected molecular descriptors, a three-layer feed forward neural network (FFNN) was constructed to predict the property. The obtained results showed that the FFNN was able to predict the molecular diffusivity of pure chemicals in water.", "paper_title": "Estimation of molecular diffusivity of pure chemicals in water: a quantitative structure-property relationship study", "paper_id": "WOS:000267202800005"}
