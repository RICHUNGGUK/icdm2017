Radio coordination (RC) techniques have been investigated to control CCI. Clustering, as a bootstrapping step of RC, defines which subset of radio nodes should be coordinated together. As a typical RC technique, cluster-based power control is not well studied in the literature. Existing solutions include all radio nodes in a single cluster, or they rely on pre-defined fixed clusters. In this tutorial we put forward dynamic clustering for coordinated power control, in the context of software-defined radio access networks, and hope to trigger more follow-up research on the topic. We propose to form clusters according to the dominant interference relation among radio nodes. A comparative simulation study indicates that the proposed approach offers similar QoE to users as the benchmark algorithms used, yet with greatly reduced RC complexity.", "paper_title": "DYNAMIC RADIO COORDINATION FOR IMPROVED QUALITY OF EXPERIENCE IN SOFTWARE-DEFINED WIRELESS NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000360548200005"}
