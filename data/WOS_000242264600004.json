Due to its importance, many companies are trying to develop efficient methods to increase customer satisfaction and reduce costs. In various methods, cross-docking is considered a good method to reduce inventory and improve responsiveness to various customer demands. However, previous studies have dealt mostly with the conceptual advantages of cross-docking or actual issues from the strategic viewpoint. It is also necessary, however, to considering cross-docking from an operational viewpoint in order to find the optimal vehicle routing schedule. Thus, an integrated model considering both cross-docking and vehicle routing scheduling is treated in this study. Since this problem is known as NP-hard, a heuristic algorithm based on a tabu search algorithm is proposed. In the numerical example, our proposed algorithm found a good solution whose average percentage error was less than 5% within a reasonable amount of time. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
