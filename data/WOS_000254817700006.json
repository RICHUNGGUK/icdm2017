This paper demonstrates their applicability to systems where the human factor is more important. It will discuss an example of a process in the public administration where the effects of a reorganization are simulated. The intention of the reorganization is positive, however easing the load on clients means that the process takes longer. Through the simulations it is possible to monitor the process and acquire data which is otherwise impossible to obtain.", "paper_title": "Use of simulation in a public administration process", "paper_id": "WOS:000254817700006"}
