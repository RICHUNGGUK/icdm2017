The SS-DEWMA chart uses the sum of squares statistic and it simultaneously monitors the process mean and variance in a single chart. A simulation study is conducted to show that the optimal SS-DEWMA chart provides better zero state average run length (ARL) and standard deviation of the run length (SDRL) performances than the optimal SS-EWMA chart. In addition, as suggested by one of the reviewers, the cyclical steady state ARLs and SDRLs of the SS-DEWMA and SS-EWMA charts are compared, where it is found that the former did not perform as well as the latter. Note that to the best of the authors' knowledge, a study on DEWMA type charts' steady state ARL and SDRL performances has yet to be made in the literature. A situation in which the SS-DEWMA chart could be more useful than the SS-EWMA chart is explained in Sections 4 and 6. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
