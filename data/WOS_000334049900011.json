Shortcomings of such mesh-based discretisation in modelling of surgical cutting include high computational cost and the need for re-meshing in the vicinity of cutting-induced discontinuity. The meshless total Lagrangian adaptive dynamic relaxation (MTLADR) algorithm we present here does not exhibit such shortcomings, as it relies on spatial discretisation in a form of a cloud of nodes. The cutting-induced discontinuity is modelled solely through changes in nodal domains of influence, which is done through efficient implementation of the visibility criterion using the level set method. Accuracy of our MTLADR algorithm with visibility criterion is confirmed against the established nonlinear solution procedures available in the commercial FE code Abaqus.", "paper_title": "Meshless algorithm for soft tissue cutting in surgical simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000334049900011"}
