The research attention is focused on improving the computational efficiency in the stacking sequence optimisation of a laminated composite plate for maximum buckling load. A new operator, the so-called two point interchange, is introduced and proved to be effective for reducing the convergence time and enhancing the robustness in the MCLACA performance. The laminate optimisation is subject to balanced and symmetric layup with ply contiguous and strength constraints. In order to assess the MCLACA performance, a simply supported rectangular laminate plate, which was taken as numerical example in previous research using traditional ACA and genetic algorithm (GA) is chosen as a benchmark case study. Comparing with the ACA and GA results, it is shown that the presented MCLACA has better performance in terms of computational efficiency and robustness. To demonstrate the applicability of the MCLACA to a general case, an additional example of laminate optimisation has been taken with more design variables and five different boundary conditions by finite element analysis.", "paper_title": "A modified ant colony algorithm for the stacking sequence optimisation of a rectangular laminate", "paper_id": "WOS:000276075900005"}
