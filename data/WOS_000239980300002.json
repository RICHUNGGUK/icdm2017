Some examples of these applications are the generation of data bases from documents, as well as the acquisition of knowledge useful for emerging technologies like question answering, information integration, and others related to text mining. However, one of the main drawbacks of the application of IE refers to its intrinsic domain dependence. For the sake of reducing the high cost of manually adapting IE applications to new domains, experiments with different Machine Learning (ML) techniques have been carried out by the research community. This survey describes and compares the main approaches to IE and the different ML techniques used to achieve Adaptive IE technology.", "paper_title": "Adaptive information extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000239980300002"}
