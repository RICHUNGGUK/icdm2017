However, these detection systems suffer from some limitations such as network packet overload, expensive signature matching and massive false alarms in a large-scale network environment. In this paper, we aim to develop an enhanced filter mechanism (named EFM) to comprehensively mitigate these issues, which consists of three major components: a context-aware blacklist-based packet filter, an exclusive signature matching component and a KNN-based false alarm filter. The experiments, which were conducted with two data sets and in a network environment, demonstrate that our proposed EFM can overall enhance the performance of a signature-based NIDS such as Snort in the aspects of packet filtration, signature matching improvement and false alarm reduction without affecting network security.
