In this paper we consider Herman's self-stabilization algorithm and study its expected termination time. McIver and Morgan have conjectured the optimal upper bound being , where denotes the number of processors. We present an elementary proof showing a bound of , a sharp improvement compared with the best known bound . Our proof is inspired by McIver and Morgan's approach: we find a nearly optimal closed form of the expected stabilization time for any initial configuration, and apply the Lagrange multipliers method to give an upper bound.", "paper_title": "A nearly optimal upper bound for the self-stabilization time in Herman's algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000358780800002"}
