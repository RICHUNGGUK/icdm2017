In WBANs many sensors are attached to human body for sensing particular health related information to improve healthcare and quality of life. Obesity is one of the most common problems all over the world, which is amongst main causes of cardiovascular diseases. In this research, we explore hardware and software architecture of WBAN for obesity monitoring. The proposed framework consists of few sensor nodes that monitor body motion, calories calculator, and a personal server running on a personal smart phone or a personal computer. The focus of this research is to make obesity patients easier to get rid of this disease.", "paper_title": "A Framework for Obesity Control Using a Wireless Body Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000339757300001"}
