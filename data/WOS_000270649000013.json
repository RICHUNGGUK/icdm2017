To assure that the scheme is local and singularity-free, we analyze the selection of scalar weight functions and the construction of the boundary curve network in detail. With the further requirements of interpolating positions, normals, and surface curvatures, we show that the minimum degree of such a triangular spline surface is 6. And we present a method for constructing boundary curves network, which consists of cubic Bezier curves. To deal with certain singular cases, the base mesh must be locally subdivided and we proposed an adaptive subdivision strategy for it. An application of our G(1) triangular spline surfaces to the approximation of implicit surfaces is described. The visual quality of this scheme is demonstrated by some examples.", "paper_title": "Local and singularity-free G(1) triangular spline surfaces using a minimum degree scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000270649000013"}
