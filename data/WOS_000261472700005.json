Here we introduce two new improvements for the existing algorithm, adding significant computational speedup in situations with many moment constraints, where the original algorithm is known to converge slowly. The first improvement is the use of the BFGS iterations to progress between successive polynomial reorthogonalizations rather than single Newton steps, typically reducing the total number of computationally expensive polynomial reorthogonalizations for the same maximum entropy problem. The second improvement is a constraint rescaling, aimed to reduce relative difference in the order of magnitude between different moment constraints, improving numerical stability of iterations due to reduced sensitivity of different constraints to changes in Lagrange multipliers. We observe that these two improvements can yield an average wall clock time speedup of 5-6 times compared to the original algorithm. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
