So far as we know, no study has yet been attempted for these problems via neural network. In fact, some interesting reformulations of BLP and mixed-integer bilinear programming problem (MIBLP) with a binary vector to linear complementarity problem (LCP) are given. Additionally, we show that the special type of MIBLP with a binary vector is equal to a quadratic program and on the other hand, it is equal to a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). Finally, we use a neural network to solve projection equation which has the same solution with LCP. Then, by presenting a Lyapunov function, we show that the proposed neural network is globally asymptotically stable. Illustrative examples are given to show the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.
