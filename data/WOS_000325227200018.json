In this brief, an improved soft BCH decoding algorithm is presented to achieve both competitive hardware complexity and better error-correcting performance by dealing with least reliable bits and compensating one extra error outside the least reliable set. For BCH (255, 239; 2) and (255, 231; 3) codes, our proposed soft BCH decoders can achieve up to 0.75-dB coding gain with one extra error compensation and 5% less complexity than the traditional hard BCH decoders.", "paper_title": "Improved High Code-Rate Soft BCH Decoder Architectures With One Extra Error Compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000325227200018"}
