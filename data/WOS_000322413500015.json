This extracted data can then be utilized by computerized systems to perform syndromic surveillance. In particular, the chief complaint-a short string that describes a patient's symptoms-has come to be a vital resource for syndromic surveillance in the North American context due to its near ubiquity. This paper reviews fifteen systems in North America-at the city, county, state and federal level-that use chief complaints for syndromic surveillance. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
