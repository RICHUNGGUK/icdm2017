Given a set S of n points in the plane and a highway speed v, we consider the problem of finding a highway that minimizes the maximum travel time over all pairs of points in S. If the orientation of the highway is fixed the optimal highway can be computed in linear time both for the L(1)- and the Euclidean metric as the underlying metric. If arbitrary orientations are allowed, then the optimal highway can be computed in O(n(2) log n) time. We also consider the problem of computing an optimal pair of highways, one being horizontal, one vertical.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING OPTIMAL HIGHWAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263627000002"}
