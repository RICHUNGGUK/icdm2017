Different from state-of-the-art NoC routers, the router has three important characteristics: (1) It employs layered switching, which implements wormhole on top of virtual cut-through (VCT) switching; (2) In contrast to input buffered architectures, it adopts an output buffered architecture; (3) It is single cycle, meaning that the router pipeline takes only one cycle for all flits. Experimental results show that the router achieves up to 80% of ideal network throughput under uniform random traffic pattern. Compared with wormhole switching, layered switching achieves up to 36.9% latency reduction for 12-flit packets under uniform random traffic with an injection rate of 0.5 flit/cycle/node. Under 65 nm technology synthesized results show that its critical path has only 20 logic gates, and it reduces 11% area compared to the input virtual-channel router with the same buffer capacity.
