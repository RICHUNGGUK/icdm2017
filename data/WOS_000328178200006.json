To satisfy these special demands in the design of an autonomous mobile robot, a motion controller, based on the dynamical behavior of a known discrete chaotic system, the Logistic map, is presented in this paper. The proposed method is based on a micro-controller for realizing a chaotic random bit generator and converting the produced chaotic bit sequence, to the robot's trajectory of motion. The experimental results confirm that this approach, with an appropriate sensor for obstacle avoidance, can obtain very satisfactory results in regard to the fast scanning of the robot's workspace with unpredictable way.
