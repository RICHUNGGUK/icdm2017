The stabilization system has been designed to provide enough precision for vehicles flying at an altitude of < 2000 m and a speed of < 400 km/h. The design comprises a 3-axis accelerometer/gyroscope kit, an embedded controller (executing a Kalman filter and a postprocessing smoothing algorithm) and a kit of 3-axis orthogonally mounted high-torque servos.", "paper_title": "Low-cost stabilized platform for airborne sensor positioning", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100034"}
