Conceptualizing organizations as interpretation systems, we posit that the internal scanning of emerging organizational needs will have a direct positive effect on a firm's level of enterprise IT assimilation, moderated by the extent of technology evaluation activities. In this model, we introduce the concept of information systems (IS) mindfulness, an elevated state of collective alertness toward IS clients' needs. Our findings suggest that the presence of IS mindfulness increases an IS unit's ability to identify and interpret opportunities to assimilate enterprise-wide IT within a firm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
