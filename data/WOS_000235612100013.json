The scheme is used to simulate a resonant tunneling diode and provides an important reduction of the simulation time. The improvement is twofold. First the grid spacing in the position variable is made coarser by using oscillating interpolation functions derived from the WKB asymptotics. Then the discretization of the energy variable, which is a parameter for the Schrodinger equation, is improved by approaching the wavefunctions in the double barrier region by its projection on the resonant states (following the work of Presilla-Sjostrand and Jona-Lasinio [On Schrodinger equations with concentrated non-linearities, Ann. Phys. 240 (1995) 1-21]).
