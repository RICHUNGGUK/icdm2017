We first present the step-by-step effect of a series of optimizations on performance. These optimizations improve the performance of PCDM by up to a factor of six. They target issues that very often limit the performance of scientific computing codes. We then evaluate the interaction of PCDM with a real SMT-based SMP system, using both high-level metrics, such as execution time, and low-level information from hardware performance counters.
