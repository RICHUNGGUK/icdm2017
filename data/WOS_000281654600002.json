These challenges are the prime hindrance for ECG based biometric being commercialized as a pervasive authentication mechanism. At least, ECG based biometric can provide a secured mechanism for cardiac patients being monitored over telephony network. In this paper, we present a polynomial distance measurement (PDM) method for ECG based biometric authentication for the very first time, according to the literature and to the best of our knowledge. The proposed PDM method is up to 12 times faster than existing algorithms, requires up to 6.5 times less template storage, needs only 2.49 (average) acquisition time with the highest accuracy rate (up to 100 per cent) when experimented on a population size of 15. Moreover, this proposed ECG based biometric system was deployed on a mobile phone based telemonitoring scenario with multilayer authentication mechanism upholding its applicability.
