Cloud applications are becoming even bigger and more complex with a high availability requirement. This paper presents a modeling strategy based on a hierarchical and heterogeneous modeling for cloud infrastructure planning. This modeling strategy allows the selection of cloud infrastructures according to dependability and cost requirements. Additionally, a stochastic model generator for cloud infrastructure planning provides automatic generation of dependability and cost models for representing cloud infrastructures. A case study based on Moodle hosted on a Eucalyptus platform is adopted to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed solution (modeling strategy and tooling).", "paper_title": "A Modeling Approach for Cloud Infrastructure Planning Considering Dependability and Cost Requirements", "paper_id": "WOS:000351545900001"}
