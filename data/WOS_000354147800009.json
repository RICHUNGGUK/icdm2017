Medical images normally exhibit large intra-class variation and inter-class ambiguity in the feature space. Modelling of feature space separation between different classes is thus problematic and this affects the classification performance. Our LSRE model tackles this issue in an ensemble classification construct. The image set is first partitioned into subclusters based on spectral clustering with approximation-based affinity matrix. Basis representations of the test image are then generated with sparse approximation from the subclusters. These basis representations are finally fused with approximation- and distribution-based weights to classify the test image. Our experimental results on a large HRCT database show good performance improvement over existing popular classifiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
