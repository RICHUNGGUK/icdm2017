They usually represent incomplete specifications of required or forbidden properties of communication protocols. We consider in this paper two basic problems concerning the automated validation of HMSC specifications, namely model-checking and synthesis. We identify natural syntactic restrictions of HMSCs for which we can solve the above questions. We show first that model-checking for globally cooperative (and locally cooperative) HMSCs is decidable within the same complexity as for the restricted class of bounded HMSCs. Furthermore, model-checking local-choice HMSCs turns out to be as efficient as for finite-state (sequential) systems. The study of locally cooperative and local-choice HMSCs is motivated by the synthesis question, i.e., the question of implementing HMSCs through communicating finite-state machines (CFM) with additional message data. We show that locally cooperative and local-choice HMSCs are always implementable. Furthermore, the implementation of a local-choice HMSC is deadlock-free and of linear size. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
