Convex optimization and generalization properties of SVM are applied to the black-box modeling of a microwave transistor. It has been shown that SVM has a high potential of accurate and efficient device modeling. This is verified by giving a worked example as compared with ANN which is another commonly used modeling technique. It can be concluded that hereafter SVM modeling is a strongly competitive approach against ANN modeling.", "paper_title": "Signal-noise support vector model of a microwave transistor", "paper_id": "WOS:000248241600004"}
