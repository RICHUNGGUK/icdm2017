The proposed method does not use any observer and can prevent the high gain actions in control inputs. Provided the variation of the disturbance in the two consecutive sampling instances is not changed significantly, it is shown that system states and system outputs are finally constrained in small bounded regions, respectively. Simulation results support the theoretical developments.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Output Feedback Controller Design for Sampled-Data Linear Uncertain Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310397900017"}
