Fractional frequency multiplication is obtained by cascading a broadband injection locked modulo-two divider and a multiply-by-three circuit based on edge combining. The proposed solution is inductorless, thus very compact. It allows the generation of all frequencies from 2.7 to 6.1 GHz with a performance suitable for cellular standards. It shows a phase noise floor below -150 dBc/Hz and a spurious level below -35 dBc. The multiplier by 3/2 consumes 5 mA and the VCO draws 10 mA from a 1.2 V supply. The additional power consumption due to the multiplier trades with the small area penalty and the flexibility of this solution, compared to the use of multiple LC VCOs.", "paper_title": "A 2.7-6.1 GHz CMOS local oscillator based on frequency multiplication by 3/2", "paper_id": "WOS:000312769900003"}
