Those studies allow exploring experimentally the proof-theoretic side of Common Knowledge Logic. This work is original in that nobody has considered Higher Order Common Knowledge Logic from the point of view of proofs performed on a proof assistant. As a matter of facts, it is experimental by nature as it tries to draw conclusions from experiments.", "paper_title": "Mechanizing common knowledge logic using COQ", "paper_id": "WOS:000247210400002"}
