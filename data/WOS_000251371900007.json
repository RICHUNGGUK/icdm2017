This study aimed to investigate whether the choice of steric molecular field settings significantly influences the predictive performance of CoMFA and, if so, which is the best. The three-dimensional quantitative structure activity relationship (3D-QSAR) models based on Lennard-Jones, indicator, parabolic and Gaussian steric fields were compared using 28 datasets taken from the literature. The analysis of the predictive ability of these models (cross validated R-2) indicates that steric fields in which the value drops off quickly with distance (i.e. Lennard-Jones and indicator fields) tend to perform better than the Gaussian version, which has a slower and smoother decrease. Furthermore, depending on the steric field type used, the field sampling density (i.e. grid spacing) has a variable influence on the predictive ability of the models generated.", "paper_title": "Effect of steric molecular field settings on CoMFA predictivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000251371900007"}
