We demonstrate that the MOF method provides the most accurate tracking of interfaces, followed by the VOF method with the right material ordering The material-order-independent VOF method performs somewhat worse than the above two while the solutions with VOF using the wrong material order are considerably worse (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier Inc.", "paper_title": "A comparative study of interface reconstruction methods for multi-material ALE simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000274928300002"}
