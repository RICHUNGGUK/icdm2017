Three common lumped models are investigated: resistor, capacitor, and inductor, and three different formulations for each model are analyzed: the explicit, semi-implicit and implicit schemes. Analysis results show that the extended ADI-FDTD algorithm is not unconditionally stable in the explicit scheme case, and the stability criterion depends on the value of lumped models, but in the semi-implicit and implicit cases, the algorithm is stable. Finally, two simple microstrip circuits including lumped elements are simulated to demonstrate validity of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Stability analysis of the extended ADI-FDTD technique including lumped models", "paper_id": "WOS:000259676700016"}
