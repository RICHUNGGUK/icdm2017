In this paper we present applications of the recent further development of OFIS for calculating both particulate matter and ozone concentrations. In particular, we refer to the analysis of the model performance in the framework of the project MERLIN and the CITYDELTA exercise. OFIS was applied to simulate the urban plume Formation of Milan. Berlin and their surrounding areas for a period of six months to one year. In this paper model results are presented as appropriate indicators of long term pollution of ozone and particulate matter and the model performance is assessed on the basis of available observational evidence using appropriate statistical indices.
