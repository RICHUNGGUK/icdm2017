Design/methodology/approach - Various changes on the magnetically relevant parts of the machine design have been discussed formerly to achieve improved electromagnetic and acoustic behavior. The electrical part of the machine is considered in this paper, varying the stator winding arrangement to achieve optimized behavior. Findings - Provides information about motivation and the methodology of the optimization process. Presents the entire analysis, covering idea, technical and computational implementation as well as verification. Research limitations/implications - It describes a method based on the utilization of specific, partly self-generated software, which perhaps limits its usefulness if mentioned tools are unavailable. However, the presented basic method is to be used generally. Originality/value - This paper presents a promising approach to further optimize the design of synchronous claw-pole alternators without major changes in the machine design.", "paper_title": "Stator optimization of six-phase claw-pole alternators using asymmetric winding arrangements", "paper_id": "WOS:000237037300012"}
