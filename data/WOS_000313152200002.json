Recently, companies have attempted to take advantage of social advertising to deliver their advertisements to appropriate customers. The success of message propagation in social media depends greatly on the content relevance and the closeness of social relationships. In this paper, considering the factors of user preference, network influence, and propagation capability, we propose a diffusion mechanism to deliver advertising information over microblogging media. Our experimental results show that the proposed model could provide advertisers with suitable targets for diffusing advertisements continuously and thus efficiently enhance advertising effectiveness.
