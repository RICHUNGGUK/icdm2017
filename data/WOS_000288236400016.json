DNA gyrase is a well-established antibacterial target consisting of two subunits, GyrA and GyrB, in a heterodimer A(2)B(2). GyrA is involved in DNA breakage and reunion and GyrB catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP. The GyrB subunit from Escherichia coli has been investigated, namely the ATP binding pocket both considering the protein without ligands and bound with the inhibitors clorobiocin, novobiocin and 5'-adenylyl-beta-gamma-imidodiphosphate. The stability of the systems was studied by molecular dynamics simulation with the further analysis of the time dependent root-mean-square coordinate deviation (RMSD) from the initial structure, and temperature factors. Moreover, exploration of the conformational space of the systems during the MD simulation was carried out by a clustering data mining technique using the average-linkage algorithm. Recognizing the key residues in the binding site of the enzyme that are involved in the binding mode with the aforementioned inhibitors was investigated by using two techniques: free energy decomposition and computational alanine scanning. The results from these simulations highlight the important residues in the ATP binding site and can be useful in the design process of potential new inhibitors. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
