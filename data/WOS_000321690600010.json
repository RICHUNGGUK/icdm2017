Units' lifetimes are assumed to follow a Weibull distribution, and the number of random removals at each inspection is assumed to follow a binomial distribution. The optimal ALT plans, which minimize the asymptotic variance of an estimated quantile at use condition, are determined. The expected duration of the test and the expected number of inspections on each stress level are calculated. A numerical study is conducted to investigate the properties of the derived ALT plans under different parameter values. For illustration purpose, a numerical example is also given.", "paper_title": "Design of accelerated life test plans under progressive Type II interval censoring with random removals", "paper_id": "WOS:000321690600010"}
