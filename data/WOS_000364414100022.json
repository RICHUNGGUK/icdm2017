In this letter, a novel iterative speaker model alignment (ISMA) method is proposed to address this problem. First, the source and target speaker models are each trained from the background model by adopting maximum a posteriori (MAP) algorithm. Then, a novel ISMA method is presented for alignment and transformation of spectral features. Finally, the proposed ISMA approach is further combined with a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to improve the conversion performance. A series of objective and subjective experiments are carried out on CMU ARCTIC dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approach.", "paper_title": "A Novel Iterative Speaker Model Alignment Method from Non-Parallel Speech for Voice Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000364414100022"}
