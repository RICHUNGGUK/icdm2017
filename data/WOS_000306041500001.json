SPreAD-GIS incorporates commonly available datasets on land cover, topography, and weather conditions to calculate noise propagation patterns and excess noise above ambient conditions for one-third octave frequency bands around one or multiple sound sources. User-specified noise source characteristics, ambient sound conditions, and frequency-weighting make SPreAD-GIS flexible to incorporate field measurements and model noise propagation for any type of source, environment, or species. SPreAD-GIS is a free, open-source application written in Python and implemented as a toolbox in ArcGIS software. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
