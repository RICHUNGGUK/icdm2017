The optimization relies on the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) and the flow simulations use vortex methods with the Brinkman penalization to enforce boundary conditions in complex bodies. We exploit the inherent parallelism of CMA-ES, by implementing a multi-host framework which allows for the distribution of the expensive cost function evaluations across parallel architectures, without being limited to one computing facility. This study repeats in silico for the first time Ingo Rechenberg's pioneering wind tunnel experiments for drag reduction that led to the inception of evolution strategies. The simulations confirm that the results of these experimental studies indicate a flat plate is not the optimal solution for drag reduction in linked bodies. We present the vorticity field of the flow and identify the governing mechanisms for this drag reduction by the slightly corrugated linked plate configuration. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
