The material handling transport modes provide movement of work pieces between workstations along their manufacturing routes in the MTN. The main contribution of this work is the solution to a constraint satisfaction problem aimed at AGVs fleet match-up scheduling while taking into consideration assumed itineraries of concurrently manufactured product types. In other words, assuming a given topology of the MTN and schedules of operation sequences modeling concurrently manufactured product types, the main objective is to provide a declarative framework aimed at determining conditions allowing one to adjust the AGVs fleet schedule due to the timetable of operations executed in an assumed multi-product manufacturing environment.
