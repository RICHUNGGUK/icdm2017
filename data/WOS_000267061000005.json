The velocity guidance is such a strategy that when vehicle approach the traffic light, suggested velocities are provided for avoiding the vehicles' sharp brakes in front of red light. Simulation results show that this strategy may significantly reduce the vehicles' stopping rate and the effect size is dependent upon the traffic density, the detector position, the signal's cycle time and the obedience rate of vehicles to the guidance.", "paper_title": "A MODIFIED CELLULAR AUTOMATION MODEL FOR RING ROAD TRAFFIC WITH VELOCITY GUIDANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000267061000005"}
