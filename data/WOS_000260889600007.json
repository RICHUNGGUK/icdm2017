A new rate control method for transporting such multimedia data over parallel wireless links with heterogeneous reliability is proposed. Rate-controlled parallel transmissions (RCPTs) of different layers of a multimedia stream with different levels of importance over a wireless channel that support multiple links with heterogeneous reliability can improve the efficiency in resource allocation while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement of the multimedia connection. To exploit RCPT, we present and evaluate a novel dynamic resource allocation method that decomposes the available radio resources into multiple sets of links with different levels of reliability. We mathematically formulate a rate control problem for the flexible RCPT scheme and develop an efficient real-time resource allocation algorithm with a remarkably fast rate of convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the utility and reduces the power consumed for delivery of a multimedia stream at the required QoS, in comparison with a previous scheme, where different layers of each multimedia class are scheduled with dependency, and two schemes that provide homogeneous high or low reliability over all parallel links.", "paper_title": "Utility-Based Rate-Controlled Parallel Wireless Transmission of Multimedia Streams with Multiple Importance Levels", "paper_id": "WOS:000260889600007"}
