We use different business decision-making techniques for doing so. We consider the use of the Hamming distance, the adequacy coefficient and the index of maximum and minimum level. That is, we use the OWA distance (OWAD), the OWA adequacy coefficient (OWAAC) and the OWA index of maximum and minimum level (OWAIMAM) operator. By using the OWA operator, we can parameterize these decision-making techniques from the maximum to the minimum result according to the interests of the decision-maker. We develop an illustrative example regarding the decision-making process to follow in the selection of a football player for a team. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
