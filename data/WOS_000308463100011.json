Besides reducing the energy consumptions of the clusters, it is necessary to make the clusters achieve equal lifetimes so that the whole network can survive longer. In this paper, we focus on the cluster lifetimes in multi-hop WSNs with cooperative multi-input single-output scheme. With a simplified model of multi-hop WSNs, we change the transmission schemes, the sizes and transmission distances of clusters to investigate their effects on the cluster lifetimes. Furthermore, linear and uniform data aggregations are considered in our model. As a result, we analyze the cluster lifetimes in different situations and discuss the requirements on the sizes and transmission distances of clusters for equal lifetimes.", "paper_title": "A Study on Cluster Lifetime in Multi-Hop Wireless Sensor Networks with Cooperative MISO Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000308463100011"}
