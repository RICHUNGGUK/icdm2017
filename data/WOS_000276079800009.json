Denote by ex(n; C-4) the maximum number of edges of a graph on n vertices and free of squares C-4. We use the constructed graphs G(q) to obtain lower bounds on the extremal function ex(n; C-4), for some n < q(2) + q + 1. In particular, we construct a C-4-free graph on n = q(2) - root q vertices and 1/2q(q(2) - 1) - 1/2 root q(q - 1) edges, for a square prime power q.", "paper_title": "Adjacency matrices of polarity graphs and of other C-4-free graphs of large size", "paper_id": "WOS:000276079800009"}
