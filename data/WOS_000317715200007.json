The huge number of images and videos continually being uploaded by millions of people have stimulated a variety of visual media creation and editing applications, while also posing serious challenges of retrieval, organization, and utilization. This article surveys recent research as regards processing of large collections of images and video, including work on analysis, manipulation, and synthesis. It discusses the problems involved, and suggests possible future directions in this emerging research area.", "paper_title": "Internet visual media processing: a survey with graphics and vision applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000317715200007"}
