If we think of omega(2) as lexicographically ordered omega x omega, then any particular zero-time transition can be represented by states whose indices are all elements of some {n} x omega. In order to express non-infinitesimal transitions, we have introduced a new unary temporal operator [omega] (omega-jump), whose effect on the time flow is the same as the effect of alpha -> alpha + omega in omega(2). In terms of lexicographically ordered to omega x omega, [omega]phi is satisfied in < i, j >-th time instant iff phi is satisfied in < i + 1, 0 >-th time instant. Moreover, in order to formally capture the natural semantics of the until operator U, we have introduced a local variant u of the until operator. More precisely, phi u phi is satisfied in < i, j >-th time instant iff psi is satisfied in < i, j + k >-th time instant for some nonnegative integer k, and phi is satisfied in < i, j + l >-th time instant for all 0 <= l < k. As in many of our previous publications, the leitmotif is the usage of infinitary inference rules in order to achieve the strong completeness. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
