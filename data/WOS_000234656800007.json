In this paper, we analyze some of these schemes under a stochastic model. We have derived expressions for average cost of checkpointing, rollback recovery, message logging and piggybacking with application messages in synchronous as well as asynchronous checkpointing. For quasi-synchronous checkpointing we show that in a system with n processes, the upper bound and lower bound of selective message logging are O(n(2)) and O(n), respectively. (c) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
