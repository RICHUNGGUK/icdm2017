Lifelog based context awareness is a technology that provides a service automatically based on perceived situational information in ubiquitous environments. To offer customized services to users, the technology of acquiring lifelog based context information in real time is the most important consideration. We propose the interactive middleware architecture for lifelog based context awareness in distributed and ubiquitous environments. Conventional middleware to support ubiquitous environments stores and manages the situational information and service content acquired by centralized storage or a DBMS. Centralized situational information and service content management may impede the autonomy of mobile nodes and the interoperation between different middle software. The proposed method designs a system that can distribute and manage situational information in mobile nodes using mobile devices in distributed and ubiquitous environments and share the service content between interactive middleware through publication. The application system designed in this study was used in a scenario providing situational perception based mobile service and proved to be useful.", "paper_title": "Interactive middleware architecture for lifelog based context awareness", "paper_id": "WOS:000338317400026"}
