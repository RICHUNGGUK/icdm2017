Complex multidimensional integrals are avoided by using hierarchical likelihood to estimate the regression parameters and to predict the realizations of random effects. The adjusted profile hierarchical likelihood is adopted to estimate the parameters in frailty distribution, during which the first- and second-order methods are used. The simulation studies indicate that the regression-parameter estimates in the Weibull frailty model are accurate, which is similar to the gamma frailty and lognormal frailty models. Two published data sets are used for illustration.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical likelihood approach for the Weibull frailty model", "paper_id": "WOS:000287499100007"}
