In the RB-HARQ, the receiver returns both NAK signal and set of unreliable bit indices if the received sequence is not accepted. Since each unreliable bit index is determined by the bitwise posterior probability, better approximation of that probability becomes crucial as the number of retransmissions increases. Assuming the systematic code for the initial transmission, the proposed RB-HARQ scheme has the following two features: (a) the sender retransmits newly encoded and interleaved parity bits corresponding to the unreliable information bits; (b) the retransmitted parity bits as well as the initial received sequence are put all together to perform the message passing decoding i.e. the suboptimal MAP decoding. Finally, simulation results are shown to evaluate the above two features.", "paper_title": "Reliability-based hybrid ARQ scheme with encoded parity bit retransmissions and message passing decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000250093700003"}
