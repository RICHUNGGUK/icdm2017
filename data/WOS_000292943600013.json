We have developed a 4K/2K layered video streaming system with JPEG 2000 codec. It offers three main advances; support of various video formats to realize a media exchange platform, 4K/2K layered streaming with multicast to utilize 4K images even if the environment has no 4K equipment, and robust transmission using a forward error correction (FEC) scheme that can deal with bandwidths beyond 800 Mbit/s. Using the system, we conducted the world's first multi-point \"shared collaborative space\" experiment with a large audience in CineGrid International Workshop 2008. It proved the feasibility of the new environment for 4K remote collaboration between multiple points including those that did not have 4K equipment. This paper details the system and implemented technologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
