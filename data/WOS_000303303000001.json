We provide an O (n)-time, 4-approximation algorithm and an O (n log(2) n)-time, 2-approximation algorithm to compute the bandwidth of convex bipartite graphs with n vertices. We also consider 2-directional orthogonal ray graphs, a superclass of convex bipartite graphs, for which we provide an O (n(2) log n)-time, 3-approximation algorithm, where n is the number of vertices.
