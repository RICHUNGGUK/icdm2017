In order to protect each participant's privilege and security, a secure and efficient access control is essential. This paper presents a new approach of access mechanism based on trust relationships across domains. A new calculation method of trust in grid is proposed and the difference between intro-domain trust and inter-domain trust is analyzed. In addition, a novel access control framework combined with trust degree is given from this proposal. It is shown to be adaptive for both intro-domain and inter-domain conditions. Hence, a prototype system based on the proposed model is introduced; furthermore, it has been shown as a dynamic and fine-granularity access control method through performance analyses and has also been demonstrated as a suitable system for grid environments.
