Here the tools of convex analysis are applied to a basic model of incomplete financial markets in which assets are traded and money can be lent or borrowed between the present and future. The existence of an equilibrium is established with techniques that include bounds derived from the duals to problems of utility maximization. Composite variational inequalities furnish the modeling platform. Models with and without short-selling are handled, moreover in the absence of any requirement that agents must initially have a positive amount of every asset, as is typical in equilibrium work in economics.", "paper_title": "Convex analysis and financial equilibrium", "paper_id": "WOS:000344809700009"}
