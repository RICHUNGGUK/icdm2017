A promising simulation result shows that more quantitative analysis has been carried out to clearly visualize the goodness and robustness of the proposed embedded algorithms for hole-filler.", "paper_title": "Hole-Filler Cellular Neural Network Simulation by RKGHM(5,5)", "paper_id": "WOS:000302346300003"}
