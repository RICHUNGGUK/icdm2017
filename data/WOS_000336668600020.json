In concrete, a revised network modeling formulation is utilized, allowing extended networking capabilities with a novel, generic, and compact way of organizing network topology information. This optimization framework offers a number of very convenient features: distribution of the overall network control effort among the local agents; no overall network knowledge required; the introduction/elimination of a node only affects to its neighbors. Thus, this integrated framework offers a powerful and easy-to-use mathematical tool in order to analyze and manage a wide variety of today's large-scale network. Specifically, this methodology is applied here to a power network to show the benefit of the work developed.", "paper_title": "An Integrated Framework for Distributed Model Predictive Control of Large-Scale Power Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600020"}
