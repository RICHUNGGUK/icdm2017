The clinical profile of diabetic subjects is often worsened by the presence of several long-term complications, for example neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, and cataract. Comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) and comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) were performed on a series of 2,4-thiazolidinediones derivatives as aldose reductase (ALR2) inhibitors. Molecular ligand superimposition on a template structure was finished by the database alignment method. The 3D-QSAR models resulted from 44 molecules gave q (2) values of 0.773 and 0.817, r (2) values of 0.981 and 0.979 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively. The contour maps from the models indicated that a large volume group next to the R-substituent will increase the ALR2 inhibitory activity. In fact, adding a -CH2COOH substituent at the R-position would generate a new compound with higher predicted activity.", "paper_title": "CoMFA and CoMSIA analysis of 2,4-thiazolidinediones derivatives as aldose reductase inhibitors", "paper_id": "WOS:000266165000005"}
