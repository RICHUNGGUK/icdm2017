The second contribution of our work is a careful description of the necessary steps to make a heterogeneous network interoperate and the implementation of a network stack for the 4 most representative hardware platforms, as used by the relevant research community (Arduino, SunSPOT, TelosB, iSense), in the form of a software library, named mkSense, which enables their intercommunication. Moreover, we describe the design and implementation of a software library which can be used for building \"intelligent software\" for the Web of Things.", "paper_title": "Controlling Physical Objects via the Internet using the Arduino Platform over 802.15.4 Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305833000006"}
