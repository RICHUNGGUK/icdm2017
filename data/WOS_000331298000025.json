In this paper, we showcase the performance of a scanner based on a 24 MHz center-frequency 128 element array, developed for applications in dermatology. We perform system characterization to examine the imaging performance achieved. We then showcase its imaging ability on healthy tissue and cancer. Finally, we image burns and human lesions in vivo and gain insights on the benefits and challenges of this approach as it is considered for diagnostic and treatment follow-up applications in dermatology and beyond.", "paper_title": "24-MHz Scanner for Optoacoustic Imaging of Skin and Burn", "paper_id": "WOS:000331298000025"}
