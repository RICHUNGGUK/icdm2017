It accomplishes its task through the employment of a theoretical, infinite capacity, virtual buffer. Information acquired from the virtual buffer is used to construct a probability distribution function that is based on the Fokker-Planck equation. This distribution function is central to the VIPER algorithm and is used to compute the queue length predictions. The predictions are shown to be promising. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
