According to object-oriented modeling technique, a virtual simulation modeling subsystem is put forward. At the same time, as a kernel of the system, an optimization subsystem is also described, which uses a new hybrid optimization algorithm and an optimization engine based Runtime Automat. Finally, SimOpt, a simulation optimization system oriented to manufacturing system, is developed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
