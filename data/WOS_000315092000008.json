Such an element can be, for example, a compliant platform where the operated object (plant) is installed or an elastic gear that connects an engine with this movable object. The control (force or torque) is bounded in magnitude. Only the first (lowest) resonance frequency is taken into account. The system under examination has two degrees of freedom. The linear mathematical model of this system has a double zero eigenvalue and two complex eigenvalues. A control law for this system is designed that steers the plant from the given initial state to a given terminal state in finite time (assuming that there is no damping). The control is divided into intervals on which it varies linearly depending on time or is constant. The time intervals on which the control varies are equal to the period of the natural vibrations of the system. If there is no damping, this makes it possible to completely avoid vibrations on the time intervals where the control is constant.
