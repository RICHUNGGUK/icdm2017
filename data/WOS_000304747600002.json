Consequently, context-aware services are usually developed without considering interoperability among different systems, devices and services. This work presents an open framework for ubiquitous environments, with a distributed context management architecture and a communication model based on standard protocols. With this framework, a smart device can search for context-aware services and a service can be easily deployed via standard protocols and distributed context managers. A prototype of the framework has been implemented to demonstrate its feasibility.", "paper_title": "Open framework for distributed context management in ubiquitous environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000304747600002"}
