Facing various mutual funds, it is necessary to evaluate their performances. This study uses association rules to understand the relationships among various mutual funds. First, equity funds are categorized into high, medium and low risk levels. This study then evaluates the co-movement among funds within the same risk level and among funds across different risk levels. This study concludes that within any given risk level, the performances of at least seven funds exhibit strong co-movement. This study also shows the influence of the global economy on the correlations among different funds. Finally, investment recommendations are provided based on the findings. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
