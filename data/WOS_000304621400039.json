However, in contrast with the large number of studies on the inhibition mechanism of the serine proteases by the STI-Kunitz inhibitors, the structural aspects of the inhibition mechanism of aspartic proteases from this family of inhibitors are poorly understood. In the present study, we have combined sequence and structural analysis methods with protein-protein docking to gain a better understanding of the SLAPI inhibition mechanism of the proteinase A. The results suggest that: i) SLAPI loop L9 may be involved in the inhibitor interaction with the proteinase AA ' s active site, and ii) the residues I144, V148, L149, P151, F152 and R154 are implicated in the difference in the potency shown previously by SLAPI and another STI-Kunitz inhibitor isolated from Solanum tuberosum to inhibit proteinase A. These results will be useful in the design of site directed mutagenesis experiments to understand more thoroughly the aspartic protease inhibition mechanism of SLAPI and other related STI-Kunitz inhibitors.", "paper_title": "Predicting functional residues of the Solanum lycopersicum aspartic protease inhibitor (SLAPI) by combining sequence and structural analysis with molecular docking", "paper_id": "WOS:000304621400039"}
