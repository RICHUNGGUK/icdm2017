Patch alignment framework (PAF) is an important systematic framework that can be applied to understand the common thought and essential differences of a numerous dimensionality reduction algorithms, e.g., principal component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and locally linear embedding and ISOMAP. These algorithms do not consider the intra-class local geometry and the inter-class discrimination simultaneously. In this paper, we present a new dimensionality reduction algorithm based on PAF, termed the discriminative information preservation based dimensionality reduction or DIP for short. First, DIP models the local geometry of intra-class samples by using Locality preserving projection (LPP) rebuilt upon PAF. Second, it models the discriminative information of inter-class samples by maximizing the margin. Thoroughly experimental evidence on several public face datasets suggests the effectiveness of DIP compared with the popular algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
