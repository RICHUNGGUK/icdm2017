Algorithms reducing the studied objects associated with the boundary value problems are reduced to the Cauchy problem through both the Finite Difference Method (FDM) with approximation of O(c(2)) and the Finite Element Method (FEM). The constructed Cauchy problem is solved via the fourth- and sixth-order Runge-Kutta methods. The validity and reliability of the obtained results is rigorously discussed. We analyze time histories, phase and modal portraits, autocorrelation functions, the Poincare and pseudo-Poincare maps, signs of the first four Lyapunov exponents, as well as the compression factor of the phase volume of an attractor. In particular, we study a transition from symmetric to asymmetric vibrations and we explain this phenomenon. Vibration-type charts are reported regarding two control parameters: amplitude q(0) and frequency omega(p) of the uniformly distributed periodic excitation. Furthermore, we have detected and illustrated chaotic vibrations of the Euler-Bernoulli beams for different boundary conditions and different beams thickness. In addition, we study chaotic dynamics and synchronization of multi-layer beams coupled only via boundary conditions. Computational examples of the theoretical investigations are given, where geometric, physical and design non-linearities are taken into account. (C) 2015 Civil-Comp Ltd and Elsevier Ltd.
