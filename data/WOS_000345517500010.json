Therefore, we combine ideas proposed in Artificial Bee Colony algorithm (Karaboga and Basturk, 2007) and Bisection method (Burden and Douglas, 1985). This method is new and very efficient for solving a nonlinear equation. We illustrate this method with four benchmark functions and compare results with others methods, such as ABC, PSO, GA and Firefly algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
