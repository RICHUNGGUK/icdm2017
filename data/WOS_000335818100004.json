This paper presents a system-level, value-driven approach to test case prioritization called the Prioritization of Requirements for Test (PORT). PORT involves analysing and assigning value to each requirement using the following four factors: requirements volatility, customer priority, implementation complexity, and fault proneness. System test cases are prioritized such that the test cases for requirements with higher priority are executed earlier during system test. PORT was applied to four student team projects as well as an industrial case study. The results show that PORT improves the rate of detection of severe failures over random prioritization. Additionally, the results indicate that customer priority was the most important contributor towards improved rate of failure detection.
