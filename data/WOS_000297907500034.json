It is based on the P-order shear deformation theory with an added zigzag function. The viscoelastic properties are taken into account with frequency dependent elastic moduli measured with a Dynamic Mechanical Thermal Analyzer. A method based on Pade approximant is also used to reduce the computation time. This acceleration technique enables to achieve fast frequency sweep computations compared to a standard direct method. Finally, validations are made on plates and cylindrical geometries. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
