Motivated by the necessity for establishing communication in wireless ad hoc networks in which the only information available to a vertex is its immediate neighborhood, we are considering routing algorithms that use the neighborhood information of a vertex for routing with constant memory only. We solve the problem for three types of directed planar geometric networks: Eulerian (in which every vertex has the same number of incoming and outgoing edges), Outerplanar (in which a single face contains all vertices of the network), and Strongly Face Connected, a new class of geometric networks that we define in the article, consisting of several faces, each face being a strongly connected outerplanar graph.
