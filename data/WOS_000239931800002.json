The mathematical model takes into account and discretizes the local topography of the rough profile. The simulation outcome will be the 3D velocity and pressure fields of the fluid film within the contact borders. This work is limited to the study of numerical resolution methods working solely in finite differences. The algorithms will be tested by analysing and comparing their results with analytically known flows.
