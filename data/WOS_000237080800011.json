After extracting the commonness and characteristics of templates, authors combine Cooperative Template concept and CSCD technologies skillfully and develop a collaborative design platform called Cooperative Template Modeling System (CoTM). Cooperative Template mechanism including cooperative template description and pattern, cooperative template operation, serial-parallel design and task management is implemented in the platform, which brings a technological advance to the mechanism itself at the same time. Several instances are provided to demonstrate the features and utility of Cooperative Template mechanism. Due to the inheritance, reusability and information-reduction function of the cooperative template, authors believe that cooperative template mechanism will play an important role in design efficiency and trans-regional design in cooperative design environment.", "paper_title": "Cooperative template mechanism for cooperative design", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800011"}
