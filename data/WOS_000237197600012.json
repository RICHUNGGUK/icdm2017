This paper considers the relation between goal-oriented business process modeling and organizational change and addresses the question \"how can we reason about organizational change using a goal-driven approach?\" To this end, it describes a systematic way-of-working for modeling organizational change and presents empirical results and observations from applying this approach in a large industrial application in the domain of utility deregulation. The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to demonstrate and assess the applicability of the proposed methodology on a nontrivial application and secondly to illustrate a number of challenging issues that need to be addressed by goal-driven methodologies in order to effectively support the process of change.", "paper_title": "Experiences with goal-oriented modeling of organizational change", "paper_id": "WOS:000237197600012"}
