In response to these advances, the search for novel implementations of arithmetic-intensive circuitry has intensified For the portability requirement in telecommunication systems, there is a need for low power hardware implementation of fast fourier transforms algorithm. This paper proposes the hardware implementation of low power multiplier-less radix-4 single-path delay commutator pipelined fast fourier transform processor architecture of sizes 16, 64 and 256 points. The multiplier-less architecture uses common sub-expression sharing to replace complex multiplications with simpler shift and add operations. By combining a new commutator architecture and low power butterfly architecture with this approach power reduction is achieved When compared with a conventional fast fourier transform architecture based on non-booth coded wallace tree multiplier the power reduction in this implementation is 44% and 60% for 64-point and 16-point radix-4 fast fourier transforms respectively. The power dissipation is estimated using cadence RTL compiler. The operating frequencies are 166 MHz and 200 MHz, for 64 point and 16 point fast fourier transforms, respectively. Our implementation of the 256 point FFT architecture consumes 153 mw for an operating speed of 125 MHz.", "paper_title": "Hardware Implementation Low Power High Speed FFT Core", "paper_id": "WOS:000263196900002"}
