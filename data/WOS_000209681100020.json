It is shown that the RLS scheme is equivalent to the incremental subgradient method with an appropriate variable step size for each iteration. With this, we further replace each gradient value by its \"sign\" to form a reduced-complexity RLS (RCRLS) scheme. Simulation results show that RCRLS has some performance degradation as compared to RLS, but both of them outperform previous related methods.", "paper_title": "New Decentralized Positioning Schemes for Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Recursive Least-Squares Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681100020"}
