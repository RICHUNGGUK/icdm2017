The proposed structure use a lower voltage for cells storing low-order bits and a nominal voltage for cells storing higher order bits. The architecture allows reconfigure the number of bits in the low-voltage mode to change the error characteristics of the array in run-time. Simulations in predictive 70 nm nodes show that the proposed array can obtain 45% savings in memory power with a marginal (similar to 10%) reduction in image quality.", "paper_title": "Reconfigurable SRAM Architecture With Spatial Voltage Scaling for Low Power Mobile Multimedia Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000285844200018"}
