Tailored QMSA models have been developed from TIs selected through ridge regression. K-nearest neighbor (kNN) based estimation has been applied to all of the methods to estimate normal vapor pressure (p(vap)) and water solubility (sol) for a set of 194 chemicals. Results show that the tailored QMSA methods are Superior to arbitrary similarity methods in estimating both of these properties for the given set of chemicals.", "paper_title": "Optimal neighbor selection in molecular similarity: comparison of arbitrary versus tailored prediction spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000236110000004"}
