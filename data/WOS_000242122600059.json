Dating from the mid-1980s, the Belief-Desire-Intention architecture (BDI) is the longest-standing model of intelligent agency used in multi-agent systems. Part of the attraction of BDI is that it is amenable to logical formalisms such as Wooldridge's Logic Of Rational Agents (LORA). In a previous paper the present authors introduced a model of trust, here named the Ability-Belief-Commitment-Desire (ABCD) model, that could be implemented within the BDI framework. This paper explores the definition of the ABCD model within the LORA formalism.", "paper_title": "Trust in LORA: Towards a formal definition of trust in BDI agents", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600059"}
