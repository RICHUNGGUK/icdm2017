An arborescence in a temporal network is said to be time-respecting, if the time labels on every directed path from the root in this arborescence are monotonically non-decreasing. In this paper, we consider a characterization of the existence of arc-disjoint time-respecting arborescences in temporal networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
