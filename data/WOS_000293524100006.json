The bottleneck can be traced down to the memory usage of 3D Delaunay triangulations. Recently an approach has been suggested to tackle this problem for the specific case of smooth surfaces by subdividing the sample set in an octree and then refining each subset individually while ensuring termination and consistency. We extend this to localized refinement of volumes, which brings about some new challenges. We show how these challenges can be met with simple steps while retaining provable guarantees, and that our algorithm scales many folds better than a state-of-the-art meshing tool provided by CGAL.", "paper_title": "Localized Delaunay Refinement for Volumes", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100006"}
