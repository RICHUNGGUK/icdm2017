Several works using probabilistic, deterministic, and hybrid methods have been conducted to address key distribution among nodes. In this paper, we propose a method to distribute key-chains utilizing expander graphs based on the Zig-Zag product. Given a set of constraints such as network size, storage, and radio range, we are able to construct a resilient key distribution graph. The main advantage of the obtained method is attaining a shorter key-path length compared with previously proposed approaches. Simulation results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "A key-distribution mechanism for wireless sensor networks using Zig-Zag product", "paper_id": "WOS:000309560400001"}
