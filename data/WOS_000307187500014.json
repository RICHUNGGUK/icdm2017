The system stores medical images along with information about the content of the image, such as the presence or absence of certain indicators of pathologies. It allows us to flexibly retrieve them on the basis of these indicators, making it possible to obtain images from patients with similar diagnosis and thus, following a common visual pattern. To illustrate the capabilities of the FORDBMS, this paper focuses on X-ray images of patients suffering from scoliosis (a medical condition in which the patient's spine is curved) from which spine descriptions are obtained. Then queries are performed to obtain a set of images with a certain curvature pattern. Results show high accuracy when evaluated by medical experts. Compared with other ad hoc content-based image retrieval systems, the one presented here is easily adaptable to other application domains, customizable, and very scalable.", "paper_title": "On the Use of a Fuzzy Object-Relational Database for Flexible Retrieval of Medical Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000307187500014"}
