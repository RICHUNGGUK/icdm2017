We illustrate our approach to this problem by means of two examples: the anti-windup design for a marginally stable system with input saturation, and the design of a switching rule for a piece-wise affine system operating in different modes.", "paper_title": "Design of convergent switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241002300017"}
