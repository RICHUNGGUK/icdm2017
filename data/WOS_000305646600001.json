In this paper, we present a cooperative data processing algorithm based on mobile agent (MA-CDP), and considers MA in multihop environments and can autonomously clone and migrate themselves in response to environmental changes. MA accounts for performing data processing and making data aggregation decisions at nodes rather than bringing data back to a central processor, and redundant sensory data will be eliminated. The results of our simulation show that MA-based cooperative data processing provides better performance than directed diffusion in terms of end-to-end delivery latency, packet delivery ratio, and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "Cooperative Data Processing Algorithm Based on Mobile Agent in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305646600001"}
