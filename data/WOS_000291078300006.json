In this context, this work proposes a mechanism for supporting design decisions on energy consumption and performance of embedded system applications. In order to depict the practical usability of the proposed methodology, a real case study as well as customized examples are presented. The estimates obtained through the conceived model are 93% close to the respective measures obtained from the real hardware platform. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
