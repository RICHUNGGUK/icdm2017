The proposed algorithm includes the following features: 1) a method of inequality to confine a genetic algorithm to search a Pareto optimal set in regions of interest with little computing effort; 2) an improved rank-based fitness assignment method to significantly increase the speed of fitness evaluation; and 3) a repairing strategy to relax the infeasible flight schedules to help reduce violations of solutions. The MMGA is successfully applied to solve the aircraft routing problems in a local airline company.", "paper_title": "Method of inequality-based multiobjective genetic algorithm for domestic daily aircraft routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000253601900004"}
