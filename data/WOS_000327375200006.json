This fact has caused the conception of new types of applications, for instance, the Web applications based on RFID panels that allow users to retrieve and store resources from and to the Web through RFID panels. The development of these applications is defined by three main concepts: the Tool that performs domain model functionality, the Command that represents an action to be performed by the tool, and finally, the Resource representing the result of the command on the tool. Thus, this work presents a framework that enables developers to model Web applications based on RFID panels in terms of these concepts. The paper also exposes how to extend the framework to build four applications that belong to absolutely different domains.", "paper_title": "A Framework to Develop Web Applications Based on RFID Panels", "paper_id": "WOS:000327375200006"}
