The ERC method gives a quantitative index for measuring the diverse brain activation properties that represent the neural correlates of event-related responses. This analysis reveals distinct effects of facial attractiveness processing and also provides further information that could not have been achieved from event-related potential alone.", "paper_title": "EVENT-RELATED COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS AND ITS APPLICATION IN THE DETECTION OF FACIAL ATTRACTIVENESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000343725700006"}
