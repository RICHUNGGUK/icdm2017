These criteria are introduced in an agglomerative hierarchical clustering context, and consist of: (a) minimizing the total volume of clusters, as given by their respective convex hulls; and, (b) minimizing the global variance in cluster directionality. The method is deterministic and produces dendrograms, which are important features for microbiologists. A set of experiments, performed on yeast spectrometric data and on synthetic data, show the new approach outperforms several well-known clustering algorithms, including techniques commonly used for microorganism differentiation.
