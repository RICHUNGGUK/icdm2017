Existing methods are capable of identifying process models that typically only work on single attribute events. We propose a new model type to address the problem of mining multi-attribute events, meaning that each event is described by a vector of attributes. The model is based on timed automata, includes expressive descriptions of states and can be used for making predictions. A probabilistic real time automaton is created, where each state is annotated by a profile of events. To identify the states of the automaton, similar events are combined by a clustering approach. The method was implemented and tested on a synthetic, a medical and a biological dataset. Its prediction accuracy was evaluated on a medical dataset and compared to a combined logistic regression, which is considered a standard in this application domain. Moreover, the method was experimentally compared to Multi-Output HMMs and Petri nets learned by standard process mining algorithms. The experimental comparison suggests that the automaton-based approach performs favorably in several dimensions. Most importantly, we show that meaningful medical and biological process knowledge can be extracted from such automata.", "paper_title": "Learning probabilistic real-time automata from multi-attribute event logs", "paper_id": "WOS:000314829500006"}
