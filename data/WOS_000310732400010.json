A risk is the overture of emergencies that produce human and/or material damages. Therefore, it is particularly critical to identify and manage risks to avoid their evolution into emergencies. In this paper, we outline the technological features of a risk environment and propose a risk model and a service-based simulation prototype aimed to improve safety in work environments. We discuss engineering issues concerning risk modeling and management. Furthermore, we propose a risk management system solution and its related implemented prototype composed of services able to detect and also to prevent the occurrence of risk conditions.
