In this paper, two kinds of communication constraints are considered during the process of information transmission in Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy complex network: 1) partial couplings, where only some part of nodes' state information can be transmitted and the channel matrices are introduced to reflect such a phenomenon; and 2) discrete-time couplings, where the nodes' information are sampled at certain time instants. This is the first time when both communication constraints are simultaneously considered in fuzzy complex networks. Compared with the perfect communication, much less information is available for synchronization. To overcome this difficulty, a regrouping method is employed to reconstruct the fuzzy network. The concise conditions are then proposed to ensure pinning synchronization of fuzzy complex networks with partial and discrete-time couplings. Simulation examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Pinning Synchronization in T-S Fuzzy Complex Networks With Partial and Discrete-Time Couplings", "paper_id": "WOS:000359262400040"}
