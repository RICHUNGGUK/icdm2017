However, they may significantly degrade performance and/or energy consumption. In this paper, we describe a reconfigurable cache memory, which is efficiently applied to the L1 data cache of an embedded general-purpose processor. A realistic hardware/software methodology of run-time tuning and reconfiguration. of the cache is also proposed, which is based on a pattern-matching algorithm. It is used to identify the cache configuration and processor frequency when the programs data working-set changes. Considering a design scenario driven by the best product execution time x energy consumption, we show that power dissipation and energy consumption of a two-level cache hierarchy and the product time x energy can be reduced on average by 39%, 38% and 37% respectively, when compared with a non-adaptive embedded microarchitecture.", "paper_title": "A reconfigurable data cache for adaptive processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000240036500031"}
