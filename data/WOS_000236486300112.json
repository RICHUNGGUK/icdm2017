However, almost all the researches have focused on estimation and paid little attention to testing. In this paper, we discuss testing significance of mixing and demixing coefficients in ICA. We propose test statistics to examine significance of these coefficients statistically. A simulation experiment implies the good performance of our testing procedure. A real example in psychometrics, which is a new application area of ICA, is also presented.", "paper_title": "Testing significance of mixing and demixing coefficients in ICA", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300112"}
