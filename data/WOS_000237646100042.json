The purpose of this paper is to propose a framework for obtaining Internet content intended for computers on mobile devices. In other words, the primary concern of this paper is to select the best images for optimal performance and convert them into images that can be effectively reproduced on mobile devices. For this, the performance of the server is to be optimized through selecting useful images among the many available images and converting them while considering the display pixel rates (DPR) and the image distribution areas.", "paper_title": "Scalable mobile Internet servers: Selecting useful images from the web for mobile services", "paper_id": "WOS:000237646100042"}
