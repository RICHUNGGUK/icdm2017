While P2P is a natural delivery solution for MPVC, a peer often does not have enough bandwidth to deliver her video to all other peers in the conference. Recently, we have witnessed the popularity of one-view MPVC, where each user only watches full video of another user. One-view MPVC opens up the design space for P2P delivery. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a pure P2P solution for one-view MPVC. We characterize the video source rate region achievable through video relays between peers. For both homogeneous and heterogeneous MPVC systems, we establish tight universal video rate lower bounds that are independent of the number of peers, the number of video sources, and the specific viewing relations between peers. We further propose, P2P video relay designs to approach the maximal video rate region. Through numerical simulations, we verified that the derived lower bounds are indeed tight bounds, and the proposed bandwidth allocation algorithm can achieve a close-to-optimal peer upload bandwidth utilization. Our results demonstrate that P2P is a promising solution for one-view MPVC. Insights obtained from our study can be used to guide the design of P2P MPVC systems.", "paper_title": "Enabling P2P One-View Multiparty Video Conferencing", "paper_id": "WOS:000327662100009"}
