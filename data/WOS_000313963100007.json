In this paper we propose a new construction method for these schemes based on combinations of duals of standard block designs. Our method is a broad spectrum one which works for any intersection threshold. By varying the initial designs, we can generate various schemes and this makes the method quite flexible. We also obtain explicit algebraic expressions for the metrics for local connectivity and resiliency. These schemes are quite efficient with regard to connectivity and resiliency and at the same time they allow a straightforward shared-key discovery.", "paper_title": "Key predistribution schemes for distributed sensor networks via block designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000313963100007"}
