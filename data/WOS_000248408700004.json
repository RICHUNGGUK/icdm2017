During storage, while the extracellular fluid resistance (R-e) and the intracellular fluid resistance (R-i) decreased progressively with time, the effective cell membrane capacitance (C-m) has increased. Blood bank storage resulted in a rise in K+ and a fall in Na+, Cl-, pH, 2,3-DPG and ATP. Accordingly, all electrical parameters correlated with Na+, K+, Cl-, pH and ATP, at varying levels. By applying the multi-regression analysis, it was demonstrated that R-i, R-e and especially C-m were appropriate for the assessment of Na+, K+, Cl-, pH and ATP until the 21st day of storage.", "paper_title": "Physiological quality assessment of stored whole blood by means of electrical measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000248408700004"}
