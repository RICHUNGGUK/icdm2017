This change has been evident in the decreased ratio of planned purchases but not in the increase of planned (or spontaneous) purchases. This act of spontaneous or otherwise unplanned purchasing is called \"impulse buying\". However, buying under these conditions costs more money always comes with negative responses, such as complaints and regret. Therefore, we propose and have designed a new merchandise recommendation system, the Mobile Merchandise Evaluation Service Platform (MMESP). This is a three-tier system composed of Real-time Merchandise Identifying System (RMIS), Real-time Merchandise Evaluation System (RMES), and Real-time Merchandise Recommendation System (RMRS). With this system, Mobile Users (MUs) take pictures of merchandise and send them to MMESP. RMIS integrates Region Adjacency Graph (RAG) and Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to gather information on the merchandise through those photographs, and. RMES and RMRS provide Intelligence Agents (IAs) and Multiple Document Summarization (MDS) to summarize recommendations on merchandise for MUs, all in real time. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
