In this paper, we introduce a new library, CUIRRE, for improving performance of irregular applications on CPUs. CUIRRE reduces the load imbalance of CPU threads resulting from irregular loop structures. In addition, CUIRRE can characterize irregular applications for their irregularity, thread granularity and CPU utilization. We employ this library to characterize and optimize both synthetic and real-world applications. The experimental results show that a 1.63 x on average and up to 2.76 x performance improvement can be achieved with the centralized task pool approach in the library at a 4.57% average overhead with static loading ratios. To avoid the cost of exhaustive searches of loading ratios, an adaptive loading ratio method is proposed to derive appropriate loading ratios for different inputs automatically at runtime. Our task pool approach outperforms other load balancing schemes such as the task stealing method and the persistent threads method. The CUIRRE library can easily be applied on many other irregular problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
