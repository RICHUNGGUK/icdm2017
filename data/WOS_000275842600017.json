In the dissimilarity matrix, the smaller element is, the more similar are the species. We translate the dissimilarity matrix to a similarity matrix based on the proposed rules, which is reflective and symmetric. The transitive closure of the obtained similarity matrix is used to construct a phylogenetic tree.", "paper_title": "A Method for Constructing Phylogenetic Tree Based on a Dissimilarity Matrix", "paper_id": "WOS:000275842600017"}
