We present a smoothing method to overcome the nondifferentiability of the objective function. By exploiting the special structure of the network, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions to achieve the optimality. Based on these conditions, a gradient descent algorithm is designed for its solution. The proposed algorithm is shown to converge to the optimal value efficiently under all network configurations. The incorporation of optimal routing and data aggregation is shown via many examples to provide significant improvement of the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Maximum lifetime routing and data aggregation for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800070"}
