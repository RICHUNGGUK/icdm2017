By using this framework and ideas from the error diffusion (ED) scheme (for mesh-generation) of Yang et al., a highly effective mesh-generation method, called GPRFS-ED, is derived and presented. Since the ED scheme plays a crucial role in our work, factors affecting the performance of this scheme are also studied in detail. Through experimental results, our GPRFS-ED method is shown to be capable of generating meshes of quality comparable to, and in many cases better than, the state-of-the-art GPR scheme, while requiring substantially less computation and memory. Furthermore, with our GPRFS-ED method, one can easily trade off between mesh quality and computational/memory complexity. A reduced-complexity version of the GPRFS-ED method (called GPRFS-MED) is also introduced to further demonstrate the computational/memory-complexity scalability of our GPRFS-ED method.", "paper_title": "A Flexible Content-Adaptive Mesh-Generation Strategy for Image Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000294132800002"}
