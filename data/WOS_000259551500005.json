The aim is to take large feed material and as efficiently as possible reduce the size of the particles to a target size range. Over time, a very large range of equipment has been developed to perform this for many materials and in many different conditions. Discrete element method (DEM) modelling is a computational tool that can allow detailed exploration of the particle flow and breakage processes within comminution equipment and can assist in developing a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the detailed processes occurring within. In this paper, we examine the particle and energy flows in representative examples of the equipment used in many grinding processes. We study a 36' semi-autogenous mill used in primary grinding for mineral processing, a ball mill used for cement clinker grinding, a grinding table also used for cement grinding, a tower mill used for fine grinding both in mineral processing and for industrial minerals and finally for an Isamill, which is used for ultra-fine grinding in mineral processing.
