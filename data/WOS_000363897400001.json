Cryptographic key is an important entity in this process. In general, randomly generated cryptographic key (of 256 bits) is difficult to remember. However, such a key needs to be stored in a protected place or transported through a shared communication line which, in fact, poses another threat to security. As an alternative to this, researchers advocate the generation of cryptographic key using the biometric traits of both sender and receiver during the sessions of communication, thus avoiding key storing and at the same time without compromising the strength in security. Nevertheless, the biometric-based cryptographic key generation has some difficulties: privacy of biometrics, sharing of biometric data between both communicating parties (i.e., sender and receiver), and generating revocable key from irrevocable biometric. This work addresses the above-mentioned concerns. We propose an approach to generate cryptographic key from cancelable fingerprint template of both communicating parties. Cancelable fingerprint templates of both sender and receiver are securely transmitted to each other using a key-based steganography. Both templates are combined with concatenation based feature level fusion technique and generate a combined template. Elements of combined template are shuffled using shuffle key and hash of the shuffled template generates a unique session key. In this approach, revocable key for symmetric cryptography is generated from irrevocable fingerprint and privacy of the fingerprints is protected by the cancelable transformation of fingerprint template. Our experimental results show that minimum, average, and maximum Hamming distances between genuine key and impostor's key are 80, 128, and 168 bits, respectively, with 256-bit cryptographic key. This fingerprint-based cryptographic key can be applied in symmetric cryptography where session based unique key is required.", "paper_title": "Fingerprint-based crypto-biometric system for network security", "paper_id": "WOS:000363897400001"}
