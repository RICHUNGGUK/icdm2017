Acoustic Emission (AE) sequences were acquired by a wide frequency range transducer (100-800 kHz) and digitalized by a 2.5 MHz, 8-bit ADC. Four common sources in AE testing are linearly mixed, involving real AE sequences, impulses and parasitic signals from human activity. A digital high-pass filter achieves a SNR up to -40 dB.", "paper_title": "On the performance of a HOS-based ICA algorithm in BSS of acoustic emission signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300050"}
