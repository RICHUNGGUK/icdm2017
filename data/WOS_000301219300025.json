In the algorithm, a novel, effective and converged orthogonalization process is given based on a differential-form objective function. A set of orthogonal rank-one basis tensors are obtained to preserve the intra-class local manifolds and enhance the inter-class margins. The algorithm is evaluated by applying to the basic facial expressions recognition. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
