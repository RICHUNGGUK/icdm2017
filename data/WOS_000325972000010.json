To consider these effects it is necessary to solve the Schrodinger equation in the confinement direction, which has a high computational cost. In this paper we propose the parallelisation and optimisation of a 2D MSB-EMC simulator. The Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) application program interface (API) is employed for the parallelisation and the simulations are performed using a multi-core machine. Numerical results show a speed-up of 7.40 when eight cores are used with a parallel efficiency higher than 90%.", "paper_title": "Optimisation and parallelisation of a 2D MOSFET multi-subband ensemble Monte Carlo simulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000325972000010"}
