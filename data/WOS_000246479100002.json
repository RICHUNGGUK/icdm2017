The problem can be formulated as a mixture model, where the mixture components correspond to the pool of haplotypes in the population. The size of this pool is unknown; indeed, knowing the size of the pool would correspond to knowing something significant about the genome and its history. Thus methods for fitting the genotype mixture must crucially address the problem of estimating a mixture with an unknown number of mixture components. In this paper we present a Bayesian approach to this problem based on a nonparametric prior known as the Dirichlet process. The model also incorporates a likelihood that captures statistical errors in the haplotype/genotype relationship trading off these errors against the size of the pool of haplotypes. We describe an algorithm based on Markov chain Monte Carlo for posterior inference in our model. The overall result is a flexible Bayesian method, referred to as DP-Haplotyper, that is reminiscent of parsimony methods in its preference for small haplotype pools. We further generalize the model to treat pedigree relationships (e.g., trios) between the population's genotypes. We apply DP-Haplotyper to the analysis of both simulated and real genotype data, and compare to extant methods.", "paper_title": "Bayesian haplotype inference via the Dirichlet process", "paper_id": "WOS:000246479100002"}
