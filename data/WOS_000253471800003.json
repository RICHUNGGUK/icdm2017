As a well-defined problem in resource allocation systems, deadlock prevention based on a Petri net formalism has received an enormous amount of attention in the literature. This paper intends to review and compare a variety of Petri net-based deadlock prevention policies reported in the literature. Their comparison is done in terms of structural complexity, behavior permissiveness, and computational complexity. This paper should facilitate engineers in choosing a suited method for their industrial application cases.", "paper_title": "A survey and comparison of Petri net-based deadlock prevention policies for flexible manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253471800003"}
