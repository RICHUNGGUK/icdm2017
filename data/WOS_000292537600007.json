To our best knowledge, this is the first time that the problem is addressed. Our proposed solution is composed of a routing algorithm that finds up to k but not necessarily feasible paths for each demand and an on-demand channel (re)assignment algorithm that adapts network resources to maintain feasibility of one of the paths. We also study the problem of obtaining an upper bound on the network performance. First, we consider an artificial version of the problem, in which all demands arrive at the same time, and formulate it as a mixed integer linear programming model. To tackle the complexity of the model, it is relaxed that provides a tight upper bound while improves solution time up to 3.Oe+5 times. Then, we model the original problem by extending the relaxed model to consider dynamic demands, it leads to a huge model; thus, we develop another model, which is equivalent to the first one and is decomposable. It is broken down by a decomposition algorithm into sub-problems, which are solved sequentially. Our extensive simulations show that the proposed solution has comparable performance to the bound obtained from the decomposition algorithm; it efficiently exploits available channels, and needs very few radios per node to achieve high network performance.
