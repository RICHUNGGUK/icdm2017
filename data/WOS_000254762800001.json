Under the model that all permutations of the numbers 1,...,n are equally likely to construct a priority tree of size n we study the following parameters in size-n trees: depth of a random node, number of right edges to a random node, and number of descendants of a random node. For all parameters studied we give limiting distribution results.", "paper_title": "Analysis of some parameters for random nodes in priority trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000254762800001"}
