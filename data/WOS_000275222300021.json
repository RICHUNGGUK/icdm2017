Firstly, the exponential stability result of general continuous-time switched systems using a discontinuous piecewise Lyapunov function approach is revisited, and the discrete-time counterpart is then presented by the following similar lines in continuous-time case. Based on these and by further constructing a discontinuous piecewise parameter-dependent Lyapunov function, the exponential stability criteria for both uncertain continuous and discrete-time polytopic uncertain switched linear systems with average dwell time switching are derived and formulated in terms of a set of linear matrix inequalities, respectively. Furthermore, the minimal average dwell time is obtained from the corresponding stability conditions for a given. decay degree, and the admissible switching signals are consequently found such that the underlying system is robustly exponentially stable. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the developed theoretical results.", "paper_title": "STABILITY OF A CLASS OF SWITCHED LINEAR SYSTEMS WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND AVERAGE DWELL TIME SWITCHING", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300021"}
