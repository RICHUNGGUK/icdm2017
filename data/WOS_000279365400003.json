These networks inherit their characteristics from both delay tolerant networks (DTN) and traditional wireless sensor networks. After introducing DTWSNs, three main problems in the design space of these networks are discussed: routing, data gathering, and neighbor discovery. A general protocol is proposed for DTWSNs based on opportunistic broadcasting in delay-tolerant networks with radio device on-off periods. Three performance measures are defined in the study: the energy for sending queries to ask for data from possible neighbors (querying energy), data transfer energy, and absorption time (delay). A simple yet accurate approximation for the data-transfer energy is proposed. An analytic model is provided to evaluate the querying energy per contact (epc). Simulation results for the data propagation delay show that the querying energy per contact measure obtained from the analytic model is proportional to the product of the querying energy and the delay. A practical rule of thumb for an optimal query interval in terms of delay and energy is derived from different parts of the study. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
