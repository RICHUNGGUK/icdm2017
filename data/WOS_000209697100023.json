The energy beamforming in the large-scale MIMO system is utilized to address the challenging problem of long-distance wireless power transfer. Furthermore, considering the limitation of the power in such a system, this letter focuses on the maximization of the energy efficiency of information transmission (bit per Joule) while satisfying the quality-of-service (QoS) requirement, i.e. delay constraint, by jointly optimizing transfer duration and transmit power. By solving the optimization problem, we derive an energy-efficient resource allocation scheme. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Optimization for Wireless Information and Power Transfer in Large-Scale MIMO Systems Employing Energy Beamforming", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100023"}
