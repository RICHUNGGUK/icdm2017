In protein families of realistic size, this learning can only be done approximately, and there is a trade-off between inference precision and computational speed. We here show that an earlier introduced l(2)-regularized pseudolikelihood maximization method called plmDCA can be modified as to be easily parallelizable, as well as inherently faster on a single processor, at negligible difference in accuracy. We test the new incarnation of the method on 143 protein family/structure-pairs from the Protein Families database (PFAM), one of the larger tests of this class of algorithms to date.
