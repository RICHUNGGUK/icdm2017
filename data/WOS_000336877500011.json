The platform includes (i) a high-level declarative language to express the requirements of the applications featuring software customization at runtime, (ii) an approach based on virtual containers to encapsulate the logic of the different programming models, (iii) an infrastructure manager to interact with different IaaS backends, (iv) a configuration software to dynamically configure the provisioned resources and (v) a catalog and repository of virtual machine images. By using this platform, an application developer can adapt, deploy and execute parallel applications agnostic to the Cloud backend. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
