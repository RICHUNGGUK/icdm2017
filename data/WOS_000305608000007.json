In contrast to the existing solutions, the proposed algorithm achieves a less accurate alignment, but in a much shorter time. The algorithm consists of two parts: a translation and a rotation. While the translation part of the alignment process is error free, the rotation part introduces a small inherent error due to the finite arithmetic and discretization. Experimental results based on three datasets are presented.", "paper_title": "A Fast Method for the Alignment of the Displacement of Voxel Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000305608000007"}
