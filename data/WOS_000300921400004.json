The technique is rotation, scale and shape invariant and makes use of the connected components in a graph obtained from the edge map of the side face image. It has been evaluated on IIT Kanpur database consisting of 2672 side faces with variable sizes, rotations and shapes and University of Notre Dame database containing 2244 side faces with variable background and poor illumination. Experimental results reveal the efficiency and robustness of the technique. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
