In this paper, we present a network traffic anomaly detection method based on the catastrophe theory. In order to characterize the normal behavior of the network, we construct a profile of the normal network traffic by using an equilibrium surface of the catastrophe theory. When anomalies occur, the state of the network traffic will deviate from the normal equilibrium surface. Then, taking the normal equilibrium surface as a reference, we monitor the ongoing network traffic and we use a new index called as catastrophe distance to quantify the deviation. According to the decision theory, network traffic anomalies can be identified by the catastrophe distance. We evaluate the performance of our approach using the DARPA intrusion detection data set. Experiment results show that our approach is significantly effective on the network traffic anomaly detection.", "paper_title": "An anomaly-based detection in ubiquitous network using the equilibrium state of the catastrophe theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000317662700003"}
