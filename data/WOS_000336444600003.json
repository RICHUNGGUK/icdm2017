The concepts were applied to protect messages from an adversary in the wiretap channel of type II with illegitimate parties. The equivocation to the adversary is described by IRDLP and upper-bounded by the generalized Singleton bound on IRDLP. Recently, RLDP was also extended in wiretap network II for secrecy control of network coding. In this paper, we introduce new relations and bounds about the sequences. They not only reveal new connections among known results but also find applications in trellis complexities of linear codes. The state complexity profile of a linear code and that of a subcode can be bounded from each other, which is particularly useful when a tradeoff among coding rate, error-correcting capability and decoding complexity is considered. Furthermore, a unified framework is proposed to derive bounds on RDLP and IRDLP from an upper bound on RLDP. We introduce three new upper bounds on RLDP and use some of them to tighten the generalized Singleton bounds by applying the framework. The approach is useful to improve equivocation estimation in the wiretap channel of type II with illegitimate parties.", "paper_title": "On the relative profiles of a linear code and a subcode", "paper_id": "WOS:000336444600003"}
