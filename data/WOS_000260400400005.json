Furthermore, a routing protocol for WSN should be well aware of sensor limitations. In this paper. we present an energy efficient. scalable. and distributed node disjoint multipath routing algorithm. The proposed algorithm, the Energy-aware Multipath Routing Algorithm (EMRA). adjusts traffic flows via a novel load balancing scheme. EMRA has a higher average node energy efficiency. lower control overhead. and a shorter average delay than those of well-known previous works. Moreover. since EMRA takes into consideration network reliability. it is useful for delivering data in unreliable environments.", "paper_title": "An Energy-Aware Multipath Routing Algorithm in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000260400400005"}
