With such purpose, coexistence mechanisms among CRN nodes or secondary users and legitimate users of the spectrum or primary users are defined. However, due to the particular features of CRNs, new security threats arise, such as the primary user emulation (PUE) attack, which is the most challenging among all. With the aim of detecting such kind of attacks, in this paper we propose a cooperative localization method specifically suited to CRNs which relies on TDoA measurements and Taylor-series estimations. Simulations results show the goodness of the proposed method and its suitability to typical CRN scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
