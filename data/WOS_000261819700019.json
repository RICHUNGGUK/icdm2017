There are three contributions. Firstly, we use the Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) to represent the players, and introduce a probabilistic framework to model the appearance of the players by a mixture of local subspaces. We also employ an efficient off-line learning algorithm to learn the templates from training data, and an efficient online filtering algorithm to update the templates used by the tracker. Secondly, we augment the boosted particle filter (BPF) with a new observation model and a template updater that improves the robustness of the tracking system. Finally, we recognize the players' actions by combining the HOG descriptors with a pure multi-class sparse classifier with a robust motion similarity measure. Experiments on long sequences show promising quantitative and qualitative results. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
