In the key distribution over these lossy channels, if key information is lost, there is critical issue that the subsequent communication is disabled. In this paper, we show that our proposal has more reliable property than the related works and has the reliable property equivalent to the dedicated communication channels such as Ethernet.", "paper_title": "Reliable key distribution scheme for lossy channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000256860900030"}
