Patients with better self-management are less likely to be rehospitalized. An online interactive heart failure module was developed and integrated into a medical-surgical nursing course to assist students in learning how to care for patients with heart failure. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the integration of an online heart failure module improved baccalaureate nursing students' heart failure self-management knowledge. A pretest/posttest design was used to examine the effects of student knowledge of heart failure self-management following implementation of an online module. Among 235 students, significant improvement of heart failure self-management knowledge was observed (P < .05). The mean posttest scores ranged from 13.82 to 15.93. Students had problems mastering knowledge of weight monitoring, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, symptoms to report to physicians, and potassium-based salt substitutes. These findings were similar to four studies examining nurses' knowledge of heart failure. Students and nurses have difficulty mastering similar heart failure education concepts. An additional strategy, such as simulated or case scenarios, needs to be developed to help nurses and nursing students master all key concepts of heart failure self-management.", "paper_title": "The Integration of an Online Module on Student Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000311829000004"}
