Namely, they admit ideal linear secret sharing schemes over every large enough finite field, they can be described by a small number of parameters, and they have useful properties for the applications of secret sharing. The use of integer polymatroids makes it possible to find many new such families and it simplifies in great measure the proofs for the existence of ideal secret sharing schemes for them.", "paper_title": "Natural Generalizations of Threshold Secret Sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000331902400022"}
