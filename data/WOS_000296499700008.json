The particle filtering technique can be directly applied to estimate the 3-D object location, but we propose to decompose the 3-D particle filter into the three planes' particle filters, which are individually designed for the 2-D bearings-only tracking problems. 2-D bearing information is derived from the azimuth and elevation of the object to be used for the 2-D particle filter. Two estimates of three planes' particle filters are selected based on the characterization of the acoustic sensor operation in a noisy environment. The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound of the proposed 2-D particle filter-based algorithm is derived and compared against the algorithm that is based on the direct 3-D particle filter.", "paper_title": "Object Tracking in 3-D Space with Passive Acoustic Sensors using Particle Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000296499700008"}
