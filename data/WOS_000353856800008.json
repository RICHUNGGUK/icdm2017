A Long Term Evolution (LTE) network aims to serve heterogeneous users with different QoS requirements. Traditional approaches need new infrastructure and degrade performance of delay sensitive applications, which may result in users with minimum rate requirements being in high blocking probability. To utilize wireless resources efficiently, users want to access the same medium to connect with the same multicast group and be overhauled at the same time. In this paper, a new technique is proposed for operator-controlled called the QoS-Aware Tethering in a Heterogeneous Wireless Network using LTE and TV White Spaces (QTHN) to improve QoS for Constant Bit Rate (CBR) and Best Effort (BE) users. The proposed QTHN converts the whole dense wireless network into hexagonal clusters via two layer network communication. In a cluster, one node is selected as a cluster head and all other nodes act as slaves. Within a cluster, a cluster head acts as an access point known as a Hotspot (H), which is further connected to the Base-station (BS). The proposed QTHN aims to improve QoS within heterogeneous wireless network using LTE and unused White Spaces in a wireless dense area. Simulation results show that the proposed QTHN reduced the numbers of blocked users and improved network utility. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
