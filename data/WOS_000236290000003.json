We analyzed the improvements obtained when 2-dimentional image sensor replaced the conventional single-element photodiode, First, we discuss the maximum receiver's field of view (FOV) when using the 2-dimentional image sensor at a particular focal length. We analyzed the best vertical inclination for both lanes and quantified the improvements in terms of the enhancement of received signal-noise ratio (SNR) when different numbers of pixels were applied. Our results indicate that using more pixels increases the received SNR and the service area becomes wider compared to the conventional single-element system. Consequently, receivable information within the service area also increased. We also found that the optimum number of pixels to accomplish a reliable communication system is 50 x 50 because performance degradation occured with a larger number of pixels.", "paper_title": "Visible light communication with LED traffic lights using 2-dimensional image sensor", "paper_id": "WOS:000236290000003"}
