A necessary and sufficient criterion is presented in terms of algebraic representations of BNs. As a consequence, we show that complete synchronization can occur only between two conditionally identical BNs when the transition matrix of the drive network is nonsingular. Two examples are worked out to illustrate the obtained results.", "paper_title": "Complete Synchronization of Boolean Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303507000015"}
