The protein-compound binding free energy is estimated front the information obtained by the above three steps. This method was applied to a small system, a 18-crown-6 ether with its ligand ion, and a realistic system consisting of a target protein with its inhibitor. This approximation worked well; the protein-inhibitor dissociation was successfully performed, and the binding free energies were calculated.", "paper_title": "Protein-Ligand Binding Free Energy Calculation by the Smooth Reaction Path Generation (SRPG) Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000269088500010"}
