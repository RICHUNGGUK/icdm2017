In this paper, we address the \"incentive issue\" of a cooperative proxy caching system and how to motivate each proxy to provide cache space to the system. To encourage proxies to participate, we propose a \"revenue-rewarding scheme\" to credit the cooperative proxies according to the resources they contribute. A game-theoretic model is used to analyze the interactions among proxies under the revenue-rewarding scheme. We propose two cooperative game settings that lead to optimal situations. In particular, (1) We propose a distributed incentive framework for peers to participate in resource contribution for media streaming; (2) Proxies are encouraged to cooperate under the revenue-rewarding scheme; (3) Profit and social welfare are maximized in these cooperative games; and (4) Cost-effective resource allocation is achieved in these cooperative games. Large scale simulation is carried out to validate and verify the merits of our proposed incentive schemes.", "paper_title": "A revenue-rewarding scheme of providing incentive for cooperative proxy caching for media streaming systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000253315700005"}
