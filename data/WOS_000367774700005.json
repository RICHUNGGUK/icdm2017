The paper compares Chaospy to similar packages and demonstrates a stronger focus on defining reusable software building blocks that can easily be assembled to construct new, tailored algorithms for uncertainty quantification. For example, a Chaospy user can in a few lines of high-level computer code define custom distributions, polynomials, integration rules, sampling schemes, and statistical metrics for uncertainty analysis. In addition, the software introduces some novel methodological advances, like a framework for computing Rosenblatt transformations and a new approach for creating polynomial chaos expansions with dependent stochastic variables.
