Efficient spectrum sensing along with transmit power control can achieve this conflicting goal. In this paper, we propose a sensor network aided cognitive radio system which will reduce the missed detection and reduce the interference. We investigate the performance of various sensing and power allocation schemes for an OFDM-based cognitive radio system. We formulate an optimisation problem to design the optimal sensing time and transmit power. Mathematical analysis shows that interference between primary and secondary in OFDM-based system depends on spectral distance. Results show that distance dependent modified water filling (DDMWF) scheme can achieve the highest data rate for the cognitive radio based secondary user and then the optimal sensing time can be designed to maximise the throughput.", "paper_title": "Throughput optimisation in sensor network-aided cognitive radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000324298600005"}
