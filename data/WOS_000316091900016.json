ZigBee and Wi-Fi belong to different network protocols. If a network system must use both ZigBee and Wi-Fi at the same time to transmit data a considerable challenge is presented. This paper introduces a novel hardware method that integrates ZigBee and Wi-Fi. The proposed method is based on the Arduino wearable module ZigBee and Ethernet concept. This study builds an intelligent home appliance control system using the ZigBee network. This intelligent control system uses an integrated ZigBee and Wi-Fi network architecture in the house. Our study sends the ZigBee sensor messages to a cloud database through the TCP/IP protocol network containing the physical network and wireless network device lines. Control management access is achieved using smart phones. The proposed method is very simple and easy to implement using Arduino circuits. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the simulation and experimental results. The hardware components include the Arduino controller, XBee Series 2 wireless communication module and end device sensors. The Android and Java programming languages are used to write the smart phone and Server recognition programs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
