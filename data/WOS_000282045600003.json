The key authorisation requirements for Pervasive Grid computing are identified and a novel Grid authorisation framework, the context-constrained authorisation framework CoCoA, is proposed. The CoCoA framework takes into account not only users' static attributes, but also their dynamic contextual attributes that are inherent in Pervasive computing. It adheres to open Grid standards, uses a modular layered approach to complement existing Grid authorisation systems, and inter-works with other Grid security building blocks. A prototype implementation of the CoCoA framework is presented and its performance evaluated.", "paper_title": "A context-constrained authorisation (CoCoA) framework for pervasive grid computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000282045600003"}
