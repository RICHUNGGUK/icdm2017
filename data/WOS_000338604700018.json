Experts in the purchasing and management of hospital supplies (administrative and clinical) were invited to participate at different stages of the ontology-based system development. As a result of the first stage, the HealthCatalog ontology was developed. This ontology models generic items included in a health catalog and their management. Secondly, a further refinement of the ontology was conducted by specifically studying the case of gloves. Twenty-seven references of different glove types were modeled and included in the ontology during the stage two. A prototype was then developed as a proof of concept and for the evaluation of the ontology. Finally, a usability evaluation was planned to improve the ontology and obtain feedback from experts after testing the system. Experts involved in the evaluation stressed its potential use in a real clinical environment and the benefits it would bring in terms of cost and sharing knowledge among clinical personnel. Our proposed ontology-based system provides an understandable and organized solution to capture knowledge regarding item management and usage. It addresses the integration challenge of health catalogs while providing a framework for collaborative sharing and knowledge acquisition among clinicians. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
