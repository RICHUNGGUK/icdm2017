This algorithm utilizes the Karnik-Mendel (KM) or the enhanced KM (EKM) algorithm only at the alpha = 0 alpha-level of (A) over tilde and then lets its result \"flow\" upward to the alpha = 1 alpha-level of (A) over tilde. It avoids having to apply the KM/EKM algorithms at every alpha-level, which significantly improves its computational efficiency; however, the CF algorithm approximation errors will gradually accumulate as the algorithm \"flows\" upward, and in some cases, this can cause the centroid of the alpha = 1 alpha-level of (A) over tilde to differ from its theoretical value. This paper introduces an improved version of the CF algorithm, which is called enhanced CF algorithm, that reduces such accumulative errors by half and, therefore, greatly improves the computational accuracy.", "paper_title": "Enhanced Centroid-Flow Algorithm for Computing the Centroid of General Type-2 Fuzzy Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000309740000010"}
