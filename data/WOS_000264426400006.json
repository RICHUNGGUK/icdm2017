These algorithms need to be given a suitable set of parameters for every problem they face, thus methods to automatically search the values of those parameters are required. This paper shows the robustness of a meta algorithm developed to automatically establish the parameters needed to design RBFNs. Results show that, this new method can be, effectively used, not only to obtain good models, but also to find a stable set of parameters, available to be used oil many different problems.", "paper_title": "STUDY OF THE ROBUSTNESS OF A META-ALGORITHM FOR THE ESTIMATION OF PARAMETERS IN RADIAL BASIS FUNCTION NEURAL NETWORKS DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000264426400006"}
