This model is compared with the PSCAD built-in synchronous machine model in order to compare the accuracy of one of the most used synchronous machine models in a commercially available software versus a well-documented and widely accepted state-space synchronous machine model. Design/methodology/approach - In the paper, a synchronous condenser with the saturation phenomenon is modeled using state-space equations in the rotating dq-reference frame and is implemented both in Matlab/Simulink and PSCAD. Integration methods of up to the fifth order are implemented for increased accuracy. The saturation modeling includes modeling of the saturation in both d- and q-axis. A steady-state and dynamic performance comparison towards the built-in PSCAD synchronous machine model is performed. The saturation modeling does not include the saturation of the leakage fluxes. Findings - When the forward Euler method is used, in order to obtain less than 5 percent error, the time step should not exceed 5 its. The third-order Runge-Kutta method is the preferred choice and it provides desired accuracy when the time step is equal or smaller than 1,000 its. The built-in PSCAD model satisfies the error criteria for time steps smaller than 300 its. A small discrepancy of 2 percent is found during the steady-state test. Originality/value - The paper presents the performance of the higher order integration methods in an EMTP-type software environment where the trapezoidal integration method is most often used. It provides a good guide for building an owner-defined model. A comparison of a dynamic performance between the publicly documented state-space and a synchronous machine models commonly used for power system transient studies is presented.", "paper_title": "Simulation accuracy of the built-in PSCAD and an owner-defined synchronous machine model", "paper_id": "WOS:000280378800015"}
