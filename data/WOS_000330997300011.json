It helps to measure the parameters of any computer. With the emergence of multicore computers, the evaluation of computers was brought under consideration. Since these types of computers can be viewed and considered as parallel computers, the evaluation methods for parallel computers may be appropriate for multicore computers. However, because multicore architectures seriously focus on cache hierarchy, there is a need for new and different benchmarks to evaluate them correctly. To this end, this paper presents a method for measuring the parameters of one of the most famous multicore computational models, namely Multi-Bulk Synchronous Parallel (Multi-BSP). This method measures the hardware latency parameters of multicore computers, namely communication latency (g (i) ) and synchronization latency (L (i) ) for all levels of the cache memory hierarchy in a bottom-up manner. By determining the parameters, the performance of algorithms on multicore architectures can be evaluated as a sequence.", "paper_title": "Measurement of the latency parameters of the Multi-BSP model: a multicore benchmarking approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000330997300011"}
