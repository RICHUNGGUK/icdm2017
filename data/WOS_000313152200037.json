Some researchers have considered this problem in multidimensional-scaling-based model or share-of-surplus choice rule. In this study, we consider this problem for multinomial logit rule by introducing a piecewise function and establishing a conjoint-analysis-based one-step optimization model for product positioning. Interval analysis is applied to obtain the optimal price of the new product from the model, and the mathematical properties of the profit-maximizing model are analyzed. An interval-analysis-embedded Tabu Search (TS) algorithm is developed for solving the model. An industrial application employing the proposed model and the interval-analysis-based enumeration method is presented and sensitivity analysis is performed. An experiment for randomly created large-scale product positioning problems is carried out to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed TS algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
