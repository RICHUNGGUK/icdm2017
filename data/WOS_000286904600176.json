Due to the subjective measurement and non-quantitative expression of LAs, this paper proposes a fuzzy quantitative integrated metric model (FQIMM) that combines Quantitative Software Metrics Set (QSMS), linguistic variables, interval of confidence and a new fuzzy number ranking method. It can help software companies to evaluate on quantitative approach and then know the status by their self more quickly and effectively. Moreover, a CMMI appraisal support system (CMMI-ASS) is developed to help self-assessment software companies to accomplish the appraisal process, which integrates a fuzzy number ranking method to rank the final result.
