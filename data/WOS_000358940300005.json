In this paper, we present an automatic cropping technique that accounts for the two primary considerations of people when they crop: removal of distracting content, and enhancement of overall composition. Our approach utilizes a large training set consisting of photos before and after cropping by expert photographers to learn how to evaluate these two factors in a crop. In contrast to the many methods that exist for general assessment of image quality, ours specifically examines differences between the original and cropped photo in solving for the crop parameters. To this end, several novel image features are proposed to model the changes in image content and composition when a crop is applied. The effectiveness of each feature is empirically analyzed in determining a final feature set for crop computation. Our experiments demonstrate improvements of our method over recent cropping algorithms on a broad range of images.", "paper_title": "Change-Based Image Cropping with Exclusion and Compositional Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000358940300005"}
