The conditions for oscillation, divergence, convergence and the guidelines on selection of the parameters are established. The effects of key parameters on CPG frequency and duty cycle are investigated. Mathematical analysis and simulation study is performed to verify these results. This study will potentially enhance the effective application of biological CPG model into engineering practice such as robotics.", "paper_title": "MATHEMATICAL STUDY ON IONIC MECHANISM OF LAMPREY CENTRAL PATTERN GENERATOR MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000273174000002"}
