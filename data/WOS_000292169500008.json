The measured data of the small wind generator (250 W), including wind speed, generator speed and output power of wind power generator, are applied to estimate the wind speed and output power by the proposed wind speed ANN(wind) and power estimation ANN(Pe)-PSO modules, respectively. Using the predicted results by the two modules of Matlab/Simulink, the MPPT point can be obtained by manipulating the generator speeds. The experimental results show that the proposed RBFNN-based approach can increase the maximum output power of the wind power generator even if the wind speed and load varies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
