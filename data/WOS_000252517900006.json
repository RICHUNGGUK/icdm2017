Privacy regulations create a principle to assure that patients have more control over their health information and set limits on the use and disclosure of health information. The security regulations stipulate the provisions implemented to guard data integrity, confidentiality, and availability. Undoubtedly, the cryptographic mechanisms are well defined to provide suitable solutions. In this paper, to comply with the HIPAA regulations, a flexible cryptographic key management solution is proposed to facilitate interoperations among the applied cryptographic mechanisms. In addition, case of consent exceptions intended to facilitate emergency applications and other possible exceptions can also be handled easily.", "paper_title": "A cryptographic key management solution for HIPAA privacy/security regulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000252517900006"}
