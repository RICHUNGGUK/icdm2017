This novel tool is composed of two layers: (1) Easy Java Simulations (EJS), an open-source tool which provides support for creating applications with a full 2D/3D interactive graphical interface, and (2) EjsRL, a high-level Java library specifically designed for EJS which provides a complete functional framework for modeling and simulation of arbitrary serial-link manipulators, Computer Vision algorithms and remote operation. The combination of both components sets up a software architecture which contains a high number of functionalities in the same platform to develop complex simulations in Robotics and Computer Vision fields. In addition, the paper shows its successful application to virtual and remote laboratories, web-based resources that enhance the accessibility of experimental setups for education and research.
