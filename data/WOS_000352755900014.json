Meanwhile, heterogeneous network (HetNet), which has multiple types of radio access nodes in the network, is widely accepted as a promising way to satisfy the increased traffic demand. In this paper, we first propose two delay-optimized offloading control schemes in HetNet. One of them is to control the number of offloading users by threshold comparison. Another is to determine whether the users are suited to offload by estimating the execution delay. Both of them take the traffic load of serving cell and neighboring cells into account. Moreover, two rate-prediction methods can be used. For comparison purpose, the delay performance of different schemes is evaluated by simulations in not only HetNet but also macro-only network.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Offloading Schemes for Mobile Cloud Computing Services in Heterogeneous Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000352755900014"}
