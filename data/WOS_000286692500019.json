Further development is obstructed by the ability to the manufacture of SoC and the signal integrity. Stacking IC is an alternative choice when we design a high-performance high-density chip. Design flow (especially physical design) is facing different issues when compared with 2D IC design. The location of the I/Os seriously affect the number of 3D-Vias and their total area in the stacking IC. This paper proposes a Stacking IC architecture and the corresponding design flow to solve the I/O and 3D-Via problems. In this flow, we have developed a system partition approach to minimize the number of 3D-Vias and balance the I/O number of each tier, and modified one traditional floorplan method to optimize the I/O and module locations. The experimental results are encouraging in the GSRC benchmarks. Compared with greedy and intuitive methods, our framework reduces the number of 3D-Vias by 30.02% on the average and can balance the I/O count of each tier. The dead space of the final floorplan is reduced by 14.13%.", "paper_title": "Design Planning with 3D-Via Optimization in Alternative Stacking Integrated Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000286692500019"}
