The aim of this study was to develop a new method to determine CTIs. The new approach, termed the intermittent critical time interval (ICTI) method, was motivated from evidence that upright standing is an intermittent rather than an asymptotic stability control process. For this ICTI method, center-of-pressure time series are first transformed to the time-frequency domain with a wavelet method. Subsequently, the CTI is assumed equal to the time span between two local maxima in the time-frequency domain within a distinct frequency band (i.e., 0.5-1.1Hz). This new method may help facilitate better estimates of the transition time interval between open and closed-loop control during upright stance and can also be applied in future work such as in simulating postural control. In addition, this method can be used in future work to assess temporal changes in CTIs.", "paper_title": "A time-frequency approach to estimate critical time intervals in postural control", "paper_id": "WOS:000349442300008"}
