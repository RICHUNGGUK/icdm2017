This paper describes a series of exhaustive experiments which demonstrate the feasibility of recognizing human emotional states via integrating low level descriptors. Our aim is to investigate three different methodologies for integrating subsequent feature values. More specifically, we used the following methods: 1) short-term statistics, 2) spectral moments, and 3) autoregressive models. Additionally, we employed a newly introduced group of parameters which is based on the wavelet decomposition. These are compared with a baseline set comprised of descriptors which are usually used for the specific task. Subsequently, we experimented on fusing these sets on the feature and log-likelihood levels. The classification step is based on hidden Markov models, while several algorithms which can handle redundant information were used during fusion. We report results on the well-known and freely available database BERLIN using data of six emotional states. Our experiments show the importance of including information which is captured by the set based on multiresolution analysis and the efficacy of merging subsequent feature values.", "paper_title": "Modeling the Temporal Evolution of Acoustic Parameters for Speech Emotion Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000323625000011"}
