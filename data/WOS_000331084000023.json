Most of the existing works based on LSA focus on behavior recognition and motion classification. In the applications of visual surveillance, accurate tracking of the moving people in surveillance scenes, is regarded as one of the preliminary requirement for other tasks such as object recognition or segmentation. However, accurate tracking is extremely hard under challenging surveillance scenes where similarity among multiple objects or occlusion among multiple objects occurs. Usual temporal Markov chain based tracking algorithms suffer from the 'tracking error accumulation problem'. The accumulated errors can finally make the tracking to drift from the target. To handle the problem of tracking drift, some authors have proposed the idea of using detection along with tracking as an effective solution. However, many of the critical issues still remain unsettled in these detection based tracking algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel moving people tracking with detection based on (probabilistic) LSA. By employing a novel 'twin-pipeline' training framework to find the latent semantic topics of 'moving people', the proposed detection can effectively detect the interest points on moving people in different indoor and outdoor environments with camera motion. Since the detected interest points on different body parts can be used to locate the position of moving people more accurately, by combining the detection with incremental subspace learning based tracking, the proposed algorithms resolves the problem of tracking drift during each target appearance update process. In addition, due to the time independent processing mechanism of detection, the proposed method is also able to handle the error accumulation problem. The detection can calibrate the tracking errors during updating of each state of the tracking algorithm. Extensive, experiments on various surveillance environments using different benchmark datasets have proved the accuracy and robustness of the proposed tracking algorithm. Further, the experimental comparison results clearly show that the proposed tracking algorithm outperforms the well known tracking algorithms such as ISL, AMS and WSL algorithms. Furthermore, the speed performance of the proposed method is also satisfactory for realistic surveillance applications.", "paper_title": "Moving people tracking with detection by latent semantic analysis for visual surveillance applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000331084000023"}
