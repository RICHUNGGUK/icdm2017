The interplay between turbulence and cavitation regarding the unsteadiness and structure of the flow is complex and not well understood. This constitutes a critical point to accurately simulate the dynamic behavior of sheet cavities. In the present study, different formulations based on a k-l transport-equation model are investigated and a scale-adaptive formulation is proposed. Numerical results are given for a Venturi geometry and comparisons are made with experimental data. The scale-adaptive model shows several improvements compared with standard turbulence models.
