The description of the introduced random fields is given in a \"whitenoise\" framework, which enables us to solve the stochastic forward problem through Galerkin projection onto polynomial chaos. With the help of such a representation the probabilistic identification problem is cast in a polynomial chaos expansion setting and the Baye's linear form of updating. By introducing the Hermite algebra this becomes a direct, purely algebraic way of computing the posterior, which is comparatively inexpensive to evaluate. In addition, we show that the well-known Kalman filter is the low order part of this update. The proposed method is here tested on a stationary diffusion equation with prescribed source terms, characterised by an uncertain conductivity parameter which is then identified from limited and noisy data obtained by a measurement of the diffusing quantity.
