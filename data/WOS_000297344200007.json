The proposed approach attempts to more effectively accommodate the potential deformations, rotational and translational changes by encoding the orientation preserving features and utilizing a novel region-based matching scheme. We systematically compare the previously proposed palm-vein identification approaches with our proposed ones on two different databases that are acquired with the contactless and touch-based imaging setup. We evaluate the performance improvement in both verification and recognition scenarios and analyze the influence of enrollment size on the performance. In this context, the proposed approaches are also compared for its superiority using single image enrollment on two different databases. The rigorous experimental results presented in this paper, on the databases of 100 and 250 subjects, consistently conforms the superiority of the proposed approach in both the verification and recognition scenario.", "paper_title": "Human Identification Using Palm-Vein Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000297344200007"}
