The conventional register exchange (RE) algorithm and memory-based trace-back (TB) algorithm cannot meet both constraints of power and decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a new Survivor Memory Unit (SMU) algorithm, named State Exchange (SE) algorithm. The SE algorithm uses the unit (TFU) to run the decoding operation for low decoding latency. Besides, we enhance the SE algorithm by the concept of the (TB). Based on this enhancement, we propose two types of SE-SMU. Proposed type-I SE-SMU has lower register requirement with a long critical path. Proposed type-II SE-SMU can support the high speed requirement with the cost of additional TFUs and latency. Both two proposed SE-SMUs have the decoding latency slightly higher than the decoding latency of RE-SMU. We synthesized the proposed architecture in TSMC 0.13 m technology. Both two approaches have fewer active registers as decoding. From the power analysis, proposed SE-SMUs can give a 70% power reduction comparing with RE-SMU at 100 MHz with the decoding length = 96. The power saving ration will increase further with the longer decoding length.", "paper_title": "Power-Efficient State Exchange Scheme for Low-Latency SMU Design of Viterbi Decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000303886100007"}
