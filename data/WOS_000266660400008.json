This can be highly dangerous when all SPH code is dynamically coupled with a structural solver. In this work a simple procedure is proposed to improve the computation of the pressure distribution in the dynamics of liquids. Such a procedure is based on the use of a density diffusion term in the equation for the mass conservation. This diffusion is a pure numerical effect, similar to the well known artificial viscosity originally proposed in SPH method to smooth out the shock discontinuities. As the artificial viscosity, the density diffusion used here goes to zero increasing the number of particles recovering consistency and convergence of the final numerical scheme adopted. Different artificial density diffusion formulas have been studied, paying attention to prevent unphysical changes of the flows. To show the improvements of the new scheme proposed here, a suitable set of examples. for which reference solutions or experimental data are available, has been tested. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
