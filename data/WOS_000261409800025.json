Therefore this paper proposed a phased compliance control using virtual force for multi-legged walking robot, which can effectively reduce the impact force when lite robot walks. Moreover, we designed a hierarchical control system for multi-legged walking robot, which is combined the proposed phased compliance control with a posture and vibration control based on virtual suspension model, to realize lite stable walking on unknown rough terrain. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the walking experimental results of the developed six-legged walking robot.", "paper_title": "PHASED COMPLIANCE CONTROL WITH VIRTUAL FORCE FOR SIX-LEGGED WALKING ROBOT", "paper_id": "WOS:000261409800025"}
