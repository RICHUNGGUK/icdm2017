Event related potential (ERP) is a kind of cognitive electroencephalogram (EEG) signal, which are directly related with task and average across spontaneous EEG. Effective time-frequency representation method and how to analyze EEG based on the event related cognitive task in time-frequency domain according to their experiment speciality are the hot study at present. In current paper, a new time-frequency method about filter bank and Hilbert transform (FBHT) was introduced, and the application for ERP and ER-EEG signal were explored in order to mine new information effectively during the classic Stroop cognitive task.", "paper_title": "Time-frequency analysis of EEG based on event related cognitive task", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300085"}
