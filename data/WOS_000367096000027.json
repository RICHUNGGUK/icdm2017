However, the TCI physical design guidelines remain unclear. In this paper, a ThruChip test chip is designed and fabricated for design guidelines exploration. Three inductive coupling interface physical design scenarios, baseline, power mesh, and dummy metal fill, are deployed in the test chip. In the baseline scenario, the test chip measurement results show that thinning chip or enlarging coil dimension can further reduce TCI power. The power mesh scenario shows that the eddy current on power mesh can dramatically reduce magnetic pulse signal and thus possibly cause TCI to fail. A power mesh splitting method is proposed to effectively suppress eddy current impact while minimizing power mesh structure impact. The simulation results show that the proposed method can recover 77% coupling coefficient loss while only introducing additional 0.5% IR-drop. In dummy metal fill case, dummy metal fill enclosed within TCI coils have no impact on TCI transmission and thus are ignorable.", "paper_title": "A Study of Physical Design Guidelines in ThruChip Inductive Coupling Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000367096000027"}
