The condition for feedback kernel is minimal: the only condition required is that Exponential stability integral(t)(0) k(s) ds = 1. Significant for applications of neural networks, the stability of FCNNDD is discussed Fuzzy cellular neural networks when T is finite and infinite. Exponential stability is obtained with distributed delay in finite time, while Distributed delay asymptotic stability is obtained with distributed delay in infinite time.
