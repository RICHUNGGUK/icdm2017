The k-center problem is fundamental in location theory. Variants of k-center may more accurately model real-life problems than the original formulation. Asymmetry is a significant impediment to approximation in many graph problems, such as k-center, facility location, k-median, and the TSP. We give an O (log* n) -approximation algorithm for the asymmetric weighted k-center problem. Here, the vertices have weights and we are given a total budget for opening centers. In the p-neighbor variant each vertex must have p (unweighted) centers nearby: we give an O(log*k)-bicriteria algorithm using 2k centers, for small p. Finally, we show the following three versions of the asymmetric k-center problem to be inapproximable: priority k-center, k-supplier, and outliers with forbidden centers. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
