The proposed algorithm is based on the scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) and has two phases. The first phase focuses on SIFT feature extraction and on estimation of image transformation. In the second phase, Structured Local Binary Haar Pattern (SLBHP) combined with a fuzzy similarity measure is then used to build a new and effective block similarity measure for change detection. Experimental results obtained on multi-temporal data sets show that compared with three mainstream block matching algorithms, the proposed algorithm is more effective in dealing with scale, rotation and illumination changes.", "paper_title": "Automatic registration of remote sensing images based on SIFT and fuzzy block matching for change detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300013"}
