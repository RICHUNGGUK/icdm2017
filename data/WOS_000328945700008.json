CrowdSC is a crowdsourcing framework designed for smarter cities. The framework lets users combine data collection, selection, and assessment activities in a crowdsourcing process to achieve sophisticated goals within a predefined context. Depending upon this process's execution strategy, different outcomes are possible. The authors describe CrowdSC's process model and evaluate three execution strategies.", "paper_title": "CrowdSC: Building Smart Cities with Large-Scale Citizen Participation", "paper_id": "WOS:000328945700008"}
