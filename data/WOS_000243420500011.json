By exploiting the relationship between the dual images of spheres and the dual image of the absolute conic (IAC), it is shown that the common pole and polar with regard to the conic images of two spheres are also the pole and polar with regard to the IAC. This provides two constraints for estimating the IAC and, hence, allows a camera to be calibrated from an image of at least three spheres. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Camera calibration from images of spheres", "paper_id": "WOS:000243420500011"}
