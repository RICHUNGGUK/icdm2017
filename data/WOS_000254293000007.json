It is calculated traditionally in the image spatial domain. In this paper, we present a new method of transforming an image into a low-dimensional domain based on random projection, so we can efficiently obtain the compatible IQM. From the transformed domain, we can calculate the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and apply fuzzy logic to generate a Low-Dimensional Quality Index (LDQI). Experimental results show that the LDQI can approximate the IQM in the image spatial domain. We observe that the LDQI is suited for measuring the compression blur due to its relatively low distortion. The relative error is about 0.15 as the compression blur increases.", "paper_title": "Approximate image quality measure in low-dimensional domain based on random projection", "paper_id": "WOS:000254293000007"}
