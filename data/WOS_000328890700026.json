The dissimilarity measure is derived from a deformation energy whose Hessian reproduces the underlying Riemannian metric, and it is used to define length and energy of discrete paths in shape space. The notion of discrete geodesics defined as energy minimizing paths gives rise to a discrete logarithmic map, a variational definition of a discrete exponential map, and a time discrete parallel transport. This new concept is developed in the context of shape spaces with shapes that are described via deformations of a given reference shape, and it is applied to a particular shape space in which shapes are considered as boundary contours of physical objects consisting of viscous material. The flexibility and computational efficiency of the approach is demonstrated for topology preserving shape morphing, the representation of paths in shape space via local shape variations as path generators, shape extrapolation via discrete geodesic flow, and the transfer of geometric features.", "paper_title": "Discrete Geodesic Calculus in Shape Space and Applications in the Space of Viscous Fluidic Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000328890700026"}
