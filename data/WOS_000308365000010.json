In this paper, we present a novel technique for generating annotations for independent AND-parallelism that is based on partial evaluation. Basically, we augment a simple partial evaluation procedure with (run-time) groundness and variable sharing information so that parallel conjunctions are added to the residual clauses when the conditions for independence are met. In contrast to previous approaches, our partial evaluator is able to transform the source program in order to expose more opportunities for parallelism. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first approach to a parallelizing partial evaluator.", "paper_title": "Annotation of logic programs for independent AND-parallelism by partial evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000308365000010"}
