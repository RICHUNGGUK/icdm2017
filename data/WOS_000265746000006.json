More particularly, we focus our simulations here on differentiation and self-renewal process based on cell communication. We consider the different cases where progenitor cells are able to self-renew or not in the bone marrow. As a consequence of this study, we give some possible explanations of the mechanism for recovery of the system under important blood loss or blood diseases such as anemia. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
