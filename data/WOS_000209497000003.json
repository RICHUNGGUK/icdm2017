An agglomerative hierarchical clustering (AHC) of decision tables has been examined. The result of AHC does not always optimize some criterion. We develop non-hierarchical clustering techniques for decision tables. In order to treat positive and negative evaluations to a common profile, we use a vector of rough membership values to represent individual opinion to a profile. Using rough membership values, we develop a K-means method as well as fuzzy c-means methods for clustering decision tables. We examined the proposed methods in clustering real world decision tables obtained by a questionnaire investigation.", "paper_title": "CLUSTERING OF DECISION TABLES TOWARD ROUGH SET-BASED GROUP DECISION AID", "paper_id": "WOS:000209497000003"}
