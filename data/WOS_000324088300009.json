The use of these relations in a systematic recursive manner enables the computation of all the means, variances, and covariances of progressively Type-II right-censored order statistics from the generalized half-logistic distribution for all sample sizes n, effective sample sizes m, and all progressive censoring schemes (R-1, ..., R-m). The results established here generalize the corresponding results for the usual order statistics due to Balakrishnan and Sandhu [Recurrence relations for single and product moments of order statistics from a generalized half-logistic distribution with applications to inference, J. Stat. Comput. Simul. 52 (1995), pp. 385-398.]. The moments so determined are then utilized to derive the best linear unbiased estimators of the scale and location-scale parameters of the generalized half-logistic distribution. The best linear unbiased predictors of censored failure times are discussed briefly. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the inferential method developed here.", "paper_title": "Recurrence relations for single and product moments of progressively Type-II censored order statistics from a generalized half-logistic distribution with application to inference", "paper_id": "WOS:000324088300009"}
