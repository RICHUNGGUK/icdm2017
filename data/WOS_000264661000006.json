The scheme of the DBF monopulse tracking system is given. The sum & difference beams and corresponding angle error signal of tire monopulse system are formed by data processing in baseband. Algorithms for the forming of these 5 monopulse beams are proposed. Multitarget tracking is achieved by module multiplying. Finally, an example of this DBF monopulse tracking is shown.", "paper_title": "DBF MONOPULSE TECHNIQUE AND SYSTEM FOR MULTI-TARGET TRACKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000264661000006"}
