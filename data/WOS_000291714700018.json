Direct real-time image analysis is a promising method for monitoring particle systems, and is becoming increasingly more attractive due to availability of high speed imaging devices and equally powerful computers. Performing image segmentation (separation of objects (particles) within one image) accurately becomes a key issue in particle image analysis. This paper presents a novel technique based on combining wavelet transform and Fuzzy C-means Clustering (FCM) for particle image segmentation. Through performing wavelet transform on images, the noise and high frequency components of images can be eliminated and the textures and features can be obtained. FCM is then used to divide data into two clusters to separate touching objects. To quantitatively evaluate this method, a case study involving a particle image is investigated. The procedure of selecting optimum wavelet function and decomposition level for this image is presented. 'Fuzzy range' is used as a derived feature for segmentation. The number of particles, particle equivalent diameters, and size distribution before and after partition are discussed. The results show that this method is effective and reliable.
