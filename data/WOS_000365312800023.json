In particular, according to a neural-dynamic design method, first, a cyclic-motion performance index is exploited and applied. This cyclic-motion performance index is then integrated into a quadratic programming (QP)-type scheme with time-varying constraints, called the time-varying-constrained DACMG (TVC-DACMG) scheme. The scheme includes the kinematic motion equations of two arms and the time-varying joint limits. The scheme can not only generate the cyclic motion of two arms for a humanoid robot but also control the arms to move to the desired position. In addition, the scheme considers the physical limit avoidance. To solve the QP problem, a recurrent neural network is presented and used to obtain the optimal solutions. Computer simulations and physical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of such a TVC-DACMG scheme and the neural network solver.", "paper_title": "Neural-Dynamic-Method-Based Dual-Arm CMG Scheme With Time-Varying Constraints Applied to Humanoid Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000365312800023"}
