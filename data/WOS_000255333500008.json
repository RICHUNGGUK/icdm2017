In the current customer's market, everyone wants things that are affordable but of high quality. Taking this into consideration, it becomes very important for each business to make a competent marketing strategic decision. They must be aware of the customer's thoughts to expand their market share and outdo their competitors. Clearly, the market still has a lot of factors to consider. Therefore, the critical issue is to identify with the customer's thoughts and construct a Customer's Choice Behavior Model (CCBM) for solving this problem of Customer's Choice. In this paper, a framework that considers customer's choice behavior, applies the graph-theory-based fuzzy Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (Fuzzy DEMATEL) approach combined with Fuzzy Multiple Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) is proposed. First, fuzzy DEMATEL is used to rind the key factors and attributes in building the structure relations of an ideal Customer's Choice Behavior. Then, FMCDM is demonstrated to evaluate whether the firm's performance and customer's satisfaction have differences or not. Empirical studies of Lexus and BMW are illustrated to show how well Lexus' sales is doing, whether or not they had satisfied Customers' needs, and determine the magnitude of the gap between them in order to correct this with the right strategy.", "paper_title": "FMCDM with fuzzy DEMATEL approach for customers' choice behavior model", "paper_id": "WOS:000255333500008"}
