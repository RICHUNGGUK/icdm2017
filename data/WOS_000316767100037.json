However, WSN's are characterized by constrained resources especially; energy which shortens their lifespan. One of the most important factors that cause a rapid drain of energy is radio communication of multivariate data between nodes and base station. Besides, the dynamic changes of environmental variables pose a need for an adaptive solution that cope with these changes over the time. In this paper, a new adaptive and efficient dimension reduction model (APCADR) is proposed for hierarchical sensor networks based on the candid covariance-free incremental PCA (CCIPCA). The performance of the model is evaluated using three real sensor networks datasets collected at Intel Berkeley Research Lab (IBRL), Great St. Bernard (GSB) area, and Lausanne Urban Canopy Experiments (LUCE). Experimental results show 33.33% and 50% reduction of multivariate data in dynamic and static environments, respectively. Results also show that 97-99% of original data is successfully approximated at cluster heads in both environment types. A comparison with the multivariate linear regression model (MLR) and simple linear regression model (SLR) shows the advantage of the proposed model in terms of efficiency, approximation accuracy, and adaptability with dynamic environmental changes.
