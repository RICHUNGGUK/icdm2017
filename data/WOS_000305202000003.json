In this paper, we show that if we impose the feasible solutions to fulfill some precedence constraints specified by paths of the digraph, then the problem becomes NP-complete. We also present a polynomial-time algorithm to solve this variant of the Eulerian closed walk problem when the set of paths does not contain some forbidden structure. This allows us to give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of feasible solutions in this polynomial-time solvable case.
