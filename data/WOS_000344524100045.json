In this paper, the cross-correlation between a p-ary m-sequence and its d-decimated sequences is investigated, and the cross correlation distribution is completely determined. The relationship between the decimations d considered in this paper and some known ones is also studied. This paper generalizes some previous results, and also gives new decimations, which lead to low cross correlation.", "paper_title": "Some Results on Cross-Correlation Distribution Between a p-Ary m-Sequence and Its Decimated Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100045"}
