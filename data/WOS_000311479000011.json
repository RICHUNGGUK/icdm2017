By integrating a fuzzy logic system and H-infinity tracking technique, the designed controller is able to adaptively compensate for interconnections and disturbances with unknown bounds, but none of the control and adaptation laws contains a sign function so that control chattering can be shunned. The closed-loop large-scale system is guaranteed to be asymptotically stable and obtain good H-infinity tracking performance. The control approach developed is applied to the following control problem of a string of vehicles within an automated highway system (AHS) and simulation results verify its validity.", "paper_title": "Decentralised direct adaptive fuzzy control for a class of large-scale nonaffine nonlinear systems and application to AHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000311479000011"}
