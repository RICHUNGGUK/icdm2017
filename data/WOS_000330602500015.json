It is shown that the method is of order 4 if a parameter takes a specific value, else it is of order 2. A well known numerical example is presented to illustrate our method as well as to compare the performance with other numerical methods proposed in the literature.", "paper_title": "Numerical Solutions of Fourth Order Lidstone Boundary Value Problems Using Discrete Quintic Splines", "paper_id": "WOS:000330602500015"}
