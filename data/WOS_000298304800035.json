In the system, DC electric power, command/response signals and a common clock signal for precise synchronous movement of the servomotors are transmitted via the same wiring with a multi-drop bus. Because of the bandwidth limitation, the common clock signal and the command/response signals overlap each other. It is confirmed that the coexistence of both signals is possible by using interference cancellation at the reception of command/response signals.", "paper_title": "Power Supply Overlaid Communication with Common Clock Delivery for Cooperative Motion Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000298304800035"}
