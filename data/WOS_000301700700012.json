Though MC DS/CDMA possesses several advantages, interference limits the capacity of the system. Mitigating the interference can directly swell the system capacity. In this contribution, we consider K co-channel users arbitrarily distributed in an L cell uplink and downlink communication system with both the base stations (BSs) and the mobile stations (MSs) equipped with two antennas each. Also, we assume that, both the BSs and MSs employ space time block code (STBC) based on the transmission matrix (G2). Our simulation study shows that, MMSE UOSIC provides better achievable bit-error rate (BER) than MMSE maximum likelihood (ML) and MMSE successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique due to optimal ordering among users and iterative interference cancellation (IC).
