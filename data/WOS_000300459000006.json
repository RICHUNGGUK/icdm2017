We formulate the multi-view face recognition task as a joint sparse representation model and take advantage of the correlations among the multiple views for face recognition using a novel joint dynamic sparsity prior. The proposed joint dynamic sparsity prior promotes shared joint sparsity patterns among the multiple sparse representation vectors at class-level, while allowing distinct sparsity patterns at atom-level within each class to facilitate a flexible representation. Extensive experiments on the CMU Multi-PIE face database are conducted to verify the efficacy of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
