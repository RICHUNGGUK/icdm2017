A detailed theoretical analysis of the proposed system is given, and the formulation of bit error rate (BER) is obtained. Then according to the BER formulation, system performance of the proposed receiving system is compared with existing STR, DTR and ATR systems, considering timing-variance of IR-UWB channels as well as timing jitter at the transmitter. Results show that the proposed receiving system outperforms existing systems in most situations.", "paper_title": "Fractional Fourier transform based transmitted reference scheme for UWB communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100015"}
