While each of these deals in some way with reasoning about alternative states of reality, no single knowledge representation framework deals with them in a unified and scalable manner. As a consequence it is difficult to build cognitive systems for domains that require each of these abilities to be used together. To enable this integration we propose a representational framework based on synchronizing beliefs between worlds. This framework is consistent with evidence that performing mental simulations of the world is a ubiquitous aspect of human intelligence. Using this framework, each of these tasks can be reformulated into a reasoning problem involving worlds. This demonstrates that the notions of worlds and inheritance can bring significant parsimony and broad new abilities to knowledge representation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
