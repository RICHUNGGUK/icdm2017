This paper considers a noncoherent multishot network, where the unknown and time-variant network is used several times. In order to create dependence between the different shots, particular convolutional codes in rank metric are used. These codes are so-called (partial) unit memory ((P) UM) codes, i.e., convolutional codes with memory one. First, distance measures for convolutional codes in rank metric are shown and two constructions of (P) UM codes in rank metric based on the generator matrices of maximum rank distance codes are presented. Second, an efficient error-erasure decoding algorithm for these codes is presented. Its guaranteed decoding radius is derived and its complexity is bounded. Finally, it is shown how to apply these codes for error correction in random linear and affine network coding.", "paper_title": "Convolutional Codes in Rank Metric With Application to Random Network Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600016"}
