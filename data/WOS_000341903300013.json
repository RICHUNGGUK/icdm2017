We show that for both problems, inverted right perpendicular log(2)(n!) inverted left perpendicular bits of advice are necessary and sufficient for a deterministic online algorithm to be optimal, where n denotes the number of vertices in one bipartition in the former problem, and the number of men in the latter.
