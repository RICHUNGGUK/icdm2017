The proposed method improves the optimization speed through the reduction of the search space. In addition, an improvement in convergence is demonstrated. The fuzzy controller optimized by the FRC scheme is employed to maintain the lateral position of an autonomous vehicle. The robustness of the controller to parameter variation is studied by Monte-Carlo analysis. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate the performance of the lateral controller.", "paper_title": "A Study on Lateral Control of Autonomous Vehicles via Fired Fuzzy Rules Chromosome Encoding Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000270635300005"}
