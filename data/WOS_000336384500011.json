Utilizing source follower and emitter follower as the bandgap reference output stage, a high performance bandgap reference with no Early effect and low output resistance is realized. A one diode-connected circuit is introduced to further simplify the current biasing. Simulation results of the proposed current reference generator indicate that the output current of 2 mu A exhibit a variation of 0.5 % over the temperature range of -40 to 125 A degrees C is achieved. The current reference draws 21 mu A from a 5 V supply. Corner and two hundred runs Monte Carlo simulation show that the maximum deviation from the desired value of the reference current are less than 3.05 % and +/- A 2.6 %, respectively. This high precision current reference generator is intended for Organic LED driver circuits.", "paper_title": "A 36 ppm/degrees C BiCMOS current reference without requiring curvature-compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336384500011"}
