A theoretical nonlinearity analysis of the newly proposed topology based on random, zero-mean, and normally distributed resistor mismatches is also presented. The derived equations enable circuit designers to quickly select the most suitable design for their applications by calculating the required resistor mismatch. Monte-Carlo simulation results show strong agreement with theoretical equations and confirm their accuracy.", "paper_title": "Nonlinearity analysis of double multi-bit decided folded resistor string digital-to-analog converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000314835300015"}
