Until now, it has been believed that their scheme is the only one to provide such a security feature, while achieving sub-linear size ciphertext. In this letter, we show that their scheme is insecure in the sense that any revoked user can retrieve a message encryption key, even without colluding with other revoked users. Our attack conics from an analysis of a publicly computable surjective function used in the scheme.", "paper_title": "Security Analysis of a Multi-Receiver Identity-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism", "paper_id": "WOS:000263078800040"}
