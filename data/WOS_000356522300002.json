In this paper, we demonstrate that enabling frame level block searching in HEVC can significantly improve coding efficiency on screen contents. We propose a hash-based block matching scheme for the intra block copy mode and the motion estimation process, which enables frame level block searching in HEVC without changing the HEVC syntaxes. In the proposed scheme, the blocks sharing the same hash values with the current block are selected as prediction candidates. Then the hash-based block selection is employed to select the best candidates. To achieve the best coding efficiency, the rate distortion optimization is further employed to improve the proposed scheme by balancing the coding cost of motion vectors and prediction difference. Compared with HEVC, the proposed scheme achieves 21% and 37% bitrate saving with all intra and low delay configurations with encoding time reduction. Up to 59% bitrate saving can be achieved on sequences with large motions.", "paper_title": "Hash-Based Block Matching for Screen Content Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000356522300002"}
