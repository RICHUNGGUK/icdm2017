However, continuous trajectory tracking poses new challenges to the overall battery life of the device, and thus novel energy-efficient sensor management strategies are necessary for improving the lifetime of such applications. Additionally, such sensor management strategies are required to provide a high and application-adjustable level of robustness regardless of the user's transportation mode. In this article, we extend and further analyze the sensor management strategies of the EnTracked(T) system that intelligently determines when to sample different on-device sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass and GPS) for trajectory tracking. Specifically, we propose the concept of situational bounding to improve and parameterize the robustness of sensor management strategies for trajectory tracking. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by performing a series of emulation experiments on real world data sets collected from different modes of transportation (including walking, running, biking and commuting by car) on mobile devices from two different platforms. Thorough experimental analyses indicate that our system can save significant amounts of battery power compared to the state-of-the-art position tracking systems, while simultaneously maintaining robustness and accuracy bounds as required by diverse location-aware applications.", "paper_title": "Robust and Energy-Efficient Trajectory Tracking for Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000347098100015"}
