Bilevel images (black and white), grayscale- or color-images and even video sequences can be effectively coded as weighted finite automata. Since each state represents a subimage within those automata the weighted transitions can exploit self-similarities for image compression. These \"fractal\" approaches yield remarkable results in comparison to the well-known standard JPEG- or MPEG-encodings and frequently provide advantages for images with strong contrasts. Here we will study the combination of these highly effective compression techniques with a generalization of weighted finite automata to higher dimensions, which establish d-dimensional relations between result-sets of ordinary weighted automata. For the applications we will restrict ourselves to three-dimensional Bezier spline-patches and to grayscale images as textures.", "paper_title": "On Succinct Representations of Textured Surfaces by Weighted Finite Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000277568600002"}
