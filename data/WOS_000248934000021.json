In this paper, a Markovian level set method for boundary detection in long-axis echocardiographic images is proposed. It combines Markov random field (MRF) model, which makes use of local statistics with level set method that handles topological changes, to detect a continuous and smooth boundary. Experimental results show that higher accuracy can be achieved with the proposed method compared with two related MRF-based methods.", "paper_title": "Boundary detection in echocardiographic images using markovian level set method", "paper_id": "WOS:000248934000021"}
