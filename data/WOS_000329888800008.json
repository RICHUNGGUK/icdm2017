We compare three kinds of matching techniques: the conventional simple correlation, the tangent distance, and the global affine transformation (GAT) correlation. Although the k-NN classification method is straightforward and powerful, it consumes a lot of time. Therefore, to reduce the computational cost of matching in k-NN classification, we propose accelerating the GAT correlation method by reformulating its computational model and adopting efficient lookup tables. Recognition experiments performed on the IPTP CDROM1B handwritten numerical database show that the matching techniques of the simple correlation, the tangent distance, and the accelerated GAT correlation achieved recognition rates of 97.07%, 97.50%, and 98.70%, respectively. The computation time ratios of the tangent distance and the accelerated GAT correlation to the simple correlation are 26.3 and 36.5 to 1.0, respectively. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
