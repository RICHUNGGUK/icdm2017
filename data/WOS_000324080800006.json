A two-by-two design was used to understand students' expression of knowledge and of learning in the contexts of \"regular\" online discussions versus \"final test\" online discussions. Findings suggested that assessment had an impact on how students interacted online and in their use of rhetorical moves; and that knowing and learning are related but distinct constructs, correlated within each writing context, dissociated across contexts, and performing differentially as a function of students' perceptions of academic demands. We discuss the limitations of traditional assessment, offer an alternative approach, and conclude with practical suggestions for online/hybrid course instructors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
