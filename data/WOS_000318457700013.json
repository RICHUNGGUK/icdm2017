The limiting threshold evolves according to a control signal derived from the feedback internal states of the network. Simulation results reveal that the CNN under control exhibits multiphase behavior in the control parameter space. With proper parameter values, the controlled CNN converges to a periodic orbit which includes a stored pattern that has the smallest Hamming distance to its initial state. The properties of the controlled CNN can be used for information processing such as memory retrieval and pattern recognition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
