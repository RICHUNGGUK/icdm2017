An optimization algorithm is applied to find the operating strategy leading to the best use of available off-gas by the different consumers. This is realized by adjusting the flow of the material through different kilns and the stock piles. In addition, the choice of whether or not to operate a certain kiln is treated as a decision variable. The contribution of this paper lies in formulating a linear model describing the system and solving the above mentioned problem as a mixed integer optimization problem in real time. A simulation result is shown and explained. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
