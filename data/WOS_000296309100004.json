Reserve capacity is identified by the largest multiplier applied to a given existing demand matrix, that can be allocated to a network without violating the arc capacities. Having a two-way streets base network and the allowable street lane additions, the problem is to find the optimum configuration of street directions and two-way street lane allocations, and the optimum selection of street lane addition projects, in a way that the reserve capacity of the network is maximized. The problem is considered in two variations: in the first variation no restriction is imposed on the symmetricity of lane allocations for two-way streets, and in the second variation, two-way street lane allocations are restricted to be symmetric. The proposed problems are modeled as mixed-integer bi-level mathematical problems. A hybrid genetic algorithm and an evolutionary simulated annealing algorithm are proposed to solve the models. Computational results for both problem variations are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
