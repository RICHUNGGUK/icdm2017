Efforts were devoted to the dynamic responses (including dynamic characteristics, acceleration amplifications, displacements, story drifts) and capacity curve. In addition, this study extended the prediction on dynamic response of precast RAC model by parametric study of material properties that represent the replacement percentage of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA). Principles and assumptions that represent characteristics of precast structure and influence of the interface between head of column and cast-in-place (CIP) joint on the stiffness of the joints was put forward and validated by test results. The comparison between simulated and tested results of the precast RAC frame shows a good correlation with most of the relative errors about 25% in general. Therefore, the adopted assumptions and the platform OpenSees are a viable approach to simulate the dynamic response of precast frames made of RAC.", "paper_title": "Simulation study on dynamic response of precast frames made of recycled aggregate concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000366648000008"}
