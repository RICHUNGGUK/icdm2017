The new formulation has the advantage of taking into account the thickness of the sediment layer which avoids mass conservation problems in certain situations. Moreover, it reduces to a classical solid transport discharge formula in the case of quasi-uniform regime. We also present several numerical tests where we compare the proposed sediment transport formula with the classical formulation and we show the behavior of the new model in different configurations.
