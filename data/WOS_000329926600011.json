Like in general multi-agent systems, the agents in the holonic system may negotiate with each other. These systems have their own characteristics and structure, for which a specific negotiation mechanism is required. This mechanism should be simple, fast and operable in real world applications. It would be better to equip negotiators with a learning method which can efficiently use the available information. The learning method should itself be fast, too. Additionally, this mechanism should match the special characteristics of the holonic multi-agent systems. In this paper, we introduce such a negotiation method. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of this new approach.", "paper_title": "HOMAN, a learning based negotiation method for holonic multi-agent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000329926600011"}
