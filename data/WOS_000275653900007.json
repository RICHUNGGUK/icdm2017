The time-varying delay is assumed to belong to an interval and can be a slow or fast time-varying function. A hybrid state feedback strategy is redesigned to guarantee the system stable since the original controller is unavailable for some actuators failures. A class of switching laws incorporating the average dwell time method is proposed so that the special switched system with interval time-varying delay is exponentially stable. New delay-range-dependent stabilisation conditions using state feedback controllers are formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by choosing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional without neglecting some useful knowledge on system states. Parameterised characterisations of the controllers are given in terms of the feasibility solutions to the LMIs. Two numeral examples are given to demonstrate the applicability and the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Exponential stabilisation for time-varying delay system with actuator faults: an average dwell time method", "paper_id": "WOS:000275653900007"}
