Because data rate and delay are both directly related to bandwidth consumption, the trend produces the imminent problem of reaching the bandwidth limit. The cap on available bandwidth forces allocation to be the focus of responses to the trend. In this article, the relationship between data rate and user satisfaction as well as the relationship between delay and user satisfaction are explored in order to gain a better understanding of how to optimize the allocation of bandwidth without major sacrifices in user satisfaction.", "paper_title": "Delay and Rate Satisfaction for Data Transmission with Application in Wireless Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000362910400014"}
