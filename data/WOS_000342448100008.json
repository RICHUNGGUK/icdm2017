EPoC is the transparent extension of EPON over a cable operator's Hybrid Fiber-Coax network. For managing and controlling such a hybrid network, a network operator prefers to have a unified scheduling, management, and quality of service environment that includes both the optical and coax portions of the network. In EPoC, this is achieved by extending the EPON Medium Access Control to run over the coax physical layer, to have a centralized end-to-end network control from the cable head-end to the end users premises. In this paper, we focus on the downstream transmissions in EPoC. We study three different framing approaches for downstream coax frames based on how sub-carriers in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexed symbol are modulated. We discuss the merits and demerits of each approach and then compare them based on their control overheads and the maximum average data transmission rates each of them can achieve. We analyze how different parameters such as modulation profile, symbol duration, number of sub-carriers and length of resource blocks affect the data rates and the performance of downstream transmissions. We present simulation results to examine the implications of these factors on packet-level performance, such as delay. The results indicate that dynamic and hybrid framing approaches tend to perform better than static approaches, when traffic and usage pattern are identical to those in real-world scenarios. Finally, we outline the important engineering and research problems in this area which can be topics of future research.", "paper_title": "On downstream transmissions in EPON Protocol over Coax (EPoC): An analysis of Coax framing approaches and other relevant considerations", "paper_id": "WOS:000342448100008"}
