The routing scheme decides which messages should be forwarded when nodes meet, and the buffer management policy determines which message is purged when the buffer overflows in a node. This study proposes a buffer management policy named as Dynamic Prediction based Multi Queue (DPMQ) for probabilistic routing protocols. It works by classification of local buffer into three queues of messages, which are DCTL, HPTL and LPTL The simulation results have proven that the DPMQ performs well as compared to DLA, DOA, MOFO, LIFO, LEPR and LIFO in terms of reducing the message relay, message drop, hop counts average and overhead while rising in the delivery probability.
