We consider several classes of one-counter automata (mainly deterministic vs. nondeterministic) and several logical fragments (restriction on the number of registers or variables and on the use of propositional variables for control states). The logics have the ability to store a counter value and to test it later against the current counter value. We show that model checking LTL(down arrow) and FO(similar to, <, +1) over deterministic one-counter automata is PSPACE-complete with infinite and finite accepting runs. By contrast, we prove that model checking LTL(down arrow) in which the until operator U is restricted to the eventually F over nondeterministic one-counter automata is Sigma(1)(1)-complete [resp. Sigma(0)(1)-completel in the infinitary [resp. finitary] case even if only one register is used and with no propositional variable. As a corollary of our proof, this also holds for FO(similar to, <, +1) restricted to two variables (written FO(2)(similar to, <, +1)). This makes a difference with respect to the facts that several verification problems for one-counter automata are known to be decidable with relatively low complexity, and that finitary satisfiability problems for LTL(down arrow) and FO(2)(similar to, <, +1) are decidable. Our results pave the way for model checking memoryful (linear-time) logics over other classes of operational models, such as reversal-bounded counter machines. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
