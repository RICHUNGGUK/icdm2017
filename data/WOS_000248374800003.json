A logical inference system named R-calculus is defined to derive all maximal contractions of a base of belief set for its given refutations. The R-calculus consists of the structural rules, an axiom, a cut rule and the rules for logical connectives and quantifiers. Some examples are given to demonstrate how to use the R-calculus. Furthermore, the properties reachability, soundness and completeness of the R-calculus are formally defined and proved.", "paper_title": "R-calculus: An inference system for belief revision", "paper_id": "WOS:000248374800003"}
