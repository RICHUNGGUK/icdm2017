As radio resources are limited, we propose an admission control rule that protects users with stringent transmission bit-rate requirements (\"streaming traffic\") while offering sufficient capacity over longer time intervals to delay-tolerant users (\"elastic traffic\"). While our strategy may not satisfy classical notions of fairness, we aim to reduce congestion and increase overall throughput of elastic users. Using time-scale decomposition, we develop approximations to evaluate the performance of our differentiated admission control strategy to support integrated services with transmission bit-rate requirements in a realistic downlink transmission scenario for a single radio cell.
