We first review the main existing methods for determining OWA operator weights. We next introduce the principle of maximum entropy for setting up probability distributions on the basis of partial knowledge and prove that Xu's normal distribution-based method obeys the principle of maximum entropy. Finally, we propose an argument-dependent approach based on normal distribution, which assigns very low weights to these \"false\" or \"biased\" opinions and can relieve the influence of the unfair arguments. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the application of the proposed approach.
