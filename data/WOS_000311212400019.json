Due to its inherent complexity, industrial-sized automated wet-etch station scheduling problems are rarely solved through full rigorous mathematical formulations. Decomposition techniques based on heuristic, meta-heuristics and simulation-based methods have been traditionally reported in literature to provide feasible solutions with reasonable CPU times. This work introduces an improvement MILP-based decomposition strategy that combines the benefits of a rigorous continuous-time MILP (mixed integer linear programming) formulation with the flexibility of heuristic procedures. The schedule generated provides enhanced solutions over time to challenging real-world automated wet etch station scheduling problems with moderate computational cost. This methodology was able to provide more than a 7% of improvement in comparison with the best results reported in literature for the most complex problem instances analyzed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
