However, social networks, which enable users to build relationships and create different types of items, present an unprecedented opportunity to alleviate these issues. In this paper, we represent a social network as a star-structured hybrid graph centered on a social domain, which connects with other item domains. With this innovative representation, useful knowledge from an auxiliary domain can be transferred through the social domain to a target domain. Various factors of item transferability, including popularity and behavioral consistency, are determined. We propose a novel Hybrid Random Walk (HRW) method, which incorporates such factors, to select transferable items in auxiliary domains, bridge cross-domain knowledge with the social domain, and accurately predict user-item links in a target domain. Extensive experiments on a real social dataset demonstrate that HRW significantly outperforms existing approaches.", "paper_title": "Social Recommendation with Cross-Domain Transferable Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000362943700017"}
