In this method, NFCRM is applied to build the fuzzy structure and then identify the premise parameters; a new criterion is proposed to auto determine the number of rules in fuzzy modeling; after the fuzzy rules have been decided, orthogonal least square is exploited to identify the consequent parameters. Simulation examples are given to demonstrate the validity of the proposed modeling approach, and the results show the new approach is very efficient with high accuracy. Finally, the new approach is applied in fuzzy modeling of a typical boiler-turbine system successfully. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
