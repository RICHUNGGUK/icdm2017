The package consists of ISOLA-GUI, a user-friendly MATLAB-based interface, and the ISOLA Fortran code, which is the computational core of the application. The methodology used is similar to iterative deconvolution technique, often used in teleseismic studies, but here adjusted for regional and local distances. The advantage of the software is the graphical interface that provides the user with an easy to use environment, rich in graphics and data handling routines, while at the same time the speed of Fortran code is retained. Besides that, the software allows the results to be exported to popular software packages, like Generic Mapping Tools, while at the same time utilizing them for quality plots of the results. The modular design of ISOLA-GUI can be used by users for the addition of supplementary routines in all the stages of processing. An example of the method's ability to obtain a quick insight into the complexity of an earthquake is presented, using records from a moderate size event. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
