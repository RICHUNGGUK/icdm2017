It is shown that the employment of adaptive antenna arrays at the receiver can assist in attenuating multiuser interference and at the same time speeds-up the convergence rate of the adaptive receiver. In this work, we assess the accuracy of the theoretical results developed for the uncoded and convolutionally coded space-time multiuser detector when applied to the adaptive case. It is found that the use of antenna arrays brings the receiver performance very close to its multiuser counterpart. Using performance error bounds, we show that a user-capacity gain of approximately 200% can easily be achieved for the space-time adaptive detector when used with a rate 1/2 convolutional code (CC) and a practical channel interleaver. This capacity gain is only 10% less than the gain achieved for the more complicated multiuser-based receiver. Finally, we perform a comparison between convolutional and turbo coding where we find that the latter outperforms the former at all practical bit-error rates (BER).
