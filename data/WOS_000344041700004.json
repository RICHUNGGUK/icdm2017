To explore how field experiences complement, diverge from, and intersect with classroom experiences, this research analysed interviews with and reports of Canadian library and information science students who did coop placements in academic libraries. The findings confirm that field experiences are important for linking classroom learning to practice and that they help illuminate the realities of librarianship and clarify the implications of classroom learning for practice.", "paper_title": "You Can't Learn It in School: Field Experiences and Their Contributions to Education and Professional Identity", "paper_id": "WOS:000344041700004"}
