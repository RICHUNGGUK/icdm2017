Most of the involved processes are driven by microorganisms. To investigate and understand these processes, individual-based models allow analyzing complex microbial systems' behavior based on rules and conditions for individual entities within these systems, taking into account local interactions and individual variations. Here, we present a streamlined, user-friendly and open version of the individual-based model INDISIM-SOM, which describes the mineralization of soil carbon and nitrogen. It was implemented in NetLogo, a widely used and easily accessible software platform especially designed for individual-based simulation models. Including powerful means to observe the model behavior and a standardized documentation, this increases INDISIM-SOM's range of potential uses and users, and facilitates the exchange among soil scientists as well as between different modeling approaches.
