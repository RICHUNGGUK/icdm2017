Unfortunately, despite these new developments, there is no easy way to build new application-specific communication services. The stovepipe approach used today for building new communication services results in rigid technology, limited utility, lengthy and costly development cycle, and difficulty in integration. In this paper, we introduce communication virtual machine (CVM) that supports rapid conception, specification, and automatic realization of new application-specific communication services through a user-centric, model-driven approach. We present the concept, architecture, modeling language, prototypical design, and implementation of CVM in the context of a healthcare application.
