However, the discussion on the concrete methods for calculating W-e has not been developed comprehensively nor have the different methods of calculation been integrated. Therefore, this paper focuses on a detailed description and a comparison of the two main W-e calculation methods. One method is mapping all the abscissa data in one united relative coordinate system to perform the calculation (called CC method) and the other is dividing the data into two groups and mapping them in two separate coordinate systems (called SC method). We tested the accuracy of each method and compared both methods in a highly controlled experiment. The experiments' results and data analysis show that the CC method is better than the SC method for human computer interface modeling. These results will be instrumental for future application of Fitts' law.", "paper_title": "The optimal calculation method to determine the effective target width for the application of Fitts' law", "paper_id": "WOS:000245929200006"}
