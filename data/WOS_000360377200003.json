Aliasing is a critical drawback of image based techniques in shadow generation. Many techniques are proposed to enhance the anti-aliasing. We have classified and systemized these techniques. The main goal of this paper is to provide researchers with background on a variety of techniques to reduce the aliasing so as make it easier for them to choose the method best suited to their aims. During categorizing the anti-aliasing techniques, well-known techniques to enhance aliasing is described detail, along with a discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of each. The algorithms are also comprehensively summarized and analysed in depth. It is also hoped that our analysis helps researchers find solutions to the shortcomings of each technique.", "paper_title": "Anti-aliasing in image based shadow generation techniques: a comprehensive survey", "paper_id": "WOS:000360377200003"}
