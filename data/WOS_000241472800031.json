In this paper a formal description of the DCA is given. The DCA is described in detail, and its use as an anomaly detector is illustrated within the context of computer security. A port scan detection task is performed to substantiate the influence of signal selection on the behaviour of the algorithm. Experimental results provide a comparison of differing input signal mappings.", "paper_title": "Articulation and clarification of the dendritic cell algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472800031"}
