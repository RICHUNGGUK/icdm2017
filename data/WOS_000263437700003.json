Both algorithms, called Alg-Neighbors and Alg-Edges, make use of biased and unbiased dice having f >= 2 faces, and are analyzed in terms of correctness, expected time complexity and rate of convergence. First, the Alg-Neighbors algorithm is presented as a generalization of the Calabrese/Franca algorithm for dice (or coins) with 2 faces. It is proved that a convenient biasing function applied to all dice changes the expected time complexity from sub-exponential, i.e., O(f(f/f-1)(n-1)) (for unbiased dice with f faces), to O(n), where n is the number of the system's nodes. Next, it is shown that the Alg-Edges algorithm is able to produce acyclic orientations in O(log(f) m) steps with high probability, where in denotes the total number of edges. Finally. a speed of convergence versus quality of acyclic orientation generation (associated number of colors) tradeoff is identified between Alg-Neighbors and Alg-Edges algorithms. Computational experiments were carried out in order to provide a more accurate description of the behavior of both algorithms. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
