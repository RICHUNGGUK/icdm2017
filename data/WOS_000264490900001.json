Focusing on this issue, this paper describes a design and implementation toolset using our ODYSSEY methodology, which advocates object-oriented (OO) modeling of embedded systems and its ASIP-based implementation. The proposed approach promotes a smooth transition from high-level object-oriented specification to the final embedded system, which is composed of hardware and software components. The transition from higher to lower abstraction levels is facilitated by the use of our GUI, which supports the intermediate steps of the design and implementation process. In order to illustrate the proposed approach and related toolset, we apply this top-down design and implementation framework to real-world embedded systems, namely JPEG codec and Motion JPEG codec. Experimental results show that the developed tool remarkably decreases the design and verification time with modest performance penalty.", "paper_title": "A FRAMEWORK FOR OBJECT-ORIENTED EMBEDDED SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT BASED ON OO-ASIPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000264490900001"}
