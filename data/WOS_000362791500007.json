In this process, different users may follow different decision making strategies, some are compensatory in which only an overall value on all the criteria is evaluated, some evaluate one criterion at a time in the order of their importance levels, while others count on the number of winning criteria. Most of the current QoS-based service selection systems do not consider these decision strategies in the ranking process, which we believe are crucial for generating accurate ranking results for individual users. In this paper, we propose a decision strategy based service ranking model. Furthermore, considering that different users follow different strategies in different contexts at different times, we apply a machine learning algorithm to learn a personalized ranking model for individual users based on how they select services in the past. We have implemented and tested the proposed approach, and our experiment results show the effectiveness of the approach.", "paper_title": "Personalized Decision-Strategy based Web Service Selection using a Learning-to-Rank Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000362791500007"}
