They are called the average-bound crossover and wavelet mutation. By introducing the proposed genetic operations, both the solution quality and stability are better than the RCGA with conventional genetic operations. A suite of benchmark test functions are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. Application examples on economic load dispatch and tuning an associative-memory neural network are used to show the performance of the proposed RCGA.", "paper_title": "An improved genetic algorithm with average-bound crossover and wavelet mutation operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239893000002"}
