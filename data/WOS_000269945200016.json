Like the VIBRANT ME-DEL's FMT (R), the PFMT can be attached to the incus long process with a metal clamp and vibrate the ossicular chain according to the force originated from the piezoelectric actuator's expansion-and-contraction. An in vitro experiment using a human temporal bone confirms that the PFMT excitation at 3.5V(rms) can generate vibration displacements being equivalent to the sound pressure of about 94 dB SPL below I kHz and about 140 dB SPL at 8 kHz. The PFMT's power consumption to produce 94 dB SPL equivalent sound stimulation is 65 mu W at 1 kHz. Therefore, the PFMT is expected to be a useful transducer with advantages such as simple surgical implantation, no interference from external electromagnetic fields, and an improved productivity.
