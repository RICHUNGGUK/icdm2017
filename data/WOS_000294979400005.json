This methodology is based on a Lagrangian Monte Carlo (MC) FOP solver constructed on a domain portrayed by an unstructured mesh. The base filtered transport equations on this mesh are solved by a finite-volume (FV) method. The consistency of the hybrid FV-MC solver and the realizability of the simulated results are demonstrated via LES of a temporally developing mixing layer. The overall performance of the model is appraised by comparison with direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. The algorithmic implementation in the commercial software ANSYS-FLUENT facilitates future FDF-LES of turbulent combustion in complex configurations. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
