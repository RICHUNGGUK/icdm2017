Our technique involves using game analytics to create an abstracted game analytic space to make the problem tractable. We then model player retention in this space and use these models to make guided changes to game analytics in order to bring about a targeted distribution of game states that will, in turn, influence player behavior. Experiments performed showed that the adaptive versions of two different casual games, Scrabb-lesque and Sidequest: The Game, were able to better fit a target distribution of game states while also significantly reducing the quitting rate compared to the nonadaptive version of the games. We showed that these gains were not coming at the cost of player experience by performing a psychometric evaluation in which we measured player intrinsic motivation and engagement with the game environments. In both cases, we showed that players playing the adaptive version of the games reported higher intrinsic motivation and engagement scores than players playing the nonadaptive version of the games.", "paper_title": "An Analytic and Psychometric Evaluation of Dynamic Game Adaption for Increasing Session-Level Retention in Casual Games", "paper_id": "WOS:000361377400002"}
