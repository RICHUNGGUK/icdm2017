To solve this problem, one can have routers check whether or not every packet comes from a correct direction based on its source address field. However, due to routing asymmetry in today's Internet, a router cannot simply reverse its forwarding table to determine the correct incoming direction of a packet. In this paper, we present the source address validity enforcement protocol, SAVE, which allows routers to learn valid incoming directions for any given source address. SAVE is independent from-and can work with-any specific routing protocol. By only interfacing with the forwarding table at routers, SAVE allows routers to properly propagate valid source address information from source address spaces to all destinations, and allows each router en route to build and maintain an incoming tree to associate each source address prefix with a corresponding incoming interface. The incoming tree is further valuable in handling routing changes: although a routing change at one router could affect the incoming direction of source address spaces from many locations, only the router that sees the change needs to send out new updates. Finally, SAVE has a good performance with low overhead. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
