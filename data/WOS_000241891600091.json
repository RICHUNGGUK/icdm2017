This model is comprised of two parts: rehandling operation scheduling and the shortest path search. A nested genetic algorithm with two layers is proposed, where the inner layer algorithm is embedded in the outer one. The outer algorithm is responsible for optimizing rehandling operation scheduling, and the inner is for searching the shortest path of rehandling operation. Two reformative operations are introduced, including the parent population involving selection and optimal individual maintaining. With an actual example, the algorithm is testified, the result shows that the algorithm is effective to solve this problem and has a high efficiency and speed of convergence.", "paper_title": "A nested genetic algorithm for optimal container pick-up operation scheduling on container yards", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600091"}
