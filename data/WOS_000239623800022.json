RobSim is a hybrid system based on soft computing techniques and includes a genetic algorithm component, a fuzzy logic component, and a component utilizing features derived from chaos theory. The presented system is an extension of our previous work. A new component of the system exploits the principle of self-similarity found in chaos theory via so-called adaptive fuzzy sets for problem solving. Compared to earlier versions the current system provides increased functionality, adaptability, and flexibility, extending the problem solving potential of the system to a wider range of applications.", "paper_title": "A hybrid robot control system based on soft computing techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800022"}
