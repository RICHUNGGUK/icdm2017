Techniques to identify and mitigate bad code smells have been proposed and studied. Recently bad test code smells (test smells for short) have been put forward as a kind of bad code smell specific to tests such a unit tests. What has been missing is empirical investigation into the prevalence and impact of bad test code smells. Two studies aimed at providing this missing empirical data are presented. The first study finds that there is a high diffusion of test smells in both open source and industrial software systems with 86 % of JUnit tests exhibiting at least one test smell and six tests having six distinct test smells. The second study provides evidence that test smells have a strong negative impact on program comprehension and maintenance. Highlights from this second study include the finding that comprehension is 30 % better in the absence of test smells.", "paper_title": "Are test smells really harmful?
