However, most of the existing automatic video annotation research focuses on the annotation of high-level concepts, such as events, scenes, and object categories. This article presents a novel solution to the annotation of specific products in videos by mining information from the Web. It collects a set of high-quality training data for each product by simultaneously leveraging Amazon and Google image search engine. A visual signature for each product is then built based on the bag-of-visual-words representation of the training images. A correlative sparsification approach is employed to remove noisy bins in the visual signatures. These signatures are used to annotate video frames. We conduct experiments on more than 1,000 videos and the results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.", "paper_title": "In-Video Product Annotation with Web Information Mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000312211900007"}
