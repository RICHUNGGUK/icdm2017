A signal from a transmitting node reaches all neighbors but a message is received successfully by a node, if and only if exactly one of its neighbors transmits in this round. If two neighbors of a node transmit simultaneously in a given round, we say that a collision occurred at this node. Collision detection is the ability of nodes to distinguish a collision from silence. We show that collision detection speeds up leader election in arbitrary radio networks. Our main result is a deterministic leader election algorithm working in time O (n) in all n-node networks, if collision detection is available, while it is known that deterministic leader election requires time Omega(n logn), even for complete networks, if there is no collision detection.
