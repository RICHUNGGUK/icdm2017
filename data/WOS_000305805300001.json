Each transition frame is composed of images of arms, hands, head and torso. Of them, the hand images are computed based on 3D hand models, and images of other parts are selected from a database. Experimental results show the method provided by this paper can improve the joined video's visual presentation.", "paper_title": "Making smooth transitions based on a multi-dimensional transition database for joining Chinese sign-language videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000305805300001"}
