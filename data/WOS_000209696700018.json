Convolutionally channel coding and iterative linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detection are employed. We focus on the design of power allocation strategies for this system to exploit the potential benefit of available CSIT. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed designs can achieve the advantage provided by the available CSIT efficiently, and meanwhile are robust to the CSIT uncertainty.", "paper_title": "Power Allocation for Linearly Precoded OFDM Systems with Imperfect CSIT", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696700018"}
