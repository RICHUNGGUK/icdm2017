In the present work, hierarchical neural fuzzy (HNF) models are reviewed, focusing on the model-based control of a biotechnological process. The model considered here consists of a set of neural fuzzy systems connected in cascade and is used in the modeling of an industrial plant for ethyl alcohol ( ethanol) production. Based on the HNF model of the process, a nonlinear model predictive controller (HNF-MPC) is designed and applied to control the process. The performance of the HNF-MPC is illustrated within servo and regulatory scenarios.", "paper_title": "Application of hierarchical neural fuzzy models to modeling and control of a bioprocess", "paper_id": "WOS:000241520800004"}
