We present a novel software infrastructure for academic chemistry institutions that allows the management of modern laboratory environments. The fundamental parts of the scientific process, namely the design of experiments, the acquisition of data, and their management, have been considered and implemented in this new software platform \"dial-a-device\". This software platform is available in an open source and modular format that guarantees affordability and high flexibility.
