In general, the positive stream of stock information is assumed to stimulate buying and increase the stock prices, and the negative stream of stock information is assumed to result in selling and decrease the stock prices. Based on the stock information entropy, the intensity for stock information stream is measured and applied to associating with the stock price movement with the aid of neural networks. Experiments illustrate the associations statistically. The results are helpful in probing the microstructure of the stock markets from a new angle.", "paper_title": "Neural network method to predict stock price movement based on stock information entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300065"}
