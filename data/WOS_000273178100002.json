The current practice to implement security functionality exclusively at the endpoint places a significant processing burden on the endpoint, renders maintenance and management of the distributed security infrastructures cumbersome, and impedes interoperability with external service requesters. To meet these challenges, we propose a reference security architecture that transposes the model of Software as a Service to the security domain and thereby realizes Security as a Service (SeAAS). The proposed architecture goes beyond the mere bundling of security functionality within one security domain. We illustrate the concepts of SeAAS at work with the requirement of fair non-repudiation. The architecture complements the SECTET framework for model-driven security engineering.", "paper_title": "SeAAS - A Reference Architecture for Security Services in SOA", "paper_id": "WOS:000273178100002"}
