However, transmission lines have been for a long time a standard way to implement high Q resonators in RF circuits. Recently, some continuous-time sigma-delta (SD) modulator architectures using transmission lines have been proposed. Theoretical analyses have shown that this kind of architectures share some of the properties of both continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) modulators. On the other hand they have specific implementation problems which are not present in other modulator architectures. This paper makes a brief review of the particularities of these modulators and shows the experimental results of a band-pass modulator implemented in BiCMOS technology. As an advantage compared to standard continuous time designs, this modulator can be operated as a subsampling ADC, displays a better immunity to clock jitter and is tolerant to loop delay.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a band-pass sigma delta modulator with distributed resonators", "paper_id": "WOS:000262668000007"}
