AIR (Advancement through Interactive Radio) gives female community radio listeners a voice with which to respond to programming and to create programming content. We first describe the cost of excluding women from Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for development, and explore how community radio represents an opportunity for inclusion. We draw upon feasibility studies and site visits in Southeast Kenya to support the introduction of a mechanism that enables women to \"talk back\" to the community radio station. Using the principles of Participatory Action Research (PAR), we argue that women will be more likely to benefit from technology-mediated opportunities for development if they themselves produce information that contributes to their advancement, rather than simply consuming information provided by others. Finally, we describe the design and implementation of simple communications device that supports this model for use in communities that are, and will remain for some time, off the electrical and cellular grid. This hand-held device enables women to record voice feedback and news for community radio. This feedback is then routed asynchronously back to the radio station through a probabilistic, delay-tolerant network, where the feedback can inform subsequent broadcasts and facilitate additional discussion. We conclude with a technical summary of the AIR prototype.", "paper_title": "Advancement through interactive radio", "paper_id": "WOS:000266240700005"}
