As the optimization of energy consumption becomes a major concern for system designers and administrators, it can be considered as another QoS metric to be monitored. In this paper, we present a service framework that allows us to monitor the energy consumption of a Cloud infrastructure, calculate its energy efficiency, and evaluate the gathered data in order to put in place an effective virtual machine (VM) management. In that context, a simulation scenario of an eco-driven VM placement policy resulted in a 14% improvement of the infrastructure's energy efficiency. In total, the proposed approaches and implementations have been validated against a testbed, producing very promising results regarding the prospect of energy efficiency as an important quality factor in Clouds.
