As they have a small microchip on board, they offer functionality that can be used for security purposes. This chip functionality makes it possible to verify the authenticity of a product and hence to detect and prevent counterfeiting. In order to be successful for these security purposes too, RFID-tags have to be resistant against many attacks, in particular against cloning of the tag. In this paper, we investigate how an RFID-tag can be made unclonable by linking it inseparably to a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF). We present the security protocols that are needed for the detection of the authenticity of a product when it is equipped with such a system. We focus on off-line authentication because it is very attractive from a practical point of view. We show that a PUF based solution for RFID-tags is feasible in the off-line case.", "paper_title": "RFID-tags for anti-counterfeiting", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884700008"}
