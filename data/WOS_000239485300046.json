In this paper, a video watermarking scheme is proposed to resist temporal desynchronization by using shot segmentation and two-dimensional principal component analysis (2DPCA). In this scheme, the to-be-watermarked video is first segmented into different shots. And each shot is analyzed by 2DPCA in xt tomography to get its principal feature frames (PFFs). And then the watermark is embedded into the PFFs. This scheme is robust to temporal desynchronization through a content dependent way. Simulations show the feasibility and reliability of this scheme. It is also robust to most of the common video processing/attacks, such as MPEG2 compression, filtering, frame resizing, noising, etc.", "paper_title": "A 2DPCA-based video watermarking scheme for resistance to temporal desynchronization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300046"}
