Web 2.0 offers interesting technical approaches (protocols, message formats, and programming tools) to build core e-infrastructure (cyberinfrastructure) as well as many interesting services (Facebook, YouTube, Amazon S3/EC2, and Google maps) that can add value to e-infrastructure projects. We discuss why some of the original Grid goals of linking the world's computer systems may not be so relevant today and that interoperability is needed at the data and not always at the infrastructure level. Web 2.0 may also support Parallel Programming 2.0-a better parallel computing software environment motivated by the need to run commodity applications on multicore chips. A 'Grid on the chip' will be a common use of future chips with tens or hundreds of cores.
