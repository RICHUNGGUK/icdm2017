Both access networks support connection-level and packet-level services, where the Poisson process and the Markov modulated Poisson process are used to describe the connection-level and packet-level services, respectively. By means of a multi-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain model, the DSA scheme is assessed under various traffic load profiles. Numerical results show that the connection-level secondary users's quality of service may be significantly deteriorated by the packet-level primary user service.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Sub-Band Allocation in Multi-Service Cognitive Radio Access Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681700025"}
