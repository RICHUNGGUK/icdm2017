The proposed approach makes use of radial basis function neural network for prediction of incremental joint angles which in turn are transformed into absolute joint angles with the assistance of forward kinematics relations. In this approach, forward kinematics relations of robot are used to obtain the data for training of neural network as well to estimate the deviation of predicted inverse kinematics solution from the desired solution. The effectiveness of the fusion process is shown by comparing the inverse kinematics solutions obtained for an end-effector of industrial robot moving along a specified path with the solutions obtained from conventional neural network approaches as well as iterative technique. The prominent features of the fusion process include the accurate prediction of inverse kinematics solutions with less computational time apart from the generation of training data for neural network with forward kinematics relations of the robot.
