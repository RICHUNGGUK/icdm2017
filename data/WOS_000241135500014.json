From various perspectives, our work focuses on how to improve information retrieval efficiency in a P2P distributed information sharing system. A new model based on mobile agent is proposed and the new migration algorithm of mobile agent based on ant colony algorithm (ACA) is presented to implement P2P information retrieval. In order to evaluate and validate the model, we built a simulated P2P prototype consisting of a network of peer nodes; mobile agent migrating in the network, making peer nodes communication with each other. The results show some advantages of the proposed approach for the P2P distributed information sharing based on mobile agent.", "paper_title": "A new migration algorithm of mobile agent based on ant colony algorithm in P2P network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500014"}
