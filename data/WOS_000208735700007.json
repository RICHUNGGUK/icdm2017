The aim of the study was to optimise the number of beds available in order to minimise cancellations of Elective surgery and maintain an acceptable level of bed-occupancy. The CCU is where critically ill patients are cared for and often requires one-to-one nursing care. The discrete event simulation model, built in Visual Basic for Applications for Excel, seeks to simulate the bed-occupancy of the CCU as well as monitoring any cancellations of Elective surgery. Several 'what-if' scenarios are run including increasing bed numbers, 'ring-fencing' beds for Elective patients, reducing length of stay to account for delayed discharge and changing the scheduling of Elective surgery, and the results are reported.", "paper_title": "A simulation model of bed-occupancy in a critical care unit", "paper_id": "WOS:000208735700007"}
