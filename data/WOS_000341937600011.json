This problem leads to large memory requirement for saving and processing data, and the time complexity for training algorithms. The purpose of the paper is to reduce the volume of training part of a data set - in order to increase the system speed, without any significant decrease in system accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - A new technique for data set size reduction - using a version of modified frequency diagram approach - is presented. In order to reduce processing time, the proposed method compares the samples of a class to other samples in the same class, instead of comparing samples from different classes. It only removes patterns that are similar to the generated class template in each class. To achieve this aim, no feature extraction operation was carried out, in order to produce more precise assessment on the proposed data size reduction technique. Findings - The results from the experiments, and according to one of the biggest handwritten numeral standard optical character recognition (OCR) data sets, Hoda, show a 14.88 percent decrease in data set volume without significant decrease in performance. Practical implications - The proposed technique is effective for size reduction for all pictorial databases such as OCR data sets. Originality/value - State-of-the-art algorithms currently used for data set size reduction usually remove samples near to class's centers, or support vector (SV) samples between different classes. However, the samples near to a class center have valuable information about class characteristics, and they are necessary to build a system model. Also, SV s are important samples to evaluate the system efficiency. The proposed technique, unlike the other available methods, keeps both outlier samples, as well as the samples close to the class centers.", "paper_title": "A new method for Arabic/Farsi numeral data set size reduction via modified frequency diagram matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000341937600011"}
