It is based on a generalization of SDECAY, to include the extended Higgs and neutralino sectors of the NMSSM. Slepton 3-body decays, possibly relevant in the case of a singlino-like lightest supersymmetric particle, have been added. NMSDECAY will be part of the NMSSMTools package, which computes Higgs, sparticle masses and Higgs decays in the NMSSM.
