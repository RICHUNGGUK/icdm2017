We have analyzed the computational complexities and data dependence between different stages of OMP algorithm to design its architecture that provides higher throughput with less area consumption. Since the solution of least square problem involves a large part of the overall computation time, we have suggested a parallel low-complexity architecture for the solution of the linear system. We have further modeled the proposed design using Simulink and carried out the implementation on FPGA using Xilinx system generator tool. We have presented here a methodology to optimize both area and execution time in Simulink environment. The execution time of the proposed design is reduced by maximizing parallelism by appropriate level of unfolding, while the FPGA resources are reduced by sharing the hardware for matrix-vector multiplication across the data-dependent sections of the algorithm. The hardware implementation on the Virtex6 FPGA provides significantly superior performance in terms of resource utilization measured in the number of occupied slices, and maximum usable frequency compared with the existing implementations. Compared with the existing similar design, the proposed structure involves 328 more DSP48s, but it involves 25 802 less slices and 1.85 times less computation time for signal reconstruction with N = 1024, K = 256, and m = 36, where N is the number of samples, K is the size of the measurement vector, and m is the sparsity. It also provides a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio value of 38.9 dB with a reconstruction time of 0.34 mu s, which is twice faster than the existing design. In addition, we have presented a performance metric to implement the OMP algorithm in resource constrained FPGA for the better quality of signal reconstruction.", "paper_title": "FPGA Implementation of Orthogonal Matching Pursuit for Compressive Sensing Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208500021"}
