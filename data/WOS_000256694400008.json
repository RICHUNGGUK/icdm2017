It is well-known that the intake swirl is one of the major disturbance parameters in engine/intake compatibility. In this study, a numerical simulation is conducted for the F-5E intake in order to study the swirl flow under subsonic speed. Both bulk and twin swirl components of the intake at the angles of attack (AOAs) and the angles of sideslip (AOSSs) with subsonic speed are investigated. The relevance of swirl flow and the possibility of engine surge are also discussed. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
