Such designs minimize the maximum mean squared error of the predicted values, with the maximum taken over a class of departures from the fitted response function. One purpose of the study is to determine if, and how, the designs change in response to the robust methods of estimation as compared to classical least squares estimation. To this end, numerous examples are presented and discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
