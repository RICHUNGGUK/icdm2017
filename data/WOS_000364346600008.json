A back-calculation and tracking anti-windup scheme is proposed in order to prevent the zero error integrator wind-up in the structures of state feedback fuzzy controllers and sliding mode controllers. The state feedback sliding mode controllers are based on the state feedback-based computation of the switching variable. An example that copes with the position control of an electro-hydraulic servo-system is presented. The conclusions are pointed out on the basis of digital simulation results for the state feedback fuzzy controller.", "paper_title": "A Unified Anti-Windup Technique for Fuzzy and Sliding Mode Controllers", "paper_id": "WOS:000364346600008"}
