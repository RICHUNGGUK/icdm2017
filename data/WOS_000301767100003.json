By taking into account the dynamic range of the time-varying channel coefficients, the quantization level is adjusted to suit the observed instantaneous link quality, i.e., the decoder wordlength is adjusted to maintain efficient throughput requirements and low power dissipation. A dynamic voltage scaling is applied with a variable wordlength to significantly reduce power consumption in the soft-decision Viterbi decoder. Unlike the conventional 8-bit fixed-wordlength decoder, our radix-4 Viterbi decoder can reduce power consumption by up to 35% under AWGN and multipath fading channel conditions.
