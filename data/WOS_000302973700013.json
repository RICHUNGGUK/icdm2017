Identifying the source and manufacturer of these illicit drugs will help deter drug-related crimes. We have developed an automatic system, called Pill-ID to match drug pill images based on several features (i.e., imprint, color, and shape) of the tablet. The color and shape information is encoded as a three-dimensional histogram and invariant moments, respectively. The imprint on the pill is encoded as feature vectors derived from SIFT and MLBP descriptors. Experimental results using a database of drug pill images (1029 illicit drug pill images and 14,002 legal drug pill images) show 73.04% (84.47%) rank-1 (rank-20) retrieval accuracy.
