In this work, we compare performance and architectural efficiency of Graphics Processing Units (CPUs) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) for two algorithms taken from a novel medical imaging method named 3D ultrasound computer tomography. From the 40 nm and 28 nm generations, we use topnotch devices and those with similar power consumption values. For our two benchmark algorithms from the signal processing and imaging domain, the results show that if power consumption is not considered, the GPU and FPGA from the 40nm generation give both, a similar performance and efficiency per transistor. In the 28 nm process, in contrast, the FPGA is superior to its CPU counterpart by 86% and 39%, depending on the algorithm. If power is limited, FPGAs outperform GPUs in each investigated case by at least a factor of four. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
