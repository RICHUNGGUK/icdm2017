We show that for a finite alphabet A of size at least 2 and positive integers k and m, the generic A-generated k-relation monoid and semigroup (defined using any of several stratifications) satisfies the small overlap condition C(m). It follows that the generic finitely presented monoid has a number of interesting semigroup-theoretic properties and, by a recent result of the author, admits a linear time solution to its word problem and a regular language of unique normal forms for its elements. Moreover, the uniform word problem for finitely presented monoids is generically solvable in polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Generic Complexity of Finitely Presented Monoids and Semigroups", "paper_id": "WOS:000290276600002"}
