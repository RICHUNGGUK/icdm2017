A simple formula to calculate genus of DNA cages is presented here. The formula connects some topological properties of DNA cages, including component number mu, crossing number c and Seifert circle number s. It shows that no matter the way of DNA strands interlinked, the genus is a constant which only depends on the component number of the underlying polyhedral graph. Our study demonstrates that, the genus is an essential topological aspect of DNA polyhedra, which provides a novel classification and a design principle for DNA cages.", "paper_title": "Topological Aspect of DNA Cages: Genus", "paper_id": "WOS:000343077300008"}
