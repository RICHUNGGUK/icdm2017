Design/methodology/approach - This extension is achieved using the descriptive validation of a software project structural organisation based on the information that was obtained from the ICT sector set of companies in Castilla y Leon. Findings - The main conclusion of the study indicates deficiencies in the proactive environmental control of the software project. To overcome these shortcomings at least partially, the author proposes the use of integrated dynamic simulation models and Team Syntegrity. Finally, the analysis provides a detailed reference to diagnose or design a software project organisational structure with viability-defined characteristics. Such reference can be adapted to different fields by extrapolating its application in favour of the VSM universality. Originality/value - The originality is based on the VSM application in software projects organisation. The value is based on VSM formalisation and practical application, to overcome the criticism about its abstract nature.", "paper_title": "Extending the viable system model scope on ICT-sector software projects in Castilla y Leon", "paper_id": "WOS:000332133600004"}
