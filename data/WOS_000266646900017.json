Survivable routing in multidomain networks is a challenging algorithmic problem because it requires choosing links that provide adequate protection both between domains and within domains that may offer different protection services. To satisfy the survivability requirements of different domains, DDP considers differentiated protection schemes, i.e., dedicated protection, shared protection, or no protection in different domains. In order to respect the principle of transparent management in multiple domains, DDP abstracts a multi-domain optical network to a virtual topology graph (VTG) for solving routing between domains. Simulation results show that DDP, unlike traditional schemes, can provide trade-off between protection methods and also allows better resource utilization. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
