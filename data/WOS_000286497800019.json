Based on the properties of the cross product, the volume variance index (VVI) is proposed to be used in extracting automatically the endmembers of the hypherspectral imagery which eliminates the shortcoming of the traditional method of using simplex only where the extraction results were easily impacted by the abnormal pixels. A case study of endmembers extraction experiment using the VVI method with the AVIRIS data for Cuprite has shown a very good result.", "paper_title": "Matrix calculation of high-dimensional cross product and its application in automatic recognition of the endmembers of hyperspectral imagary", "paper_id": "WOS:000286497800019"}
