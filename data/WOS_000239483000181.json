A novel approach is proposed for STLF by combining mutual information (MI) and ANN. The MI theory is first briefly introduced and employed to perform input selection and determine the initial weights of ANN. Then ANN module is trained using historical daily load and weather data selected to perform the final forecast. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, short-term load forecasting was performed on the Hang Zhou Electric Power Company in China, and the testing results show that the proposed model is feasible and promising for load forecasting.", "paper_title": "Short-term load forecasting based on mutual information and artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000181"}
