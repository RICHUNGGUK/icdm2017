We present a standard independent framework to enable exchange of information relevant for coexistence based on two mechanisms: centralized and distributed. Both mechanisms introduce the use of multiradio cluster-head equipment (CHE) as a physical entity that acquires relevant information, identifies coexistence opportunities, and implements autonomous coexistence decisions. The major conceptual difference between them lies in the fact that the centralized mechanism utilizes coexistence database(s) as a repository for coexistence related information, where CHEs need to access before making coexistence decisions. On the other hand, the distributed mechanism utilizes a broadcast channel to distribute beacons and directly convey coexistence information between CHEs. Furthermore, we give a concise overview of the current activities in international standardization bodies toward the realization of communications in TVWS along with measures taken to provide coexistence between secondary cognitive networks.", "paper_title": "ENABLING COEXISTENCE OF MULTIPLE COGNITIVE NETWORKS IN TV WHITE SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000294544000006"}
