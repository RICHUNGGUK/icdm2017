This paper is an introduction to reaction systems. It provides basic notions together with the underlying intuition and motivation as well as two examples (a binary counter and transition systems) of \"programming\" with reaction systems. It also provides a tour of some research themes.", "paper_title": "A TOUR OF REACTION SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000297580200002"}
