Here, we show that consideration of Galilean invariance in fluid-solid interfacial dynamics can greatly enhance the computational accuracy and robustness in a numerical simulation. Surprisingly, simulations are so vastly improved that the force fluctuation is very small and a time average becomes unnecessary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
