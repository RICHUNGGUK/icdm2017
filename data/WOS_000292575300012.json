The manufacturing processes associated with the CFMS are complicated with each operation being possibly done by several machining centers. The co-simulator design approach is built upon the theory of dynamic meta-model based supervisory control with the cooperation of its own embedded intelligent blocks. The system is implemented by coupling of the centralized simulation controller (CSC) and real-time simulator for enforcing dynamic strategies of shop floor control. The posteriori adaptive co-simulator is equipped with a concurrent bilateral mechanism for simulation optimization based on appropriate control rules enhancing performance criteria simulation efficiency. A working intelligent adaptive controller prototype (iCoSim-FMS) has been developed to validate the proposed approach and compare its performance with well known FMS heuristic methods.
