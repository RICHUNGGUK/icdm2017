While off-line computation and pre-baking can be acceptable for some cases, many applications (games, simulators, etc.) require real-time or interactive approaches to evaluate indirect illumination. We present a novel algorithm to compute indirect lighting in real-time that avoids costly precomputation steps and is not restricted to low-frequency illumination. It is based on a hierarchical voxel octree representation generated and updated on the fly from a regular scene mesh coupled with an approximate voxel cone tracing that allows for a fast estimation of the visibility and incoming energy. Our approach can manage two light bounces for both Lambertian and glossy materials at interactive framerates (25-70FPS). It exhibits an almost scene-independent performance and can handle complex scenes with dynamic content thanks to an interactive octree-voxelization scheme. In addition, we demonstrate that our voxel cone tracing can be used to efficiently estimate Ambient Occlusion.", "paper_title": "Interactive Indirect Illumination Using Voxel Cone Tracing", "paper_id": "WOS:000296915400007"}
