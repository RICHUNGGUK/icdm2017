HSO processes objectives instead of points, an idea that has been considered before but that has never been properly evaluated in the literature. We show that both previously studied exact hypervolume algorithms are exponential in at least the number of objectives and that although HSO is also exponential in the number of objectives in the worst case, it runs in significantly less time, i.e., two to three orders of magnitude less for randomly generated and benchmark data in three to eight objectives. Thus, HSO increases the utility of hypervolume, both as a metric for general optimization algorithms and as a diversity mechanism for evolutionary algorithms.", "paper_title": "A faster algorithm for calculating hypervolume", "paper_id": "WOS:000235725500003"}
