The low-power LC VCO and LNA circuits are stacked and share the same bias current. An LC filter is used between the LNA and the VCO to improve the isolation between the two functions. Based on the measurement results of the proof-of-concept prototype, the LNA achieves a gain of 18.4 dB and a noise figure (NF) of 3.8 dB at 2.4 GHz. The VCO has a center frequency of 2.45 GHz with a -5.3 dBm output power and a phase noise of -119 dBc/Hz at 1-MHz offset. The combined LNA-VCO block consumes 240 A mu W from a 0.8 V supply.", "paper_title": "A low-power 2.4-GHz combined LNA-VCO structure in 0.13-A mu m CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000345842200013"}
