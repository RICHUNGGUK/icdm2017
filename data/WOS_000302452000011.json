Consequently, it is becoming increasingly complex to select a service provider for a user as a result of their various economic and social attributes. In this paper, we state the problem of how to find the appropriate services with satisfying the users' multiple QoS requirements. We consider the service's response time, trust degree and monetary cost. And inspired from the mode of Web search engine, such as Yahoo, Google, we propose an innovative service selection algorithm for SOA systems. The algorithm can recommend a number of suitable services based on the user's QoS requirements. Compared with the existing scheduling algorithms, our solution is much more flexible in supporting the multiple objectives and user personalization. We study the scalability of the algorithm with different numbers of jobs, service providers and QoS criteria. And we find that it can capture user's preferences value in less than six times of job submissions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
