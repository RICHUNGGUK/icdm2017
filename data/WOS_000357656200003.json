Specifically, EMC3 incorporates novel pace control and decision making mechanisms for task assignment, leveraging participants' current call, historical call records as well as predicted future calls and mobility, in order to ensure the expected number of participants to return sensed results and fully cover the target area, with the objective of assigning a minimal number of tasks. Extensive evaluation with a large-scale real-world dataset shows that EMC3 assigns much less sensing tasks compared to baseline approaches, it can save 43%-68% energy in data transfer compared to the traditional 3G-based scheme.", "paper_title": "EMC3: Energy-Efficient Data Transfer in Mobile Crowdsensing under Full Coverage Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000357656200003"}
