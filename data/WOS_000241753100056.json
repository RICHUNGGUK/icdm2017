Considering human auditory perception and varieties of disturbances, instead of the frequency differences, wavelet modulation scales are adopted to reflect the dynamic features of speech in ASR. Experiments for the Chinese digit-string recognition show extracting the wavelet modulation scales as the dynamic features have good performance both in additional noises and convolutional noises environment.", "paper_title": "Speech feature extraction based on wavelet modulation scale for robust speech recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100056"}
