With the quantifier guided aggregation method of OWA operators and the generating function representation of regular increasing monotone (RIM) quantifiers, a parameterized RIM quantifier family with the maximum entropy principle is proposed. This quantifier family can be regarded as the continuous case of the commonly used maximum entropy OWA (MEOWA) operator. Like the MEOWA operator, the RIM quantifier with maximum entropy generating function also possesses some interesting properties. One of them is that the aggregation value for any aggregated set always monotonically increases with the orness level. This can be used to represent the decision maker's preference information, but with free dimension.", "paper_title": "On the properties of regular increasing monotone (RIM) quantifiers with maximum entropy", "paper_id": "WOS:000254131300002"}
