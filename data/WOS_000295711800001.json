It also proposes the concept of belonging as a three-dimensional construct. Design/methodology/approach - The paper proposes that belonging to a virtual community has positive effects on consumer satisfaction, affective commitment and word-of-mouth behaviour. After validation of the measurement scales the hypotheses are contrasted through modelling. Findings - The data show that belonging to a virtual community may enhance consumer satisfaction, affective commitment and word-of-mouth advertising towards the brand around which the community is developed. In addition, the paper introduces a third dimension to the construct of belonging, called non-participative belonging. Active participative belonging influences the level of satisfaction and affective commitment more positively than passive and non-participative belonging. Research limitations/implications - Data were obtained through surveys, web surveys and online interviews. There were also limitations of sample size and sampling procedure. Practical implications Managers may enhance consumer satisfaction, affective commitment and word-of-mouth advertising by developing virtual brand communities and promoting consumers' participation in them. Originality/value - Previous works that have focused on virtual brand communities have never concentrated on virtual brand communities within Facebook. In addition, prior to this study, belonging to a virtual brand community was a two-dimensional construct: active and passive participative belonging. The paper identifies a third dimension as non-participative belonging. Thus this paper offers new areas for future research.", "paper_title": "The influence of belonging to virtual brand communities on consumers' affective commitment, satisfaction and word-of-mouth advertising The ZARA case", "paper_id": "WOS:000295711800001"}
