We show that any recurrent almost Theta-rich word u is an image of a recurrent Theta'-rich word under a suitable morphism, where Theta' is also an involutive antimorphism. Moreover, if the word u is uniformly recurrent, we show that Theta' can be set to the reversal mapping. We also treat one special case of almost Theta-rich words: we show that every Theta-standard word with seed is an image of an Arnoux-Rauzy word.", "paper_title": "ALMOST RICH WORDS AS MORPHIC IMAGES OF RICH WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000007"}
