For the ZC, the optimal code structure for an arbitrary finite blocklength is derived in the cases of two, three, and four codewords and conjectured in the case of five codewords. For the BSC, the optimal code structure for an arbitrary finite blocklength is derived in the cases of two and three codewords and conjectured in the case of four codewords. For a general BAC, the best codebooks under the assumption of a threshold decoder are derived for the case of two codewords. The derivation of these optimal codes relies on a new approach of constructing and analyzing the codebook matrix not rowwise (codewords), but columnwise. This new tool leads to an elegant definition of interesting code families that is recursive in the blocklength and admits their exact analysis of error performance. This allows for a comparison of the average error probability between all possible codebooks.", "paper_title": "Optimal Ultrasmall Block-Codes for Binary Discrete Memoryless Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100026"}
