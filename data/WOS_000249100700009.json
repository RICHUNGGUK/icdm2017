Employing a new mathematical model, namely the processor-sharing system, steady-state throughput ratio and average delay of OCDMA networks are calculated. The results reveal that our protocol outperforms other existing protocols. Meanwhile, we investigate the performance of OCDMA networks by altering the code parameters, i.e., length and weight, and the maximum number of active users in the system, corresponding results are indeed consistent with the practical situation. In addition, the analysis is simplified compared with the conventional Markov chain model. Thus the processor-sharing system is truly applicable to model OCDMA networks.", "paper_title": "Performance analysis of a new random access protocol for OCDMA networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249100700009"}
