In addition, each label l is an element of N to which at least one edge is mapped has a non-negative cost c(e). The minimum label spanning tree problem (MinLST) asks to find a spanning tree in G that minimizes the overall cost of the labels used by its edges. Equivalently, we aim at finding a minimum cost subset of labels 19 N such that the edge set {e is an element of E : L(e) is an element of I} forms a connected subgraph spanning all vertices. Similarly, in the minimum label s-t path problem (MinLP) the goal is to identify an s-t path minimizing the combined cost of its labels, where s and t are provided as part of the input. The main contributions of this paper are improved approximation algorithms and hardness results for MinLST and MinLP. As a secondary objective, we make a concentrated effort to relate the algorithmic methods utilized in approximating these problems to a number of well-known techniques, originally studied in the context of integer covering.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithms and hardness results for labeled connectivity problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700042"}
