Under reasonable assumptions, Type-2 computability of these functions is characterized as sequential computability and the effective continuity. We investigate effective uniform topological spaces with a separating set, and adapt the above result under some assumptions. It is also proved that effective local uniform continuity implies effective continuity under the same assumptions. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
