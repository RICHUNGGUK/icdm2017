However, this strategy has been justified until now only by means of intuitive ideas. In this note we present, for the first time, a formal stability analysis, which takes into account the electric dynamics, justifying use of such a control strategy.", "paper_title": "CURRENT LOOPS IN A MAGNETIC LEVITATION SYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000266024700013"}
