This problem is known to be PSPACE-complete for bipartite planar graphs. In this paper, we first show that the problem remains PSPACE-complete even for bipartite series-parallel graphs, which form a proper subclass of bipartite planar graphs. We note that our reduction indeed shows the PSPACE-completeness for graphs with pathwidth two, and it can be extended for threshold graphs. In contrast, we give a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the problem for graphs with pathwidth one. Thus, this paper gives sharp analyses of the problem with respect to pathwidth.", "paper_title": "The List Coloring Reconfiguration Problem for Bounded Pathwidth Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466600005"}
