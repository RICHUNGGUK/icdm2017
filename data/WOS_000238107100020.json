In this paper, we present the design of distributed monitoring and performance analysis services in the K-WfGrid project. We give an overview of the architecture of the performance and monitoring services and discuss useful performance and dependability metrics for workflows in K-WfGrid. We describe basic system components including the monitoring and instrumentation service, the performance analysis service along with data representation and service interface.", "paper_title": "Towards distributed monitoring and performance analysis services in the K-WfGrid project", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107100020"}
