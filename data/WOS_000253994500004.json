The management of devices can benefit services enabling and improve user experience. This paper presents the device management issues in the IMS. Requirements of device management are presented and a management architecture is proposed to satisfy the requirements. The architecture utilizes distributed design by separating management and executing functionalities and provides service provisioning and tracing functionalities to application servers utilizing some IMS capabilities. Some approaches to integrate more IMS capabilities in device management architecture are discussed. A possible evaluation model for quality of device management from the perspective of user and management authority is proposed.", "paper_title": "Device management in the IMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000253994500004"}
