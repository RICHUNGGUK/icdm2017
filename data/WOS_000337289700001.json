One of the main challenges in deriving a schedulability test for global FP scheduling is identifying the worst-case runtime behavior, i.e., the critical instant, at which the release of a job suffers the maximum interference from the jobs of its higher priority tasks. Unfortunately, the critical instant is not yet known for sporadic tasks under global FP scheduling. To overcome this limitation, pessimism is introduced during the schedulability analysis to safely approximate the worst-case. The endeavor in this paper is to reduce such pessimism by proposing three new schedulability tests for global FP scheduling. Another challenge for global FP scheduling is the problem of assigning the fixed priorities to the tasks because no efficient method to find the optimal priority ordering in such case is currently known. Each of the schedulability tests proposed in this paper can be used to determine the priority of each task based on Audsley's approach. It is shown that the proposed tests not only theoretically dominate but also empirically perform better than the state-of-the-art schedulability test for global FP scheduling of sporadic tasks.", "paper_title": "Interference-aware fixed-priority schedulability analysis on multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000337289700001"}
