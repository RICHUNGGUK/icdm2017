This mapping enables one to reduce the path tracking task tor mobile robots to straight line tracking. Due to the simplicity of the transformation, closed form Solutions for the direct and inverse mapping are presented. Furthermore. the transformation also defines,,I feedback equivalence relation between the original and the transformed system equations of the mobile robot. It is shown that the form of the system equations is preserved and that (he transformation essentially maps a car-like robot in the original domain. to a car-like robot in the transformed domain. This enables one to use straight line trackers developed solely for this system, for the tracking of arbitrary strictly monotone polygonal curves. Finally, it is shown that the use of this mapping can also simplify the path tracking controllers since they on]), need to track straight line paths. In general, one can eliminate from application of existing the existing path controllers all parameters that are needed for non-straight paths, thus obtaining respective simplified controllers. For example. it is shown that a fuzzy path controller with 135 rules can be reduced to in equivalent fuzzy straight line tracking, controller with 45 rules. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
