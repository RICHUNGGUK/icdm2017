Due to the lack of a systematic framework and supporting system between engineers and related manufacturing information resources, many simulation engineers have actually wasted time and cost with redundant tasks for simulation. A P3R-driven modeling and simulation system in PLM is suggested and implemented in this paper. For this purpose, a P3R data structure is defined for simulation-model generation, and a middleware application is developed based on the P3R object-oriented model. Finally, a concurrent material flow analysis system is developed and applied for area and flow analysis. As a case study, the developed methodology and systems of P3R-driven modeling and simulation are practically applied to automotive press shops. Based on the results, the proposed methodology and systems in this paper are very useful in terms of reducing time and cost in material flow analysis via simulations. Also, it is possible to perform more effective engineering tasks such as simulation for material flow analysis via integrated environment, because relevant data for simulation can be extracted from PLM system automatically and that data is compatible with actual or planned shop floor. This will lead to seamless implementation of manufacturing engineering processes with more effective decision making processes. Furthermore, concurrent material flow analysis is possible from the early stages of product development and production. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
