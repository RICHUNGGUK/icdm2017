Existing PSO techniques, however, still contain some significant disadvantages. In this paper, we present a new QBL-PSO algorithm that uses QBL (query-based learning) to improve both the exploratory and exploitable capabilities of PSO. Here, we apply a QBL method proposed in our previous research to PSO, and then test this new algorithm on a real case study on problems of power conservation. Our algorithm not only broadens the search diversity of PSO, but also improves its precision. Conventional PSO often snag on local solutions when performing queries, instead of finding better global solutions. To resolve this limitation, when particles converge in nature, we direct some of them into an \"ambiguous solution space\" defined by our algorithm. This paper introduces two ways to invoke this QBL algorithm. Our experimental results confirm that the proposed method attains better convergence to the global best solution. Finally, we present a new PSO model for solving multi-objective power conservation problems. Overall, this model successfully reduces power consumption, and to our knowledge, this paper represents the first attempt within the literature to apply the QBL concept to PSO. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
