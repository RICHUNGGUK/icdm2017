Physical SANs are complex and costly infrastructures that require significant space. Both the cost and size are serious difficulties in setting up labs for teaching SANs. The lab approach presented in this article solves both problems by using computer virtualization, as well as software tools to emulate storage systems, so that lab activities can be carried out in a single physical computer. The article discusses the selection of a virtualization platform suitable for the teaching of SANs. Using the selected platform (the Hyper-V hypervisor), a set of learning modules is designed. These modules teach students fundamental concepts and skills about SAN architecture, configuration and operation. The article provides brief descriptions of the modules. Then, the configuration schema of the practice platform used to support the SAN lab is explained. This configuration schema is designed for the cohabitation of multiple hypervisors (required to support the SAN lab activities) and a client operating system in the same physical computer. Thus, the SAN lab can be taught in a general purpose computer laboratory and coexist with other courses in the same physical lab. The proposed approach has been successfully implemented and verified by teaching the SAN lab in the context of an information technology degree in 2013 and 2014.
