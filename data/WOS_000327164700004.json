Learning is often utilized by multi-agent systems which can deal with complex problems by means of their decentralized approach. With a number of learning methods available, a need for their comparison arises. This is why we designed and implemented new multidimensional Farmer Pest problem domain, which is suitable for benchmarking learning algorithms. This paper presents comparison results for reinforcement learning (SARSA) and supervised learning (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and Ripper). These algorithms are tested on configurations with various complexity with not delayed rewards. The results show that algorithm performances depend highly on the environment configuration and various conditions favor different learning algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
