A method is presented here that achieves synchronization implicitly through the use of a discrete Fourier transform in combination with the computation of an effective admittance. It is shown that the method is suitable for systems with high frequency variability as well as for systems with nonideal supply voltage including heavy voltage asymmetry.", "paper_title": "Digital Control Method for Grid-Connected Converters Supplied With Nonideal Voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000336668600014"}
