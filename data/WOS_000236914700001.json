We will find the orbits of the point stabilizer in each case and in the case of D(2(q-1)) we will prove there is an orbit Delta of the point stabilizer G(omega), such that Delta not equal {omega} and whose orbiting under G gives a 1-design with the automorphism group isomorphic to the symmetric group S(q+1).", "paper_title": "Designs from the group PSL(2)(q), q even", "paper_id": "WOS:000236914700001"}
