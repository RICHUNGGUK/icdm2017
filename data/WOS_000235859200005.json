Comparison relies on matching surface graphs, extracted from the surfaces by considering concave and convex patches, through a kernelized version of the Softassign graph-matching algorithm. On the other hand, classification is performed by clustering the surface graphs with ail EM-like algorithm, also relying on kernelized Softassign, and then calculating the distance of an input surface graph to the closest prototype. We present experiments showing the Suitability of kernelized Softassign for both comparing and classifying surface graphs. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
