However, this requires a user to provide an image to the system. It is easier for a user to query the CBIR system using search terms which requires the image content to be described by semantic labels. However, finding a relationship between the image features and semantic labels is a challenging problem to solve. This paper aims to discover semantic labels for facial features for use in a face image retrieval system. Face image retrieval traditionally uses global face-image information to determine similarity between images. However little has been done in the field of face image retrieval to use local face-features and semantic labelling. Our work aims to develop a clustering method for the discovery of semantic labels of face-features. We also present a machine learning based face-feature localization mechanism which we show has promise in providing accurate localization.", "paper_title": "Automatic localization and annotation of facial features using machine learning techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000290768000017"}
