There are two kinds of beads used in this construction. Each column element has three higher beads with a weight of four and three lower beads with a weight of one. The proposed 32-bit adder contains eight column elements. The construction was simulated by the technology of TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Layout was also made by the same technology. The maximum delay of the 32-bit abacus adder is 0.91 ns and 14% less than that of Carry Look-ahead Adders for 0.18 mu m technology. The power consumption of the abacus adder is 3.1 mW and 28% less than that of Carry Look-ahead Adders for 0.18 mu m technology. Recent researches are compared with the proposed adder. The construction was also simulated by Predictive Technology Model. The PTM results also presented. The use of Chinese abacus approach offers a competitive technique with respect to other adders.
