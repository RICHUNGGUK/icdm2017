This settles the last open case of a conjecture by Haggkvist. Using this result, we also show that there is a constant rho, such that, for any positive integer n, if each cell in an n x n array B is assigned a set of m <= rho n symbols, where each set is chosen independently and uniformly at random from {1, ... , n}, then the probability that B is avoidable tends to 1 as n -> infinity.", "paper_title": "Avoiding Arrays of Odd Order by Latin Squares", "paper_id": "WOS:000314296400002"}
