Finding such a controller is known to be computationally intractable by the conventional techniques. Therefore, to solve this design problem easily and directly, we utilize a moving boundary process together with a robust stability test, for finding a solution to the corresponding feasibility problem. Some design examples are presented to illustrate the main points introduced in this paper.", "paper_title": "Robust Design of Fuzzy Structured Controllers via a Moving Boundaries Process", "paper_id": "WOS:000358213100019"}
