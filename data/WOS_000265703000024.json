In this paper, we propose a robust approach to extracting the salient region based on bottom-up visual attention. The main contributions are twofold: 1) Instead of the feature parallel integration, the proposed saliencies are derived by serial processing between texture and color features. Hence, the proposed approach intrinsically provides an alternative methodology to model attention with low implementation complexity. 2) A constructive approach is proposed for rendering an image by a non-linear intensity mapping, which can efficiently eliminate high contrast noise regions in the image. And then the salient map can be robustly generated for a variety of nature images. Experiments show that the proposed algorithm is effective and can characterize the human perception well.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Non-linear Intensity Mapping Based Salient Region Extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000265703000024"}
