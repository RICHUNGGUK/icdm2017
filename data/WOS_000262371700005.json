Beyond message design, realistic delivery models are needed for delivering information to a traditionally hard-to-reach audience. This study investigated two e-health interventions to provide health information on mobile devices - one providing diabetes information and one offering childcare information. Both were well-received, and most of the subjects' usability issues related to the translation of these interventions to the mobile device's smaller screen. The diabetes website was effective in providing information to study participants m as measured by pre- and posts tests of knowledge) while the childcare website was not. Continued work in this area could explore improved design strategies for mobile devices - a delivery model that could be used in doctors' offices, for example. Effective delivery of health information to low health literate audiences is an important issuer and this research highlights a critical element by targeting another potential delivery model.", "paper_title": "Patient education on mobile devices: an e-health intervention for low health literate audiences", "paper_id": "WOS:000262371700005"}
