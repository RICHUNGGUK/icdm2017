Such opinions can be represented by fuzzy numbers such as positive trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. Several aggregation methods have been proposed previously; however, there are still deficits which limit their applications. This paper proposes an aggregation method based on centroid measurement which aims to overcome some of the shortcomings. In the paper, a number of axioms are proposed. A numerical example is given at the end to illustrate the application of the proposed aggregation method.", "paper_title": "A fuzzy aggregation approach to group decision-making based on centroid measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241201000007"}
