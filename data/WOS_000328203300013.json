Due to the dynamical network topology, designing an efficient node compromise attack algorithm is challenging, because it is difficult to model the attack or to enhance the attacking efficiency. In this paper, a general algorithm for modeling the node compromise attack in VANET is proposed, which promotes the attacking efficiency by destroying the network backbone. The backbone is constructed using the connected dominating set of the network, which has relevant to the intermeeting time between the vehicles. Then two attacking algorithms are proposed based on the general model, which destroy the network in a centralized and distributed version while maximizing the destructiveness. Simulations are conducted to show the advantages of our scheme. Simulation results reveal that our scheme enhances the attacking efficiency in different mobility models and different applications, which is suitable for modeling the node compromise attack in VANET. At last, discussions are presented to the illustrate the influences of the characteristics to the attacking efficiency with respect to vehicle speed, communication range and key sharing probability.", "paper_title": "Enhancing Efficiency of Node Compromise Attacks in Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks Using Connected Dominating Set", "paper_id": "WOS:000328203300013"}
