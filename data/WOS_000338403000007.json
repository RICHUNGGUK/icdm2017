Computed Tomography (CT) scanning is of particular interest because it can identify the locations and sizes of internal quality-controlling features such as knots, heartwood/sapwood extent, rot, cracks and holes. Conventional CT scanning is based on medical-style equipment, which needs to have very high spatial and density resolution. This need sets very high requirements on the measurement resolution and accuracy, and substantially increases equipment complexity and cost. These features make such equipment unsuited for typical sawmill applications. However, for log scanning applications, high spatial and density resolution and measurement accuracy are not needed because most targeted internal features are fairly large and have specific geometrical shapes. Based on this thought, this paper proposes a novel geometry-based CT reconstruction approach and corresponding density reconstruction algorithms. A prototype CT scanner was built and the CT reconstructions were determined by processing the measured data using the proposed density reconstruction approach. The results obtained compare well with the results computed from conventional CT reconstruction. The good comparison gives confidence in the usefulness and applicability of the proposed CT approach for industrial use in sawmills for log scanning. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
