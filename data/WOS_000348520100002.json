The randomly occurring actuator failure, which describes the phenomenon of the actuator failure appearing in a random way, is modelled by a Bernoulli distributed white sequence with a known conditional probability. The fading performance output is characterized by a random variable obeying any discrete-time probability distribution over a known interval. The main purpose is to design a reliable controller over a given finite horizon such that, an optimized upper bound of the predefined quadratic performance index is guaranteed for the addressed systems in the presence of both the randomly occurring actuator failures and the fading performance output. It is shown that the desired controller gain can be obtained in terms of the solution to a Riccati-like difference equation. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.", "paper_title": "Reliable guaranteed-cost control for networked systems with randomly occurring actuator failures and fading performance output", "paper_id": "WOS:000348520100002"}
