A polarlike or pseudopolar format grid is introduced to sample data close to the resolution, which presents the design of a separable kernel for efficient FFT implementation. The proposed imaging algorithm formulates the reflectivity image of the target scene as an interpolation-free double image series expansion with two usual approximation-induced phase error terms being taken into account, whereby more generalized application scenarios with high frequency, large bandwidth or larger aperture length for imaging a target scene located within either the far-field or the near-field of the radar aperture are processable with high accuracy. In addition, convergence acceleration methods in computational mathematics are introduced to accelerate the convergence of the image series expansion, so as to make the algorithm more efficient. The proposed algorithm has been validated both qualitatively and quantitatively with an extensive collection of numerical simulations and field measurements of ground-based SAR (GB-SAR) data set.", "paper_title": "Generalized pseudopolar format algorithm for radar imaging with highly suboptimal aperture length", "paper_id": "WOS:000353817800005"}
