In recent studies we have systematically shown that the freezing properties of flexible, elastic polymers depend on the precise chain length. Performing multicanonical Monte Carlo simulations, we faced several computational challenges in connection with liquid-solid and solid-solid transitions. For this reason, we developed novel methods and update strategies to overcome the arising problems. We introduce novel Monte Carlo moves and two extensions to the multicanonical method.
