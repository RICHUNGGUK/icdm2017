In this paper, we report that the implementation of the pseudospectral approach can be simplified if power-series expansions are used. There is also an added advantage of an improved computational efficiency. We demonstrate how this approach can be implemented for two-dimensional (2D) models that may include material inhomogeneities. Physically relevant examples, taken from optics, are presented to show that, using collocations at Chebyshev points, the power-series approximation may give very accurate 2D soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger (NLS) equation. To find highly accurate numerical periodic solutions in models including periodic modulations of material parameters, a real-time evolution method (RTEM) is used. A variant of RTEM is applied to a system involving the copropagation of two pulses with different carrier frequencies, that cannot be easily solved by other existing methods. (C) 2011 IMACS.
