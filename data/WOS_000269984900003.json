We prove the analogue of the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem for the random k-uniform hypergraph G(k)(n, P) when k < (n/2)(1/3); that is, we show that with probability tending to 1 as n -> infinity, the maximum size of an intersecting subfamily of G(k)(n, p) is the size of a maximum trivial family. The analogue of the Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem does not hold for all p when k >> n(1/3). We give quite precise results for k < n(1/2-epsilon). For larger k we show that the random Erdos-Ko-Rado theorem holds as long as p is not too small, and fails to hold for a wide range of smaller values of p. Along the way, we prove that every non-trivial intersecting k-uniform hypergraph can be covered by k(2) - k + 1 pairs, which is sharp its evidenced by projective planes. This improves upon a result of Sanders [7]. Several open questions remain.", "paper_title": "Erdos-Ko-Rado in Random Hypergraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000269984900003"}
