In this new model, called learning automata-based adaptive PN (APN-LA), learning automata are used to resolve the conflicts among the transitions. In the proposed APN-LA model, transitions are portioned into several sets of conflicting transitions and each set of conflicting transitions is equipped with a learning automaton which is responsible for controlling the conflicts among transitions in the corresponding transition set. We also generalize the proposed APN-LA to ASPN-LA which is a fusion between LA and stochastic PN (SPN). An application of the proposed ASPN-LA to priority assignment in queuing systems with unknown parameters is also presented.", "paper_title": "Learning Automata-Based Adaptive Petri Net and Its Application to Priority Assignment in Queuing Systems With Unknown Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751100007"}
