We show how to simplify the combinatorial structure of and obtain a 3D polyhedral complex homeomorphic to but with fewer cells. We introduce an algorithm that computes cup products in directly from the combinatorics. The computational method introduced here can be effectively applied to any polyhedral complex embedded in R-3.", "paper_title": "Computing Cup Products in Z(2)-Cohomology of 3D Polyhedral Complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000339419000004"}
