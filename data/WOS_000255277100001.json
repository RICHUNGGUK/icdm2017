This requires an efficient way of managing the encryption keys. In this scenario, time-bound key management schemes for a hierarchy were proposed by Tzeng and Chien in 2002 and 2005, respectively. Both schemes are insecure against collusion attacks. In this paper, we propose a new key assignment scheme for access control, which is both efficient and secure. Elliptic-curve cryptography is deployed in this scheme. We also provide the analysis of the scheme with respect to security and efficiency issues.", "paper_title": "An efficient time-bound hierarchical key management scheme for secure broadcasting", "paper_id": "WOS:000255277100001"}
