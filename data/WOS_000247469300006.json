The existence and global stability for the unique equilibrium of the Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with distributed delays are achieved by using some new Lyapunov functionals, M-matrix theory and some analytic techniques, and some less restrictive conditions are obtained. An example is also worked out to validate the advantages of our results.", "paper_title": "Global exponential stability analysis of delayed Cohen-Grossberg neural networks with distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000247469300006"}
