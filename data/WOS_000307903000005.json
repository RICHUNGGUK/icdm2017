This framework sets the scene for a vision of a smooth evolution of reconfigurability features in mobile devices, paving the way from current, mainly static implementation choices toward a fully flexible device platform environment. For this flexible mobile device framework, baseband interfaces are introduced as they are currently discussed in ETSI reconfigurable radio systems standardization. Furthermore, this technical solution is positioned with respect to security requirements and the basic regulatory framework which is currently under revision in Europe. Indeed, the future revised Radio Equipment and Telecommunications Terminal Equipment Directive is expected to allow for such advanced reconfiguration, enabling users to acquire and install so-called RadioApps software components which may affect the compliance of a mobile device to the essential requirements of the Directive.", "paper_title": "FUTURE OF WIRELESS COMMUNICATION: RADIOAPPS AND RELATED SECURITY AND RADIO COMPUTER FRAMEWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000307903000005"}
