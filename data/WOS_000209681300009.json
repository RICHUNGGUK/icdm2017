In particular, by taking advantage of matrix general inverse algorithms the encoding method of the proposed security codes is derived and is practically implementable due to low complexity. Experiments are conducted to examine the proposed security codes and the security system over Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC).", "paper_title": "Achieving Secure Communications over Wiretap Channels via Security Codes from Resilient Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300009"}
