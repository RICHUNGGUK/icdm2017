We propose a state-dependent control strategy which makes the trajectories of the analyzed system converge to finite cyclic sequences of points. Our method relies on a technique of decomposition of the state space into local regions where the control is uniform. We have implemented the procedure using zonotopes, and applied it successfully to several examples of the literature and industrial case studies in power electronics.", "paper_title": "Finite controlled invariants for sampled switched systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345376100001"}
