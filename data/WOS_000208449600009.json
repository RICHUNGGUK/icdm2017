With the use of such a system, rules can be inserted and extracted into/from WNNs. The rule insertion and extraction problems are described with a detailed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of the rule insertion and extraction algorithms proposed. The process of rule insertion and rule extraction in WNNs is often more natural than in other neural network models.", "paper_title": "On a hybrid weightless neural system", "paper_id": "WOS:000208449600009"}
