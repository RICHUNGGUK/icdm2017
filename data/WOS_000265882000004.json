Our bijection yields an efficient uniform random sampler for 3-connected planar graphs, which turns out to be determinant for the quadratic complexity of the current best-known uniform random sampler for labelled planar graphs. It also provides an encoding for the set P(n) of n-edge 3-connected planar graphs that matches the entropy bound 1/n log(2) vertical bar P(n)vertical bar = 2 + o(1) bits per edge (bpe).This solves a theoretical problem recently raised in mesh compression as these graphs abstract the combinatorial part of meshes with spherical topology. We also achieve the optimal parametric rate 1/n log(2) vertical bar P(n, i, j)vertical bar bpe for graphs of P(n) with i vertices and j faces, matching in particular the optimal rate for triangulations. Our encoding relies on a linear time algorithm to compute an orientation associated with the minimal Schnyder wood of a 3-connected planar map. This algorithm is of independent interest, and it is, for instance, a key ingredient in a recent straight line drawing algorithm for 3-connected planar graphs.", "paper_title": "Dissections, Orientations, and Trees with Applications to Optimal Mesh Encoding and Random Sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000265882000004"}
