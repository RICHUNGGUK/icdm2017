Because of the unbalanced distribution of learners and tutors among member organizations of CRTVU, the cross-organizational sharing of tutor resources is very critical to the success of formative assessment. A global scheduling scheme is designed in LAGrid to solve the above problem, through which a formative assessment task could be globally scheduled to any available tutor so as to allow collaborative work among tutors from different member organizations. Based on the queuing theory, the global scheduling scheme is modeled and analyzed. The implementation of the global scheduling scheme is also discussed in this paper.", "paper_title": "Global scheduling in learning assessment grid", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800016"}
