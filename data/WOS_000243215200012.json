By employing linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) and differential inequalities with delays and impulses, several sufficient conditions are obtained for ensuring the system to be globally exponentially stable. Three illustrative examples are also given at the end of this paper to show the effectiveness of our results. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
