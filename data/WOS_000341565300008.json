Placement restrictions and excessive runtime thermal variations, however, compromise the performance and reliability of the sensor readings. Within this framework, a novel methodology for thermal estimation based on unscented Kalman filter, augmented only with a limited number of temperature sensors at a few selected locations, is proposed. In addition, we extend discontinuous Galerkin finite-element method to include coupling mechanism between neighboring grid cells for accurate thermal profile estimation and introduce a balanced stochastic truncation to find a low-dimensional but accurate approximation of the thermal network over the whole frequency domain. As the experimental results show, the runtime thermal estimation method reduces temperature estimation errors by an order of magnitude.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Thermal Estimation Methodology for High-Performance 3-D MPSoC", "paper_id": "WOS:000341565300008"}
