Time Ser. Anal. 18 (1997), pp. 137-155] where each component yi, t is a fractionally integrated process of order di, i=1, ..., r. Under the conditions outlined in Assumption 1 of this article, the conditional likelihood function of this class of VARFIMA models can be efficiently and exactly calculated with a conditional likelihood Durbin-Levinson (CLDL) algorithm proposed herein. This CLDL algorithm is based on the multivariate Durbin-Levinson algorithm of Whittle [On the fitting of multivariate autoregressions and the approximate canonical factorization of a spectral density matrix, Biometrika 50 (1963), pp. 129-134] and the conditional likelihood principle of Box and Jenkins [Time Series Analysis, Forecasting, and Control, 2nd ed., Holden-Day, San Francisco, CA]. Furthermore, the conditions in the aforementioned Assumption 1 are general enough to include the model considered in Andersen et al. [Modeling and forecasting realized volatility, Econometrica 71 (2003), 579-625] for describing the behaviour of realized volatility and the model studied in Haslett and Raftery [Space-time modelling with long-memory dependence: Assessing Ireland's wind power resource, Appl. Statist. 38 (1989), pp. 1-50] for spatial data as its special cases. As the computational cost of implementing the CLDL algorithm is much lower than that of using the algorithms proposed in Sowell [Maximum likelihood estimation of fractionally integrated time series models, Working paper, Carnegie-Mellon University], we are thus able to conduct a Monte Carlo experiment to investigate the finite sample performance of the CLDL algorithm for the 3-dimensional VARFIMA processes with the sample size of 400. The simulation results are very satisfactory and reveal the great potentials of using the CLDL method for empirical applications.", "paper_title": "Maximum likelihood estimation of stationary multivariate ARFIMA processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000278439300002"}
