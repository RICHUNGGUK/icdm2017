We are interested in the problems related to pieces with differing degrees of dirt. In this direction, we propose and evaluate a maintenance decision problem of maintenance in an engine factory that is specialized in the production, sale and maintenance of medium and slow speed four stroke engines. The main purpose of this paper is to study the problem by means of the analytic hierarchy process to obtain the weights of criteria, and the TOPSIS method as multicriteria decision making to obtain the ranking of alternatives, when the information was given in linguistic terms.", "paper_title": "Multi-criteria analysis for a maintenance management problem in an engine factory: rational choice", "paper_id": "WOS:000296735300012"}
