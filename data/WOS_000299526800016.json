Even though different human skin-color detection solutions have been successfully applied, they are prone to false skin detection and are not able to cope with the variety of human skin colors across different ethnic. Moreover, existing methods require high computational cost. In this paper, we propose a novel human skin detection approach that combines a smoothed 2-D histogram and Gaussian model, for automatic human skin detection in color image(s). In our approach, an eye detector is used to refine the skin model for a specific person. The proposed approach reduces computational costs as no training is required, and it improves the accuracy of skin detection despite wide variation in ethnicity and illumination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to employ fusion strategy for this purpose. Qualitative and quantitative results on three standard public datasets and a comparison with state-of-the-art methods have shown the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "A Fusion Approach for Efficient Human Skin Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000299526800016"}
