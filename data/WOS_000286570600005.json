This paper introduces an unsupervised algorithm to address this problem in symbolically-represented musical melodies. Our algorithm is able to identify transposed patterns including exact matchings, i.e., null transpositions. We have tested our algorithm on a corpus of songs and the results suggest that our approach is promising, specially when dealing with songs that include non-exact repetitions.", "paper_title": "Mining transposed motifs in music", "paper_id": "WOS:000286570600005"}
