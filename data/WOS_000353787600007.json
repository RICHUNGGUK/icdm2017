The method is in a general formulation, which includes oversampling. We do not specify the discretization of the derived macroscopic equation, but we give two examples of possible realizations, suggesting a finite element solver for the fine scale and a vertex-centered finite volume method for the effective coarse scale equations. Assuming periodicity, we show that the method is equivalent to a discretization of the homogenized equation. We provide an a posteriori estimate for the error between the homogenized solutions of the pressure and saturation equations and the corresponding HMM approximations. The error estimate is based on the results recently achieved as reported by CancSs et al. (Math. Comp. 83(285):153-188, 2014).
