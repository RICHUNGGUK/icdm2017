The basic idea is to adapt the packet length of Wi-Fi in the MAC layer such that the fragmented packet has a better chance to survive the interference from the nearby BT devices. We first develop an analytical model that specifies the information required by the Wi-Fi MAC layer to decide the best fragmentation strategy. Then, this model is extended to analyze the throughput and transmission delay of the Wi-Fi device. The analytical model is validated by computer simulation. Furthermore, it is demonstrated by simulation results that the proposed coexistence mechanism improves the performance of Wi-Fi in throughput and transmission delay significantly while relatively smaller performance improvement is observed for BT.", "paper_title": "Coexistence Wi-Fi MAC Design for Mitigating Interference Caused by Collocated Bluetooth", "paper_id": "WOS:000348053400004"}
