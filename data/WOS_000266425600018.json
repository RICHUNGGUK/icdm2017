There are several variant schemes to improve the efficiency and the security of the Chikazawa-Yamagishi scheme. Unfortunately, all of the proposed schemes have some weaknesses. First, all the proposed schemes require time synchronization of the communicating parties. Second, none of the proposed schemes provide both forward secrecy and security against session state reveal attacks. In this paper, we suggest an ID-based key distribution scheme which does not require time synchronization and provides both forward secrecy and security against session state reveal attacks.", "paper_title": "Stronger Chikazawa-Yamagishi ID-Based Key Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000266425600018"}
