We prove that every non-strict continuous Archimedean t-conorm-based decomposable measure can be extended from an algebra to the completion of this algebra under the fuzzy pseudometric and then to the sigma-algebra generated by this algebra. The existence of such an extension follows very simply from the well-known Caratheodory result. However, our topological proof offers an intuitive interpretation of the extension of decomposable measures. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
