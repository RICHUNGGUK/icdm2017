The type of representational structures and the role they play in the preservation of an agent's autonomy are pointed out. A framework of self-organised Peircean semiotic processes is introduced and it is then used to demonstrate the emergence of grounded representational structures in agents interacting with their environment.", "paper_title": "Towards representational autonomy of agents in artificial environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000238053100046"}
