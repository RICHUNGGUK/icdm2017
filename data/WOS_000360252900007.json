Results from a survey about a beef traceability system show novel findings about the important roles played by consumers' perceived regulatory effectiveness as an exogenous antecedent, and by their trust in seller and willingness to pay a price premium as mediators, that shape their intentions to use a BTS and conduct a purchase transaction.
