It is shown that the classifications of the new equations are similar to the original equations that is, if the original equation is a hyperbolic then the new classification after convolution product is also a hyperbolic similarly, if an elliptic then the new classification is an elliptic equation. Thus we prove that the classifications of new equations are invariant after finite convolution products. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
