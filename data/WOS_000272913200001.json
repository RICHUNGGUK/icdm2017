The proposed architecture is composed of three layers: a device management layer, a data management layer and all application layer. Vital signs sensing is achieved by wired and wireless sensor node integrated with a medical device, or by sensors connected with serial link. Although defined as the software above the medical sensor network, the two-layer middleware is below the application program that provides a common programming abstraction for tele-homecare systems. An application,called the Tele-Homecare Household Monitor System, based oil the proposed middleware is implemented and evaluated. The transmission energy costs (the number of messages transmitted in the system) and the average delays caused by aggregation function are compared in two configurations and four different implementations of aggregation function. To increase power efficiency and prolong the system life-time, the aggregation functions should be implemented oil the sensor node of the wireless sensor network if this is feasible. To minimize the message delay, the aggregation functions should be implemented on cluster head. Good message aggregation and filtering significantly reduce the number of messages transmitted and stored in the system, and could translate the sensed readings into useful and meaningful information.
