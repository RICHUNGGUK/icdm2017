In this paper, we consider the uncertainty and information content of ranked set samples in both perfect and imperfect ranking scenarios in terms of Shannon entropy, Renyi and Kullback-Leibler (KL) information measures. It is proved that under these information measures, ranked set sampling design performs better than its simple random sampling counterpart of the same size. The information content is also a monotone function of the set size in ranked set sampling. Moreover, the effect of ranking error on the information content of the data is investigated.
