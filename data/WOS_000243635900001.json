Item to item structures readily lend themselves to probabilistic and fully learned models because they are solely composed of observable nodes, like answers to test questions. Their structure is also well grounded in the cognitive theory of knowledge spaces. We study the effectiveness of two Bayesian frameworks to learn item to item structures and to use the induced structures to predict item outcome from a subset of evidence. One approach, Partial Order Knowledge Structures (POKS), relies on a naive Bayes framework whereas the other is based on the Bayesian network (BN) learning and inference framework. Both approaches are assessed over their predictive ability and their computational efficiency in different experimental simulations. The results from simulations over three data sets show that they both can effectively perform accurate predictions, but POKS generally displays higher predictive power than the BN. Moreover, the simplicity of POKS translates to a time efficiency between one to three orders of magnitude greater than the BN runs. We further explore the use of the item to item approach for handling concepts mastery assessment. The approach investigated consist in augmenting an initial set of observations, based on inferences with the item to item structure, and feed the augmented set to a BN containing a number of concepts. The results show that augmented set can effectively improve predictive power of a BN for item outcome, but that improvement does not transfer to the concept assessment in this particular experiment. We discuss different explanations for the results and outline future research avenues.", "paper_title": "Learned student models with item to item knowledge structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000243635900001"}
