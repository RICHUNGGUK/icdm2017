Based on the generalized attack model and all-or-nothing transformation, the security of network coding in the generalized combination network can be characterized by the network capacity and the min-cut bound of wiretapping set from the source. Furthermore, it can be extended to any directed acyclic networks with single source. Compared with the traditional results, we construct information-theoretic secure network coding without additional encryptions and giving up any capacity.", "paper_title": "Secure network coding in the presence of eavesdroppers", "paper_id": "WOS:000276599800019"}
