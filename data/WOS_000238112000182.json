A nonlinear version of the standard deterministic annealing (DA) algorithm is first constructed by means of a Gaussian kernel, which can reveal the structure in the data that may go unnoticed if DA is performed in the original input space. After that, a robust pruning method, the maximization of the mutual information against the constrained input data points; is performed to phase out noise and outliers. The good aspects of the proposed method for data clustering are supported by experimental results.", "paper_title": "Robust data clustering in mercer kernel-induced feature space", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000182"}
