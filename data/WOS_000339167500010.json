With SDN, network operators can run their infrastructure more efficiently, supporting faster deployment of new services while enabling key features such as virtualization. In this article, we adopt an SDN-like approach applied to wireless mobile networks that will not only benefit from the same features as in the wired case, but will also leverage on the distinct features of mobile deployments to push improvements even further. We illustrate with a number of representative use cases the benefits of the adoption of the proposed architecture, which is detailed in terms of modules, interfaces, and high-level signaling. We also review the ongoing standardization efforts, and discuss the potential advantages and weaknesses, and the need for a coordinated approach.", "paper_title": "AN ARCHITECTURE FOR SOFTWARE DEFINED WIRELESS NETWORKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000339167500010"}
