In this paper, we propose a potential function that models the DRAM behavior in GPGPU architectures and a DRAM scheduling policy, alpha-SJF policy to minimize the potential function. The scheduling policy essentially chooses between SJF and FR-FCFS at run-time based on the number of requests from each thread and whether the thread has a row buffer hit.", "paper_title": "DRAM Scheduling Policy for GPGPU Architectures Based on a Potential Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000312559500002"}
