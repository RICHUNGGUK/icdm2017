Quadratic Boolean functions are related to simple graphs and it is shown that the orbit generated by successive local complementations on a graph can be found within the transform spectra under investigation. The flat spectra of a quadratic Boolean function are related to modified versions of its associated adjacency matrix.", "paper_title": "Generalized bent criteria for Boolean functions (I)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240076700017"}
