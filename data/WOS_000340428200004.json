It uses a proprietary face detector (PittPatt) and a novel classifier consisting of a set of Random Forests paired with support vector machine labellers. The system performs at real-time rates under imaging conditions, with no intermediate human intervention. The acted still-image Binghamton University 3D Facial Expression database was used for training purposes, while a number of spontaneous expression-labelled video databases were used for testing. Quantitative evidence for qualitative and intuitive facial expression recognition constitutes the main theoretical contribution to the field.", "paper_title": "Fully Automated Recognition of Spontaneous Facial Expressions in Videos Using Random Forest Classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000340428200004"}
