This has resulted in production of massive point cloud data from images or LiDAR. Visualization and further processing generally require a detailed, yet concise representation of the scene's surfaces. Related work generally either approximates the data with the risk of over-smoothing, or interpolates the data with excessive detail. Many surfaces in urban scenes can be modeled more concisely by planar approximations. We present a method that combines these polygons into a watertight model. The polygon-based shape is closed with free-form meshes based on visibility information. To achieve this, we divide 3-space into inside and outside volumes by combining a constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization with a graph-cut. We compare our method with related work on several large urban LiDAR data sets. We construct similar shapes with a third fewer triangles to model the scenes. Additionally, our results are more visually pleasing and closer to a human modeler's description of urban scenes using simple boxes.", "paper_title": "Watertight Scenes from Urban LiDAR and Planar Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000323204000022"}
