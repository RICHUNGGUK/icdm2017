With OFDMA in the downlink and SC-FDMA in the uplink, LTE possesses a robust and adaptive multiple access scheme that facilitates many physical layer enhancements. Despite this flexibility, scheduling in LTE is a challenging functionality to design, especially in the uplink. Resource allocation in LTE is made complex, especially when considering its target packet-based services and mobility profiles, both current and emerging, in addition to the use of several physical layer enhancements. In this paper, we offer a tutorial on scheduling in LTE and its successor LTE-Advanced. We also survey representative schemes in the literature that have addressed the scheduling problem, and offer an evaluation methodology to be used as a basis for comparison between scheduling proposals in the literature.", "paper_title": "Uplink Scheduling in LTE and LTE-Advanced: Tutorial, Survey and Evaluation Framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000343072200005"}
