The implementation of sustainable land use can alleviate some of these problems. It needs a set of tools for the exploration, design, modification, illustration, and evaluation of alternative planning scenarios. This paper demonstrates that the integration of cellular automata and agent-based modelling can provide a spatial exploratory tool for generating alternative development patterns. Sustainable development strategies are embedded in the modelling to regulate agents' behaviours. The use of agents can help to represent human-environment interactions in solving complex land-use problems. It is able to examine the effects of different stakeholders in influencing the process of land development. The proposed model has been applied to the simulation of planning scenarios for residential development in a rapidly expanding city in the Pearl River Delta.", "paper_title": "Embedding sustainable development strategies in agent-based models for use as a planning tool", "paper_id": "WOS:000253735500003"}
