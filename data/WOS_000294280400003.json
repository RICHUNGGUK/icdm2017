Unfortunately, the consequences of any decision at the strategic level are propagated to the tactical and even the operational levels. In order to support highly efficient flexibility while avoiding infrastructure over-sizing, resource saturation and poor coordination of activities and resources, it is important to consider the cause-effect interaction of strategic decisions with operational ones. In this paper, a discrete-event system simulation approach to evaluate the influence of the internal interactions among material, people, information and financial resources on the success of a Spanish optician supply chain is introduced. The emergent dynamics are analyzed and a redesign of the business and distribution network is proposed to foster synergy among supply chain actors.", "paper_title": "Operational and strategic supply model redesign for an optical chain company using digital simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000294280400003"}
