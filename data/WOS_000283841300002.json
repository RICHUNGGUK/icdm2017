In this paper we consider the following natural extension: is there a generic construction of \"identity-based signature schemes with additional properties\" (such as identity-based blind signatures, verifiably encrypted signatures, ...) from standard signature schemes with the same properties? Our results show that this is possible for a number of properties including proxy signatures; (partially) blind signatures; verifiably encrypted signatures; undeniable signatures; forward-secure signatures; (strongly) key insulated signatures; online/offline signatures; threshold signatures; and (with some limitations) aggregate signatures. Using well-known results for standard signature schemes, we conclude that explicit identity-based signature schemes with additional properties can be constructed, enjoying sometimes better properties than specific schemes proposed until now. In particular, our work implies the existence of identity-based signatures with additional properties that are provably secure in the standard model, do not need bilinear pairings, or can be based on general assumptions.", "paper_title": "ON THE GENERIC CONSTRUCTION OF IDENTITY-BASED SIGNATURES WITH ADDITIONAL PROPERTIES", "paper_id": "WOS:000283841300002"}
