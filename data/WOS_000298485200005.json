In contrast to previous works, a spatially correlated MIMO channel model is considered and a transmitter correlation value (TCV) is newly introduced to assist the antenna selection in addition to the channel gain. For the TBS or CCBS, with predetermined threshold of TCV or ratio of successful antennas (RSAs), full searching (FS) and sub searching (SS) are applied more efficiently to user equipments (UEs) compared with previous schedulers. As a result, the number of candidate antennas in the scheduling set can be reduced, which translates into a lower computational complexity in terms of number of evaluated antenna combinations. Additionally, compared with the TBS, the peak computational complexity can be further reduced by the CCBS. Simulation results show that with proposed schedulers the computational complexity can be reduced by at least 50% with an acceptable compromise of capacity.
