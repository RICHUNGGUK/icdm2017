Assume that P-1, ..., P-k are players such that P-i knows all of the numbers except x(i). They want to determine if Sigma(k)(j=1) x(j) = T by broadcasting as few bits as possible. In [7] an upper bound of O(root n) bits was obtained for the k = 3 case, and a lower bound of omega(1) for k >= 3 when T = Theta(2(n)). We obtain (1) for k >= 3 an upper bound of k + O((n + log k)(1/([1g(2k-2)]))), (2) for k = 3, T = Theta(2(n)), a lower bound of Omega(log log n), (3) a generalization of the protocol to abelian groups, (4) lower bounds on the multiparty communication complexity of some regular languages, and (5) empirical results for k = 3.", "paper_title": "The multiparty communication complexity of exact-T: improved bounds and new problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240271700013"}
