Classical approaches such as using smoothing splines, which are controlled by a single smoothing parameter, are inefficient in estimating the underlying function that consists of different spatial structures. In this paper, we propose a blockwise method of fitting smoothing splines wherein the smoothing parameter X varies spatially, in order to accommodate possible spatial nonhomogeneity of the regression function. A key feature of the proposed blockwise method is the parameterization of a smoothing parameter function lambda(x) that produces a continuous spatially adaptive fit over the entire range of design points. The proposed parameterization requires two important ingredients: (1) a blocking scheme that divides the data into several blocks according to the degree of spatial variation of the data; and (2) a method for choosing smoothing parameters of blocks. We propose a block selection approach that is based on the adaptive thinning algorithm and a choice of smoothing parameters that minimize a newly defined blockwise risk. The results obtained from numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
