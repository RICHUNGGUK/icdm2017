An approach to create a remote ASP-oriented simulation tool for the glass pressing process is presented in this paper. The original functionality of the simulation system is divided into several independent modules: main server, job scheduler, simulating units and user interface (including visualization). The construction approach and implementation techniques of the system are described in detail. Furthermore, the united model and methodology is presented to establish an integrated simulation platform for the multiple aspects of the forming process. The modeling and formulation of glass pressing, part cooling, mold cooling residual stresses and shrinkage are also discussed.", "paper_title": "A web-based remote simulation system for the glass pressing process", "paper_id": "WOS:000255514700002"}
