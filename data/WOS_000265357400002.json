In this article, the experimental validation of the proposed theory is presented, describing the step-by-step procedure to be adopted when designing an AB-C Doherty. The amplifier was realized at 2.14 GHz in hybrid form using two (0.5 mu m, 1 mm gate periphery) GaN HEMTs. (c) 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
