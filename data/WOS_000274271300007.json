Since energy efficiency is a critical issue in ad hoc networks, we develop an energy-saving framework that includes scheduling for node-to-node direct communication. The scheduling is performed by a coordinator that is selected by some simple rule. We enhance IEEE 802.11 protocol by using our proposed framework, and analyze its energy efficiency in transmitting and receiving data. Through mathematical analysis, we confirm that our enhanced protocol significantly saves energy compared to the IEEE 802.11 protocol. We also investigate the robustness of our algorithm by covering the cases Of uncooperative users, system malfunctioning, and channel errors. The numerical results confirm that our protocol works well under these hostile environments and maintains its advantage over the conventional scheme.
