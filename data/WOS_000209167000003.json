Logical or physical access is restricted to authorised users, which in many cases have to provide tokens where their personal information is stored. At the same time, biometrics proposes a feasible solution for the recognition problem. The combination of both solutions is coming up front. However, up till now, owing to processing restrictions, these tokens are just able to store data and perform the last steps of the biometric recognition process. In this study, the authors propose a new system where tokens are based on hardware/software (HW/SW) co-design, which allows computing most of the biometric process in them. This proposal covers several aspects which these systems are subject to, taking advantages of the two platforms they use for reducing computational time or HW area, and also to increase security or minimise misidentification errors. For testing this proposal, an Iris ID token has been implemented, showing different design alternatives adapted to different work scenarios.", "paper_title": "Optimisation of biometric ID tokens by using hardware/software co-design", "paper_id": "WOS:000209167000003"}
