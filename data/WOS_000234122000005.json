Application-level multicast becomes a promising alternative. Many overlay multicast systems have been proposed in recent years. However, they are insufficient in supporting applications that require any-source multicast with varied host capacities and dynamic membership. In this paper, we propose two capacity-aware multicast systems that focus on host heterogeneity, any source multicast, dynamic membership, and scalability. We extend Chord and Koorde to be capacity-aware. We then embed implicit degree-varying multicast trees on top of the overlay network and develop multicast routines that automatically follow the trees to disseminate multicast messages. The implicit trees are well balanced with the workload evenly spread across the network. We rigorously analyze the expected performance of multisource capacity-aware multicasting, which was not thoroughly addressed in any previous work. We also perform extensive simulations to evaluate the proposed multicast systems.", "paper_title": "Capacity-aware multicast algorithms on heterogeneous overlay networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000234122000005"}
