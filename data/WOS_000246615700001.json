We identify appropriate asymptotic regimes and obtain fluid and diffusion limits. The non-trivial, yet tractable, limits can be used for performance analysis and policy design. Furthermore, the scalings used to obtain these limits are themselves of interest and help explain phenomena observed in previous simulation studies.", "paper_title": "Integrating streaming and file-transfer Internet traffic: fluid and diffusion approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000246615700001"}
