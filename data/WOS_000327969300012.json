This mnemonic-motor task requires memorization of the selection order of points scattered on a 2-D plane and reproduction of this order using entire arm movements. Four information presentation methods, visual information only, visual information + enactment, visual information + haptic guidance, and visual information + haptic disturbance, are considered. The latter three methods provide different levels of haptic kinesthetic feedback to the trainee. We carried out a user study to assess the quantitative performance differences of the four training methods using a custom-built visuo-haptic training system. Experimental results showed the relative advantages and disadvantages of each information presentation method for both short-term and long-term memorization. In particular, training with only visual information was the best option for short-term memory, while training also with haptic disturbance was the most effective for long-term memory. Our findings have implications to designing a training method that is suitable for given training requirements.", "paper_title": "Haptic Assistance for Memorization of 2-D Selection Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000327969300012"}
