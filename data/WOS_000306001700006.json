Comput., 30 (2000), pp. 475-485] to be MAX-SNP hard even on high-dimensional Euclidean metrics. To circumvent this hardness, researchers have been developing approximation schemes for \"simpler\" instances of the problem. For instance, the algorithms of Arora and of Talwar show how to approximate TSP on low-dimensional metrics (for different notions of metric dimension). However, a feature of most current notions of metric dimension is that they are \"local\": the definitions require every local neighborhood to be well-behaved. In this paper, we define a global notion of dimension that generalizes the popular notion of doubling dimension, but still allows some small dense regions; e. g., it allows some metrics that contain cliques of size root n. Given a metric with global dimension dim(C), we give a (1 + epsilon)-approximation algorithm that runs in subexponential time, i.e., in exp(O(n(delta)epsilon(-4 dimC)))-time for every constant 0 < delta < 1. As mentioned above, metrics with bounded dim(C) may contain metrics of size O(root n) on which the TSP problem is hard to approximate to within (1 + epsilon). Hence, to do better than a running time of Omega(exp{root n}), our algorithms find O(1)-approximations to some portions of the tour, and (1 + epsilon)-approximations for other portions, and stitch them together. Moreover, we show that such globally bounded metrics have spanners that preserve distances to arbitrary accuracy and have size Theta(n(1.5)).", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATING TSP ON METRICS WITH BOUNDED GLOBAL GROWTH", "paper_id": "WOS:000306001700006"}
