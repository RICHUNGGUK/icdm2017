The primary objective is to find the optimal sequence of jobs and the optimal resource allocation separately. Here we propose two separate models: minimizing a cost function of makespan, total completion time, total absolute differences in completion times and total resource cost; minimizing a cost function of makespan, total waiting time, total absolute differences in waiting times and total resource cost. Since each model is strongly NP-hard, we solve both models by breaking them down to two sub-problems, the optimal resource allocation problem for any job sequence and the optimal sequence problem with its optimal resource allocation. Specially, we transform the second sub-problem into the minimum of the bipartite graph optimal matching problem (NP-hard), and solve it by using the classic KM (Kuhn-Munkres) algorithm. The solutions of the two sub-problems demonstrate that the target problems remain polynomial solvable under the proposed model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
