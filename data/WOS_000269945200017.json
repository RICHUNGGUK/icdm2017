The HFNC consists of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) which was designed to control each degree of freedom (I)OF) of a MIMO system individually and an additional coupling neural network which was incorporated into the FLC to compensate for the dynamic coupling effects between each DOF of the MIMO system. Stability and robustness of the HFNC have been demonstrated using a state-space approach. From the simulation results of the 2-link robotic manipulator application and the experimental results of the 6-DOF robot tests. the HFNC demonstrated more superior control performance than the FLC.
