These methods have the property that they preserve important structural features of the original systems, such as the behaviour of solutions near to fixed points, and also, where appropriate (e.g. for certain mechanical systems), the property of being volume-preserving, or preserving a symplectic/Poisson structure. Here we focus on the application of Kahan's method to models of biological systems, in particular to reaction kinetics governed by the Law of Mass Action, and present a general approach to birational discretization, which is applied to population dynamics of Lotka-Volterra type.", "paper_title": "Non-standard discretization of biological models", "paper_id": "WOS:000360155600004"}
