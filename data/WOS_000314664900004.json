The challenge consists of sizing and scheduling the lots in the most cost-effective manner on a set of parallel molding machines that are fed by a furnace that melts the glass. The solution procedure combines a multi-population hierarchically structured genetic algorithm (GA) with a simulated annealing (SA), and a tailor-made heuristic named cavity heuristic (CH). The SA is applied to intensify the search for solutions in the neighborhood of the best individuals found by the GA, while the CH determines quickly values for a relevant decision variable of the problem: the processing speed of each machine. The results indicate the superior performance of the proposed approach against a state-of-the-art commercial solver, and compared to a non-hybridized multi-population GA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
