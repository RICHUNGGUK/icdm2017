We study some basic questions concerning the discriminating power of AL, focusing on the equivalence on processes induced by the logic (=(L)). As underlying calculi besides MA we consider a subcalculus in which an image-finiteness condition holds and that we prove to be Turing complete. Synchronous variants of these calculi are studied as well. In these calculi, we provide two operational characterisations of =(L): a conductive one (as a form of bisimilarity) and an inductive one (based on structual properties of processes). After showing =(L) to be stricly finer than barbed congruence, we establish axiomatisations of =(L) on the subcalculus of MA (both the asynchronous and the synchronous version), enabling us to relate =(L) to structural congruence. We also present some (un) decidability results that are related to the above separation properties for AL: the undecidability of =(L) on MA and its decidability on the subcalculus.", "paper_title": "SEPARABILITY IN THE AMBIENT LOGIC", "paper_id": "WOS:000262643100004"}
