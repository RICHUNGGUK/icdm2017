The energy of sensor nodes is tightly constrained so that there is a need to control the power consumption in node operations such as transmission and routing. In this paper, we carry out analysis on energy-aware routing in order to minimize the path loss. Our goal is to prolong the network lifetime and case the management of sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware routing analysis in wireless sensors network", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100046"}
