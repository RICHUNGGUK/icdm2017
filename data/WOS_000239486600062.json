In this paper, we propose a novel method to model and render this phenomenon. We first establish their corresponding atmospheric temperature models. Then adhering to the physical law, we calculate the light path and intensity attenuation during its propagation. To simulate the dynamic effect of mirages, we introduce a dynamic model based on atmospheric gravity waves. By incorporating GPU acceleration into the rendering process, different types of dynamic mirages under different conditions can be realistically rendered in real time, demonstrating the formation, change, and disappear of mirages.", "paper_title": "Real-time simulation of dynamic mirage scenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600062"}
