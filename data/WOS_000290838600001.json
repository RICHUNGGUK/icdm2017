Based on a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, some new delay-dependent stability conditions are presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities, which guarantee the uncertain stochastic neural networks with mixed delays to be robustly exponentially stable. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
