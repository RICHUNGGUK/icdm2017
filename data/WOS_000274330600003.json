The proposed synthesizer employs RC poly phase filter to suppress unwanted tones and correct phase and amplitude errors between quadrature paths. Fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, this circuit achieves a side-band rejection of -32.27 dB, integrated phase noise of 2.138 degrees, and a switching time of less than 2.05 ns while consuming 66 mW from a 1.8-V supply.", "paper_title": "A single-PLL dual-PPF synthesizer for Mode-1 MB-OFDM UWB communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000274330600003"}
