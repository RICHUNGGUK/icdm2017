However, in the presence of cured patients, evaluating gene effect on time to relapse is quite complex since it may affect either the probability of never experiencing a relapse (cure effect) or the time to relapse among the uncured patients (disease progression effect) or both. In this context, we propose a simple and an efficient method for identifying gene expression changes that characterize early and late recurrence for uncured patients. Results: Simulation results show the good performance of the proposed statistic for detecting a disease progression effect. In a study of early-stage breast cancer, our results show that the proposed statistic provides a more powerful basis for gene selection than the classical Cox model-based statistic. From a biological perspective, many of the genes identified here as associated with the speed of disease recurrence have known roles in tumorigenesis.", "paper_title": "Identifying gene expression changes in breast cancer that distinguish early and late relapse among uncured patients", "paper_id": "WOS:000238768500012"}
