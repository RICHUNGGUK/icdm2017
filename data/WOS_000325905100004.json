Focusing on discrete models of these networks, namely, Boolean automata networks, we propose to analyse the contribution of non-monotony to the diversity and complexity in their dynamical behaviours. More precisely, in this paper, we start by detailing some motivations, both mathematical and biological, for our interest in non-monotony, and we discuss how it may account for phenomena that cannot be produced by monotony only. Then, to build some understanding in this direction, we show some preliminary results on the dynamical behaviours of some specific non-monotone Boolean automata networks called XOR circulant networks.
