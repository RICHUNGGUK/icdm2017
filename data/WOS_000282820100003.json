One component of this program is spike metrics-notions of distance between two spike trains recorded from a neuron. Alignment spike metrics work by identifying \"equivalent\" spikes in both trains. We present an alignment spike metric having L-p underlying geometrical structure; the L-2 version is Euclidean and is suitable for further embedding in Euclidean spaces by multidimensional scaling methods or related procedures. We show how to implement a fast algorithm for the computation of this metric based on bipartite graph matching theory.", "paper_title": "A Fast L-p Spike Alignment Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000282820100003"}
