Of their different characteristics and challenges, network management and lifetime elongation are the most considered issues in WSN based systems. Connected Dominating Set (CDS) is known to be an efficient strategy to control network topology, reduce overhead, and extend network lifetime. Designing a CDS algorithm for WSNs is very challenging. This paper provides a review on connected dominating set construction techniques for wireless sensor networks.", "paper_title": "Connected dominating set algorithms for wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000318684500006"}
