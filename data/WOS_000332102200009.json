Furthermore, in current-mode implementation, the proposed circuit produces simultaneously multiple filtering functions while uses just one configuration of inputs. Also, as the result of sensitivity analysis shows, the new filter structure has a very low sensitivity to the values of capacitors and trans-conductance elements. However, the proposed Gm-C filter is designed and simulated in HSPICE using 0.18 mu m CMOS technology parameters and HSPICE simulation results have very close agreement with theoretical results obtained from MATLAB which justifies the design accuracy and low-power, multi-mode, multi-output universal filtering performance of the proposed circuit.", "paper_title": "A low-power multi-mode and multi-output high-order CMOS universal Gm-C filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000332102200009"}
