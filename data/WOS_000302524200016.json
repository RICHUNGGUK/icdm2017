We propose a new technique for visualizing terrain surfaces by tessellating them on the GPU. The presented algorithm introduces a new adaptive tessellation scheme for managing the level of detail of the terrain mesh, avoiding the appearance of t-vertices that can produce visually disturbing artifacts. Previous solutions exploited the geometry shader's capabilities to tessellate meshes from scratch. In contrast, we reuse the already calculated data to minimize the operations performed in the shader units. This feature allows us to increase performance through smart refining and coarsening. Finally, we also propose a framework to manage large DEMs as height maps.
