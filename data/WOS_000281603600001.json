It allows researchers to submit their experiments and to retrieve the results from the central server. In the testbed, we also propose a software-based hardware-supported scheme to measure the energy consumption of running sensor nodes. And we compare our energy-consumption estimation with oscilloscope measurements. The results show that the energy consumption is very close to oscilloscope measurements.", "paper_title": "A distributed Wireless Sensor Network testbed with energy consumption estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000281603600001"}
