We introduce various notions of k-locality of a stabilizer code, inherited from the associated stabilizer group. A choice of generators leads to a Hamiltonian with the code in its groundspace. We establish bounds on the locality of any other Hamiltonian whose groundspace contains such a code, whether or not its Pauli tenser summands commute. Our results provide insight into the cost of creating an energy gap for passive error correction and for adiabatic quantum computing. The results simplify in the cases of XZ-split codes such as Calderbank-Shor-Steane stabilizer codes and topologically-ordered stabilizer codes arising from surface cellulations.", "paper_title": "LOCALITY BOUNDS ON HAMILTONIANS FOR STABILIZER CODES", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937600009"}
