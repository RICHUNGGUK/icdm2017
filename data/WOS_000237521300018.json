The full CRBM system consists of stochastic neurons whose continuous-valued probabilistic behavior is mediated by injected noise. Integrating on-chip training circuits, the full CRBM system provides a platform for exploring computation with continuous-valued probabilistic behavior in VLSI. The VLSI CRBM's ability both to model and to regenerate continuous-valued data distributions is examined and limitations on its performance are highlighted and discussed.", "paper_title": "Continuous valued probabilistic behavior in a VLSI generative model", "paper_id": "WOS:000237521300018"}
