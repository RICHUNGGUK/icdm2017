In particular, we consider two different protocols based on the FD capability of relay: 1) FD transmission (FDT), in which the FD-Relay receives and sends data concurrently; 2) FD-Relay with jamming (FDJ), where first, the FD-Relay simultaneously receives data and sends jamming to the eavesdropper; then, it forwards the data, while the source jams the eavesdropper. We first develop the secrecy rate expressions for half-duplex transmission (HDT), half-duplex with jamming (HDJ), FDT, and FDJ relaying protocols, and then use them to derive their performance properties in terms of the channel gains between nodes, eavesdropper types, and more importantly, the SI level in FD-Relay. We further investigate the non-convex power allocation problems for the developed FDT and FDJ to maximize the secrecy rate under the power constraints. In particular, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm based on the difference-of-two-concave-functions programming. Analytical and simulation results show the strong influence of SI level on the achieved secrecy rate of the FDT and the FDJ. For sufficiently low SI, FDT achieves a much higher secrecy rate than FDJ, HDJ, and HDT. However, for higher SI, FDJ becomes more effective in enhancing the achieved secrecy rate. The results also indicate that adaptive power allocation can significantly improve the performance and confirm that the proposed FDT and FDJ outperform the HDT and the HDJ.", "paper_title": "Improving Wireless Secrecy Rate via Full-Duplex Relay-Assisted Protocols", "paper_id": "WOS:000360891300006"}
