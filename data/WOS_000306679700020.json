A reference process model can be used as a TO-BE model in a BPR project. An appropriate process model should not contain structural problems. An unstructured model may cause deadlock or unfinished instances that stay in a system. Therefore, the structure of the reference model must be verified to reduce the number of errors during implementation. This work presents a novel pattern-based PN structural analytical approach. Several workflow patterns and their PN-based identification algorithms are also developed. An approach to transforming a PN model into a pattern-based process diagram (PBPD) is specified. Via the PBPD, several structure-related flaws, such as deadlock and improper nesting, are analyzed using a Split-Join Routing Table (SJRT). Analytical results support the re-design of a workflow model and enhance its feasibility. The main contribution of the proposed approach is that the PBPD can reduce the complexity of a PN model and subsequently increase analytical efficiency. An industrial reference model is used as an empirical case during the implementation phase of the proposed concepts.", "paper_title": "A PATTERN BASED APPROACH FOR STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF WORKFLOW MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306679700020"}
