In this work we propose a very simple interface that requires minor programmer effort and achieves substantial performance and scalability improvements. In particular, we focus on the common use of data structures or collections for organizing data on the heap. We let the program notify the collector which classes represent nodes of data structures and also when such nodes are being removed from their data structures. The data-structure aware (DSA) garbage collector uses this information to improve performance, locality, and load balancing. Experience shows that this interface requires a minor modification of the application. Measurements show that for some significant benchmarks this interface can dramatically reduce the time spent on garbage collection and also improve the overall program performance.", "paper_title": "Data Structure Aware Garbage Collector", "paper_id": "WOS:000370548500004"}
