This covers both a static part, defining individual, bilateral and collective agent attitudes, and a dynamic part, describing system reconfiguration in a dynamic, unpredictable environment. In this paper, we investigate the complexity of the satisfiability problem of the static part of TEAMLOG, focusing on individual and collective attitudes up to collective intention. Our logics for teamwork are squarely multi-modal, in the sense that different operators are combined and may interfere. One might expect that such a combination is much more complex than the basic multi-agent logic with one operator, but in fact we show that it is not the case: the individual part of TEAMLOG is PSPACE-complete, just like the single modality case. The full system, modelling a subtle interplay between individual and group attitudes, turns out to be EXPTIME-complete, and remains so even when propositional dynamic logic is added to it.", "paper_title": "Complexity issues in multiagent logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000244426400014"}
