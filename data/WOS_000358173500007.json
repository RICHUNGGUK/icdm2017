QSLiMFinder uses specific query protein information to restrict the motif space and thereby increase the sensitivity and specificity of predictions. Results: QSLiMFinder was extensively benchmarked using known SLiM-containing proteins and simulated protein interaction datasets of real human proteins. Exploiting prior knowledge of a query protein likely to be involved in a SLiM-mediated interaction increased the proportion of true positives correctly returned and reduced the proportion of datasets returning a false positive prediction. The biggest improvement was seen if a short region of the query protein flanking the interaction site was known.", "paper_title": "QSLiMFinder: improved short linear motif prediction using specific query protein data", "paper_id": "WOS:000358173500007"}
