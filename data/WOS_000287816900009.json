Our purpose is to look for a connection between these two disciplines. Following a previous work [3], we consider an extension of the original ludics with contraction and universal nondeterminism, which play dual roles, in order to capture a polarized fragment of linear logic and thus a constructive variant of classical propositional logic. We then prove a completeness theorem for proofs in this extended setting: for any behaviour (formula) A and any design (proof attempt) P, either P is a proof of A or there is a model M of A(perpendicular to) which defeats P. Compared with proofs of full completeness in game semantics, ours exhibits a striking similarity with proofs of Godel's completeness, in that it explicitly constructs a countermodel essentially using Konig's lemma, proceeds by induction on formulas, and implies an analogue of Lowenheim-Skolem theorem.", "paper_title": "ON THE MEANING OF LOGICAL COMPLETENESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287816900009"}
