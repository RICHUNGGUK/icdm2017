When the finite volume framework is applied, a reliable solver is crucial for the construction of numerical fluxes, for which the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) scheme undertakes such a task in the sense of second order accuracy. Combining these techniques yields a second order accurate adaptive generalized Riemann problem (AGRP) scheme for two dimensional compressible fluid flows over unstructured triangular meshes. Besides the generation of meshes, the main process of this combination consists of two ingredients: Fluid dynamical evolution and mesh redistribution. The fluid dynamical evolution ingredient serves to evolve the compressible fluid flows on a fixed nonuniform triangular mesh with the direct Eulerian GRP solver. The role of the mesh redistribution is to redistribute mesh points on which a conservative interpolation formula is adopted to calculate the cell-averages for the conservative variables, and the gradients of primitive variables are reconstructed using the least squares method. Several examples are taken from various contexts to demonstrate the performance of such a program. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
