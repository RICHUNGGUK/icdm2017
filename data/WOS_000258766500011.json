The Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory for functional differential equations and the linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach are employed in our investigation. The results are shown to be generalizations of some previously published results and are less conservative than existing results. The present results are also applied to recurrent neural networks with constant time delays.", "paper_title": "Global asymptotic stability of recurrent neural networks with multiple time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000258766500011"}
