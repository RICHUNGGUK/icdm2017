The final summary consists of a collection of quantified sentences. The use of the time hierarchy allows us to accomplish the objectives of a summary, i.e., to be general, brief, and accurate.", "paper_title": "A Fuzzy Approach to the Linguistic Summarization of Time Series", "paper_id": "WOS:000288045700004"}
