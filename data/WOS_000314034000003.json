These point-sets naturally occur in the design of efficient multiplication algorithms for finite-dimensional -algebras of the form , where is generated by monomials of the form ; one particularly important example is the algebra of truncated power series . Similarly to what is known for multi-point evaluation and interpolation in the univariate case, our algorithms have quasi-linear time complexity. As a known consequence Schost (ISSAC'05, ACM, New York, NY, pp 293-300, 2005), we obtain fast multiplication algorithms for algebras of the above form.", "paper_title": "Multi-point evaluation in higher dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000314034000003"}
