For an ideal 3D shape interpolation, especially the articulated model, the shape should follow the movement of the underlying articulated structure and be transformed in a way that is as rigid as possible. Given input shapes with compatible connectivity, we propose a novel multiresolution mean shift (MMS) clustering algorithm to automatically extract their near-rigid components. Then, by building the hierarchical relationship among extracted components, we compute a common articulated structure for these input shapes. With the aid of this articulated structure, we solve the shape interpolation by combining 1) a global pose interpolation of near-rigid components from the source shape to the target shape with 2) a local gradient field interpolation for each pair of components, followed by solving a Poisson equation in order to reconstruct an interpolated shape. As a result, an aesthetically pleasing shape interpolation can be generated, with even the poses of shapes varying significantly. In contrast to a recent state-of-the-art work [19], the proposed approach can achieve comparable or even better results and have better computational efficiency as well.", "paper_title": "Multiresolution Mean Shift Clustering Algorithm for Shape Interpolation", "paper_id": "WOS:000267814500013"}
