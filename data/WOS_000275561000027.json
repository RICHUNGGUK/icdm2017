It turns out that exponential Welch permutations not only lead in general to the smallest hops, but are also relatively easy to study, as a closed formula exists for the maximal hop. Through extensive collection of data for logarithmic Welch and Golomb permutations, on the other hand, it is found that: a) these two families behave (almost) identically; and that b) their maximal hops do not get as small as in exponential Welch permutations.", "paper_title": "On the Hops Present in Costas Permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000275561000027"}
