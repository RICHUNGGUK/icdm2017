In many software programs, global matching algorithms are used in order to obtain accurate disparity maps. Although their error rates are considerably low, their processing speeds are far from that required for real-time processing because of their complex processing sequences. In order to realize real-time processing, many hardware systems have been proposed to date. They have achieved considerably high processing speeds; however, their error rates are not as good as those of software programs, because simple local matching algorithms have been widely used in those systems. In our system, sophisticated local matching algorithms (CA and FLC) that are suitable for FPGA implementation are used to achieve low error rate while maintaining the high processing speed. We evaluate the performance of our circuit on Xilinx Vertex-6 FPGAs. Its error rate is comparable to that of top-level software algorithms, and its processing speed is nearly 2 clock cycles per pixel, which reaches 507.9 fps for 640 x 480 pixel images.", "paper_title": "Fast and Accurate Stereo Vision System on FPGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000332482800003"}
