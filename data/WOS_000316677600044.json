It was found that four Z-cys are bound to the Au-20 apexes preferentially through S atoms. Regarding normal modes, after adsorption of four Z-cys molecules, a more intense infrared (IR) peak is maintained around 1,631.4 cm(-1) corresponding with a C=O stretching mode, but its intensity is enhanced approximately six times. The enhancement in the intensity of modes between 0 to 300 cm(-1) is around 4.5 to 5.0 times for normal modes that involve O-C=O and C-S bending modes. Other two normal modes in the range from 300 to 3,500 cm(-1) show enhancements of 6.0 and 7.4 times. In general, four peaks show major intensities and they are related with normal modes of carboxyl and NH3 groups of Z-cys.", "paper_title": "Zwitterion L-cysteine adsorbed on the Au-20 cluster: enhancement of infrared active normal modes", "paper_id": "WOS:000316677600044"}
