Particle swarm optimization is used to decide the initial weights of the neural network. The HGAPSO-ANN model is applied to predict the power of the solar stirling heat engine which data set reported in literature of china. The performance of the HGAPSO-ANN model is compared with experimental output data. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the HGAPSO-ANN model.", "paper_title": "Prediction of power in solar stirling heat engine by using neural network based on hybrid genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000318003100012"}
