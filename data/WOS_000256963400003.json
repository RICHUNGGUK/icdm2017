If the series converges, then the matrix exponential of the sum equals the fundamental solution of the differential equation. The question considered in this paper is: When does the series converge? The main result establishes a sufficient condition for convergence, which improves on several earlier results.", "paper_title": "Convergence of the Magnus series", "paper_id": "WOS:000256963400003"}
