Due to openness of the network, the system is vulnerable various attacks. To enhance its security, the mutual authentication among the server, the user and the registration is essential. In last several years, many biometrics-based authentication schemes for critical systems based on the client-server environment were proposed for practical applications. However, those schemes are not suitable for critical systems based on the multi-server environment. To guarantee secure communication in critical systems based on the multi-server environment, we propose a new biometrics-based authentication scheme for the multi-server environment. Security analysis and performance analysis show that the proposed scheme avoids security weaknesses in previous schemes while additional cost is small.", "paper_title": "New biometrics-based authentication scheme for multi-server environment in critical systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000365127200012"}
