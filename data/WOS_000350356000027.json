Each appliance can be identified from the aggregate power readings at the meter panel. The possibility of applying a temporal multilabel classification approach in the domain of nonintrusive load monitoring is explored (nonevent-based method). A novel set of metafeatures is proposed. The method is tested on sampling rates based on the capabilities of current smart meters. The proposed approach is validated over a dataset of energy readings at residences for a period of a year for 100 houses containing different sets of appliances (water heater, washing machines, etc.). This method is applicable for the demand side management of households in the current limitation of smart meters; from the inhabitants or from the grid operator's point of view.", "paper_title": "Nonintrusive Load Monitoring: A Temporal Multilabel Classification Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000027"}
