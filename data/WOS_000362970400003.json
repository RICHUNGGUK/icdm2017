The methods of generation of such functions by means of strong negations, similarity measures and pseudo-difference operations associated to t-conorms are proposed. The considered non-statistical association measures can be used in definition of association (or correlation) measures of fuzzy sets, in measuring associations in fuzzy inference and probabilistic reasoning.", "paper_title": "Association measures on [0,1]", "paper_id": "WOS:000362970400003"}
