Due to high shape variation and boundary ambiguity, accurate lung field segmentation from chest radiograph is still a challenging task. To tackle these challenges, we propose a joint shape and appearance sparse learning method for robust and accurate lung field segmentation. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) a robust shape initialization method is designed to achieve an initial shape that is close to the lung boundary under segmentation; 2) a set of local sparse shape composition models are built based on local lung shape segments to overcome the high shape variations; 3) a set of local appearance models are similarly adopted by using sparse representation to capture the appearance characteristics in local lung boundary segments, thus effectively dealing with the lung boundary ambiguity; 4) a hierarchical deformable segmentation framework is proposed to integrate the scale-dependent shape and appearance information together for robust and accurate segmentation. Our method is evaluated on 247 PA chest radiographs in a public dataset. The experimental results show that the proposed local shape and appearance models outperform the conventional shape and appearance models. Compared with most of the state-of-the-art lung field segmentation methods under comparison, our method also shows a higher accuracy, which is comparable to the inter-observer annotation variation.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical Lung Field Segmentation With Joint Shape and Appearance Sparse Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000341773600001"}
