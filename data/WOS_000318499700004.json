The LIA measures the amplitude and phase of the input signal with frequencies from 15 to 20 MHz at SNR as low as -30 dB. The magnitude measurement circuitry relies on the band-pass filter and current integrator to extract the signal amplitude. The phase measurement circuitry relies on the phase-locked loop to extract the phase difference between the input signal and the reference signal. The designed LIA is fabricated in TSMC 0.18 mu m technology. The LIA consumes 37 mW of power. The output signal dynamic range is 300 mV for 600 mV input signal variation, and therefore the output-to-input sensitivity is approximately 0.5 V/V.", "paper_title": "General-purpose high-speed integrated lock-in amplifier with 30 dB dynamic reserve at 20 MHz", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700004"}
