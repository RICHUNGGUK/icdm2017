Their algorithm produces an optimal solution within O(n (2)) time. In this paper we generalise their approach in order to solve the k-Steiner tree problem, in which the Steiner minimum tree may contain up to k Steiner points for a given constant k. We also extend their approach further to encompass other normed planes, and to solve a much wider class of problems, including the k-bottleneck Steiner tree problem and other generalised k-Steiner tree problems. We show that, for any fixed k, such problems can be solved in O(n (2k) ) time.", "paper_title": "Generalised k-Steiner Tree Problems in Normed Planes", "paper_id": "WOS:000348206400005"}
