In this scenario, the use of Intrusion Detection Systems has emerged as a key element in network security. In this paper we address the problem proposing a wavelet-based technique able to detect network anomalies almost in real-time. In more detail, our approach is based on the combined use of sketches and wavelet analysis to reveal the anomalies in data collected at the router level. Moreover, to improve the detection rate we propose a multi time-scale analysis. The performance analysis, presented in this paper, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.
