An important security mechanism for WMN, intrusion detection, has received considerable attention from the research community. Recent results show that traditional monitoring mechanisms are not applicable to real-world WMN due to their constrained resources (memory and processing power), which result in high false negative rates since only a few IDS functions can be activated on monitoring nodes. Cooperative solutions, on the other hand, have high communication overhead and detection delay when the traffic load is high. A practical traffic-aware IDS solution was recently proposed for resource-constrained WMN, however, traffic-awareness might not be feasible for some WMN applications. This article proposes a traffic-agnostic IDS solution that uses a link-coverage approach to monitor both local and backbone WMN traffic. Using real-world experiments and extensive simulations, we show that our proposed IDS solutions outperform traffic-aware IDS solutions while incurring lower computation and communication overhead.
