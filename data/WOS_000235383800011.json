It is an executive program that can migrate from host to host, performing tasks autonomously. However, in an open environment, the mobile agent has many potential threats. Security becomes a critical issue for the mobile agent. Recently, Volker and Mehradad have constructed a mobile agent structure and designed a key assignment strategy to prevent the sensitive data to from being accessed by an unauthorized host. However, their scheme requires a larger agent size and a higher computational cost. In this paper, We shall propose an efficient key assignment scheme to enhance the performance of Volker and Mehradad's scheme. Only few computations and a fixed and small storage are required in our proposed scheme. Furthermore, our scheme can achieve the dynamic key management efficiently. It can also be implemented simply and practically.
