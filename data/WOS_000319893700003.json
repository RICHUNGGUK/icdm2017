By examining different types of email (i.e. permission-based email and spamming), the present study empirically tested the theoretical linkage between email advertising values, perceived instrusiveness, and the attitudinal-behavioural dispositions towards email advertising. Design/methodology/approach - A survey was conducted using 221 respondents from Taiwan. Two scenarios were designed for the present study. The questionnaires were equally divided into two sets, with the first half containing a scenario depicting permission-based email, and the other half containing a scenario describing a spamming email Each respondent only received one set of the survey. Findings - Results from a survey of 221 Internet users in Taiwan indicate that values and attitudes toward, and the perceived intrusiveness of email advertising significantly affect consumers' behavioral dispositions toward email advertising. The results suggest that permission-based email is more effective as compared to spam email advertising. For solicited email, consumers perceived less intrusiveness if the email advertisement offered them financial incentives. Research limitations/implications - The authors acknowledge four limitations in this study. These limitations however provide further direction for future studies in the discipline. The discussion of these limitations is provided. Practical implications - Importantly, this study yields significant theoretical and managerial implications. Concerned with the context of email advertising, the authors' work provides theoretical support for both constructs of advertising values and perceived intrusiveness as important. Concerned with the advertisers, this study renders important implications for better planning of marketing mix strategy using email. Originality/value - This study provides new theoretical insights into factors influencing consumers' acceptance of email advertising by incorporating perceived intrusiveness as a mediator in the relationship between advertising values and attitudinal-behavioral dispositions. By empirically comparing the different types of email advertisements of permission-based email and spamming, the present study also offers better understanding and extending of the current literature on email advertising research.", "paper_title": "The determinants of consumer behavior towards email advertisement", "paper_id": "WOS:000319893700003"}
