So, it is an important issue to effectively make use of these huge geospatial data resources. This means that effective data processing technologies need to be developed to support distributed query and analysis operations onto the distributed resources. The emergence of grid computing technology offers a good solution to accomplish this goal. To combine the grid computing technique with geospatial database we design and implement a GGDS (Grid Geospatial Database System) prototype named GEOBARN. Key modules and detailed implementation methods of GEOBARN are discussed in this paper. By using the GEOBARN system, both reliable data management and effective distributed geospatial query can be achieved.", "paper_title": "GEOBARN: A Practical Grid Geospatial Database System", "paper_id": "WOS:000271872000002"}
