A typical usage situation for mobile services is one characterized by a small screen and no keyboard, and by the service being only a secondary focus of the user. Under such circumstances, it is particularly important to deliver the \"right\" information and service at the right time, with as little user interaction as possible. This may be achieved by making services context aware. Mobile users frequently follow the same route to a destination as they did during previous trips to the destination, and the route and destination constitute important aspects of the context for a range of services. This paper presents key concepts underlying a software component that identifies and accumulates the routes of a user along with their usage patterns and that makes the routes available to services. The problems associated with of route recording are analyzed, and algorithms that solve the problems are presented. Experiences from using the component on logs of GPS positions acquired from vehicles traveling within a real road network are reported.", "paper_title": "Enabling routes of road network constrained movements as mobile service context", "paper_id": "WOS:000244680800003"}
