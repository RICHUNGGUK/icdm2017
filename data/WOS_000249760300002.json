Detecting semantic changes to ontologies is essential to the functioning of data instances and dependent ontologies over the semantic Web. In this article, we propose a SemDiff approach to examining structural changes and deriving both explicit and implicit semantic changes between ontology versions. Our approach exploits the semantic dependency between properties and concepts: we introduce the notion of isosems, and conduct implication analysis to examine whether, when, and how semantic changes to an isosem imply semantic changes to other isosems. A prototype of our approach is implemented.", "paper_title": "SemDiff: An approach to detecting semantic changes to ontologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000249760300002"}
