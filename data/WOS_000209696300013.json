We propose a cooperative strategy based on physical layer network coding and superposition modulation decoding for uni-directional communications among users. The performance of our solution in terms of throughput is evaluated through capacity analysis and simulations that include practical constraints such as the lack of synchronization in time and frequency. We obtain a significant throughput gain compared to the classical time sharing case.", "paper_title": "A Cooperative Network Coding Strategy for the Interference Relay Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000209696300013"}
