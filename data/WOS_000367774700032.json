The model is based on the Field Assisted Dissolution approach for anodization. The parallel code for model simulation is run on Nvidia Tesla GPU cards. We verify that the parallel algorithm yields correct analytical results for the simple exclusion diffusion between emitting and absorbing walls in 3D. We identify the model parameters that have a strong impact on the nanostructures obtained in simulations and present the diagram of prevalence of these structures. We also simulate in our model the so called \"two step anodization\" and find an agreement with experimental findings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
