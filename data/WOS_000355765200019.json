However, the execution that each rule has a precise execution time does not coincide with the biological fact, since the execution time of biochemical reactions can vary because of external uncontrollable conditions. SN P systems that work independently from the values associated with the execution times of the rules were investigated in Pan et al. (Neural Comput 23(5):1320-1342, 2011). In this work, we give a time-free solution to integer factorization problem by SN P systems, which means the execution times of the rules specified by different time mappings have no influence on the correctness of the solution. Besides, we prove that the systems are constructed in a uniform manner.", "paper_title": "A uniform solution to integer factorization using time-free spiking neural P system", "paper_id": "WOS:000355765200019"}
