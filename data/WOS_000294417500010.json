In this paper, we first investigate the impact of NBTI on PMOS devices and propose a temporal performance degradation model that considers the temperature variation between active and standby mode. We then discuss the resemblance between NBTI and leakage mechanisms, and find out that the impact of input vector and internal node on leakage and NBTI is different; hence, leakage and NBTI should be optimized simultaneously. Based on this, we study the impact of standby leakage reduction techniques (including input vector control and sleep transistor insertion) on circuit performance degradation considering active and standby temperature differences. We demonstrate the potential mitigation of the circuit performance degradation by these techniques.", "paper_title": "Temperature-Aware NBTI Modeling and the Impact of Standby Leakage Reduction Techniques on Circuit Performance Degradation", "paper_id": "WOS:000294417500010"}
