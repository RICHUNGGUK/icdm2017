On the other hand, Stereographic projection can map a point in n dimensional real space into the surface of unit sphere in (n+1) dimensional real space. Because the modular length of any point in the unit sphere of (n+1) dimensional real surface is I and stereographic projection is a bijective mapping, Stereographic projection can be treated as an implementation for the normalization of vector in n dimensional real space. Experimental results shown that feed forward neural network can classify data instantly and accurately if stereographic projection is used to normalized input vector for feed forward network.", "paper_title": "Research on stereographic projection and it's application on feed forward neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600014"}
