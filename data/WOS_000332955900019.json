The activation function is unbounded and the uncertainties are norm bound. By the homotopy invariance and solution properties of the topological degree, the conditions for the existence of equilibrium are given out. Moreover, based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theory, the conditions of global robust stability for discontinuous delayed neural networks with uncertainties are presented in terms of linear matrix inequality. At last, an illustrative numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of results given.", "paper_title": "Global robust stability of uncertain delayed neural networks with discontinuous neuron activation", "paper_id": "WOS:000332955900019"}
