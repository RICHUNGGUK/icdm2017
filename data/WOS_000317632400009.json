Load imbalance among nearby cells often causes inefficient utilization of the system resources. Then in overloaded cells, users cannot get satisfied services for short resources, while in idle cells, there is plenty of unoccupied resources. However, switching users only for load balancing with no consideration of channel state often results in aggressive handover of users, which may occupy too many resources in their target cells and deteriorate the network efficiency. Thus, how to efficiently perform load balancing with the consideration of channel state becomes an important issue. Meanwhile, LTE network aims to serve users with different QoS requirements, which should be taken into account when performing load balancing. Thus we propose a multi-objective optimization problem, whose objectives are load balancing index and network average load for users with QoS requirements and a unified utility function for users without QoS requirements. The constraints are physical resource limits and users' QoS demands. Then we analyze its complexity and propose a practical algorithm, load balancing, with the consideration of different QoS requirements and channel state services (LBQC). Extensive simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed algorithm can approximate the optimal algorithm efficiently, and leads to significantly better performances than load balancing with no consideration of channel state, e.g. a lower new call blocking rate with a fewer system resources occupation for users with QoS requirements, a higher cell edge throughput and total throughput for users without QoS requirements.", "paper_title": "QoS and channel state aware load balancing in 3GPP LTE multi-cell networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000317632400009"}
