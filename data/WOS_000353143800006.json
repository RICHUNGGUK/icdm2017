In this paper, we consider a wireless network where the application flows consist of video traffic. From a user perspective, reducing the level of video distortion is critical. We ask the question \"Should the routing policies change if the end-to-end video distortion is to be minimized?\" Popular link-quality-based routing metrics (such as ETX) do not account for dependence (in terms of congestion) across the links of a path; as a result, they can cause video flows to converge onto a few paths and, thus, cause high video distortion. To account for the evolution of the video frame loss process, we construct an analytical framework to, first, understand and, second, assess the impact of the wireless network on video distortion. The framework allows us to formulate a routing policy for minimizing distortion, based on which we design a protocol for routing video traffic. We find via simulations and testbed experiments that our protocol is efficient in reducing video distortion and minimizing the user experience degradation.", "paper_title": "A Distortion-Resistant Routing Framework for Video Traffic in Wireless Multihop Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000353143800006"}
