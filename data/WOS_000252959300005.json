The proposed control laws are based on models that have been validated with real data acquired on two real biological SBR pilot plants. These models are presented in D. Mazouni et al., 16th IFAC World Congress, Prague, 5-8 July 2005. The validation results of these control strategies are presented and discussed.", "paper_title": "Optimal control of biological SBRs for the treatment of dairy and toxic wastewaters", "paper_id": "WOS:000252959300005"}
