These schemes can be applied to provide entity authentication, data origin authentication, non-repudiation, and data integrity verification. ISO/IEC 14888 consists of three parts under the general title Information technology-Security techniques-Digital signatures. Part II, or ISO/IEC 14888-2 specifies the general structure and the fundamental procedures for the generation and verification of an identity-based signature (IBS) mechanism for messages of arbitrary length. Particularly, the IBS scheme of Guillou and Quisquater (GQ) is described in Clauses 6-8. In this paper, an efficient identity-based multisignature (IBMS) scheme is proposed for the GQ IBS scheme, which allows multiple users using the ISO/IEC 14888-2 standard GQ scheme to generate multisignatures. The scheme is efficient in the sense that both the length and the verification time of the multisignatures are fixed. The proposed ID-based multisignature scheme is also secure against forgeability under adaptive chosen-message attack and adaptive chosen-identity attack in random oracle model.", "paper_title": "Efficient identity-based GQ multisignatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000266583500003"}
