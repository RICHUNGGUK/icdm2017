Given such a representation, we show that probabilistic processes on infinite words, under which each successive symbol is determined by a finite probabilistic choice, generate Borel probability measures on the represented space. Conversely, for several well-behaved types of space, every Borel probability measure is represented by a corresponding probabilistic process. Accordingly, we consider probabilistic processes as providing \"probabilistic names\" for Borel probability measures. We show that integration is computable with respect to the induced representation of measures. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
