The main contribution of this paper is to provide a mode through which a mobile user can receive transparent service environment during his mobility period using the benefits of service composition paradigms. We propose a novel service selection matrix that enables the selection of the services similar to the ones that user was previously using. We observed that the user context is not the only key to improve the service selection rather some selection heuristics are also needed. Those search heuristics are provided through the degree of adaptive similarity. Our over all objective is to achieve high levels of service consistency and quality of service at higher layers.", "paper_title": "A novel autonomic rapid application composition scheme for ubiquitous systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000241471800005"}
