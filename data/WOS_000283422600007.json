Existing robust dynamic programming methods cannot be extended to solving this class of general problems. In this paper, based on a robust optimality criterion, an approximate robust policy iteration using a multilayer perceptron neural network is proposed. It is proven that the proposed algorithm converges in finite iterations, and it converges to a stationary optimal or near-optimal policy in a probability sense. In addition, we point out that sometimes even a direct enumeration may not be applicable to addressing this class of problems. However, a direct enumeration based on our proposed maximum value approximation over the parameter space is a feasible approach. We provide further analysis to show that our proposed algorithm is more efficient than such an enumeration method for various scenarios.", "paper_title": "Approximate Robust Policy Iteration Using Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks for Discounted Infinite-Horizon Markov Decision Processes With Uncertain Correlated Transition Matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000283422600007"}
