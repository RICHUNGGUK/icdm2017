The term 'Ubiquitous' is referred firstly by Mark Weiser, which means the user based environment that provides network service 'any time, anywhere'. In the ubiquitous environment, the computing environment should have the device that recognizes the user and the environment. But there is not a verification process when dealing in sensitive information, and it may cause serious errors or malfunction. In order to complement the problem, members of the CCRA utilized CC(Common Criteria) to build up an assessment system and create a secured ubiquitous environment.", "paper_title": "Study on the common criteria methodology for secure ubiquitous environment construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200003"}
