Docking studies within the active site of TraR of fixed conformations obtained using molecular mechanics calculations showed that TraR, for which the crystalline structure is known, is a relevant model for the study of other protein-ligand interactions in the same protein family. Structure-activity relationships of AHLs derived QS modulators including carboxamides, sulfonamides and ureas were thus investigated. The results show that Tyr61, a residue conserved in the LuxR-proteins family, is involved in attractive interactions with aromatic carboxamide antagonists. Tyr-53, Tyr61 and Asp70, conserved residues, are implicated in both the development of additional hydrogen bonds and attractive interactions with the N-sulfonyl homoserine lactones and AHLs derived ureas antagonists.
