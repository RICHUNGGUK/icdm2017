It helps plant operators in monitoring and diagnosing of abnormal situations in refining process of lubricating oil. The LUBRES structure, the knowledge base, and the inference machine are presented in detail. A new strategy is proposed for conflicts resolution - the sorting strategy of antecedents, and a selection strategy of knowledge rules in the memory knowledge base. Knowledge acquisition mechanism is based on an empirical knowledge table, while knowledge verification is carried out based on the directed graph approach. C++Builder and SQL Server 2000 have been used in developing the proposed system. LUBRES has been successfully implemented in Microsoft Windows Server environment. For I year, LUBRES has been used for monitoring and diagnosing of refining process of the lubricating oil. The industrial application of LUBRES proved its high reliability and accuracy.
