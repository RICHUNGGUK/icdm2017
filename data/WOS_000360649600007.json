The method can be applied to any system where one can define a finite set of possible states of the system and an elementary process which transforms one state of the system to another. The method is based on the system symmetry; we get classes of states, which can be used instead of states. A detailed procedure is presented for undirected/directed and/or unweighted/weighted graphs. Several applications of the method are shown for different types of systems. In particular, new results are presented for the random Boolean networks.", "paper_title": "Classes of states of discrete systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000360649600007"}
