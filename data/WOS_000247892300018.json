In this study, a simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) is regarded as a network where each node and each edge respectively represent a population and the possibility of the transition between two nodes. The characteristic path length (CPL), which is one of the most popular criteria in small-world networks, is derived analytically and shows how much the crossover operation affects the path length between two populations. As a result, the crossover operation is not so useful for shortening the CPL.", "paper_title": "A network analysis of genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000247892300018"}
