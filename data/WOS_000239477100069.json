Students can invite the agent to a discussion session on MSN Messenger. The agent understands the students' questions in natural language, and provides answers or hints during the group discussion. Unlike a traditional natural language tutoring agent that converses with one student at a time, our agent needs to work with a group of students in MSN chat.", "paper_title": "Designing a tutoring agent for facilitating collaborative learning with instant messaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100069"}
