It is shown that the coefficient matrices of the global SBFEM equations for the rotationally periodic system are block-circulant when a symmetry-adapted reference co-ordinate system is used. Furthermore, both the eigenproblem and stiffness matrix equation are partitioned into a series of independent sub-problems. By solving these sub-problems via a partitioning algorithm, solution of the whole problem can be obtained at low computing expense. Two numerical examples are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed approach.
