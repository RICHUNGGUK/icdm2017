It consists of an overlay control and service layer that is deployed on top of IP-based mobile and fixed networks, in order to enable the seamless provisioning of IP multimedia services to 3G users. Service differentiation, which implies the network's ability to distinguish between different classes of traffic (or service) and provide each class with the appropriate treatment, is an important aspect that is considered in 3G networks. In this article, we present a critical review of existing service differentiation solutions and propose a new control-level call differentiation solution for IMS-based 3G core networks. The solution consists of a novel call differentiation scheme, enabling the definition of various categories of calls with different QoS profiles. To enable the support of such profiles, an extended IMS architecture, relying on two adaptive resource management mechanisms, is proposed. Furthermore, simulations are used to evaluate the system performance. Compared to existing service differentiation solutions, our solution offers several benefits, such as: flexible QoS negotiation mechanisms, control over many communication aspects as means for differentiation, and a dynamic and adaptive resource management strategy.", "paper_title": "Control-Level Call Differentiation in IMS-Based 3G Core Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000286385400004"}
