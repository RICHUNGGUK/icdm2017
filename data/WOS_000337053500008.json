The FMT proposed previously has a single track and vertebral structure. The flexed posture of the FMT determines its turning radius and direction; thus, knowing its posture is important. However, it is impossible to measure the shape of flexible mobile systems using sensors located internally, such as a rotary potentiometer, or located externally, such as a laser scanner. To solve the problem, we introduce the FDS to measure the flexed FMT shape. The sensor consists of two fixed electrodes, a sliding electrode, and a nylon string coated with carbon (NSCC). It works as a flexible potentiometer by moving the sliding electrode along the NSCC while maintaining electrical contact. The measurement system is implemented in a prototype of the FMT called RT02-WORMY and is validated in a series of experiments.", "paper_title": "Measurement System for Flexed Shape of Flexibly Articulated Mobile Track", "paper_id": "WOS:000337053500008"}
