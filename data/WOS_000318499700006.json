This cell is based on the popular self-cascode structure, and has been found suitable for use in low voltage design applications. The proposed cell has been characterized using 130 nm technology at supply voltage of 1.2 V. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the utility of the proposed cell in low voltage self cascode structures.", "paper_title": "Split length FGMOS MOS cell: a new block for low voltage applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000318499700006"}
