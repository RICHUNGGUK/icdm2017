When the problem was first formulated in 2001, Integer Linear Programming, an exact method, was found to be impractical because of large execution times. Since then, the problem has mainly been addressed by employing metaheuristic techniques. Objective: In this paper, we investigate if the single-objective and hi-objective Next Release Problem can be solved exactly and how to better approximate the results when exact resolution is costly. Methods: We revisit Integer Linear Programming for the single-objective version of the problem. In addition, we integrate it within the Epsilon-constraint method to address the bi-objective problem. We also investigate how the Pareto front of the bi-objective problem can be approximated through an anytime deterministic Integer Linear Programming-based algorithm when results are required within strict run-time constraints. Comparisons are carried out against NSGA-II. Experiments are performed on a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets. Findings: We show that a modern Integer Linear Programming solver is now a viable method for this problem. Large single objective instances and small hi-objective instances can be solved exactly very quickly. On large bi-objective instances, execution times can be significant when calculating the complete Pareto front. However, good approximations can be found effectively. Conclusion: This study suggests that (1) approximation algorithms can be discarded in favor of the exact method for the single-objective instances and small bi-objective instances, (2) the Integer Linear Programming-based approximate algorithm outperforms the NSGA-II genetic approach on large hi-objective instances, and (3) the run times for both methods are low enough to be used in real-world situations.
