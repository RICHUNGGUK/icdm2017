A tour is feasible if these constraints are fulfilled, and the objective is to find a feasible solution with minimum cost. A particle swarm optimization approach hybridized with a local search procedure is discussed in this paper. The method is shown to be very effective in guiding a sophisticated local search previously introduced in the literature towards high quality regions of the search space. Differently from standard particle swarm algorithms, the proposed hybrid method tends to fast convergence to local optima. A mechanism to self-adapt a parameter and to avoid stagnation is therefore introduced. Extensive experimental results, where the new method is compared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, show the effectiveness of the new approach. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
