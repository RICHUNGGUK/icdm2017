The results help clarify overall characteristics of human hand to inform many domains, such as the design of robotic manipulators, targeting rehabilitation toward important hand functionality, and designing haptic devices for use by the hand. It investigates the properties of objects grasped by two housekeepers and two machinists during the course of almost 10,000 grasp instances and correlates the grasp types used to the properties of the object. We establish an object classification that assigns each object properties from a set of seven classes, including mass, shape and size of the grasp location, grasped dimension, rigidity, and roundness. The results showed that 55 percent of grasped objects had at least one dimension larger than 15 cm, suggesting that more than half of objects cannot physically be grasped using their largest axis. Ninety-two percent of objects had a mass of 500 g or less, implying that a high payload capacity may be unnecessary to accomplish a large subset of human grasping behavior. In terms of grasps, 96 percent of grasp locations were 7 cm or less in width, which can help to define requirements for hand rehabilitation and defines a reasonable grasp aperture size for a robotic hand. Subjects grasped the smallest overall major dimension of the object in 94 percent of the instances. This suggests that grasping the smallest axis of an object could be a reliable default behavior to implement in grasp planners.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Human Grasping Behavior: Object Characteristics and Grasp Type", "paper_id": "WOS:000346319500004"}
