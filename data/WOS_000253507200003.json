To manage situations with time- and space-dependent body forces or source terms, this paper proposes a new approach through theoretical derivation and numerical verification. The method by attaching an extra term to the lattice Boltzmann equation is still used, but the expression of the extra term is modified. It is the modified extra term that achieves the particularity of the new approach. This approach can not only introduce unsteady and non-uniform body forces into momentum equations, but is also able to add an arbitrary source term to the continuity equation. Both the macroscopic equations from multi-scale analysis and the simulated results of typical examples show that the accuracy with second-order convergence can be guaranteed within incompressible limit.
