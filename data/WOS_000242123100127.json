In this paper we present an approach which integrates the autonomously obtained temporally-vague observations forming the global system perspective of the observed reality. This global system view is then extended in order to reach highest possible consistency. An effective and simple procedure for extending consensus obtained observations is proposed and discussed.", "paper_title": "An approach to resolving semantic conflicts of temporally-vague observations in artificial cognitive agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000242123100127"}
