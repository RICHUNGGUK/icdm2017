By replacing the faces of a uniform polyhedron with these necks, an HGF polyhedron corresponding to the vertex configuration of the polyhedron can be obtained. HGF polyhedra including tetrahedron, cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, icosahedron, and truncated icosahedron are proposed under the same construction scheme, which contains nonhexagons other than heptagons. Moreover, simple criteria for determining the stabilities of the proposed HGFs based on four geometric, parameters are discussed.", "paper_title": "Systematics of High-Genus Fullerenes", "paper_id": "WOS:000268138900005"}
