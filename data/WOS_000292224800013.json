In this paper, the neighborhood system is researched from the view point of knowledge engineering and then each neighborhood is considered as a basic unit with knowledge. By using these knowledge in neighborhood system, the rough approximations and the corresponding properties are discussed. It is shown that in the incomplete information system, the smaller upper approximations can be obtained by neighborhood system based rough sets than by the methods in [Y. Leung, D.Y. Li, Maximal consistent block technique for rule acquisition in incomplete information systems, Information Sciences 115 (2003) 85-106] and [Y. Leung, W.Z. Wu, W.X. Zhang, Knowledge acquisition in incomplete information systems: a rough set approach, European Journal of Operational Research 168 (2006) 164-180]. Furthermore, a new knowledge operation is discussed in the neighborhood system, from which more knowledge can be derived from the initial neighborhood system. By such operations, the regions of lower and upper approximations are further expanded and narrowed, respectively. Some numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments.
