UAV offers a great advantage in supplying reconnaissance data to the military personnel on the ground, thus lessening the life risk of the troops. In this paper we analyze various techniques for path planning and obstacle avoidance and cooperation issues for multiple mobile robots. We also present a generic dynamics and control model for steering a UAV along a collision free path from a start to a goal position.", "paper_title": "Path planning and obstacle avoidance for autonomous mobile robots: A review", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600070"}
