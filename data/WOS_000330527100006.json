Many important die design decisions are made based on technological knowledge, which is especially closely related to understanding the activities of product design and process planning. Due to the lack of such valuable knowledge within conventional three-dimensional computer-aided design systems, a concurrent system for supporting technological aspect of die design process is proposed within this article. The system that was developed on top of computer-aided three-dimensional interactive application CATIA V5 product lifecycle management software enables die design automation on the basis of constraint solving. Product design and process planning activities are accomplished concurrently by system's modules. Finally, it extracts relevant technological information and decisions directly to the die design phase. The system also represents unique basis for the development of some modules capable of automatic reasoning, regarding die design and performing actions on this basis. The experimental results showed that the use of this system significantly shortens sheet-metal product development cycle, improves its quality, and enables efficient training of inexperienced designers.", "paper_title": "Concurrent computer-aided design system for supporting technological aspect of cutting die design", "paper_id": "WOS:000330527100006"}
