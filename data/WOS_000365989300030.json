The fuzzy system is based on the Takagi-Sugeno model that is often used to represent the complex nonlinear systems in terms of fuzzy sets and fuzzy reasoning. To reflect more realistic dynamical behaviors of the system, the parameter uncertainties, the stochastic disturbances, and nonlinearities are considered, where the parameter uncertainties enter into all the system matrices, the stochastic disturbances are given in the form of a Brownian motion. The mixed delays comprise both discrete and distributed time-varying delays. By taking the relationship among the time delays, their lower and upper bounds into account, some less conservative linear-matrix-inequality-based delay-dependent passivity criteria are obtained without ignoring any useful terms in the derivative of Lyapunov functional. Finally, numerical examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "New Criteria of Passivity Analysis for Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems With Parameter Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000365989300030"}
