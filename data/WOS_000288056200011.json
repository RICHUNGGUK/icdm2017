Okhotin, Boolean grammars, Information and Computation, 194(1) (2004) 19-481. In particular, we propose a two-player infinite game of perfect information for Boolean grammars, which is equivalent to their well-founded semantics. The game is directly applicable to the simpler classes of conjunctive and context-free grammars, and offers a promising new connection between game theory and formal languages. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
