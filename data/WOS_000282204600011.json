Our simulations showed that EFXCP achieves excellent performance. However, the stability analysis in our previous paper neglected the feedback delay for simplification analysis, which is not consistent with that of present-day networks and make the analysis inaccuracy. To make the analysis more realistic and accurate, to portray the real network, we consider the stability analysis with the feedback delay and present a fluid flow of traffic model of EFXCP. Based on the model, we utilize classical control theory method to further analyze the stability of EFXCP. We also quantitatively define the efficiency and fairness index, and based on these definitions, we qualitatively analyze the efficiency and fairness convergence timings of EFXCP. These conclusions are validated by extensive NS2 simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
