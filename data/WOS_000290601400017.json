A berth, allocation model considering the scheduling of quay crane is developed first. Then a disruption management model is developed to recover the berth schedule when unexpected events happen, and simulation optimization approach is proposed to solve the model. To improve the computation efficiency of simulation optimization approach, algorithms based on local rescheduling and tabu search is designed. Numerical experiments indicate that local rescheduling based algorithm can improve the computation efficiency comparing to full rescheduling based algorithm. Moreover; the disruption management model considers the benefit of different parties, thus increases the scientificity of recovery schedule.", "paper_title": "DISRUPTION MANAGEMENT MODEL AND ITS ALGORITHMS FOR BERTH ALLOCATION PROBLEM IN CONTAINER TERMINALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400017"}
