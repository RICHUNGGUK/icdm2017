Those devices are often battery driven. Therefore, low energy consumption in embedded processors is important and becomes critical in step with the system complexity. The on-chip instruction cache (I-cache) is usually the most energy-consuming component on the processor chip due to its large size and frequent access operations. To reduce such energy consumption, the existing loop cache approaches use a tiny decoded cache to filter the I-cache access and instruction decode activity for repeated loop iterations. However, such designs are effective for small and simple loops, and only suitable for DSP kernel-like applications. They are not effectual for many embedded applications where complex loops are common. In this article, we propose a decoded loop instruction cache (DLIC) that is small, hence energy efficient, yet can capture most loops, including large nested ones with branch executions, so that a significant amount of I-cache accesses and instruction decoding can be eradicated. The experiments on a set of embedded benchmarks show that our proposed DLIC scheme can reduce energy consumption by up to 87% as compared to normal cache-only design. On average, 66% energy can be saved on instruction fetching and decoding, while at a performance overhead of only 1.4%.", "paper_title": "DLIC: Decoded Loop Instructions Caching for Energy-Aware Embedded Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000324173900006"}
