We focus on the generalization of the problem with higher connectivity requirements. The problem with one root and two sinks is APX-hard. The problem with one root and many sinks is as hard to approximate as the directed Steiner forest problem, and the latter is well known to be as hard to approximate as the label cover problem. Utilizing previous techniques, we strengthen these results and extend them to undirected graphs. Specifically, we give an Omega(k(epsilon)) hardness bound for the rooted k-connectivity problem in undirected graphs. As a consequence, we obtain an Omega(k(epsilon)) hardness bound for the undirected subset k-connectivity problem. Additionally, we give a result on the integrality ratio of the natural linear programming relaxation of the directed rooted k-connectivity problem.", "paper_title": "Approximating Rooted Steiner Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000345574900001"}
