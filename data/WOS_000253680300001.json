Under parameter variation, large supply and load disturbance, high slew-rate current transient, high nonlinearity in today and future power management integrated circuits, linear control theories used in traditional monolithic DC-DC converters cannot satisfy required performance, which make it stringent to use modern control theories in monolithic DC-DC converters. This paper proposes cascade controller which consists of PWM based sliding-mode-voltage control and current-mode control for high frequency DC-DC converters. As long as the dynamic responses of the inner current loop are much faster than the outer sliding-mode-voltage loop, inner and outer loops operate in cascade-mode functionally. This work leads to an easy-to-follow design procedure to design control coefficients. To illustrate the feasibility of the scheme, a monolithic 100 MHz boost DC-DC converter using cascade controller with sliding-mode-voltage and current-mode is designed in SMIC 0.18 mu m CMOS process. Several simulations are performed to validate the functionalities of the controller.", "paper_title": "Cascade controller with sliding-mode-voltage and current-mode for monolithic high frequency DC-DC converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000253680300001"}
