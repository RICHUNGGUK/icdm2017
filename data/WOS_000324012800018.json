This has been reported in the literature as the energy-hole problem. In this paper, we propose to establish equal energy dissipation condition over the network to mitigate energy-hole problem. We consider a data gathering linear array of wireless camera sensor nodes. Each camera sensor node generates one raw image per data gathering cycle. The raw image captured by each camera sensor node is processed locally and sent to the sink node using intermediate nodes. Exact placement of nodes is derived to ensure equal energy dissipation over the network. The raw image is locally processed using discrete wavelet transform (Dw-r). Network lifetime and peak signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) of the reconstructed image are calculated at the sink node for several test images. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
