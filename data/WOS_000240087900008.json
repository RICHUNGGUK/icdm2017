Disruption may be introduced by a handoff during active communication. In this paper, a method for significantly reducing network overhead as well as packet loss and packet delay by predicting the future cell when a mobile is near a cell boundary is presented. Packets are transmitted to the new base station before handoff occurs, and the mobile is allowed to hand off only to this cell. This process is called forced handoff. In addition, a simple topology to localize handoffs is proposed.", "paper_title": "A new low-latency forced handoff protocol for wireless cellular systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240087900008"}
