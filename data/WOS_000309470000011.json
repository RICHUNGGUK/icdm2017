Yet Nielsen and others have shown how quantum theory as it stands could breach the physical Church-Turing thesis. We draw a clear line as to when this is the case, in a way that is inspired by Gandy. Gandy formulates postulates about physics, such as homogeneity of space and time, bounded density and velocity of information - and proves that the physical Church-Turing thesis is a consequence of these postulates. We provide a quantum version of the theorem. Thus this approach exhibits a formal non-trivial interplay between theoretical physics symmetries and computability assumptions.", "paper_title": "THE PHYSICAL CHURCH-TURING THESIS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000011"}
