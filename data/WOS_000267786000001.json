By automatically bringing attention to anomalous events, without the need of previously defining those events, it can perform certain tasks that would otherwise require human scrutiny. This paper reviews some approaches to the problem when applied to the time series analysis problem.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Time Series Novelty Detection Strategies for Synthetic and Real Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000267786000001"}
