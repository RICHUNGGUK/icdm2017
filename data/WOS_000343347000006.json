The new approximations exploit recent heavy-traffic limits for the steady-state number of busy servers in the associated infinite-server model with the same arrival and service processes. In addition, a new heavy-traffic approximation is developed for the long-run proportion of time that all servers are busy. These new approximations are then combined to develop new approximations for the separate blocking probabilities of individual arrival streams in multi-class loss models. Simulation experiments show that these approximations are effective. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
