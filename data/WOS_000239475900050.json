Namely we suggest considering the class of full automata in lower bound analysis. Then we apply such technique to the complementation of nondeterministic w-automata and obtain several lower bound results. Particularly, we prove an Omega((0.76n)(n)) lower bound for Buchi complementation, which also holds for almost every complementation and determinization transformation of nondeterministic w-automata, and prove an optimal (Omega(nk))(n) lower bound for the complementation of generalized Biichi automata, which holds for Streett automata as well.", "paper_title": "Lower bounds for complementation of omega-automata via the full automata technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000239475900050"}
