In this paper, we propose a novel framework for automating the synthesis of regular NoCs with Vls, to satisfy application performance constraints while minimizing chip power dissipation. Our proposed framework uses a set of novel algorithms and heuristics to generate solutions that reduce network traffic by up to 62%, communication power by up to 32%, and total chip power dissipation by up to 13%, compared to the best known prior work that also solves the same problem.
