Based on the ratio of a defined measurement error relative to the norm of a state function, the introduced control updates are always event-triggered. A decentralized formulation of the related agents, which requires the states information of itself and their neighbors for the controller deployment, is considered. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.
