Using a feedback control combined with a discrete nonlinear programming method to adjust the transmission radii of sensor nodes located in different locations, makes network load redistribution possible and balances energy consumption, further prolongs the lifetime of the entire network. A data distribution model which specific to WSNs with sensor nodes that can adjust transmission radii is proposed to analyze the load spread of the network. This model contributes to predicting and analyzing energy consumption balance effectively. Compared with two other algorithms, dynamic transmission range adjustment and SP, respectively, the experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can lengthen the lifetime of WSNs by up to 22.7 and 27.2 %.", "paper_title": "Prolonging the lifetime of wireless sensor networks by utilizing feedback control", "paper_id": "WOS:000342229400028"}
