In order to solve the virtual machine placement problems in large scale, three algorithms are proposed. Firstly, we propose a physical machine (PM) classification algorithm by analyzing pseudotime complexity and find out an important factor (the number of physical hosts) that affects the efficiency, which improves running efficiency through reduction number of physical hosts; secondly, we present a VM placement optimization model using multitarget heuristic algorithm and figure out the positive and negative vectors of three goals using matrix transformation so as to provide the mapping of VMs to hosts by comparing distance with positive and negative vectors such that the energy consumption is saved, resources wastage of occupied PM is lowered, multidimension resource utilization is optimized, and the running time is shortened. Finally, we consider the poor placement efficiency problem of large-scale virtual serial requests and design a concurrent VM classification algorithm using the K-means method. Simulation experiments validate the performance of the algorithm in four aspects, including placement efficiency, resources utilization balance rate, wastage rate, and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "MTAD: A Multitarget Heuristic Algorithm for Virtual Machine Placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000363149100001"}
