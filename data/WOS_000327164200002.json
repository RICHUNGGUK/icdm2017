We find that in many cases such integrals can be \"experimentally\" evaluated in closed form or that intriguing linear relations exist within a class of similar integrals. Discovering these identities and relations often requires the evaluation of integrals to extreme precision, combined with large-scale runs of the \"PSLQ\" integer relation algorithm. This paper presents details of the techniques used in these calculations and mentions some of the many difficulties that can arise. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
