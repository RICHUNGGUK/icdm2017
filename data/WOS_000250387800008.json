The main research question we address in this paper is: Under which conditions can this task be accomplished by the robots? The studied robots are quite simple: they are anonymous, totally asynchronous, they do not have any memory of past computations, they cannot explicitly communicate between each other. We show that this simple task cannot be in general accomplished by the considered system of robots. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
