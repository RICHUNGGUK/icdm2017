In this paper, we develop an innovative framework, called PowerTracer, for diagnosing energy inefficiency and saving power. Inside the framework, we first present a resource tracing method based on request tracing in multi-tier services of black boxes. Then, we propose a generalized methodology of applying a request tracing approach for energy inefficiency diagnosis and power saving in multi-tier service systems. With insights into service performance and resource consumption of individual requests, we develop (1) a bottleneck diagnosis tool that pinpoints the root causes of energy inefficiency, and (2) a power saving method that enables dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) with online request tracing. We implement a prototype of PowerTracer, and conduct extensive experiments to validate its effectiveness. Our tool analyzes several state-of-the-practice and state-of-the-art DVFS control policies and uncovers existing energy inefficiencies. Meanwhile, the experimental results demonstrate that PowerTracer outperforms its peers in power saving.", "paper_title": "PowerTracer: Tracing Requests in Multi-Tier Services to Reduce Energy Inefficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000352491300014"}
