This problem has not been effectively solved in the research community. In this paper, we propose an improved energy function to tackle this problem by continuously rectifying the deviation of the level set function according to the signed distance function. This is achieved using an expectation-maximisation algorithm. Experimental work shows the proposed framework outperforms the classical level set algorithms in accuracy and efficiency of image segmentation. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
