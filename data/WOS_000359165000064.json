Previous studies have shown that the precise phase with which individual neurons are synchronized to some band might have consequences on further processing and for spike timing-dependent plasticity. Based on the theory of phase synchronization, we provide new insights into scientific findings, which may help to study the neurobiological phenomenon, so as to provide support for medical diagnosis.
