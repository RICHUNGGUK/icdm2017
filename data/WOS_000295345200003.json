The purpose of this paper is to develop a new methodology for wire diagnosis allowing the detection, localization and characterization of the fault in wiring network. Design/methodology/approach - The direct problem (propagation along the cables) is modelled by RLCG circuit parameters and the finite difference time domain method. This model provides a simple and accurate method to simulate time domain reflectometry (TDR) responses. Genetic algorithms are combined with this wire propagation model to solve the inverse problem and to deduce physical information's about defects from the reflectometry response. Findings - The results show the applicability of an inverse procedure dedicated to TDR for the localization and characterization of defects in simple wires and faulty wiring networks. With experimental results, the paper demonstrates the accuracy which can be provided for wire diagnosis. Practical implications - The work provides an efficient tool for the diagnosis of embedded wire networks. Originality/value - In this paper, a new method is developed and applied to detect, characterize and localize the defects in wiring networks: an inverse procedure is introduced for wire diagnosis. The presented methodology is applied for complex network structures and with measurement data.", "paper_title": "Recent progress in wiring networks diagnosis for automotive applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000295345200003"}
