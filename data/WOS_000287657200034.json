Performance is measured as the fraction of time an inferior arm (generating lower mean reward) is pulled. We derive a minimax lower bound that proves that in the absence of sufficient statistical \"diversity\" in the distribution of the covariate X, a property that we shall refer to as lack of persistent excitation, no policy can improve on the best achievable performance in the traditional bandit problem without side information.", "paper_title": "A Note on Performance Limitations in Bandit Problems With Side Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200034"}
