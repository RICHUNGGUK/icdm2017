On the other hand Esteva and Godo's monoidal t-norm based logic (MTL) and its involutive extension IMTL are strongly standard complete. In this paper we show that Pi MTL (an extension of MTL by the axioms characteristic of product logic) does not enjoy the strong standard completeness theorem like BL, Lukasiewicz, and product logic.
