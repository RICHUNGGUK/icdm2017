These laws are defined with respect to the key system parameters of per-node transmit power and the number of antennas exploited for diversity coding and/or beamforming at each node. We demonstrate that the local probability of connectivity scales like O(z(C)) in these parameters, where C is the ratio of the dimension of the network domain to the path loss exponent, thus enabling efficient boundary effect mitigation and network topology control.", "paper_title": "Connectivity Scaling Laws in Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800014"}
