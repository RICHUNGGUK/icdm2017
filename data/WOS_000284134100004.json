Next, they propose ALRED, a construction method for MAC functions based on a block cipher that has provable security in the absence of internal collisions. They apply this construction to advanced encryption standard (AES) resulting in two MAC functions: ALPHA-MAC and PELICAN. The authors provide a model for describing different types of internal collisions in ALRED and provide evidence that the security claims they propose are usable for MAC functions that use the ALRED construction. Finally, they provide a motivation for the security claims that accompany PELICAN.", "paper_title": "Refinements of the ALRED construction and MAC security claims", "paper_id": "WOS:000284134100004"}
