However, its scope is limited due mainly to the fact that this procedure does not currently provide tactile feedback without which the surgeon can neither feel nor palpate tissue. In this paper, we describe a new tactile display that reproduces these missing constituent properties of the tissue directly to the surgeon. The softness of different objects is regenerated based on the mechanical properties of those objects and fingertip pulp. The force-displacement non-linear behavior of several different materials is simulated using force feedback and a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for the linear actuator. Experimental tests show that the proposed tactile display can closely regenerate the feeling of softness for different objects by rendering the force-displacement curve to the surgeon's hand.
