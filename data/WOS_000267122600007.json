In this paper, we study this problem and provide some findings. We present a large-scale evaluation framework for personalized search based on query logs and then evaluate five personalized search algorithms (including two click-based ones and three topical-interest-based ones) using 12-day query logs of Windows Live Search. By analyzing the results, we reveal that personalized Web search does not work equally well under various situations. It represents a significant improvement over generic Web search for some queries, while it has little effect and even harms query performance under some situations. We propose click entropy as a simple measurement on whether a query should be personalized. We further propose several features to automatically predict when a query will benefit from a specific personalization algorithm. Experimental results show that using a personalization algorithm for queries selected by our prediction model is better than using it simply for all queries.", "paper_title": "Evaluating the Effectiveness of Personalized Web Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000267122600007"}
