The transmission of these codes is assumed to take place over a memoryless and symmetric channel. The new bounds, which are based on the Gallager bounds and their variations, are applied to the Gallager ensembles of nonbinary and regular low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. These upper bounds are also compared with sphere-packing lower bounds. This study indicates that the new upper bounds are useful for the performance evaluation of coded communication systems which incorporate nonbinary coding techniques.", "paper_title": "Performance Bounds for Nonbinary Linear Block Codes Over Memoryless Symmetric Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600007"}
