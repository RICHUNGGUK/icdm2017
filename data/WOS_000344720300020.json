Both the video source and MIMO-OFDM channel components exhibit nonuniform energy distribution. This has motivated us to leverage the source data redundancy at the channel to achieve high video recovery performance. We propose ParCast+ that first separates the source and the channel into independent components, matches the more important source components with higher-gain channel components, allocates power weights with joint consideration to the source and the channel, and uses pseudo-analog modulation for transmission. Such a scheme achieves fine-grained unequal error protection across source components. We implemented ParCast+ in Matlab and on Sora. Extensive evaluation has shown that our scheme outperforms competing schemes by notable margins, sometimes up to 6.4 dB in PSNR for challenging scenarios.", "paper_title": "ParCast plus : Parallel Video Unicast in MIMO-OFDM WLANs", "paper_id": "WOS:000344720300020"}
