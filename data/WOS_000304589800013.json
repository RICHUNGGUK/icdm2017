Several cellular automata update schemes and a tentative classification of such schemes are introduced and discussed. In order to analyze the effects of the different update schemes, a class of simple CA-called One neighbor binary cellular automata (1nCA)-is then introduced. An overview of the general features of 1nCA is described, then the effects of six different updates schemes on all the class of 1nCA are described.", "paper_title": "An analysis of different types and effects of asynchronicity in cellular automata update schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000304589800013"}
