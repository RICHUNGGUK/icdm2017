Orbit codes are constant dimension codeswhich are defined as orbits of a subgroup of the general linear group, acting on the set of all subspaces of F-q(n). If the acting group is cyclic, the corresponding orbit codes are called cyclic orbit codes. In this paper, we show how orbit codes can be seen as an analog of linear codes in the block coding case. We investigate how the structure of cyclic orbit codes can be utilized to compute the minimum distance and cardinality of a given code and propose different decoding procedures for a particular subclass of cyclic orbit codes.", "paper_title": "Cyclic Orbit Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100028"}
