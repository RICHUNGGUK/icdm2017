The difficulty with the problem is that there is a chicken-egg dilemma that each action needs to be extracted in advance for its recognition but the precise extraction is only possible after the action is correctly identified. In order to solve this dilemma, we use as many models as actions of our interest, and test each model against a given sequence to find a matched model for each action occurring in the sequence. For each action, a model is designed so as to represent any activity containing the action. The hierarchical hidden Markov model (HHMM) is employed to represent the models, in which each model is composed of a submodel of the target action and submodels which can represent any action, and they are connected appropriately. Several experimental results are shown.", "paper_title": "HHMM based recognition of human activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900026"}
