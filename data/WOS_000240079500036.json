Our method is composed of four main steps. First, point-based rough registration is performed for correcting gross translational mismatch. The center of inertia (COI), apex and hilar point of each unilateral lung are proposed as the reference point. Second, the initial alignment is refined by narrow-band surface registration. Third, thin-plate spline warping is used to accurately align inner region of the lung. Finally, enhanced vessels are visualized by subtracting registered pre-contrast images from post-contrast images. To facilitate visualization of parenchymal enhancement, color-coded mapping and image fusion is applied to subtracted images. Our method has been evaluated using eight pairs of pre- and postcontrast CT images by visual inspection, accuracy evaluation and processing time.", "paper_title": "Multi-stage registration for quantification of lung perfusion in chest CT images", "paper_id": "WOS:000240079500036"}
