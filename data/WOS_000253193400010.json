For this purpose, a suitable augmented observation equation is defined such that the optimal polynomial estimator of the original signal is obtained from the optimal linear estimator of the augmented signal based on the augmented observations and, hence, a recursive algorithm for this linear estimator is deduced. The proposed estimator does not require the knowledge of the state-space model of the signal, but only the moments (up to the 2 nu th one) of the signal and observation noise, as well as the probability that the signal exists in the observations.", "paper_title": "Polynomial fixed-point smoothing of uncertainly observed signals based on covariances", "paper_id": "WOS:000253193400010"}
