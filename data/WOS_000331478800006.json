The results for the three benchmark functions indicate that the proposed IOAP-FNN performs better than the other algorithms. In addition, model evaluation results also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm really can predict the picking cart's position more accurately. Moreover, unlike artificial neural networks, the proposed approach allows much easier interpretation of the training results, since they are in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
