In this work the problem of leakage detection is formulated within a systems engineering framework, and a solution methodology to detect leakages in a class of distribution systems is proposed. Specifically, the case where water utilities use standard flow sensors to monitor the water inflow in a District Metered Area (DMA) is considered. The goal is to design algorithms which analyze the discrete inflow signal and determine as early as possible whether a leakage has occurred in the system. The inflow signal is normalized to remove yearly seasonal effects, and a leakage fault detection algorithm is presented, which is based on learning the unknown, time-varying, weekly periodic DMA inflow dynamics using an adaptive approximation methodology for updating the coefficients of a Fourier series; for detection logic the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm is utilized. For reference and comparison, a second solution methodology based on night-flow analysis using the normalized inflow signal is presented. To illustrate the solution methodology, results are presented based on randomized simulated leakages and real hydraulic data measured at a DMA in Limassol, Cyprus.", "paper_title": "Leakage fault detection in district metered areas of water distribution systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000310047400012"}
