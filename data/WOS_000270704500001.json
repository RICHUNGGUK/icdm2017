MUMmerGPU 2.0 features a new stackless depth-first-search print kernel and is 13 x faster than the serial CPU version of the alignment code and nearly 4x faster in total computation time than MUMmerGPU 1.0. We exhaustively examined 128 GPU data layout configurations to improve register footprint and running time and conclude higher occupancy has greater impact than reduced latency.
