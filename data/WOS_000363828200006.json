The computational challenges encountered are overcome by employing a direct parallel multi-frontal method in conjunction with memory-efficient out-of-core storage of matrix co-factors. Comparison is drawn with complementary computational and experimental results for low Reynolds number flow where they exist, and a range of new benchmark solutions provided. These, in turn, are compared with corresponding solutions, for non-zero Reynolds number, from a simplified model based on the long-wave approximation; the latter is shown to produce comparatively acceptable results for the free-surface disturbance experienced, when the underpinning formal restrictions on geometry and capillary number are not exceeded.
