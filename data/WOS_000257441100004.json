The flexibility poses challenges for developing efficient collective communication algorithms since the network topology can potentially have a strong impact on the communication performance. In this paper, we consider the all-to-all broadcast operation on clusters with cut-through and store-and-forward switches. We show that near-optimal all-to-all broadcast on a cluster with any topology can be achieved by only using the links in a spanning tree of the topology when the message size is sufficiently large. The result implies that increasing network connectivity beyond the minimum tree connectivity does not improve the performance of the all-to-all broadcast operation when the most efficient topology specific algorithm is used. All-to-all broadcast algorithms that achieve near-optimal performance are developed for clusters with cut-through and clusters with store-and-forward switches. We evaluate the algorithms through experiments and simulations. The empirical results confirm our theoretical finding.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth efficient all-to-all broadcast on switched clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000257441100004"}
