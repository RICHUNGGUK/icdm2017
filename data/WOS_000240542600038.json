The new model considers the QoS guarantee as QoS optimization objectives rather than QoS constraints. It overcomes the limitations that exist in the traditional multicast routing model. Furthermore, a new routing algorithm to deal with the new model based on immune principles and Pareto concepts is given. In this algorithm, a gene library is introduced to speed up the algorithm to satisfy the real-time requirement of the routing problem. The initial experimental results have shown that the new algorithm can effectively produce more than one Pareto optimization solution compromising all QoS objectives within one single running.", "paper_title": "A new QoS multicast routing model and its immune optimization algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600038"}
