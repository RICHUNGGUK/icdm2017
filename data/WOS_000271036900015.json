A new method based on a switching technique is presented to solve this problem. A switched fuzzy system, which differs front existing ones, is firstly employed to describe a nonlinear system, and then some new concepts about the innovated SF system are introduced. Usually, this class of systems can precisely describe continuous and discrete dynamics as well as their interactions in the complex real-world systems. Next, the switched state feedback controllers for the proposed SF systems are built to ensure that the relevant closed-loop System is quadratically stable. Finally, switching laws of the state-dependent form achieving system quadratic stability of the SF system are given. The main conditions are given in terms Of Convex combination and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), hence they are easily solvable. The comparison of the elaborated example is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design approach. All results illustrate good control performances as desired.", "paper_title": "STABILIZATION AND SWITCHED CONTROL FOR A CLASS OF SWITCHED FUZZY SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900015"}
