What does a robot need to know to refer to the temporal aspects of events-could a robot gain a grounded understanding of \"a long journey,\" or \"soon?\" Cognitive maps constructed by individual agents from their own journey experiences have been used for grounding spatial concepts in robot languages. In this paper, we test whether a similar methodology can be applied to learning temporal concepts and an associated lexicon to answer the question \"how long\" did it take to complete a journey. Using evolutionary language games for specific and generic journeys, successful communication was established for concepts based on representations of time, distance, and amount of change. The studies demonstrate that a lexicon for journey duration can be grounded using a variety of concepts. Spatial and temporal terms are not identical, but the studies show that both can be learned using similar language evolution methods, and that time, distance, and change can serve as proxies for each other under noisy conditions. Effective concepts and names for duration provide a first step towards a grounded lexicon for temporal interval logic.", "paper_title": "Are We There Yet?
