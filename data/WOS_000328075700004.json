The Navier-Stokes and energy equations are reduced by a similarity transform in order for a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations to be formed. Then, governing equations will be solved analytically by using a kind of analytic technique for nonlinear problems which has been named the homotopy analysis method (HAM). The obtained results of this study have been compared with the results of differential quadrature method (DQM) as a promising numerical method. Very good agreement has been shown between analytical results and those obtained by DQ. Finally, effects of the Prandtl number and rarefaction parameter K on velocity and temperature profiles are investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
