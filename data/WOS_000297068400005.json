The conditional diagnosability is a novel measure of diagnosability by adding an additional condition that any faulty set cannot contain all the neighbors of any node in a system. In this paper, we evaluate the conditional diagnosability for augmented cubes under the PMC model. We show that the conditional diagnosability of an n-dimensional augmented cube is 8n - 27 for n >= 5.", "paper_title": "Conditional Diagnosability of Augmented Cubes under the PMC Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000297068400005"}
