This paper addresses the protection for the single-link failure in optical WCM networks and proposes a new and improved algorithm called Near Optimal Routing (NOR). For each connection request, the previous algorithm forst computes one primary path and follows to compute one link-disjoint backup path. In our proposed request, NOR can obtain the near optimal solutions by re-computing the primary or backup paths based on the rerouting policy. Simulation results show that he performances of NOR can be significantly improved compared to the previous algorithm. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
