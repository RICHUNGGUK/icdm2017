In particular, we make a distinction between four different types of fuzzy set multi-measures on a universe X, considering both the usual or inverse real number ordering of this lattice and increasing or decreasing monotonicity with respect to the number of arguments. We provide results from which we can derive families of measures that hold for the applicable conditions in each case. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
