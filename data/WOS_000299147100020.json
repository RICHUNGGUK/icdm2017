The main benefit that this architecture provides is a set of mappings that will allow designers to effortlessly obtain various types of OLAP metadata for several kinds of tools and users during the simultaneous generation of the database schema. Both processes are automatic and integrated. As a proof of concept, our approach is implemented in the Eclipse Modelling Framework, thus showing its feasibility and usefulness. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
