Radiographic measurement of cup orientation depends on the position and orientation of the pelvis on the X-ray table, and its variability could introduce significant measurement errors. We have developed a tool to accurately measure 3D implant orientation from postoperative antero-posterior radiographs by registering to preoperative CT scans. The purpose of this study is to experimentally and clinically validate the automatic CT/X-ray matching algorithm by comparing the X-ray based measurements of cup orientation with direct 3D measurements from postoperative CT scans. The mean measurement errors (+/- stdev) found in this study were 0.4 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees for abduction and 0.6 degrees +/- 0.8 degrees for version. In addition, radiographic pelvic orientation measurements demonstrated a wide range of inter-subject variability, with pelvic flexion ranging from -5.9 degrees to 11.2 degrees.", "paper_title": "2D/3D registration for measurement of implant alignment after total hip replacement", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556700080"}
