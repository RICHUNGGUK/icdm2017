We view the problem as being one of scaling the radii of the unequal circles so that they can all be packed into the container. Our algorithm is composed of an optimisation phase and an improvement phase. The optimisation phase is based on the formulation space search method whilst the improvement phase creates a perturbation of the current solution by swapping two circles. The instances considered in this work can be categorised into two: instances with large variations in radii and instances with small variations in radii. We consider six different containers: circle, square, rectangle, right-angled isosceles triangle, semicircle and circular quadrant. Computational results show improvements over previous work in the literature. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
