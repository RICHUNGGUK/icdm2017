It clusters the sequences into several groups in the first phase. A n-tuple data structure is designed to represent sequences and reduce the dimensionality. A more understandable and accurate method for measuring similarities SMCS among the above sequences is presented, which captures more specific information about sequences so that the similarity is computed more accurately. In the second phase, stratograms are employed to visualize the patterns. Stratogram provides more information, such as frequency of the sequences, which helps discover and extract significant patterns. The efficacy of the proposed method is verified on one real life dataset and one synthetic dataset, and experimental results show that the proposed method has advantages in accuracy, expressivity and comprehensibility in comparison with conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL TWO-STAGE SCHEME BUILT-UPON CLUSTERING FOR SEQUENTIAL PATTERN MINING", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601400020"}
