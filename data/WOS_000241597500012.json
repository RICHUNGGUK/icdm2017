The analysis is based on electric-field and magnetic-field integral equations. In the proposed design, the structure uses a combination of a thin circular disk dielectric resonator (DR) and a microstrip-fed dog-bone slot. This dog-bone slot works as a half-wavelength radiator and as a feed circuit for the DR. By optimizing the structure's parameters, the hybrid structure allows not only the DR to resonate at one frequency band but also the dog-bone slot to resonate at the other one with the required frequency separation. Based on the above design concept, an antenna prototype for wireless communication applications centered at 1.9 and 2.45 GHz is successfully designed, fabricated, and tested.
