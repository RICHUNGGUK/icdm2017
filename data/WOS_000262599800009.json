More particularly, supersaturated designs can be applied to decrease the number of calculations, because the number of simulations is inferior to the number of studied factors but its use is risky and depends on \"parsimony principle\". This paper shows new supersaturated designs that use the a priori knowledge and thus overcome this difficulty. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
