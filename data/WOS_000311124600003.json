Our polygonization algorithm repeatedly performs clipping operations on volumetric cells that correspond to a spatial convex partition and computes the boundary by traversing the connected cells. We use point-based representations along with finite-precision arithmetic to improve the efficiency and generate the B-rep approximation of a BSP solid. The core of our polygonization method is a novel clipping algorithm that uses a set of logical operations to make it resistant to degeneracies resulting from limited precision of floating-point arithmetic. The overall BSP to B-rep conversion algorithm can accurately generate boundaries with sharp and small features, and is faster than prior methods. At the end of this paper, we use this algorithm for a few geometric processing applications including Boolean operations, model repair, and mesh reconstruction.", "paper_title": "Efficient Boundary Extraction of BSP Solids Based on Clipping Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000311124600003"}
