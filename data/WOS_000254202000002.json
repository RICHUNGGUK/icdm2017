Since finding control policies using any RL algorithm can be very time consuming, we propose to combine RL algorithms with heuristic functions for selecting promising actions during the learning process. With this aim, we investigate the use of heuristics for increasing the rate of convergence of RL algorithms and contribute with a new learning algorithm, Heuristically Accelerated Q-learning (HAQL), which incorporates heuristics for action selection to the Q-Learning algorithm. Experimental results on robot navigation show that the use of even very simple heuristic functions results in significant performance enhancement of the learning rate.", "paper_title": "Accelerating autonomous learning by using heuristic selection of actions", "paper_id": "WOS:000254202000002"}
