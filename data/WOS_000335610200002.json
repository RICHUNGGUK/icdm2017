The model is shown to not be equivalent to any hyperchaotic system that the authors know of. In particular, the model does not display any equilibria, but can exhibit two-scroll hyperchaos as well as chaotic, quasiperiodic and periodic dynamics. For certain parameter values, coexisting attractors can be observed, e.g. hyperchaotic and periodic attractors. Investigation of the proposed system is performed through a combination of numerical simulation and mathematical analysis in order to obtain time plots, phase portraits, Lyapunov exponents, and Poincare sections.
