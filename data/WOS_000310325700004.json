According to the propagation direction of control packets, an existing OBS signaling can be classified as one-way or two-way signaling. The transmission of bursts in two-way signaling is guaranteed while in one-way signaling is unguaranteed, so the blocking rate in two-way signaling is less than in one-way signaling. But the end-to-end delay and operation complexity in two-way is greater than in one-way signaling. In this paper, we propose another two-way signaling named subscription-based tell-and-wait (S-TAW), which is a forward reserved, delay-configured and implicitly released two-way OBS signaling. By analysis and simulation, we show that S-TAW can reduce the operation complexity and end-to-end delay without greatly increasing the blocking rate, comparing with the existing best-performed two-way signaling-prebooking reservation mechanism.", "paper_title": "A subscription-based two-way signaling for optical burst switched networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000310325700004"}
