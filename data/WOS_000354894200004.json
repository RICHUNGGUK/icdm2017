The microblogging services have served more as news media outlets than online social networks. We use them to participate in some big events, as exemplified by predicting the H1N1 virus emergency, detecting earthquakes, and living World Cup Games. However, these kinds of burst events will cause peak access. It is unsurprising that servers will suffer from large amount of concurrent access and lead to significant impairment of availability. Furthermore, it will lead to asymmetric workloads, because of the divergent behaviours of users, social users and media users. Some media users or celebrities (e. g. Lady Gaga accounts for over 20 million followers) will generate a huge amount of traffic and lead to tremendous workloads. In this paper, we are in consideration of these problems together, and present SoMed, a hybrid DHT framework towards decentralised microblogging services. We evaluate SoMed by conducting simulations with real traces of Twitter. An experimental analysis illustrates significantly bandwidth saving and response time reducing with high QoS.", "paper_title": "SoMed: scaling decentralised microblogging services with a hybrid DHT framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000354894200004"}
