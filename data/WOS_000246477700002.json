Generally, the model is relatively more successful in predicting when the investors take actions than what actions they take and the extent of their activities. The findings do demonstrate the learning and predicting potential of the ANFIS model in financial applications, but at the same time, suggest that some of the market behaviors are too complex to be predictable.", "paper_title": "Predicting the impact of anticipatory action on US stock market - An event study using ANFIS (a neural fuzzy model)", "paper_id": "WOS:000246477700002"}
