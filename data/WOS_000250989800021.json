The cell has a function of a 4-valued universal literal which can be implemented using a Series-Gating Differential-Pair Circuit (SGDPC) having only one current source. A 4-valued universal literal can be realized by programming two subfunctions called half-universal literals. To reduce power consumption of a standby cell, ON/OFF-control and leakage-current reduction schemes are introduced in the current source. These technologies are effectively employed for low-power reconfigurable VLSI computing.", "paper_title": "Low-power multiple-valued reconfigurable VLSI using series-gating differential-pair circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989800021"}
