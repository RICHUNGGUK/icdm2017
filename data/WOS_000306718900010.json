By utilizing the allocated spectrum, cognitive radio devices can provide high throughput and low latency communications. This paper introduces an efficient dynamic spectrum allocation algorithm in cognitive radio networks based on the network utility maximization framework. The objective function in this optimization problem is always nonconvex, which makes the problem difficult to solve. Prior works on network resource optimization always transformed the nonconvex optimization problem into a convex one under some strict assumptions, which do not meet the actual networks. We solve the nonconvex optimization problem directly using an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Simulated annealing (SA), combined with PSO to form the PSOSA algorithm, overcomes the inherent defects and disadvantages of these two individual components. Simulations show that the proposed solution achieves significant throughput compared with existing approaches, and it is efficient in solving the nonconvex optimization problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM.
