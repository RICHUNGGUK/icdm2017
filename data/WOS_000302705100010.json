However, when used on 2-D data such as images, PPCA suffers from the curse of dimensionality due to the subsequently large number of model parameters. To overcome this problem, we propose in this paper a novel probabilistic model on 2-D data called bilinear PPCA (BPPCA). This allows the establishment of a closer tie between BPPCA and its nonprobabilistic counterpart. Moreover, two efficient parameter estimation algorithms for fitting BPPCA are also developed. Experiments on a number of 2-D synthetic and real-world data sets show that BPPCA is more accurate than existing probabilistic and nonprobabilistic dimension reduction methods.", "paper_title": "Bilinear Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000302705100010"}
