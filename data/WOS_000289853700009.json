Among them, one of the most used ones is Piecewise Linear Representation, probably due to its ease of use. This work tries to determine the difficulties faced by this technique when the analyzed time series shows noisy data and a large number of measurements and how to introduce the information about the present noise in the segmentation process. Both difficulties are met in the Air Traffic Control domain, which exhibits position measurements of aircraft's trajectories coming from sensor devices (basically surveillance radar and aircraft-derived data), being used as the motivating domain. Results from the three main traditional techniques are presented (sliding window, top down and bottom up approaches) and compared with a new introduced approach, the Hybrid Local Residue Analysis technique.", "paper_title": "PIECEWISE LINEAR REPRESENTATION SEGMENTATION IN NOISY DOMAINS WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MEASUREMENTS: THE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL DOMAIN", "paper_id": "WOS:000289853700009"}
