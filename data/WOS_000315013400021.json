This has triggered an increase in the number of companies' Web service registries. In this paper, we propose to use communities as a means to organize Web service registries in such a context. We provide an automatic and implicit approach to create communities of Web service registries using registries' WSRD descriptions. We also define the needed management operations to ensure the communities consistency during a registry/community life-cycle. Experiments we have made show the feasibility and validity of our community creation approach as well as the specified managing operations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
