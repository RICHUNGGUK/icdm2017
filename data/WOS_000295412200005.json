Results: We present ExomeCNV, a statistical method to detect CNV and LOH using depth-of-coverage and B-allele frequencies, from mapped short sequence reads, and we assess both the method's power and the effects of confounding variables. We apply our method to a cancer exome resequencing dataset. As expected, accuracy and resolution are dependent on depth-of-coverage and capture probe design.", "paper_title": "Exome sequencing-based copy-number variation and loss of heterozygosity detection: ExomeCNV", "paper_id": "WOS:000295412200005"}
