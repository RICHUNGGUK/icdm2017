We consider solutions Of H-systems which are of the form T : dom(T) -> C where either dom(T) = Z(d), or dom(T) = Z(d)\\S and S is the set of integer singularities of the system. It is shown that any natural number is the dimension of the solution space of some consistent H-system, and that in the case d > 2 there are H-systems whose solution space is infinite dimensional. The relationship between dimensions of solution spaces in the two cases dom(T) = Zd and dom(T) = Zd S is investigated. We prove that every consistent H-system H has a non-zero solution T with dom(T) = Z(d).
