The study was based on the assumption of a homogeneous deformation. Here, we extend the previous study by performing an inverse finite element material parameter estimation. This ensures a more realistic deformation state and material parameter estimates. The constitutive relations were compared on the basis of (i) 'goodness of fit': how well they fit a set of six shear deformation tests and (ii) 'variability': how well determined the material parameters are over the range of experiments. These criteria were utilised to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the constitutive relations. It was found that a specific form of the polyconvex type as well as the exponential Fung-type equations were most suitable for modelling the orthotropic behaviour of myocardium under simple shear.", "paper_title": "A finite element study of invariant-based orthotropic constitutive equations in the context of myocardial material parameter estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000272995400008"}
