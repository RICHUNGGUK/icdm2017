Measured BRDFs provide accurate representation with complex visual appearance, but have larger storage cost. Analytical BRDFs such as Cook-Torrance provide a compact representation but fail to represent the effects we observe with measured appearance. Accurately fitting an analytical BRDF to measured data remains a challenging problem. In this paper we introduce the SGD micro-facet distribution for Cook-Torrance BRDF. This distribution accurately models the behavior of most materials. As a consequence, we accurately represent all measured BRDFs using a single lobe. Our fitting procedure is stable and robust, and does not require manual tweaking of the parameters.", "paper_title": "Accurate fitting of measured reflectances using a Shifted Gamma micro-facet distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000305993000016"}
