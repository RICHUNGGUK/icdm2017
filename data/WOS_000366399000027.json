Based on Chinese remainder theorem and Schnorr signature algorithm, this paper proposes an efficient revocable group signature scheme in VANETs. In the proposed scheme, it only need to update the corresponding group public key when a member quits the group, and in the meanwhile the key pairs of unchanged group members are not influenced. Furthermore, this scheme can achieve privacy protection by making use of blind certificates. Before joining to the VANETs, users register at local trusted agencies (LTAs) with their ID cards to obtain blind certificates. The blind certificate will be submitted to road-side units (RSUs) to verify the legality of users. Thus, the real identities of users can be protected. In addition, if there is a dispute, users can combine to submit open applications to RSUs against a disputed member. And LTAs can determine the real identity of the disputed member. Moreover, since the key pairs employed by a user are different in different groups, attackers are not able to track the movement of users with the obtained public keys in a group. Furthermore, performance analysis shows that proposed scheme has less computation cost than existing schemes.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Revocable Group Signature Scheme in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000027"}
