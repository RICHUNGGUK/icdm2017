Uniform scaling is not ideal in such scenario, since it will result in loss of features and unwanted distortions. In this work, we propose a novel method for content-aware mesh resizing. Unlike uniform scaling, significant features can be well preserved after scaling. Compared with the seminal work by Kraevoy et al., our method does not need an auxiliary regular grid, and directly deforms the mesh models according to local sensitivity to geometric scaling. The method is efficient, easy-to-implement and produces reasonable scaling results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
