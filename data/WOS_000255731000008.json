Connection availability is studied under two basic path protection schemes. Different topologies are selected in order to have heterogeneity in geographic coverage, network diameter, link lengths, and average node degree. Connection availability is also computed considering the reliability data of physical components and a well-known network availability model. Results report some useful information to select the suitable protection algorithms according to the network topology features and the required levels of availability.
