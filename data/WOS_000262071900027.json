Indeed, computing the electromagnetic fields in this case is a challenge per se, as these geometrical singularities generate very strong solutions in their neighborhood. Moreover, they have also an influence over the solution of the Vlasov equation, through the coupling. We propose here a method to solve this problem, illustrated by numerical examples.
