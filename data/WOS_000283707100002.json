Methods. In Experiments 1 and 2 using blood labs from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and values derived from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) respectively, a proportion of glucose and HbA1c specimens were randomly mismatched A Bayesian network that encoded probabilistic relationships among analytes was used to predict mismatches. In Experiment 1 the performance of the network was compared against existing error detection software. In Experiment 2 the network was compared against 11 human experts recruited from the American Academy of Clinical Chemists. Results were compared via area under the receiver-operator characteristic curves (AUCs) and with agreement statistics. Results: In Experiment 1 the network was most predictive of mismatches that produced clinically significant discrepancies between true and mismatched scores ((AUC of 0.87 (+/- 0.04) for HbA1c and 0.83 (+/- 0.02) for glucose), performed well in identifying errors among those self-reporting diabetes (N = 329) (AUC = 0.79 (+/- 0.02)) and performed significantly better than the established approach it was tested against (in all cases p < .0.05). In Experiment 2 it performed better (and in no case worse) than 7 of the 11 human experts. Average percent agreement was 0.79 and Kappa (kappa) was 0.59, between experts and the Bayesian network. Conclusions: Bayesian network can accurately identify mismatched specimens. The algorithm is best at identifying mismatches that result in a clinically significant magnitude of error.
