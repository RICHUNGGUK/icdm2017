It considers the gate floating state for ESD protection and negatively gate biased for leakage suppression under normal operations. The circuit is achieved by adding a switch device and a negatively biased circuit at the gate of ESD protection devices. Robustness and leakage of ESD protection circuit are improved. The circuit suits thin thickness of gate oxide of complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) devices due to an elimination of oxide damage. This approach benefits design of very large-scaled integration circuit and implementation of system-on-chip with sub-100 nm CMOS devices. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
