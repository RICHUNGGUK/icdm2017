For the movement of the token within the computer network, two possible methods can be considered: perpetual mobility of the token and token-asking method. This paper presents a distributed token-based algorithm scheduling mutually exclusive access to a critical resource by the processes in a distributed network. This network is composed of N nodes that communicate by message exchanges. The proposed hybrid algorithm imposes a logical structure in the form of wraparound two-dimensional array on the network. It applies the concept of perpetual mobility of the token in columns and token-asking in rows of the array. The major purpose of the algorithm is to increase the scalability property and decrease overhead due to additional communication in a system with at least one unresponded critical section request at any given time. In this status, typically, the number of message exchanges is between root N and 2 root N under light demand and reduces to root N message exchanges under heavy demand. Therefore, it outperforms lots of well known algorithms in terms of number of messages exchanged. The algorithm satisfies safety and liveness properties. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
