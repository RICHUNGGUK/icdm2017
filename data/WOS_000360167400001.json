From bottom to top, the first tire of the network is the mobile data acquisition layer (DAL), the second tire of the network is the data transporting layer (DTL), and the third tire of the network is the data collection layer (DCL). A RF power control based topology management mechanism is proposed to balance the network load and to improve the network throughput. A lightweight hierarchical routing protocol (LHRP) was designed to reduce the transmission delay and improve the network throughput. For the mobile DAL nodes, the seamless mobile access mechanism (SMAM) was designed to ensure the low packet loss ratio. To evaluate the network performance, the end-to-end delay, the averaged reception ratio, and the network throughput of the DHMH were tested and the results proved that the network performance of the DHMH was improved.", "paper_title": "Implementation and Real-Time and Reliability Evaluation of a WHMS Improved by LHRP and SMAM", "paper_id": "WOS:000360167400001"}
