Many previous studies proposed dedicated protection architectures to protect the critical components, which results in high cost for deployment. To achieve high reliability and low-cost for deployment, this article proposes a novel fault-tolerant Multi-EPON system with cost-effective shared protection through Bridge ONUs. Under failures, the Bridge ONU controls the faulty EPON, plays the role of OLT and the transmission of faulty EPONs are restored by relaying to other interconnected adjacent EPONs. The minimum hop-count relay algorithm and the relay window mechanism are also proposed for the Multi-EPON system to efficiently help data relaying to the central office (CO). Furthermore, the one-wait dynamic bandwidth allocation enables the controller of affected Passive Optical Networks (PONs) to obtain more up-to-date buffer information from each ONU in order to enhance overall system performance. The simulation results show that the proposed Multi-EPON system can provide high system performance for different failure situations in terms of throughput, average delay, maximum delay, and expedited forwarding (EF) jitter, especially in high traffic loads.", "paper_title": "A novel fault-tolerant multi-EPON system with sharing protection through bridge ONUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200003"}
