Many researchers use the whole genome alignment method to detect a genomic meaning between genomes. In this paper, we introduce a new method for whole genome alignment with LOD(Level-of-Detail) representation. It helps us to understand a relationship between two genomes and determine candidate sets from the whole genome alignment result.", "paper_title": "Visualization of whole genome alignment with LOD representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600045"}
