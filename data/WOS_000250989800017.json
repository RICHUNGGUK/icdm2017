In this paper, a reconfigurable VLSI which realizes a high-performance sequential logic circuit based on a bit-serial operation is proposed. A universal sequential logic module (USLM) suitable for local data transfer in a programmed sequential logic circuit is presented. A redundant multiple-valued sequential logic operation is also proposed, where linear summation of time-by-time adjacent bits is fully utilized to increase the input/output throughput of a sequential logic circuit. Moreover, packet data transfer scheme is introduced to make programmable interconnection possible in the bit-serial data transfer between cells composed of the multiple USLMs.", "paper_title": "Universal VLSI based on a redundant multiple-valued sequential logic operation", "paper_id": "WOS:000250989800017"}
