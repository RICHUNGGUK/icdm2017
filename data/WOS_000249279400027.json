One such optimization task is the support vector machine (SVM) classification, which has been the focus of intense theoretical as well as application-oriented research in machine learning. In this letter, the incorporation of recent results in reduced convex hulls (RCHs) to a nearest point algorithm (NPA) leads to an elegant and efficient solution to the SVM classification task, with encouraging practical results to real-world classification problems, i.e., linear or nonlinear and separable or nonseparable.", "paper_title": "A geometric nearest point algorithm for the efficient solution of the SVM classification task", "paper_id": "WOS:000249279400027"}
