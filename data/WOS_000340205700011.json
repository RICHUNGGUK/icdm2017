This paper presents a basis expansions model for multi-label classification, where a basis function is an LP classifier trained on a random k-labelset. The expansion coefficients are learned to minimize the global error between the prediction and the ground truth. We derive an analytic solution to learn the coefficients efficiently. We further extend this model to handle the cost-sensitive multi-label classification problem, and apply it in social tagging to handle the issue of the noisy training set by treating the tag counts as the misclassification costs. We have conducted experiments on several benchmark datasets and compared our method with other state-of-the-art multi-label learning methods. Experimental results on both multi-label classification and cost-sensitive social tagging demonstrate that our method has better performance than other methods.", "paper_title": "Generalized k-Labelsets Ensemble for Multi-Label and Cost-Sensitive Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000340205700011"}
