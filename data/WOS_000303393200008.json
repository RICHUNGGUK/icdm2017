However, applications of cooperative communication are barely seen in reality. A main obstacle blocking its wide application is the lack of incentives for wireless nodes to participate in cooperative communication. We first survey the existing game theoretic solutions for providing cooperation incentives in cooperative communications. We then discuss the challenges in applying game theory to cooperative communications.", "paper_title": "GAME THEORY IN COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000303393200008"}
