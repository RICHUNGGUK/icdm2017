In our formulation, the convective part is linearized using a Picard iteration, for which there exists a necessary criterion for convergence. We show that our novel hybridized implementation can be used as an alternative method for solving a range of problems in the field of incompressible fluid dynamics. We demonstrate this by comparing the performance of our method with standard finite volume solvers, specifically the well-established finite volume method of second order in space, such as the icoFoam and simpleFoam of the OpenFOAM package for three typical fluid problems. These are the Taylor-Green vortex, the 180-degree fence case and the DFG benchmark. Our careful comparison yields convincing evidence for the use of hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method as a competitive alternative because of their high accuracy and better stability properties.
