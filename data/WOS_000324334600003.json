Unlike previous studies based on exhaustive enumeration of molecular graphs or on combinatorial enumeration preselected fragments, we used results of constrained graphs enumeration by Reymond to establish a correlation between the number of generated structures (M) and the number of heavy atoms (N): logM = 0.584 x N x logN + 0.356. The number of atoms limiting drug-like chemical space of molecules which follow Lipinsky's rules (N = 36) has been obtained from the analysis of the PubChem database. This results in M a parts per thousand 10(33) which is in between the numbers estimated by Ertl (10(23)) and by Bohacek (10(60)).", "paper_title": "Estimation of the size of drug-like chemical space based on GDB-17 data", "paper_id": "WOS:000324334600003"}
