However, this often places unduly high cognitive load on the user, particularly in terms of keeping track of multiple investigative branches, remembering earlier results, and correlating between different views. We propose a new methodology for automatically spatializing the individual steps in visual exploration onto a large visual canvas, allowing users to easily recall, reflect, and assess their progress. We also present a web-based implementation of our methodology called ExPlatesJS where users can manipulate multidimensional data in their browsers, automatically building visual queries as they explore the data.", "paper_title": "ExPlates: Spatializing Interactive Analysis to Scaffold Visual Exploration", "paper_id": "WOS:000321110500008"}
