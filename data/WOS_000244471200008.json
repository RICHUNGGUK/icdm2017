Topologies are optimized by minimizing the complexity of the topologies, maximizing the sharing of circuits between the different modes, maximizing the topology robustness with respect to circuit nonidealities, and minimizing the total power consumption. This paper presents a case study for designing topologies for a three-mode reconfigurable Delta Sigma modulator and compares the obtained topologies with a state-of-the-art design and topologies obtained using the Delta Sigma Toolbox.", "paper_title": "Systematic methodology for designing reconfigurable Delta Sigma modulator topologies for multimode communication systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244471200008"}
