Conflict freeness is the true concurrent version of the notion of confluence. A system is confusion free if nondeterministic choices are localised and do not depend on the scheduling of independent components. Ours is the first typing system to control behaviour in a true concurrent model. To demonstrate its applicability, we show that typed event structures give a semantics of linearly typed version of the pi-calculi with internal mobility. The semantics we provide is the first event structure semantics of the pi-calculus and generalises Winskel's original event structure semantics of CCS. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
