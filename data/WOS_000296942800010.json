However, many users are overwhelmed by the vast amount of data on the internet, which limits its potential significantly. To maximize the potential, extracting semantics from the raw data is one of the key technologies. The challenge on the extraction is that the data on the internet is often dispersed where a single property of a subject might have a list of values. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework that can extract useful semantics out of a semantic context in the dispersed data. Since the semantic information is vague in its nature, our framework deploys the fuzzy inference method to effectively extract the useful semantic. Experimental results show that the proposed framework is effective in realizing semantic web with abundant semantic information, which allows web users to entertain full potential of the internet.", "paper_title": "FUZZY-SEMANTIC INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR DISPERSED INFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000296942800010"}
