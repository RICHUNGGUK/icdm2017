Let u, v be two vertices of G from different partite sets. A collection of k internal vertex disjoint paths joining u to v is referred as a k-container C-k (u,v). A k-container is a k(*)-container if it spans all vertices of G. We define G to be a k(*)-laceable graph if there is a k(*)-container joining any two vertices from different partite sets. A k(*)-container C-k(*)(u,v)={P-1,..., P-k} is equitable if parallel to V(P-i )vertical bar-vertical bar V(P-j)parallel to <= 2 for all 1 <= i, j <= k. A graph is equitably k(*)-laceable if there is an equitable k(*)-container joining any two vertices in different partite sets. Let Q(n) be the n-dimensional hypercube. In this paper, we prove that the hypercube Q(n) is equitably k(*)-laceable for all k <= n-4 and n >= 5.", "paper_title": "On the equitable k*-laceability of hypercubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000248864800022"}
