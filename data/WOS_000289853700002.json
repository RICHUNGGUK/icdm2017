To analyse these structures, it is now possible to obtain serial images from large samples of nervous tissue in an automated manner through combined focused ion beam milling and scanning electron microscopy. However, the identification, 3D reconstruction and quantification of synapses within these samples are labor intensive procedures that require continuous user intervention. We have developed a software tool to achieve the segmentation of synapses in a reconstructed 3D volume of the cerebralcortex, thereby greatly facilitating and accelerating these processes. The tool is interactive, allowing the user to supervise the segmentation process, to modify the appropriate parameters and to validate the results. Some experimental results obtained with our tool in the rat cerebral cortex are also presented.", "paper_title": "FAST INTERACTIVE QUANTIFICATION OF SYNAPSES IN THE CEREBRAL CORTEX", "paper_id": "WOS:000289853700002"}
