Our NPSVM that is fully different from the existing nonparallel classifiers, such as the generalized eigenvalue proximal support vector machine (GEPSVM) and the twin support vector machine (TWSVM), has several incomparable advantages: 1) two primal problems are constructed implementing the structural risk minimization principle; 2) the dual problems of these two primal problems have the same advantages as that of the standard SVMs, so that the kernel trick can be applied directly, while existing TWSVMs have to construct another two primal problems for nonlinear cases based on the approximate kernel-generated surfaces, furthermore, their nonlinear problems cannot degenerate to the linear case even the linear kernel is used; 3) the dual problems have the same elegant formulation with that of standard SVMs and can certainly be solved efficiently by sequential minimization optimization algorithm, while existing GEPSVM or TWSVMs are not suitable for large scale problems; 4) it has the inherent sparseness as standard SVMs; 5) existing TWSVMs are only the special cases of the NPSVM when the parameters of which are appropriately chosen. Experimental results on lots of datasets show the effectiveness of our method in both sparseness and classification accuracy, and therefore, confirm the above conclusion further. In some sense, our NPSVM is a new starting point of nonparallel classifiers.", "paper_title": "Nonparallel Support Vector Machines for Pattern Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000342225800007"}
