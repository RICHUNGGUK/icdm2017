Additional master stations controlled the intercom system are required, and it is load to maintain the stations for general users. In order to solve these problems, we propose the digital living network alliance (DLNA) compatible family intercom system (DFIS): the architecture to support user mobility. This architecture makes it possible to quickly reach a family member without the knowledge of the extension number that caters to a fixed location. In other words, it will be not necessary to dial the extension number of the location of the desired person. We introduce call control and phone handling under the subject of DFIS architecture and demonstrate that the proposed DLNA family intercom device and DLNA family intercom adaptor can work well.", "paper_title": "Design and Implementation of the DLNA Family Intercom System for Smart Homes", "paper_id": "WOS:000272085300011"}
