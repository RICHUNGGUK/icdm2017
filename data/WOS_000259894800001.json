We empirically test this relationship using real-world software engineering data set containing over 500 software projects. The results of our experiments indicate that the hypothesized Cobb-Douglas function form for software development effort with respect to team size and software size is true. We also find increasing returns to scale relationship between software size and team size with software development effort. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
