Temporary relations are embedded in the network by adding feedback connections in the second layer of the fuzzy wavelet network. In addition, the study algorithm of the RCFWN is introduced and its stability analysis is studied. Finally, the RCFWN is applied in several simulations. The results verify the effectiveness of the RCFWN.", "paper_title": "Identification of dynamic systems using recurrent fuzzy wavelet network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000119"}
