The process of extraction often involves an enhancement of the images under consideration. The network employs multilevel sigmoidal activation function to segment true color images. Both these activation functions are characterized by fixed thresholding parameters, which do not incorporate the underlying heterogeneity in the image intensity gamut. Methods for incorporating dynamic thresholding mechanisms into the thresholding characteristics of the PSONN architecture are investigated in this paper. We also propose a parallel bi-directional self-organizing neural network (PBDSONN) architecture to address the limitations of the PSONN architecture. Three constituent BDSONNs in the proposed architecture process color component information by embedded adaptive fuzzy context sensitive thresholding (CONSENT) mechanisms. A source layer feeds the BDSONNs with input color component information. Another sink layer fuses the processed color component information into resultant outputs. Comparative results of the quality of the extracted/segmented images indicate the efficacy of the proposed PBDSONN architecture over the PSONN architecture with fixed as well as dynamic thresholding mechanisms.
