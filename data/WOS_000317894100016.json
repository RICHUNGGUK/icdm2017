More explicitly we will see that polylogarithmic cuts of models of V-0 are models of VNC1 by formalizing a proof of Nepomnjascij's Theorem in such cuts. This is a strengthening of a result by Paris and Wilkie. We can then exploit our result in Proof Complexity to observe that Frege proof systems can be sub exponentially simulated by bounded depth Frege proof systems. This result has recently been obtained by Filmus, Pitassi and Santhanam in a direct proof. As an interesting observation we also obtain an average case separation of Resolution from AC(0)-Frege by applying a recent result with Tzameret.", "paper_title": "POLYLOGARITHMIC CUTS IN MODELS OF V-0", "paper_id": "WOS:000317894100016"}
