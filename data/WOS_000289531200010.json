The calculated parameters indicated the effects of O-doping on the electronic environments of the first neighboring atoms of the doped sites. Comparing the results of the zigzag and armchair models also indicated that the latter model detects more effects of the O-doping than the former one.", "paper_title": "A computational study of atomic oxygen-doped silicon carbide nanotubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000289531200010"}
