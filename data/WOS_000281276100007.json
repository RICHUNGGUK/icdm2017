It seeks to examine the differences between USA, and Korean users. Design/methodology/approach - The study surveyed SNS users in the USA and Korea to determine the key differences between the two countries. Survey questions, developed in English and Korean, were presented in each country to explore the influences of various factors from the modified Technology Acceptance Model on SNS user dimensions. The analytic design methods were based on structural equation modelling and applied to the data gathered. The TAM factors of SNS were analysed, focusing on the differences in motives between the two countries. Findings - The results of the online survey of SNS users validated the proposed theoretical model's ability to explain and predict user acceptance of SNS very well. While the results illustrate the importance of both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, the two countries showed different sets of motivations, providing useful implications for theory and practice. Practical implications - Based on the results of the study, practical applications for marketing strategies in online SNS markets and theoretical applications for cross-national studies are recommended. Originality/value - Despite the burgeoning interest in SNS, only a few studies have explored the acceptance of SNS in a cross-national manner, leading to a paucity of information on how different cultures influence acceptance of online services.", "paper_title": "Analysis of online social networks: a cross-national study", "paper_id": "WOS:000281276100007"}
