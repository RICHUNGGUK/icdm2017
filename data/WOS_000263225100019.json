The time delay is assumed to be infinitely distributed in the discrete-time domain, and the uncertain parameters are norm-bounded. By using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) technique, sufficient conditions are derived for ensuring the exponential stability as well as the H. performance for the closed-loop fuzzy control system. It is also shown that the controller gain can be characterized in terms of the solution to a set of LMIs, which can be easily solved by using standard software packages. A simulation example is exploited in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed design procedures.", "paper_title": "Robust H-infinity Control for Discrete-Time Fuzzy Systems With Infinite-Distributed Delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000263225100019"}
