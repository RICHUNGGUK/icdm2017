Time delays exist in the regulatory effects from one gene to another due to the time needed for transcription, translation, and to accumulate a sufficient number of needed proteins. Also, it is known that the delays are important for oscillatory phenomenon. Therefore, it is crucial to develop a causal gene network model, preferably as a function of time. In this paper, we propose an algorithm CLINDE to infer causal directed links in GRN with time delays and regulatory effects in the links from time-series microarray gene expression data. It is one of the most comprehensive in terms of features compared to the state-of-the-art discrete gene network models. We have tested CLINDE on synthetic data, the in vivo IRMA (On and Off) datasets and the [1] yeast expression data validated using KEGG pathways. Results show that CLINDE can effectively recover the links, the time delays and the regulatory effects in the synthetic data, and outperforms other algorithms in the IRMA in vivo datasets.", "paper_title": "Inferring Time-Delayed Causal Gene Network Using Time-Series Expression Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000362909500019"}
