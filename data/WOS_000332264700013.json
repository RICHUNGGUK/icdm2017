To achieve maximum memory throughput with a lower computational runtime, two different Sort algorithms are introduced for reordering the initial system of equations: direct and step-by-step. It is shown that the latter method is well-fitted to modern GPUs and achieves speedup of up to 3.47x in single precision and 2.1 x in double precision compared to the CPU Thomas algorithm. By benefiting from the new global memory implementation, the CR solver could run 2 x -100 x faster compared to previous works on parallel tridiagonal solvers. The CR solver is also applied to 2D & 3D compressible viscous flow simulations using the high-order compact finite-difference scheme. In this matter, the procedure of filtering, primitive variables, and flux derivative calculations are carried out by using the parallel tridiagonal solver on the GPU device. The GPU-accelerated calculations achieve speedups between 1.9 x -15.2 x in 2D and 6.4x-20.3x in 3D simulations for different grid sizes compared to CPU computations. The computations are performed on the NVIDIA GTX480 GPU. The obtained results are compared to those achieved on a single core of Intel Core 2 Duo (2.7 GHz, 2 MB cache) in terms of calculation runtime. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
