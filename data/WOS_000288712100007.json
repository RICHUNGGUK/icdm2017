We show that the systematic process variation adversely affects the ability of the RO-PUF to generate unique chip-signatures, and propose a compensation method to mitigate it. Moreover, a configurable ring oscillator (CRO) technique is proposed to reduce noise in PUF responses. Our compensation method could improve the uniqueness of the PUF by an amount as high as 18%. The CRO technique could produce nearly 100% error-free PUF outputs over varying environmental conditions without post-processing while consuming minimum area.", "paper_title": "Improved Ring Oscillator PUF: An FPGA-friendly Secure Primitive", "paper_id": "WOS:000288712100007"}
