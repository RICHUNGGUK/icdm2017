Considering some existing problems in information retrieval processes, this work proposes a hybrid system that combines a model of the ART family neural network, ART2-A, with the Slim-Tree data structure, which is a metric access method. This approach is an alternative to perform clustering on data in an intelligent way so that the data can be recovered from the corresponding Slim-Tree. The proposed hybrid system is able to perform range and k-nearest neighbor queries, which is not an inherent characteristic in implementations involving artificial neural networks. Furthermore, experimental results showed that the performance of the hybrid system was better than the performance of Slim-Tree.
