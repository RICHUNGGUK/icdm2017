The volume of such content is increasing exponentially, making its search, analysis, and use more difficult and thus favoring advanced tools that aid in information search and processing. We propose an integrated framework that offers an infrastructure necessary for accessing, integrating, and analyzing multilingual user-generated content from different social media sites. Building on this framework, we develop the Dark Web Forum Portal (DWFP) that supports the gathering and analyses of social media content conceming security. Our evaluation results show that users supported by DWFP complete tasks better and faster than those using the benchmark forum. Participants consider DWFP to be better in terms of system quality, usefulness, ease of use, satisfaction and intention to use. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
