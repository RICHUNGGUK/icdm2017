Our model employs a part-of-speech weighting scheme and is based on a statistical bag-of-words approach. It does not require either hand-crafted knowledge bases or advanced syntactic tools, which makes it easily applicable to languages with limited natural language processing resources. By using a paraphrase recognition test, we demonstrate that our system achieves a higher accuracy than all existing statistical similarity algorithms and solutions of a more structural kind.", "paper_title": "Using Part-of-Speech Tags as Deep-Syntax Indicators in Determining Short-Text Semantic Similarity", "paper_id": "WOS:000352158200001"}
