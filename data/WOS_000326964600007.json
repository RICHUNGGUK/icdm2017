Its applications are broader and cover, in addition to presentation of knowledge, the complex organization of systems such as web sites. The paper presents a method for reaching consensus from several organizations of data/web site independently produced by different people. A class of methods was initiated, considering a number of parameters that can be chosen in order to match closely any specific real-life application. Although the methodology can be fully automated in terms of a suitable computer program, it is meant to be mainly a useful tool for experts in web site organization.", "paper_title": "A new approach to complex web site organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000326964600007"}
