In this letter, we present a new modulation scheme in this category, where we propose use of the Hamming code construction technique to systematically design the constellation. An illustrative example and experimental studies demonstrate that the proposed scheme introduces rich design flexibility and achieves better transmission rate, performance, and power tradeoffs with comparable hardware costs as compared with existing schemes.", "paper_title": "New Space Shift Keying Modulation with Hamming Code-Aided Constellation Design", "paper_id": "WOS:000209695900001"}
