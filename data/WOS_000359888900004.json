Unlike previous methods, our approach requires no manual construction of feature hierarchies or incorporation of other prior knowledge. Rather, like deep learning approaches using convolutional networks, our recognition networks are trained directly on raw pixel values. However, in contrast to convolutional neural networks, our approach uses 2D LSTM networks at all levels. Our networks yield per pixel mid-level classifications of input images; since training data for such applications is not available in large numbers, we describe an approach to generating artificial training data, and then evaluate the trained networks on real-world images. Our approach performed significantly better than others methods including Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNet), yet using two orders of magnitude fewer parameters. We further show the experiment on a recently published dataset, outdoor scene attribute dataset for fair comparisons of scene attribute learning which had significant performance improvement (ca. 21%). Finally, our approach is successfully applied on a real-world application, automatic web-image tagging. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
