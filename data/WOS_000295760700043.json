The fact that most real-world applications have to cope with some form of shift makes its study highly relevant. The literature on the topic is mostly scattered, and different authors use different names to refer to the same concepts, or use the same name for different concepts. With this work, we attempt to present a unifying framework through the review and comparison of some of the most important works in the literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
