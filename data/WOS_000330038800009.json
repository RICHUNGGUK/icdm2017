To integrate as much empirical evidence as possible from conflicting explanations of the conflicts the theory of securitization is applied. This allows to overcome the dichotomy of conflicting explanations, namely the thesis of ancient hatred and the thesis of political manipulation. To represent this theory, the simulation model consists of two agent classes: politicians, who enforce value orientations, and citizens, who form paramilitary militia. Simulation results reveal the mechanisms of securitization. Political actors can stimulate the emergence of ethnic mistrust and conflicts, but this ability is shaped by the network structure of the citizens.", "paper_title": "Securizitating the Nation: Simulating the Dynamics at the Case of Yugoslavia", "paper_id": "WOS:000330038800009"}
