But \"contexts\" of community residents are private information and should be treated very carefully. In this paper, we propose a novel information system called RUIS -Regional Ubiquitous Information System. RUIS can obtain and store regional information from network, realize robust security mechanism of personal/private information protection, and provide information that matches to residents' contexts. Using RUIS features we can realize \"smart watch over\" for children. We are working on the implementation of this application based on RUIS prototype.", "paper_title": "RUIS: Development of regional ubiquitous information system and its applications: Towards a universal ubiquitous information society", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600021"}
