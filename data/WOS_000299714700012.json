Recently, various approaches to emotion recognition have been proposed in the literature, but they do not provide a powerful approach to recognize emotions from Partially Occluded Facial Images. In this paper, we propose a new method for Emotion Recognition from Facial Expression using Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). This novel method is even able to recognize emotions from Partially Occluded Facial Images. Moreover, this research describes new algorithms for facial feature extraction that demonstrate satisfactory performance and precision. In addition, one of the main factors that have an important influence on the final precision of fuzzy inference systems is the membership function parameters. Therefore, we use a Genetic Algorithm for parameter-tuning of the membership functions. Experimental results report an average precision rate of 93.96% for Emotion Recognition of six basic emotions, which is so promising.
