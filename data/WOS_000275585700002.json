The methods are local and rely on adjusting gradients at the data points to insure nonnegativity of the spline when the original data is nonnegative. As part of the analysis, a new condition for the nonnegativity of the Cubic Clough-Tocher macro-element is obtained. More general range-restricted interpolation is also considered.
