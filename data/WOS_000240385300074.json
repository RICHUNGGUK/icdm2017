In this paper, we propose an effective and adaptive background modeling approach based on the eigenbackground [1]. Instead of learning the eigenbackground from the training set off-line and fixing it during the detection procedure, the proposed approach updates the eigenspace on-line and employs linear prediction model to detect moving objects. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to model the background and detect moving objects under various type of background scenarios and with close to real-time performance.", "paper_title": "Adaptive eigenbackground for dynamic background modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300074"}
