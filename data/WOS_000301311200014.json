We model this technology choice by having two firms simultaneously select from two production technologies in the first stage and subsequently take in a Cournot production quantity subgame. Conditions under which technology equilibriums exist are given. We find that the premium a firm is willing to pay for flexibility increases as the market size increases and the product substitutability decreases. We also find that Prisoner's Dilemma does not necessarily occur in the production technology game, which is different from previous studies. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
