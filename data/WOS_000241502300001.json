Compared with possibility measures, the advantage of credibility measures is the self-duality property. This paper gives a relation between possibility measures and credibility measures, and proves a sufficient and necessary condition for credibility measures. Finally, the credibility extension theorem is shown.", "paper_title": "A sufficient and necessary condition for credibility measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000241502300001"}
