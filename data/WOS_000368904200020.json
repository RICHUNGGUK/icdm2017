CQPH is a highly optimized and minimal-overhead execution engine designed to deliver real-time response for high-volume data streams. Unlike most of the other FPGA-based approaches, CQPH provides on-the-fly configurability for multiple queries with its own dynamic configuration mechanism. With a dedicated query compiler, SQL-like queries can be easily configured into CQPH at run time. CQPH supports continuous queries including selection, group-by operation and sliding-window aggregation with a large number of overlapping sliding windows. As a proof of concept, a prototype of CQPH is implemented on an FPGA platform for a case study. Evaluation results indicate that a given query can be configured within just a few microseconds, and the prototype implementation of CQPH can process over 150 million tuples per second with a latency of less than a microsecond. Results also indicate that CQPH provides linear scalability to increase its flexibility (i.e., on-the-fly configurability) without sacrificing performance (i.e., maximum allowable clock speed).", "paper_title": "Design and Evaluation of a Configurable Query Processing Hardware for Data Streams", "paper_id": "WOS:000368904200020"}
