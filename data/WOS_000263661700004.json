This transformation is based on a projection technique and results in a smaller (or equal) binary aggregation function. The transformation is idempotent and acts internally on the classes of conjunctors, semi-copulas and quasi-copulas. Hence, also copulas are transformed into quasi-copulas, but in general not into copulas. Remarkably, the Frank copulas are mapped to new copulas. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
