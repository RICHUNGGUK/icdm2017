By 'realistic' we mean problems that are modelled by partial differential equation (PDE) systems closed by sophisticated thermodynamics and hydrodynamics laws, set out over a terrain-induced geometry and associated with time-dependent boundary conditions. Although the combination of these techniques is not a straightforward matter, it is made possible via a careful examination of the objectives of the Simulation problem and suitable adaptations of which we shall give the details. Significant benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.
