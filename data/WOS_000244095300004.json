The next step is to consider a human body not only as a 3D shape, but as an active semantic entity with features, functionalities, interaction skills, etc. We are currently working on an ontology-based approach to make Virtual Humans more active and understandable both for humans and machines. The ontology for Virtual Humans we are defining will provide the \"semantic layer\" required to reconstruct, stock, retrieve, reuse and share content and knowledge related to Virtual Humans.", "paper_title": "An ontology of virtual humans - Incorporating semantics into human shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000244095300004"}
