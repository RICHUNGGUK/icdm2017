The PRISM uncertainty quantification framework (PUQ) offers several methods to sample the distribution of input variables and to obtain surrogate models (or response functions) that relate the uncertain inputs with the quantities of interest (QoIs); the surrogate models are ultimately used to propagate uncertainties. PUQ requires minimal changes in the simulation code, just those required to annotate the QoI(s) for its analysis. Collocation methods include Monte Carlo, Latin Hypercube and Smolyak sparse grids and surrogate models can be obtained in terms of radial basis functions and via generalized polynomial chaos. PUQ uses the method of elementary effects for sensitivity analysis in Smolyak runs. The code is available for download and also available for cloud computing in nanoHUB. PUQ orchestrates runs of the nanoPLASTICITY tool at nanoHUB where users can propagate uncertainties in dislocation dynamics simulations using simply a web browser, without downloading or installing any software.
