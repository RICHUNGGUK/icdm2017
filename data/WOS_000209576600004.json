However, the battery drain problem always bothers us. To understand this problem, we design and implement the Bugu service which aims to analyzing power and event information and providing users with detailed energy behaviors of applications. We analyzed 100 popular applications power behavior using Bugu on different platforms. The results showed several interesting observations, including radio service and hardware interrupts, that indicate the potential energy optimization for both applications and systems. We further revealed the underlying reason of different power consumption for several applications in case studies. For example, the low efficient usage of system service in iHeartRadio. Finally, lessons learned from software-based power profiling and the ground truth of application level power consumption is discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
