Motivated by known results in the study of fixed size list decoding for a point-to-point arbitrarily varying channel, we define for every AVMAC whose capacity region for random codes has a nonempty interior, a nonnegative integer Omega called its symmetrizability. It is shown that for every L <= Omega, C-L has an empty interior, and for every L >= (Omega + 1)(2), C-L equals the nondegenerate capacity region of the AVMAC for random codes with a known single-letter characterization. For a binary AVMAC with a nondegenerate random code capacity region, it is shown that the symmetrizability is always finite.", "paper_title": "On the Deterministic Code Capacity Region of an Arbitrarily Varying Multiple-Access Channel Under List Decoding", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163500009"}
