Secondly, we impose the finite index restriction on cooperating distributed grammar systems working in hybrid modes themselves, which leads us to new characterizations of programmed grammars of finite index.", "paper_title": "The Finite Index Restriction Meets Hybrid Modes in Cooperating Distributed Grammar Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000371496500008"}
