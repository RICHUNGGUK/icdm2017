The aim is to materialize and publish a secure view that satisfies the properties of \"inference-proofness\" and \"distortion minimality\". A comprehensive class of first-order constraints (representing a user's a priori knowledge and a confidentiality policy) can be handled by the presented algorithm in a sound and complete way: tuple-generating dependencies, denial constraints and existential constraints. The due proof of refutation soundness makes use of Herbrand's theorem and semantic trees. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
