Design/methodology/approach - A 1D parabolic partial differential equation with given initial condition and known boundary conditions and subject to overspecification at a point in the spatial domain is solved using the cubic B-spline scaling functions. Findings - In this paper, a numerical technique is developed for solving an inverse parabolic problem. Practical implications - The scheme described is efficient. The numerical results obtained using the new algorithm for a test problem show that the new method can solve the model effectively. Originality/value - The problem investigated in this research has already been studied by several authors. However, to the best of one's knowledge this is the first time that the new approach has been employed to solve the given model.", "paper_title": "A new technique for solution of a parabolic inverse problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000254029100027"}
