Many different kinds of growth patterns have been used in the literature to model the different types of realistic growth mechanisms. It is generally a matter of substantial benefit to the data analyst to have a reasonable idea of the nature of the growth pattern under study. As a result, goodness-of-fit tests for standard growth models are often of considerable practical value. In this paper we develop some natural goodness-of-fit tests based on finite differences of the size variables under consideration. The method is general in that it is not limited to specific parametric forms underlying the hypothesized model so long as an appropriate finite difference of some function of the size variables can be made to vanish. In addition it allows the testing process to be carried out under a set up which manages to relax most of the assumptions made by Bhattacharya et al. (2009); these assumptions are generally reasonable but not guaranteed to hold universally. Thus our proposed method has a very wide scope of application. The performance of the theory developed is illustrated numerically through several sets of real data and through simulations. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
