We consider three types of feedback delays: feedback with nonidentical delay, feedback without self delay and feedback with identical delay. Based on Lyapunov functional methods and stochastic analysis techniques, the synchronization problem of genetic oscillators are derived. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the derived results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
