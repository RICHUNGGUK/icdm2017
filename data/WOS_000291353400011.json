Designed in an SMIC standard 0.18 mu m CMOS process, mixed-signal processing can be performed by the assistance of an on-chip MCU and configurable digital blocks. Relative precision of the analog processing is 99.5%. A PID controller is shown as an application example. With a total die area of 11 mm(2), the maximum power consumption is 17.6 mA with a 3.3 V supply voltage, resulting in a 17x improvement in energy-efficiency over current conventional FPAAs.", "paper_title": "A reconfigurable analog processor using coarse-grained, heterogeneous configurable analog blocks for field programmable mixed-signal processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000291353400011"}
