A PadSpace proposes an extension of a typical Linda-like coordination model (tuplespace) to provide mechanisms for the interoperation among Web applications, Web services and end-users' local functional resources. First, a PadSpace provides an end-user supporting tool for composing Web applications, Web services, and local visual resources based on the meme media architecture without writing any program codes. It enables end-users to directly manipulate visual components, and to create new composite components for the creation of services that use Web applications, Web services, and local functional resources. Second, a PadSpace provides a spreadsheet-based service-coordination tool for end-users to orchestrate multiple Web applications, Web services, and local functional resources. Finally, we show some new applications of service composition and service orchestration.", "paper_title": "PadSpace: A new framework for the service federation of web resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000316020500009"}
