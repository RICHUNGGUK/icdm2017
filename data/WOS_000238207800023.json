The paper proposes a novel mechanism which consists of effective detection and response methods. Through analyzing sampled attack traffic. we find that there is a stable difference between attack and legitimate traffic in frequency field, especially in low frequency. We use Sum of Low Frequency Power spectrum (SLFP) for detection. In our algorithm the destination IP address is used as flow label and SLFP is applied to every flow traversing edge router. If shrew is found. all flows to the destination are processed by Aggregated Flows Balance (AFB) at a proper upstream router. Simulation shows that attack traffics are restrained and TCP traffics can obtain enough bandwidth. The result indicates that Our mechanism is effective and deployable.", "paper_title": "Novel mechanism to defend against low-rate denial-of-service attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238207800023"}
