The result shows that this system has complex dynamical behaviors, such as chaotic ones. It also shows that the system evolves into chaos through a series of period-doubling bifurcations.", "paper_title": "Chaotic dynamics of a five-dimensional nonlinear network", "paper_id": "WOS:000251156900003"}
