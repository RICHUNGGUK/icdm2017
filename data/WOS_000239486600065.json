One of such intrinsic properties can be described as geometric details. For point-sampled geometry, combining the Normal Geometric Details (NGDs) and the Position Geometric Details (PGDs), a useful interactive geometry local editing method is developed. The method deforms the sample points in a region of interest by manipulating handle points. In the preprocessing step, a non-local denoising algorithm is applied to smooth the input noisy point-sampled model and as a postprocessing step, a new up-sampling and relaxation procedure is proposed to refine the deformed model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by examples, i.e., the editing operation can deform the model while respecting the intrinsic geometric details.", "paper_title": "Detail-preserving local editing for point-sampled geometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600065"}
