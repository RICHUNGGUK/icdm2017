The objective of transmission is not to restore the message, but to partition active users into distinct groups so that they can, subsequently, transmit their messages without collision. We first calculate (by mutual information) the amount of information needed for the partitioning without channel effects, and then propose two different coding schemes to obtain achievable transmission rates over the channel. The first one is the brute force method, where the codebook design is based on centralized source coding; the second method uses random coding, where the codebook is generated randomly and optimal Bayesian decoding is employed to reconstruct the partition. Both methods shed light on the internal structure of the partition problem. A novel formulation is proposed for the random coding scheme, in which a sequence of channel operations and interactions induces a hypergraph. The formulation intuitively describes the transmitted information in terms of a strong coloring of this hypergraph. An extended Fibonacci structure is constructed for the simple, but nontrivial, case with two active users. A comparison between these methods and group testing is conducted to demonstrate the potential of our approaches.", "paper_title": "Partition Information and Its Transmission Over Boolean Multi-Access Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000348298400023"}
