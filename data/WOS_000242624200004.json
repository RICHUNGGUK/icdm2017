We propose a set of logical principles that guide such geographic classifications. These principles are represented as definitions and axioms of the first-order predicate logic. Then we demonstrate an application of these principles with a practical example of the \"National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units.\" The study presents a minimal set of entities and relation need for such formalizations and emphasizes the need to distinguish clearly between classes of ecosystems and ecosystems-individuals physically located on the Earth surface. The ontological framework proposed in the paper has the potential to be used to facilitate interoperability between such geographic classifications.", "paper_title": "Ontological investigation of a multiscale ecosystem classification using the \"National Hierarchical Framework of Ecological Units\" as an example", "paper_id": "WOS:000242624200004"}
