As a result, the analysis and the response provided by the automatic system are also envisioned to be continuous over the course of time, within the boundaries of digital machine output. The term continuous affect analysis is used as analysis that is continuous in time as well as analysis that uses affect phenomenon represented in dimensional space. The former refers to acquiring and processing long unsegmented recordings for detection of an affective state or event (e.g., nod, laughter, pain), and the latter refers to prediction of an affect dimension (e.g., valence, arousal, power). In line with the Special Issue on Affect Analysis in Continuous Input, this survey paper aims to put the continuity aspect of affect under the spotlight by investigating the current trends and provide guidance towards possible future directions.
