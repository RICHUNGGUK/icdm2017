The remote operation of the construction robot is achieved by manipulating the graphic robot in a virtual environment. Based on binocular vision, the ground surface is modeled as an elevation map, and the task objects are recognized from video images and reconstructed using the Power Crust algorithm. The virtual guidance forces consisting of a pair of attractive force and repulsive force from the objects and obstacles are used to enhance the multi-task manipulation of the tele-robotic system.
