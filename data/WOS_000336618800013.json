A second-order diffusion scheme based on the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is added to the viscous version of the SW model and tested for conservation behaviors. The inviscid flux-form SW model is found to have better conservation of total energy and zonal angular momentum while the vector-invariant form provides better ability of conserving potential enstrophy. The inviscid flux-form tends to generate spurious vorticity but the LDG scheme combined with a wellbalanced treatment can effectively eliminate the small-scale noise and generate smooth and accurate results.
