Motivated by applications in wireless multihop networks, we consider four fundamental problems under the power minimization criteria: the Min-Power b-Edge-Cover problem (MPb-EC) where the goal is to find amin-power subgraph so that the degree of every node v is at least some given integer b(v), the Min-Power k-node Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (MPk-CSS), Min-Power k-edge Connected Spanning Subgraph problem (MPk-ECSS), and finally the Min-Power k-Edge- Disjoint Paths problem in directed graphs (MPk-EDP). We give an O(log(4) n)-approximation algorithm for MPb-EC. This gives an O(log(4) n)-approximation algorithm for MPk-CSS for most values of k, improving the best previously known O(k)-approximation guarantee. In contrast, we obtain an O(root n) approximation algorithm for MPk-ECSS, and for its variant in directed graphs (i.e., MPk-EDP), we establish the following inapproximability threshold: MPk-EDP cannot be approximated within O(2log(1-epsilon) n) for any fixed epsilon > 0, unless NP-hard problems can be solved in quasi-polynomial time.", "paper_title": "Power optimization for connectivity problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244889700010"}
