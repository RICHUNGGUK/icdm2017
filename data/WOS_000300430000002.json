There is a constant need for remeshing: a wasteful procedure. In the framework of ALE formulations, a mesh movement scheme is presented, in which frame and elasticity analogies are loosely coupled. The resulting deformed mesh preserves the quality of elements, especially in the near-wall region, where accurate prediction of heat flux and shear stresses is required. The proposed scheme handles mesh deformation in a computationally efficient manner by localizing the mesh deformation. The 2D problem of ice accretion over single and multi-element airfoils is considered here as a numerical experiment. Experimentally measured glaze ice shapes were used to evaluate the performance of the present approach.
