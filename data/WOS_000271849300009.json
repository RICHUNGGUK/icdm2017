It aims to achieve a low generalization error by maximizing the information divergence between the distributions of different classes while minimizing the entropy of the distribution in each single class. We estimate the density of data in each class with Gaussian kernel Parzen window and develop an efficient and fast convergent algorithm to calculate quadratic entropy and divergence measure. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the traditional feature extraction methods in the classification and data visualization tasks. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
