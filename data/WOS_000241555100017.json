An appealing feature of CSS is that it specifies formatting instructions using rather simple guarded rules. A limitation of CSS is that it focuses on static formatting rules. As a consequence scripting languages such as ECMA Script are used in practice for dynamic adaptation of formatting. CSSNG is a novel extension of CSS 3, the newest version of CSS, introducing just a few rules for a dynamic rendering and for markup visualization. This limited extension of CSS 3 turns out to make possible a rather advanced visualization of programs. This article (1) introduces into the extensions of CSSNG with respect to CSS 3, (2) describes a proof-of-concept prototype implementation of CSSNG, and (3) demonstrates CSSNG on Xcerpt query programs.", "paper_title": "Web queries with style: Rendering Xcerpt programs with CSSNG", "paper_id": "WOS:000241555100017"}
