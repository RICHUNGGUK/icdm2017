To this end, we have developed a P2P distributed platform using Sun's MA technology, which is endowed with resource brokerage strategies to efficiently select peers using four selection models: (a) economic scheduling model: (b) priced-based model: (c) peer-priority selection model; and, (d) random selection model. Next, we have deployed the P2P platform in a real network using nodes of the PlanetLab and have experimentally evaluated the performance of the peer selection models. The P2P platform offers a user-friendly interface for efficient peer selection and configuration of the P2P platform. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
