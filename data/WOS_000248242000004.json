To further exploit its search abilities, in this paper we propose an SOM-based algorithm (SOMS) for optimization problems involving both static and dynamic functions. Furthermore, a new SOM weight updating rule is proposed to enhance the learning efficiency; this may dynamically adjust the neighborhood function for the SOM in learning system parameters. As a demonstration, the proposed SOMS is applied to function optimization and also dynamic trajectory prediction, and its performance compared with that of the genetic algorithm (GA) due to the similar ways both methods conduct searches.", "paper_title": "An SOM-based algorithm for optimization with dynamic weight updating", "paper_id": "WOS:000248242000004"}
