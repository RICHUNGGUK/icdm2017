The extensive use of WSN posed new challenges in terms of both scalability and reliability. This paper proposes Sensor Node File System (SENFIS), a novel file system for sensor nodes, which addresses both scalability and reliability concerns. SENFIS can be mainly used in two broad scenarios. First, it can transparently be employed as a permanent storage for distributed TinyDB queries, in order to increase the reliability and scalability. Second, it can be directly used by a WSN application for permanent storage of data on the WSN nodes. The experimental section shows that SENFIS implementation makes an efficient use of resources in terms of energy consumption, memory footprint, flash wear levelling, while achieving execution times similarly with existing WSN file systems.", "paper_title": "SENFIS: a Sensor Node File System for increasing the scalability and reliability of Wireless Sensor Networks applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000274327800006"}
