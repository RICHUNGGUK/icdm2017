This paper presents a fortification planning model for capacitated logistics systems in a two-stage stochastic mixed-integer programming framework. Considering limited protection investment budget, the model can deal with locating fortified facilities, pre-positioning emergency inventory and assigning emergency transportation under scenario-based random parameters. The risk mitigation combination of facility protection and emergency inventory pre-positioning policies is proposed to hedge well against accidental disruptions in the capacitated logistics systems. The revised disjunctive decomposition-based branch-and-cut (D2-BAC) algorithm for the model is developed by integrating with two types of valid cuts and dynamical 'truncation' strategy of the branch-and-bound tree. Extensive computational results confirm the computational performance of the proposed method and indicate that this model can provide a powerful tool for identifying best possible fortification strategies. It is also demonstrated that the risk mitigation combination can significantly increase the reliability of capacitated logistics systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
