We consider Performance Modelling Interchange Formats (PMIFs), which allow models to be specified in a uniform way and ported to a number of tools that solve them. We focus on extending the class of models describable in a PMIF that can be solved analytically - specifically, yielding a product-form solution for their equilibrium state probabilities. We use an extension of an established theorem, called the 'reversed compound agent theorem' (RCAT) as the basis of the analytical modelling tool into which the extended PMIF feeds models. We describe the RCAT methodology in practical terms, how it is integrated into an extended PMIF, and illustrate our methodology with three examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
