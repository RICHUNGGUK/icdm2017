The former finds sequential patterns Without considering the relationships between transactions in databases, while the latter finds inter-transaction patterns without considering the ordered relationships of items within each transaction. However, if we want to find patterns that cross transactions in a sequence database, called inter-sequence patterns, neither of the above models can perform the task. In this paper, we propose a new data mining model for mining frequent inter-sequence patterns. We design two algorithms, M-Apriori and EISP-Miner. to find such patterns. The former is an Apriori-like algorithm that can mine inter-sequence patterns, but it is not efficient. The latter, a new method that we propose, employs several mechanisms for mining inter-sequence patterns efficiently. Experiments show that EISP-Miner is very efficient and outperforms M-Apriori by several orders of magnitude. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
