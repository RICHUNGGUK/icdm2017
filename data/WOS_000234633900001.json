In order to determine the optimal shape, we have extended a measure theory-based method. Using an embedding procedure, the problem of finding the optimal shape is reduced to one consisting of minimizing a linear form over a set of positive measures. The resulting problem can be approximated by a finite dimensional linear programming problem. The solution of this problem is used to construct a nearly optimal shape. A numerical example is given to illustrate the method.", "paper_title": "Wing drag minimization by using measure theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000234633900001"}
