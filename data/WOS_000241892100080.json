All the researchers in the key frame algorithm are mainly focusing on the Euclidean object, without considering the fractal object. Fractal geometry can describe many irregularly shaped objects or spatially nonuniform phenomena in nature that cannot be accommodated by Euclidean geometry. In addition, the fractal objects in nature are almost colorful. Therefore, a computer aided inbetweening algorithm for color fractal graphics is presented in this paper. Our study shows that the fractal idea can be effectively applied in the key frame animation. The main feature of our algorithm is that it can deal with a fractal object while the conventional algorithm cannot. The theoretical and experimental results presented in this paper show that our algorithm has many practical values that can improve the efficiency of animation production and simultaneously greatly reduce the cost.", "paper_title": "Computer aided inbetweening algorithm for color fractal graphics", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100080"}
