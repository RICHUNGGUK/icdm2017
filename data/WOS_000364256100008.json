Using these lifting relations, a new hybrid FVM-LB method is presented (called Finite type-LB hybrid method), which is consistent with MRT-LBM. In this new hybrid method, single-particle distribution functions in MRT-LBM sub-domain boundaries are computed, using equilibrium and non-equilibrium moments. These moments are computed in Navier-Stokes/FVM sub-domain boundaries, using macroscopic variables and their derivatives. The new method is validated by solving three benchmark problems, i.e., two- and three-dimensional lid driven cavity flows and two-dimensional unsteady flow around a squared section cylinder. These problems are analyzed with pure FVM, pure LBM, and Finite type-LB hybrid method (FTLBHM) and the related results are compared with each other and with benchmark data. These comparisons clearly demonstrate the accuracy of the present novel methodology for simulating steady/unsteady flow fields in two and three dimensions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
