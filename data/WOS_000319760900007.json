The maximum clique problem is to determine in G a clique (i.e., a complete subgraph) of maximum cardinality. This paper presents an effective algorithm for the maximum clique problem. The proposed multistart tabu search algorithm integrates a constrained neighborhood, a dynamic tabu tenure mechanism and a long term memory based restart strategy. Our proposed algorithm is evaluated on the whole set of 80 DIMACS challenge benchmarks and compared with five state-of-the-art algorithms. Computational results show that our proposed algorithm attains the largest known clique for 79 benchmarks.", "paper_title": "An adaptive multistart tabu search approach to solve the maximum clique problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000319760900007"}
