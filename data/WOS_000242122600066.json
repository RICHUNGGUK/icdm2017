Thatcher, Fyfe and Jain [2] have suggested an intelligent landing support system, comprising of three agents, that will support the flight crew in the most critical phase of a flight, the approach and landing. The third agent is envisaged to act as a pattern matching agent or an 'extra pilot' in the cockpit to aid decision making. This paper will review a new form of self-organizing map which is based on a nonlinear projection of latent points into data space, identical to that performed in the Generative Topographic Mapping (GTM) [3]. But whereas the GTM is an extension of a mixture of experts, our new model is an extension of a product of experts [4]. We show visualisation results on some real and artificial data sets and compare with the GTM. We then introduce a second mapping based on harmonic averages and show that it too creates a topographic mapping of the data.", "paper_title": "Twinned topographic maps for decision making in the cockpit", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600066"}
