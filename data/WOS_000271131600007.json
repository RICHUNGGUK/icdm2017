Several methods exist to analyze the risk in a system, but all require a mature design, However. by applying the concept of \"common interfaces\" to a functional model and utilizing a historical knowledge base. it is possible to analyze chain of failures during the conceptual phase of product design. This paper presents a method based on these common interfaces to be used in conjunction with other methods such as risk in early design to allow a more complete risk analysis during the conceptual design phase. Finally, application of this method is demonstrated in a design setting by applying it to a thermal control subsytem.", "paper_title": "Function-based failure propagation for conceptual design", "paper_id": "WOS:000271131600007"}
