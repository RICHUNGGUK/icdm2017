It is found that a single QIFN is sufficient for the applications that require a number of neurons in different layers of a conventional neural network. Several benchmark and real-life problems of classification and function-approximation have been illustrated.", "paper_title": "Learning with single quadratic integrate-and-fire neuron", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000063"}
