But the majority of the current Retrieval Systems are based on plain syntactic analysis which makes it difficult for the user to find the exact required information. This paper proposes the Semantic Web based Information Retrieval System using an Ontology Server to enhance efficiency and accuracy of information retrieval for the Users' Preferences. Evaluation model is also proposed to measure the similarity between documents with semantic information. It is implemented and compared with the existing systems.", "paper_title": "Semantic web based information retrieval system for the users' preferences", "paper_id": "WOS:000253607500003"}
