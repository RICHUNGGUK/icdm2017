Current approaches to shape representation mainly focus on designing low-level shape descriptors which are robust to rotation, scaling and deformation of shapes. In this paper, we focus on mid-level modeling of shape representation. We develop a new shape representation called Bag of Contour Fragments (BCF) inspired by classical Bag of Words (BoW) model. In BCF, a shape is decomposed into contour fragments each of which is then individually described using a shape descriptor, e.g., the Shape Context descriptor, and encoded into a shape code. Finally, a compact shape representation is built by pooling shape codes in the shape. Shape classification with BCF only requires an efficient linear SVM classifier. In our experiments, we fully study the characteristics of BCF, show that BCF achieves the state-of-the-art performance on several well-known shape benchmarks, and can be applied to real image classification problem.
