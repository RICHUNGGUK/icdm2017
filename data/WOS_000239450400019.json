The goal is to boost the unit's efficiency and effectiveness. There are three different approaches proposed to help in designing adaptive multimedia systems for heterogeneous devices: server-side adaptation, proxy-based adaptation, and adaptation paths. Though there are a variety of approaches being proposed, evaluating content adaptation approaches using simulation is still lacking. This paper reports a simulation effort to compare the differences of performance among those three kinds of content adaptation approaches. A 2 by 5 factorial design was implemented to test the effects of five influential factors within the network. The result indicates that the service based approach is not only capable of adapting varied network environments but also have outperformed the other two. This could be used as a key reference for the optimization of content adaptation network.", "paper_title": "Simulations of distributed service-based content adaptation for network optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239450400019"}
