It is shown that for all odd q and all n = 1,2,..., lim inf(k ->infinity) mu(q2)(n, k)/kn <= 2(1 + 1/q - 2). For the proof of this upper bound, we show that for an odd prime power q, all algebraic function fields in the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower F-q2 over have places of all degrees and apply a Chudnovsky like algorithm for multiplication of polynomials modulo a power of an irreducible polynomial.", "paper_title": "An Upper Bound on the Complexity of Multiplication of Polynomials Modulo a Power of an Irreducible Polynomial", "paper_id": "WOS:000324573500046"}
