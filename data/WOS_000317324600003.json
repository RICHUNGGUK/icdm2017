Consequently, much work has been done to track the head in the 2D image plane using a single camera or in a 3D world using multiple cameras. Tracking the head in real-time with a single camera could be very useful for fall detection. Thus, in this article, an original method to extract the 3D head trajectory of a person in a room is proposed using only one calibrated camera. The head is represented as a 3D ellipsoid, which is tracked with a hierarchical particle filter based on color histograms and shape information. Experiments demonstrated that this method can run in quasi-real-time, providing reasonable 3D errors for a monocular system. Results on fall detection using the head 3D vertical velocity or height obtained from the 3D trajectory are also presented. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
