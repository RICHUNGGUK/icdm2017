This level of design representation may not be appropriate for test generation tools that usually require a model expressed at the gate level. Logic extraction is a key step in test model generation to produce a gate-level netlist from the transistor-level representation. This is a semi-automated process which is error-prone. Once a test model is found to be erroneous, manual debugging is required, which is a resource-intensive and time-consuming process. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of typical sets of extraction errors found in the test model representations of the pipelines in high-performance designs today. It also develops an automated debugging solution for single extraction errors for pipelines with no state equivalence information. A suite of experiments on circuits with similar architecture to that found in the industry confirms the fitness and practicality of the solution.", "paper_title": "Extraction error modeling and automated model debugging in high-performance custom designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239366800010"}
