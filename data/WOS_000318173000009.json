For a projectivity group of PG(2, q), we investigate the geometric properties of the (unique) I\"-orbit of size 90 such that the 1-point stabilizer of I\" in its action on is a cyclic group of order 4. Here lies either in PG(2, q) or in PG(2, q (2)) according as 3 is a square or a non-square element in GF(q). We show that if q a parts per thousand yen 349 and q not equal 421, then is a 90-arc, which turns out to be complete for q = 349, 409, 529, 601,661. Interestingly, is the smallest known complete arc in PG(2,601) and in PG(2,661).
