This letter examines the relevance of this dependency and shows how to adapt existing models in order to include it. The improved model is verified mathematically for down-converters, by means of Spice simulations and based on measurements of silicon integrated prototypes. Measurements demonstrate an accuracy improvement of up to 30 % compared with the conventional model.", "paper_title": "Accuracy improvement of the output impedance model for capacitive down-converters", "paper_id": "WOS:000304874300030"}
