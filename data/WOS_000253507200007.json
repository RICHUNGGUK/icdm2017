The mesh refinement and optimization are performed based on an algorithm that combines the so-called conforming centroidal Voronoi Delaunay triangulations (CfCVDTs) and residual-type local a posteriori error estimators. Numerical experiments in the two-dimensional space for various examples are presented with quadratic finite elements used for the velocity field and linear finite elements for the pressure. The results show that our meshing scheme can equally distribute the errors over all elements in some optimal way and keep the triangles very well shaped as well at all levels of refinement. In addition, the convergence rates achieved are close to the best obtainable. Extension of this approach to three-dimensional cases is also discussed and the main challenge is the efficient implementation of three-dimensional CfCVDT generation that is still under development.
