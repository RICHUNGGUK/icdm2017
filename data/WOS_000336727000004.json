In this article, we generalize this representation and propose a generic solver where other domains representations can be used. In this framework, we define a new representation for continuous domains based on octagons. We generalize local consistency and split to this octagon representation. Experimental results show promising performance improvements on several classical benchmarks.", "paper_title": "The octagon abstract domain for continuous constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000336727000004"}
