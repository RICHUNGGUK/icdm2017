This article is devoted to generalizing the originally proposed algorithm based on the correlation of modal parameters among the distributed fiber optic sensors to develop a method for both damage locating and quantifying. After a brief review of the distributed sensing techniques, the generalized method is proposed based on the originally proposed MMSV-based algorithm. Numerical case studies are performed to locate and quantify damage under different designed cases to verify the effectiveness and universality of the method. Experimental investigations on a simple beam under hammer impulsive excitation at different locations with arbitrary amplitudes are then carried out to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. An innovative idea on data interpretation and feature extraction is described. On the basis of the experimental and numerical investigations, an integrated model-free scheme for damage locating and quantifying is finally summarized for proposal.", "paper_title": "A model-free method for damage locating and quantifying in a beam-like structure based on dynamic distributed strain measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000255492400007"}
