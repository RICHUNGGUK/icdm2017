Additionally, without MPLS to establish the desired end-to-end paths, hop-by-hop routing load balancing is more difficult to achieve than the source routing; however, it can significantly improve network performance. In this paper, we propose a load balancing scheme with hop-by-hop routing, by using the burstiness features of flows to make sure that the packets of the same flow arrive at the receiving end in order. Simulation results show that our algorithm can adapt to the dynamic changes of the end-to-end delay and the routing vector, and also can achieve fine-gained load balancing.", "paper_title": "Dynamic load distribution with hop-by-hop forwarding based on max-min one-way delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000339228800010"}
