This paper addresses the problem of interconnection networks performance modeling of large-scale distributed systems with emphases on heterogeneous multi-cluster computing systems. We present an analytical model to predict message latency in multi-cluster systems in the presence of node, network and system organization heterogeneity. The model is validated through comprehensive simulation, which demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits a good degree of accuracy for various system organizations and under different working conditions.", "paper_title": "Analytical modeling of interconnection networks in heterogeneous multi-cluster systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000245792400002"}
