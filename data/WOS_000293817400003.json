For this purpose, a hybrid fuzzy linear regression (FLR) and back propagation network (BPN) approach is proposed in this study. In the proposed approach, multiple experts construct their own fuzzy multiple linear regression models from various viewpoints to forecast the future WIP level. Each fuzzy multiple linear regression model can be converted into two equivalent nonlinear programming problems to be solved. To aggregate these fuzzy WIP level forecasts, a two-step aggregation mechanism is applied. At the first step, fuzzy intersection is applied to aggregate the fuzzy WIP level forecasts into a polygon-shaped fuzzy number, in order to improve the precision. After that, a back propagation network is constructed to defuzzify the polygon-shaped fuzzy number and generate a representative/crisp value, so as to enhance the accuracy. A real example is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. According to experimental results, the proposed methodology improved both the precision and accuracy of WIP level forecasting by 53% and 24%, respectively.", "paper_title": "FUTURE WIP LEVEL FORECASTING IN A WAFER FABRICATION FACTORY WITH A HYBRID FUZZY AND NEURAL APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000293817400003"}
