In particular, providing satisfactory security service in IoT systems is indispensable to its mission critical applications. However, limited resources prevent full security coverage at all times. Therefore, these limited resources must be deployed intelligently by considering differences in priorities of targets that require security coverage. In this study, we have developed a new application of Cognitive Radio (CR) technology for IoT systems and provide an appropriate security solution that will enable IoT to be more affordable and applicable than it is currently. To resolve the security-related resource allocation problem, game theory is a suitable and effective tool. Based on the Blotto game model, we propose a new strategic power allocation scheme to ensure secure CR communications. A simulation shows that our proposed scheme can effectively respond to current system conditions and perform more effectively than other existing schemes in dynamically changeable IoT environments.", "paper_title": "Cognitive Radio Anti-Jamming Scheme for Security Provisioning IoT Communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000366399000023"}
