Evolutionary Computation (EC) is widely used to optimize embedding parameters in intelligent watermarking (IW) systems. Traditional IW methods represent all blocks of a cover image as candidate embedding solutions of EC algorithms, and suffer from premature convergence when dealing with high resolution grayscale facial images. For instance, the dimensionality of the optimization problem to process a 2048 x 1536 pixel grayscale facial image that embeds 1 bit per 8 x 8 pixel block involves 491( variables represented with 293k binary bits. Such Large-Scale Global Optimization problems cannot be decomposed into smaller independent ones because watermarking metrics are calculated for the entire image. In this paper, a Blockwise Coevolutionary Genetic Algorithm (BCGA) is proposed for high dimensional IW optimization of embedding parameters of high resolution images. BCGA is based on the cooperative coevolution between different candidate solutions at the block level, using a local Block Watermarking Metric (BWM). It is characterized by a novel elitism mechanism that is driven by local blockwise metrics, where the blocks with higher BWM values are selected to form higher global fitness candidate solutions. The crossover and mutation operators of BCGA are performed on block level. Experimental results on PUT face image database indicate a 17% improvement of fitness produced by BCGA compared to classical GA. Due to improved exploration capabilities, BCGA convergence is reached in fewer generations indicating an optimization speedup. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
