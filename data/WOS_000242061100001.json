It is a challenging task to build QoS constrained multicast trees with high performance and high success ratio. The Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) can provide high-speed, high-transmission capacity and bandwidth efficiency to proceed with the multipoint-to-multipoint multicast transmission. Reserved paths with the form of a tree are not the ideal topology for the multipoint-to-multipoint multicast transmission because transceivers and reserved wavelength channels will lead to some other new connections that cannot be held at the same time. This paper presents a new Hybrid Routing and Wavelength Assignment with delay constraint (HRWA-DC) multicast algorithm on WDM mesh networks, which reduces the number of searching ring paths to achieve low complexity and the number of links to increase the number of successful connections. Simulation result shows that HRWA-DC is more effective for resource utilization than tree scheme in terms of lower call blocking probability and link utilization even at tight delay constraint. It is suitable for big group size and long holding time for multipoint-to-multipoint multicast transmission.", "paper_title": "A QoS-based HRWA multicast scheme with resource constraint on WDM mesh networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242061100001"}
