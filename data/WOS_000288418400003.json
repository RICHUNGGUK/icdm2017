Results are then completely ordered with respect to these bipolar preferences, giving priority to constraints over wishes. Additionally, we propose a treatment that allows us to guarantee that any query will return a result, even if no element satisfies all constraints specified by the user. Such a treatment may be useful when user's constraints are unrealistic (i.e., cannot be all satisfied simultaneously) and when the user desires a guaranteed result. The approach is illustrated on a real-world problem concerning the selection of optimal packaging for fresh fruits and vegetables. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
