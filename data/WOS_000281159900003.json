The new method is based on the concept that if an ANC is valid, the recovered signal should be uncorrelated to the noise source. Then, a new correlation test between recovered signal and noise source is periodically computed to online check the validity of noise cancellers when ANCs are in operation. Simulation demonstrations on validity monitoring for recursive least squares-based ANC are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new procedure.", "paper_title": "A correlation test-based validity monitoring procedure for online detecting the quality of nonlinear adaptive noise cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000281159900003"}
