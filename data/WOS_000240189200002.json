Machine understanding of human facial signals could revolutionize user-adaptive social interfaces, the integral part of ambient intelligence technologies. Nonetheless, development of a face-based ambient interface that detects and interprets human facial signals is rather difficult. This article summarizes our efforts in achieving this goal, enumerates the scientific and engineering issues that arise in meeting this challenge and outlines recommendations for accomplishing this objective.", "paper_title": "Face for ambient interface", "paper_id": "WOS:000240189200002"}
