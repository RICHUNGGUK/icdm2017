Hence, there is a need for precise facial feature detectors, as well as objective measures for their evaluation and comparison. In this paper, we will present significant improvements to a previous method for precise eye center localization, by integrating a module for mouth localization. The technique is based on Support Vector Machines trained on optimally chosen Haar wavelet coefficients. The method has been tested on several public databases; the results are reported and compared according to a standard error measure. The tests show that the algorithm achieves high precision of localization.", "paper_title": "PRECISE EYE AND MOUTH LOCALIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000267114600002"}
