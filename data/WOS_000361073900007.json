Each probabilistic input parameter is substituted by its two point estimates. Half-factorial and central composite designs are implemented to obtain a minimum number of representative slope realizations to model. The output from the numerical models is used to construct mathematical prediction models or response surfaces. A response surface can be used to predict the factor of safety of arbitrary realizations without further numerical modelling and can be used to determine the probability of slope failure.
