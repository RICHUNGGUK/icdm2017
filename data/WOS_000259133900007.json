Thus, the remaining living nodes should be well-protected against failure when parts of replicated nodes have failed. Design faults and system-specific weaknesses may cause chain reactions of common faults on identical replicated nodes in replication systems. These can be alleviated by replicating diverse hardware and software. Going one-step forward, failures on the remaining nodes can be suppressed by predicting and preventing the same fault when it has occurred on a replicated node. In this paper, we propose a fault avoidance scheme which increases system dependability by avoiding common faults on remaining nodes when parts of nodes fail, and analyze the system dependability.
