However, a salient and consistent feature of most roads or tracks regardless of type of the environments is that their edges, boundaries, and even ruts and tire tracks left by previous vehicles on the path appear to converge into a single point known as the vanishing point. Hence, estimating this vanishing point plays a pivotal role in the determination of the direction of the road. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology based on image texture analysis for the fast estimation of the vanishing point in challenging and unstructured roads. The key attributes of the methodology consist of the optimal local dominant orientation method that uses joint activities of only four Gabor filters to precisely estimate the local dominant orientation at each pixel location in the image plane, the weighting of each pixel based on its dominant orientation, and an adaptive distance-based voting scheme for the estimation of the vanishing point. A series of quantitative and qualitative analyses are presented using natural data sets from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Grand Challenge projects to demonstrate the effectiveness and the accuracy of the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Fast Vanishing-Point Detection in Unstructured Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000298325500039"}
