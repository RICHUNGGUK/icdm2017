Unfortunately, this effect is also extremely costly. It can take hundreds to thousands of samples to achieve noise-free results using Monte Carlo integration. This paper introduces an efficient adaptive depth-of-field rendering algorithm that achieves noise-free results using significantly fewer samples. Our algorithm consists of two main phases: adaptive sampling and image reconstruction. In the adaptive sampling phase, the adaptive sample density is determined by a 'blur-size' map and 'pixel-variance' map computed in the initialization. In the image reconstruction phase, based on the blur-size map, we use a novel multiscale reconstruction filter to dramatically reduce the noise in the defocused areas where the sampled radiance has high variance. Because of the efficiency of this new filter, only a few samples are required. With the combination of the adaptive sampler and the multiscale filter, our algorithm renders near-reference quality depth-of-field images with significantly fewer samples than previous techniques.", "paper_title": "Efficient Depth-of-Field Rendering with Adaptive Sampling and Multiscale Reconstruction", "paper_id": "WOS:000295129100006"}
