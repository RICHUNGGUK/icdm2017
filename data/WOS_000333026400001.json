The relays are half-duplex and use the decode-and-forward protocol. The transmit source is a layered video bitstream, which can be partitioned into two layers, a base layer (BL) and an enhancement layer (EL), where the BL is more important than the EL in terms of the source distortion. The source broadcasts both layers to the relays and the destination using hierarchical 16-QAM. Each relay detects and transmits successfully decoded layers to the destination using either hierarchical 16-QAM or QPSK. The destination can thus receive multiple signals, each of which can include either only the BL or both the BL and the EL. We derive the optimal linear combining method at the destination, where the uncoded bit error rate is minimized. We also present a suboptimal combining method with a closed-form solution, which performs very close to the optimal. We use the proposed double-layer transmission scheme with our combining methods for transmitting layered video bitstreams. Numerical results show that the double-layer scheme can gain 2-2.5 dB in channel signal-to-noise ratio or 5-7 dB in video peak signal-to-noise ratio, compared with the classical single-layer scheme using conventional modulation.", "paper_title": "Double-Layer Video Transmission Over Decode-and-Forward Wireless Relay Networks Using Hierarchical Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000333026400001"}
