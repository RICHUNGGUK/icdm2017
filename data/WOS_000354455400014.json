However, the wide application of participatory sensing has its own challenges, among which privacy and multimedia data quality preservations are two critical problems. Unfortunately, none of the existing work has fully solved the problem of privacy and quality preserving participatory sensing with multimedia data. In this paper, we propose SLICER, which is the first k-anonymous privacy preserving scheme for participatory sensing with multimedia data. SLICER integrates a data coding technique and message transfer strategies, to achieve strong protection of participants' privacy, while maintaining high data quality. Specifically, we study two kinds of data transfer strategies, namely transfer on meet up (TMU) and minimal cost transfer (MCT). For MCT, we propose two different but complimentary algorithms, including an approximation algorithm and a heuristic algorithm, subject to different strengths of the requirement. Furthermore, we have implemented SLICER and evaluated its performance using publicly released taxi traces. Our evaluation results show that SLICER achieves high data quality, with low computation and communication overhead.", "paper_title": "Privacy and Quality Preserving Multimedia Data Aggregation for Participatory Sensing Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000354455400014"}
