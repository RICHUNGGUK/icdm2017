In this thesis, we introduce an iterative missing-value completion method based on the RAR (Robust Association Rules) support values to extract useful association rules for inferring missing values in an iterative way. It consists of three phases. The first phase uses the association rules to roughly complete the missing values. The second phase iteratively reduces the minimum support to gather more association rules to complete the rest of missing values. The third phase uses the association rules from the completed dataset to correct the missing values that have been filled in. Experimental results show the proposed approaches have good accuracy and data recovery even when the missing-value rate is high. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
