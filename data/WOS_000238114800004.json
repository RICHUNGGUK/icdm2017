These devices need to be energy conserving so that the battery life is maximized. The energy for transmission of a packet in the wireless channel remains quite significant and may turn out to be the highest energy consuming component of the device. So, an energy-efficient communication protocol can minimize maintenance and maximize system performance. We propose an Energy Aware Source Routing (EASR) which can be efficient from network long-term connectivity point of view. In this algorithm, multiple routing paths are selected. However, only one path will be used for data transmission at a certain time among multiple paths and each path has probability to be selected. In EASR, the routing paths will be discovered without overlapped. In addition, each path hardly overhears other data transmission. We define an overhearing ratio in order to reduce the overhearing energy waste among each selected path. And we show how establish energy efficient multiple paths by making use of overhearing ratio. Our simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve magnitude improvement of network lifetime and reasonable packet latency time.", "paper_title": "EASR: An energy aware source routing with disjoint multipath selection for energy-efficient multihop wireless ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800004"}
