The end-user's role in this procedure can be supported through platforms that encourage user's participation. This is critical toward the success of community-oriented service platforms that rely on end-user-generated content. The current paper describes an approach toward the participation of non-expert users in the development, deployment and provision of mobile services referred as Simple Mobile Services. The solution has been developed in the framework of the SMS project. The overall management is supported by the service-oriented structure of the SMS system infrastructure. The service authoring is facilitated through the SMS Authoring Wizard giving users the opportunity to create and deploy services inspecting them instantly on their mobile terminals.", "paper_title": "Enabling the deployment of mobile services for end-users: the SMS approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000355742000002"}
