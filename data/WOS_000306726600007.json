In this paper, robust optimization models with two decomposition algorithms are introduced to solve the graph partitioning problem with interval uncertain weights of edges. The bipartite graph partitioning problem with edge uncertainty is also presented. Throughout this paper, we make no assumption regarding the probability of the uncertain weights.
