This is why the three-dimensional approach applying advanced computational analyses must be used to obtain the true 3D structural performance. The paper is directed to the cross section warping effect and to the warping induced long term prestressing loss due to creep of concrete. It is shown that the severity of cross section warping is of fundamental importance, particularly in the case of unevenly distributed and isolated tendons in cross-section and in the case of short spans. Thus it will be appropriate to introduce a new component of the prestress loss - the prestress loss due to creep of concrete induced by cross section warping. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
