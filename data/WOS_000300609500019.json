Efficient hardware implementations of these techniques that can achieve real-time operation in high-speed networking equipment as well as other highly time-constrained application fields is however an open problem. We introduce a development platform for fuzzy inference systems with applications to network traffic analysis and control. The platform addresses the current requirements and constraints of high performance networking equipment. For the development process, we set up a methodology and a CAD tool chain that span the entire design process from initial specification in a high-level language to implementation on FPGA devices. An FPGA development board with PCI/PCIe interface is employed to support an open platform that comprises CAD tools as well as IP cores. PCI compatible fuzzy inference modules are implemented as System-on-Programmable-Chip (SoPC). We present satisfactory experimental results from the implementation of fuzzy systems for a number of applications in analysis and control of Internet traffic. These systems are shown to satisfy operational and architectural requirements of current and future high performance routing equipment. The platform proposed allows for the development of prototypes while avoiding large investments and complicated management procedures which constrain the testing and adoption of soft computing techniques in high performance networking.
