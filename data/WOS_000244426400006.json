In the first approach any covering is represented by an identity resolution of fuzzy sets on X and a corresponding probability distribution with associated entropy is defined. A second approach is based on a probability distribution generated by the covering normalizing the standard counting measure. Finally, the extension to a generic covering of the Liang-Xu approach to entropy is investigated, both from the \"global\" and the \"local\" point of view. For each of these three possible entropies the complementary entropy (or co-entropy) is defined showing in particular that the Liang-Xu entropy is a co-entropy.", "paper_title": "Entropies and co-entropies of coverings with application to incomplete information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000244426400006"}
