This can be obtained from large numbers of realistic mock galaxy catalogues that mimic the observed distribution of galaxies within the survey volume. To this end we present a fast, distributed-memory, planar-parallel code, L-PICOLA, which can be used to generate and evolve a set of initial conditions into a dark matter field much faster than a full non-linear N-Body simulation. Additionally, L-PICOLA has the ability to include primordial non-Gaussianity in the simulation and simulate the past lightcone at run-time, with optional replication of the simulation volume. Through comparisons to fully non-linear N-Body simulations we find that our code can reproduce the z = 0 power spectrum and reduced bispectrum of dark matter to within 2% and 5% respectively on all scales of interest to measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations and Redshift Space Distortions, but 3 orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy, speed and scalability of this code, alongside the additional features we have implemented, make it extremely useful for both current and next generation large-scale structure surveys.
