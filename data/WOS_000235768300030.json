The user is required to move the finger once it touches the scanner surface, thus deliberately producing skin distortion. A multi-stage feature-extraction technique captures and processes the significant information from a sequence of frames acquired during the finger movement; this information is encoded as a sequence of DistortionCodes and further analyzed to determine the nature of the finger. The experimentation carried out on a database of real and fake fingers shows that the performance of the new approach is very promising.", "paper_title": "A new approach to fake finger detection based on skin distortion", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300030"}
