The mixed delays in this paper include time-varying delays and unbounded distributed delays. By using a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, a drive-response concept and a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, several sufficient conditions are established that guarantee the exponential synchronization of the neural networks. Also, the estimation gains can be easily obtained. Finally, a numerical example and its simulation are given to show the effectiveness of the obtained results. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
