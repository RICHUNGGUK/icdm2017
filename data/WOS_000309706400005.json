Close interaction requires application support for awareness features, allowing participants to establish common ground. Following an overview of research on awareness and grounding, the results of an informal user study are presented, which demonstrate how current systems can deter users from engaging in close collaboration. Literature on awareness provides hope for improving this situation, but a naive transfer to mobile distributed user interfaces will not necessarily succeed. From prior art, a concise list of guidelines has been compiled to assist designers in providing awareness information to users of shared mobile workspaces. These guidelines can also serve as heuristics for the evaluation of future systems. An example is provided to demonstrate how these guidelines can be applied to the development of features for providing awareness of current location and browsing history to colocated users of mobile distributed user interfaces.", "paper_title": "Guidelines for Designing Awareness-Augmented Mobile DUIs", "paper_id": "WOS:000309706400005"}
