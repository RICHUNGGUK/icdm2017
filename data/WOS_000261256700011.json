Among them, ZLI-3417-100 gave the lowest driving voltage (<2.5 V/mu m) and fastest response time (<10 ms) which was interpreted in terms of high dielectric anisotropy (Delta epsilon) and low viscosity of the LC. However, diffraction efficiency of the film was a bit low due to the relatively small refractive anisotropy (Delta n) of the LC giving rise to a small mismatch of refractive index wit h resin. With regard to the LC content, 40% LC gave the greatest diffraction efficiency, whereas saturation time decreased with increasing content of LC which emphasizes the viscosity reducing effect of LC.
