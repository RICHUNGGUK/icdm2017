Its novelty lies in the dynamic description method of potential diffusion process which is generated by the whole membrane and nearby ion channel while potassium ion channels open. The main parameters and the corresponding equations of proposed model are studied. The dynamic spatiotemporal spread processes of membrane potential repolarization evoked by opened potassium ion channels are investigated as well. Furthermore, performance evaluation by computer simulation and experimental results proves the correctness and effectiveness of the idea above. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
