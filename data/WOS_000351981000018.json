These simulators are based on sequential coupling and include state-of-the-art knowledge for saliferous materials. Their main difference is the sequential method used. We present a benchmark between LBNL and TU Clausthal. The scenario studied assumes heat and gas generation from the waste packages, and crushed Salt backfill. The comparison of results is very satisfactory, providing increased reliability and confidence in the capabilities of the simulators to evaluate the geological and engineered barriers in the long-term.
