On-demand allocation and prompt freeing of speculative cache space in the design reduces the burden on nonspeculative execution. Quick access to both clean and speculative versions of data for multiple contexts provides flexibility and greater design freedom to HTM architects. Performance analysis shows the designs stand up well against other HTM design proposals, with potential performance gains in high contention applications with small transactions.", "paper_title": "SCIN-Cache: Fast Speculative Versioning in Multithreaded Cores", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800035"}
