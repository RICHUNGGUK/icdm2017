Novel truss and triangle elements are developed to permit large strains in the form-finding model while anticipating the small-strain behavior of the realized structure. Forcing functions are formulated to permit element length prescription using a new iterative technique termed Prescriptive Dynamic Relaxation (PDR). Case studies of a segmental concrete shell and a pedestrian steel bridge illustrate the potential for using PDR to achieve economic and environmentally considerate structural solutions.
