Reconfiguration is an operation process widely used for this optimization by means of changing the status of switches in a distribution network. Some major points such as time-varying loads and the number of switchings, which are often neglected or not applied simultaneously in most previous studies, are the main motivation behind this study. In this paper, a new probabilistic approach is proposed to perform an optimal reconfiguration in order to reduce the total cost of operation, including the cost of switching and benefit of loss reduction. Considering time-varying loads, the proposed method can obtain an optimal balance between the number of switchings and the power loss. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated through several experiments and the results are compared with those of other reliable methods in several cases. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
