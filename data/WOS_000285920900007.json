In this study, the authors proposed an effective causal scheme of video frames registration, and implemented it by the modified two frames intensity match algorithm. In order to achieve its real-time performance, the authors avoid handling a much more complex appearance model in this causal system by using registration parameters as measurement values, which are estimated directly from two consecutive frames via intensity matching. The simple linear and Gaussian system is thus derived and an efficient Kalman filter algorithm can be utilised. As the Kalman filter naturally incorporated the temporal information contained in a video into the estimation of registration parameters, the algorithm developed in this study is quite robust and has good performance even if the processed video contains several segments of non-texture frames.", "paper_title": "Alignment of non-texture video frames using Kalman filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000285920900007"}
