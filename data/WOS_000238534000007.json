Equilibrium points and their stability are investigated in an analogical way to determine the nature of the bifurcations. The global behaviour is studied by using bifurcation diagrams showing collisions between fixed points and borderlines. The border collision bifurcations have their origin in the saturations of the PWM modulator. (c) 2006 IMACS.
