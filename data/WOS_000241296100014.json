In MJ2 coding, every frame can be coded at similar target bitrate due to the accurate rate control feature. Moreover, frames of the same scene have the similar rate-distortion (RD) characters. The proposed method estimates the initial cutoff threshold of the current frame according to the previous frame's RD information. This iterative method reduces computational cost significantly. As opposed to previous algorithms, it can be used at any compression ratio. Experiments show that the performance is comparable to normal JPEG2000 coding.", "paper_title": "Constant rate control for motion JPEG2000", "paper_id": "WOS:000241296100014"}
