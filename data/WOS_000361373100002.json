Spatial cloaking technique is a well-known privacy preserving method, which blurs an exact user location into a cloaked region to meet privacy requirements. In this paper, we propose a new semantic privacy preservation method rely on the well-established k-anonymity and l-diversity privacy metrics for semantic cloaking. We also define a representative cloaking region which helps in communication cost reduction caused by user movement. Experimental implementation and analysis exhibit that our proposed method renders good performance in efficiency and scalability. We also show that our proposed method outperforms the existing privacy preservation method by effectively enhance privacy against various adversaries.", "paper_title": "A Novel Location Privacy Preservation Method for Moving Object", "paper_id": "WOS:000361373100002"}
