This situation becomes more intricate by the growing parasitic variability and manufacturing reliability. To facilitate the feasibility of template-based layout migration, this paper first introduces a layout preservation, which extracts placement and routing behaviors from an existing layout into a crossing graph via constrained Delaunay triangulation. And later this crossing graph can be migrated into multiple layouts with placement and routing reconnection. The proposed approach also provides a refinement for wire to optimize the performance metrics. This approach is applied to a variable-gain amplifier, a folded-cascode operational amplifier, and a low dropout regulator. The experimental results demonstrate more possibility on layout migration, such that averagely more than 75% routing of migrated layout is generated by our approach. Additionally, it exhibits the productivity with qualified performance on different designs.", "paper_title": "A Fast Prototyping Framework for Analog Layout Migration With Planar Preservation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360405500001"}
