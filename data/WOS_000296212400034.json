The RLPDA approach decomposes the eigenspace of the locality preserving within-class scatter matrix into three subspaces, i.e., the face space, the noise space and the null space, and then regularizes the three subspaces differently according to their predicted eigenvalues. As a result, the proposed approach integrates discriminative information in all of the three subspaces, de-emphasizes the effect of the eigenvectors corresponding to the small eigenvalues, and meanwhile suppresses the small sample size problem. Extensive experiments on ORL face database, FERET face subset and UMIST face database illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
