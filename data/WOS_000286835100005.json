However, the process of interpreting EEG is time consuming for electroencephalographers (EEGers). In this study, an automatic EEG interpretation system constructed in the way of qualified EEGer's visual inspection was proposed. The system was applied to interpret hyperventilation-induced EEG automatically. The final results of automatic interpretation were compared with EEGer's visual inspection, and showed high consistence.", "paper_title": "Automatic interpretation of hyperventilation-induced electroencephalogram constructed in the way of qualified electroencephalographer's visual inspection", "paper_id": "WOS:000286835100005"}
