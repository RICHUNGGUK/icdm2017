Geographic data are represented as instances of concepts in an ontology of transportation networks which was designed in close relation to GDF. These data are transformed into SVC, whereas the transformation is specified symbolically as instances of a transformation ontology. This approach is extremely flexible and easily extendible to include all kinds of information in the generated maps. This article is an abbreviated version of the research report [5] and focuses only on the technical aspects of the approach.", "paper_title": "Ontology driven visualisation of maps with SVG - Technical aspects", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800033"}
