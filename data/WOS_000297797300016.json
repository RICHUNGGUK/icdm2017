A novel token passing algorithm was proposed based on the characteristics of MS/TP network frame distribution and the requirements of real-time performance. The algorithm adopts distributed control method, which can adjust the token passing order dynamically according to the frame distribution of every master station in the MS/TP network, change the number of frames a master station can send when holding token adaptively and the network bandwidth every master station occupied to reduce the token passing times on the logical ring. OPNET simulation results show that the algorithm has reduced the average service delay, decreased the frame lost, enhanced the network real-time performance and increased the network throughput. It is better than the order token passing algorithm, and has some inspiration for researching other token ring networks.", "paper_title": "An Adaptive Token Passing Algorithm Applicable to MS/TP Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300016"}
