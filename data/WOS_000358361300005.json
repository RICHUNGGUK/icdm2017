The approach, which we apply here to Slovene, takes into account monosemous and polysemous words, general and specialised vocabulary as well as simple and multi-word lexemes. The extracted words are then assigned one or several synset ids, based on a classifier that relies on several features including distributional similarity. Finally, we identify and remove highly dubious (literal, synset) pairs, based on simple distributional information extracted from a large corpus in an unsupervised way. Automatic, manual and task-based evaluations show that the resulting resource, the latest version of the Slovene wordnet, is already a valuable source of lexico-semantic information.", "paper_title": "Constructing a poor man's wordnet in a resource-rich world", "paper_id": "WOS:000358361300005"}
