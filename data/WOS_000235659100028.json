Compromised nodes may exhibit arbitrary behavior and may collude with other compromised nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel security strategy with assistant cluster heads, SSACH, which focuses on limiting the attack from compromised nodes. It adds the Assistant Cluster Heads (ACH) so as to monitor Cluster Head (CH) and take precautions against the inside attack.", "paper_title": "Compromised nodes in wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100028"}
