Two sets X-i and X-i of F overlap if X-i boolean AND X-i not equal empty set, X-j\\X-i not equal empty set, and X-i \\ X-j not equal empty set. Two sets X, Y epsilon F are in the same overlap class if there is a series X = X-1, X-2, .... X-k = Y of sets of F in which each XiXj+(1) overlaps. In this note, we focus on efficiently identifying all overlap classes in O(n + Sigma(m)(i=1) vertical bar X-i vertical bar) time. We thus revisit the clever algorithm of Dahlhaus [E. Dahlhaus, Parallel algorithms for hierarchical clustering and applications to split decomposition and parity graph recognition, J. Algorithms 36 (2) (2000) 205-240] of which we give a clear presentation and that we simplify to make it practical and implementable in its real worst case complexity. An useful variant of Dahlhaus's approach is also explained. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "A note on computing set overlap classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000260355400004"}
