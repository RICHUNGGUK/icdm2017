The high-order spectral element macroscopic modeling code SEL/HiFi has been used to explore the parameter space. It is shown that for a given number of spatial degrees of freedom, increasing polynomial degree while reducing the number of elements results in exponential reduction of the numerical error. The alignment of the grid with the direction of anisotropy is shown to further improve the accuracy of the solution. These effects are qualitatively explained and numerically quantified in 2- and 3-dimensional calculations with straight and curved anisotropy. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
