In a BiNoC, each communication channel allows to be dynamically self-reconfigured to transmit flits in either direction. This added flexibility promises better bandwidth utilization, lower packet delivery latency, and higher packet consumption rate. Novel on-chip router architecture is developed to support dynamic self-reconfiguration of the bidirectional traffic flow. This area-efficient BiNoC router delivers better performance and requires smaller buffer size than that of a conventional network-on-chip (NoC). The flow direction at each channel is controlled by a channel direction control (CDC) algorithm. Implemented with a pair of finite state machines, this CDC algorithm is shown to be high performance, free of deadlock, and free of starvation. Extensive cycle-accurate simulations using synthetic and real-world traffic patterns have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the BiNoC. These results exhibit consistent and significant performance advantage over conventional NoC equipped with hard-wired unidirectional channels.", "paper_title": "A Bidirectional NoC (BiNoC) Architecture With Dynamic Self-Reconfigurable Channel", "paper_id": "WOS:000287658900009"}
