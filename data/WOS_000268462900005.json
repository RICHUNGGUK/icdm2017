In this paper, after a brief review of a recent Lagrangian method, namely the particle finite element method, some issues are discussed and some improvements are made. The least-square finite element method is adopted to simplify the solving of the Navier-Stokes equations. An adaptive time method is derived to obtain suitable time steps. A mass correction procedure is imported to improve the mass conservation in long time calculations and time discretization scheme is adopted to decrease the pressure oscillations during the calculations. Finally, the method is used to simulate a series of examples and the results are compared with the commercial FLOW3D code.
