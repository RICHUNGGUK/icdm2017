In this paper, we present a simple, yet well-formed, semantic-based capability model for information-providing web services, which can express such features as not modifying the world state and not requiring all input/output parameters to be supplemented with class information as semantics. We then present a corresponding automatic composition method derived from a query rewriting algorithm, MiniCon, used in the data integration field. This method adequately utilizes previous features, enables primitive semantic reasoning, and can generate executable BPEL scripts automatically. Performance of the method is complementary to traditional search-based ones. Experiments on a typical type of problem show that the method is usable in practice.", "paper_title": "Automatic composition of information-providing web services based on query rewriting", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800002"}
