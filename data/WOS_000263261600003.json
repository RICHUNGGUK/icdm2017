We provide a globally optimal solution to this problem for a special case of using omni-directional antennas. This graph theoretic approach provides us insights into more general case of using directional antennas, and inspires us to produce a group of heuristic algorithms. Experimental results show that our algorithms outperform other energy-aware multicast algorithms significantly in terms of multicast lifetime.", "paper_title": "A framework for the multicast lifetime maximization problem in energy-constrained wireless ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000263261600003"}
