We propose an algorithm specifically designed to take advantage of shared memory, vectorized, parallel and many-core microprocessors such as the Cell processor, new generation Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and standard vectorized multi-core processors (e. g. quad-core CPUs). Besides its implementation is easy. We also give evidence of the efficiency of our approach and compare the algorithm on the three platforms, thus exhibiting pros and cons for each of them.", "paper_title": "A Simple Compressive Sensing Algorithm for Parallel Many-Core Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000314776600001"}
