Because of the diversity and dynamics of people's indoor activities, it is important to monitor IAQ for each individual. Most existing air-quality sensing systems are stationary or focus on outdoor air quality In contrast, we propose MAQS, a user-centered mobile sensing system for IAQ monitoring. MAQS users carry portable, indoor location tracking and IAQ sensing devices that provide personalized IAQ information in real time. To improve accuracy and energy efficiency, MAQS incorporates three novel techniques: (I) an accurate temporal n-gram augmented Bayesian room localization method that requires few Wi-Fi fingerprints; (2) an air-exchange-rate- based IAQ sensing method, which measures general IAQ using only CO2 sensors; and (3) a zone-based proximity detection method for collaborative sensing, which saves energy and enables data sharing among users. MAQS has been deployed and evaluated through a real-world user study. This evaluation demonstrates that MAQS supports accurate personalized IAQ monitoring and quantitative analysis with high energy efficiency. We also found that study participants frequently experienced poor IAQ.", "paper_title": "User-Centric Indoor Air-Quality Monitoring on Mobile Devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000336891800003"}
