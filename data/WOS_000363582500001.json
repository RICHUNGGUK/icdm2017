BSNs consist of a number of sensor nodes located and deployed over the human body. These sensors continuously gather vital sign data of the body area to be used in various intelligent systems in smart environments. This paper presents an intelligent design of the body sensor network based on virtual hypercube structure backbone termed as Smart BodyNet. The main purpose of the Smart BodyNet is to provide resilience for the BSN operation and reduce power consumption. Various experiments were carried out to show the performance of the Smart BodyNet design as compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "paper_title": "Developing a Powerful and Resilient Smart Body Sensor Network through Hypercube Interconnection", "paper_id": "WOS:000363582500001"}
