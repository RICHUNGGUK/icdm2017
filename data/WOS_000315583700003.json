The location and orientation of the airfoil is obtained by image processing and the airfoil is filled with proper velocity data. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) is applied to these post-processed images to compute POD modes and time coefficients, and a discrete-time state-space dynamical model is fit to the trajectories of the time coefficients using subspace system identification (N4SID). The procedure is verified using PIV and CFD data obtained from a pitching NACA0012 airfoil. The simulation results confirm that the dynamical model obtained from the method proposed can represent the flow dynamics with acceptable accuracy.", "paper_title": "Dynamical modelling of the flow over a flapping wing using proper orthogonal decomposition and system identification techniques", "paper_id": "WOS:000315583700003"}
