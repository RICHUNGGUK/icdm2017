However, temporal characteristics of networks have not been estimated sufficiently. We propose time graph pattern mining as a new concept of graph mining reflecting the temporal information of a network. We conduct two case studies of time graph pattern mining: extensively discussed topics on blog sites and a book recommendation network. Through examination of case studies, we ascertain that time graph pattern mining has numerous possibilities as a novel means for information retrieval and network analysis reflecting both structural and temporal characteristics.", "paper_title": "Time Graph Pattern Mining for Network Analysis and Information Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784100012"}
