The main problems of the well-known algorithms, based on nonparametric belief propagation (NBP), are the high communication cost and inefficient sampling techniques. Moreover, they either do not use smoothing or just apply it offline. Therefore, in this article, we propose more flexible and efficient variants of NBP for cooperative localization in mobile networks. In particular, we provide: (i) an optional 1-lag smoothing done almost in real-time, (ii) a novel low-cost communication protocol based on package approximation and censoring, (iii) higher robustness of the standard mixture importance sampling (MIS) technique, and (iv) a higher amount of information in the importance densities by using the population Monte Carlo (PMC) approach, or an auxiliary variable. Through extensive simulations, we confirmed that all the proposed techniques outperform the standard NBP method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
