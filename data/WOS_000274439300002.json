The former brings an Anycast scalability problem and the latter causes the routing tables to grow proportionally to the number of all global Anycast groups in the entire Internet. Therefore, both of the above designs restrict and hinder the application and development of Anycast services. A new kind of Anycast communication model is proposed in this paper which solves some existing problems, such as scalability and communication errors between clients and servers. In this paper, the Anycast communication model is analyzed in depth and discussed, and the experimental data of this Anycast communication model demonstrate its feasibility and validity.
