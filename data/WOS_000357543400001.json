The localization is based on a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with a map from optimally selected visual features using Gaussian process (GP) regression. In particular, the collection of selected features over a surveillance region is modeled by a multivariate GP with unknown hyperparameters. The hyperparameters are identified through the learning process by an MLE, which are used for prediction in an empirical Bayes fashion. To select features, we apply a backward sequential elimination technique in order to improve the quality of the position estimation with compressed features for efficient localization. The excellent results of the proposed algorithm are illustrated by the experimental studies with different visual features under both indoor and outdoor real-world scenarios. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
