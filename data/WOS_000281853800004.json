It is physically accurate and its implementations are efficient for interactive simulation. However, one requirement of using Cosserat rod theory is that the tubular object must have rigid cross-sections that are small compared to its length. This requirement make it difficult for the approach to model elastic deformation of rods with large, non-rigid cross-sections that can change shape during rod deformation, in particular, hollow tubes. Our approach achieves this task using a hybrid model that binds a mesh elastically to a reference Cosserat rod. The mesh represents the surface of the hollow tube while the reference rod models bending, twisting, shearing and stretching of the tube. The cross-sections of the tube may take on any arbitrary shape. The binding is established by a mapping between mesh vertices and the rod's directors. Deformation of the elastic tube is accomplished in two phases. First, the reference rod is deformed according to Cosserat theory. Next, the mesh is deformed using Laplacian deformation according to its mapping to the rod and its surface elastic energy. This hybrid approach allows the tube to deform in a physically correct manner in relation to the bending, twisting, shearing, and stretching of the reference rod. It also allows the surface to deform realistically and efficiently according to surface elastic energy and the shape of the reference rod. In this way, the deformation of elastic hollow tubes with large, non-rigid cross-sections can be simulated accurately and efficiently.", "paper_title": "Elastic Tubes: Modeling Elastic Deformation of Hollow Tubes", "paper_id": "WOS:000281853800004"}
