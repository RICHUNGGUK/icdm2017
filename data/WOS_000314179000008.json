We point out the need for auxiliary sampling distributions, meaning parametric families on binary spaces, which are able to reproduce complex dependency structures, and illustrate their usefulness in our numerical experiments. We provide numerical evidence that particle-driven optimization algorithms based on parametric families yield superior results on strongly multimodal optimization problems while local search heuristics outperform them on easier problems.", "paper_title": "Particle Algorithms for Optimization on Binary Spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000314179000008"}
