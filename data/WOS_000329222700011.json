Early availability of feasible trade-offs between inductance, quality factor, self-resonance frequency and area, is a key enabler towards the improvement of such design methodologies. This paper introduces such an approach in two steps. First, a Pareto-optimal performance front of integrated inductors is generated by embedding a performance evaluator into a multi-objective optimization tool. Then, starting from the optimal front samples, a surrogate model of the performance front is obtained. Experimental results in a 0.35-mu m CMOS technology are provided.", "paper_title": "Generation of surrogate models of Pareto-optimal performance trade-offs of planar inductors", "paper_id": "WOS:000329222700011"}
