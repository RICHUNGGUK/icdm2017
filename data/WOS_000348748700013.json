The potential benefits of ISA are two-fold. First, agent-object interactions often reveal an object's function, which plays a key role in shape understanding. Second, compared to direct shape analysis, ISA, which utilizes pre-selected agents, is less affected by imperfections of, or inconsistencies between, the geometry or topology of the analyzed shapes. We employ digital human models as the external agents and develop a prototype ISA scheme for 3D shape classification and retrieval. Given a 3D model M, we compute an ISA feature vector for M by encoding how well a selected set of human models, with functional poses, can be aligned to M so as to perform the intended functions. We demonstrate the discriminability of ISA features for 3D shape retrieval and compare to state-of-theart methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
