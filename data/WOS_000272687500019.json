Design/methodology/approach - Mineral information includes all kinds of relative metallogenic information In order to extract comprehensive metallogenic prediction information, it is necessary to filter initial observation information to emphasize the factors that are most advantageous to metallogenic prognosis. Rough set can delete Irrespective or unimportant attributes on the premises of no information missing and no classification ability changing, without supplementary information or prior knowledge, which has important theoretic and practical value for metallogenic prognosis Findings - The association and importance of geological information referring to prospecting are found out through attribute reduction based on rough set Originality/value - The analysis of geological and mineral information based on rough set is a novel approach for high-dimensional complex non-deterministic polynomial problems which are predominant in geological research The research successfully extracts characterized mineralization information to offer the scientific basis for target prediction.", "paper_title": "Rough set for quantitative analysis of characteristic information in metallogenic prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500019"}
