The problem is strongly NP-hard and has been intensively studied since the 1960s. We present a metaheuristic and an exact algorithm and analyze their average behavior on a large set of test instances from the literature. The metaheuristic algorithm, which is based on a scatter search paradigm, computationally proves to be highly effective and capable of solving to optimality a very high percentage of the publicly available test instances. The exact algorithm, which is based on a specialized binary search and a branch-and-price scheme, was able to quickly solve to optimality all remaining instances.", "paper_title": "Heuristic and exact algorithms for the identical parallel machine scheduling problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000257473600001"}
