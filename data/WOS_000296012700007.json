In spite of the improvement in speed and accuracy introduced by MSA programs, the computational requirements for large-scale alignments requires high-performance computing and parallel applications. In this paper we present an improvement to a parallel implementation of T-Coffee, a widely used MSA package. Our approximation resolves the bottleneck of the progressive alignment stage on MSA. This is achieved by increasing the degree of parallelism by balancing the guide tree that drives the progressive alignment process. The experimental results show improvements in execution time of over 68% while maintaining the biological accuracy.", "paper_title": "Exploiting parallelism on progressive alignment methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000296012700007"}
