Technology acceptance refers to a user's willingness to employ information technology for the tasks it is designed to support. This study compared the four models (TRA, TPB, TAM, and integrated) to examine which model best helps to predict preservice teachers' intentions to use technology. Data were gathered from 429 preservice teachers from a teacher training institute in Singapore, and structural equation modeling was used to compare the four models in terms of overall model fit, explanatory power, and path significance. The results demonstrate that the models did not differ in explanatory power. Attitude as an independent variable was found to have the greatest impact on the intention to use technology.", "paper_title": "Understanding the Intention to Use Technology by Preservice Teachers: An Empirical Test of Competing Theoretical Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000301841200003"}
