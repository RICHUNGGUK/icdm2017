We are given an undirected graph G = (V, E), where eacb vertex v is associated with a penalty rejection cost r(v).. We need to choose a subset of vertices, V', and to find a proper coloring of the induced subgraph of G over V'. We are interested in both the number of colors used to color the vertices of V', and in the total rejection cost of all other vertices. The goal is to minimize the sum of these two amounts. In this paper we consider both the online and the offline versions of this problem. In the online version, vertices arrive one at a time, revealing the rejection cost of the current vertex and the set of edges connecting it to previously revealed vertices. We also consider the classical online coloring problem on bounded degree graphs and on (k+1)-claw free graphs.", "paper_title": "Graph coloring with rejection", "paper_id": "WOS:000241478200032"}
