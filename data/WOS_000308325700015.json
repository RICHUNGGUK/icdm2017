While substantial research has been done on the former, we for the first time review the PPM in the light of parallelization: We analyze the architecture and classify its components with respect to a recent taxonomy for parallel multi-objective evolutionary algorithms. Further, we theoretically examine benefits of simultaneous predator collaboration on a spatial population structure and give insights into solution emergence. On the prey level, we integrate a gradient-based local search mechanism to exploit problem independent parallelization and hybridize the model in order to achieve faster convergence and solution stability. This way, we achieve a good approximation and unfold further parallelization potential for the model.", "paper_title": "Parallel predator-prey interaction for evolutionary multi-objective optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000308325700015"}
