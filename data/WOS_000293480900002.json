By introducing the free weighting matrices to deal with the integral items and converting the coupling time-varying matrix inequalities into a group of decoupling matrix inequalities, an innovative delay-dependent stabilization criterion is first presented. Then, a sampled-data H-infinity controller is designed to stabilize the T S fuzzy system to achieve the prescribed disturbance attenuation level, which is dependent on both the size of state delay and upper bound of allowable sampling period. Since (I) the sawtooth structure of delay is fully considered; (2) neither model transformation nor bounding techniques are employed in deriving the delay-dependent results; and (3) none of the integral items are arbitrarily ignored and magnified, the less conservative results can be expected. A practical application example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
