We propose an efficient preconditioner using a matrix reordering scheme to solve the sparse linear systems iteratively arising from the discretized non-linear equations. Numerical examples demonstrate effectiveness of the DGAFEM to damp the spurious oscillations and resolve well the sharp layers occurring in convection dominated non-linear equations.
