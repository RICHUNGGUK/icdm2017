Lattices of congruences of fuzzy automata are described and an algorithm for computing the greatest congruence contained in an equivalence of a fuzzy automaton is presented. It is used for minimization procedures for both fuzzy automata with and without outputs. Connections with previously known minimization algorithms are discussed. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
