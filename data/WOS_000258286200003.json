The new method converts text to words vector space model at first, and then splits words into a set of concepts. Through computing the inner products between concepts, it obtains the similarity between words. The new method computes the similarity of text based on the similarity of words at last. The contributions of the paper include: 1) propose a new computing formula between words; 2) propose a new text similarity computing method based on words similarity; 3) successfully use the method in the application of similarity computing of WEB news; and 4) prove the validity of the method through extensive experiments.", "paper_title": "A new similarity computing method based on concept similarity in Chinese text processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000258286200003"}
