But biometric matchers of different modalities possess a property of the statistical independence of their output scores. In this work we investigate if utilizing this independence knowledge results in the improvement of the combination algorithm. We show both theoretically and experimentally that utilizing independence provides better approximation of score density functions, and results in combination improvement.", "paper_title": "Utilizing independence of multimodal biometric matchers", "paper_id": "WOS:000241429800005"}
