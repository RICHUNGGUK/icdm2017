The purpose of this paper is to present new dynamic approaches in the IT benefits evaluation. We use essential financial indicators to measure the impact of sample entities which performed IT investment before December 31, 2004 in China and Taiwan. From the field study we find that both in China and Taiwan, the IT investment make a negative impact. However, from the Taiwan experience, most entlTrises will meet the temporary decline situation after implementing the IT investment, but in the long-term, about 4 years, it will make a significant financial progress. While in China after IT investment, it always keeps a negatively related performance.", "paper_title": "The dynamic assessment of Information Technology investment", "paper_id": "WOS:000244011400005"}
