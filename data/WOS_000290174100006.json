Mobile streaming TV is one of the alternatives to deploy such a system; others are DVB-H or MediaFLO. In this paper we propose an alternative CDN-based architecture to distribute contents to different access networks, in order to create a triple screen platform. The core elements of the system are the video streamers, acting as surrogates of the mobile CDN-based architecture, installed in the access networks (including mobile), and the transcoding servers in the premises of the content providers. The paper focused on the wireless part of the system, analyzing the architecture and performance results related with the video coding and the efficiency obtained due to the placement of the streaming servers. The system has been deployed by a Spanish media company for its use with different Telcos, ISPs and media companies.", "paper_title": "Wireless CDN video streaming architecture for IPTV", "paper_id": "WOS:000290174100006"}
