The main contribution is a new inductive query language extending SQL, with the goal of supporting the whole knowledge discovery process, from pre-processing via data mining to post-processing. A prototype system supporting the query language was developed in the SINDBAD (structured inductive database development) project. Setting aside models and focusing on distance-based and instance-based methods, closure can easily be achieved. An example scenario from the area of gene expression data analysis demonstrates the power and simplicity of the concept. We hope that this preliminary work will help to bring the fundamental issues, such as the integration of various pattern domains and data mining techniques, to the attention of the inductive database community.", "paper_title": "Inductive databases in the relational model: The data as the bridge", "paper_id": "WOS:000237245300008"}
