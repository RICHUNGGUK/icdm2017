In this article I will point out a number of recent developments in low-level image analysis which open up new possibilities to bring together concepts of high-level and low-level vision. The key observation is that numerous multi-label optimization problems can nowadays be efficiently solved in a near-optimal manner, using either graph-theoretic algorithms or convex relaxation techniques. Moreover, higher-level semantic knowledge can be learned and imposed on the basis of such multi-label formulations. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
