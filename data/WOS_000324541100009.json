The Hamiltonian of this model includes a SA potential and a pressure term. The model identi _ es a crumpled-to-tubule (CT) transition between the crumpled and tubular phases. This is a secondorder transition, which occurs when the pressure di r erence between the inner and outer sides of the surface is close to zero. We obtain the Flory swelling exponents V-R(2)(= D-f/2) and (V) over bar (v) corresponding to the mean square radius of gyration R-g(2) and enclosed volume V, where D-f is the fractal dimension. The analysis shows that (V) over bar (v) at the transition is almost identical to the one of the smooth phase of previously reported SA model which has no crumpled phase.", "paper_title": "CRUMPLED-TO-TUBULE TRANSITION AND SHAPE TRANSFORMATIONS OF A MODEL OF SELF-AVOIDING SPHERICAL MESHWORK", "paper_id": "WOS:000324541100009"}
