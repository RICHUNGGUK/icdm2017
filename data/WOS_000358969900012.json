Based on Lyapunov-like function method and average dwell time technique, some sufficient conditions are derived to guarantee the finite-time boundedness of considered uncertain switched neural networks. Furthermore, the state feedback controller is designed to solve the finite-time stabilization problem. Moreover, the proposed sufficient conditions can be simplified into the form of linear matrix equalities for conveniently using Matlab LMI toolbox. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of the main results. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
