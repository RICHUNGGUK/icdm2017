First, the intrinsic parameters of the cameras are self-calibrated with two pairs of parallel lines that are orthogonal. Then, the poses of the cameras relative to the parallel lines are deduced, and the rotational transformation between the two cameras is calculated. With the intrinsic parameters and the relative pose of the two cameras, a method is proposed to obtain the poses of a line, plane, and rigid object. Furthermore, a new visual-control method is developed using a pose detection rather than a three-dimensional reconstruction. Experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "New pose-detection method for self-calibrated cameras based on parallel lines and its application in visual control system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240756700011"}
