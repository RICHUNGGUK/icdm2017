The algorithm is based on a projection method which solves the complete 2D Navier-Stokes equations in two steps. First the pressure term in the momentum equations is excluded and the resultant advection-diffusion equations are solved. In the second step the continuity and the momentum equation with only the pressure terms are solved to give a block tri-diagonal system of equation with pressure as the unknown. This system can be solved by a direct matrix solver without iteration. A new implicit treatment of non-hydrostatic pressure, similar to the lower layers is applied to the top layer which makes the model free of any hydrostatic pressure assumption all through the water column. This treatment enables the model to evaluate both free surface elevation and wave celerity more accurately. A series of numerical tests including free-surface flows with significant vertical accelerations and nonlinear behaviour in shoaling zone are performed. Comparison between numerical results, analytical solutions and experimental data demonstrates a satisfactory performance.
