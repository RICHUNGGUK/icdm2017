The design takes into account channel state and performance information from the PHY and medium access control (MAC) layers, respectively. It uses a decision algorithm to evaluate this information, specify unfavorable conditions regarding low channel quality and increased congestion, and take measures by coordinating modulation order, transmission power, and media encoding rate, toward improved overall quality of service (QoS) offered to the user. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed design achieves considerably reduced packet loss and power consumption, combined with increased throughput as compared to a typical mobile WiMAX system.
