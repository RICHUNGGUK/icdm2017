We first present probabilistic arguments to investigate under which conditions MVA models provide worst-case response times, without large overshoots. Then, we show how to characterize the distributed server system so as to construct a model to predict response times as well as to estimate system capacity. Finally, we exemplify the methodology usage via transactions implemented in two distributed Linux systems.
