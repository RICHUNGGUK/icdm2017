Several methods have been published in the past 20 years including stereo reconstruction as well as multi-view factorization methods. In general, reconstruction algorithms compute the 3D structure of the object and the camera parameters in a non-optimal way, and then a nonlinear and numerical optimization algorithm refines the reconstructed camera parameters and 3D coordinates. In this paper, we propose an adjustment method which is the improved version of the well-known Tomasi-Kanade factorization method. The novelty, which yields the high speed of the algorithm, is that the core of the proposed method is an alternation and we give optimal solutions to the subproblems in the alternation. The improved method is discussed here and it is compared to the widely used bundle adjustment algorithm.", "paper_title": "Weak-perspective structure from motion by fast alternation", "paper_id": "WOS:000289209800005"}
