As a result, strategies for diffusion, adoption, and use have been incomplete and have produced disappointing results. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework for identifying factors that affect the spread, use, and effects of IT in the U.S. health care sector. The framework can be used by researchers to focus their efforts on unanswered questions, by practitioners considering IT adoption, and by policymakers searching for ways to spread IT throughout the system.", "paper_title": "Toward an effective strategy for the diffusion and use of clinical information systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000246670800014"}
