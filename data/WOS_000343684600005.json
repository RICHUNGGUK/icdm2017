Here we consider anisotropic classes of functions, including certain classes with dominating mixed derivatives. Our analysis is based on a multilevel Monte Carlo method developed by Daun and Heinrich (2013) and we obtain the order of the deterministic and randomized n-th minimal errors (in some limit cases up to logarithms). Furthermore, we compare the rates in the deterministic and randomized setting to assess the gain reached by randomization. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
