Simultaneously, due to the larger current loads, current densities are increasing, making electromigration an important design issue. In this paper, methods for optimizing a multi-layer interdigitated power and ground network are presented. Based on the resistive and inductive (both self-and mutual) impedance, a closed-form solution for determining the optimal power and ground wire width is described, producing the minimum impedance for a single metal layer. Electromigration is considered, permitting the appropriate number of metal layers to be determined. The tradeoff between the network impedance and current density is investigated. Based on 65-, 45-, and 32-nm CMOS technologies, the optimal width as a function of metal layer is determined for different frequencies, suggesting important trends for interdigitated power and ground networks.", "paper_title": "Multi-Layer Interdigitated Power Distribution Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289905400005"}
