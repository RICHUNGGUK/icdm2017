Electronic medical records (EMR) systems could help increase the efficiency and efficacy of these clinics. Even though some EMR systems have been developed for developing countries, they lack customizability. This paper gives some background information about EMR systems: how they are used in developed countries, and how FileMaker, an off-the-shelf database software, could be used to rapidly deploy EMR systems in clinics and hospitals of developing countries. An existing EMR database developed by Banner Alzheimer's Institute serves as a proof of concept that FileMaker is a viable EMR solution.", "paper_title": "Developing EMRs in Developing Countries", "paper_id": "WOS:000286009500009"}
