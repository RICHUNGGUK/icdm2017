Thanks to calibration, comparator offset errors above half the stage least-significant bit margin in a unitary redundancy scheme are admissible, thus relaxing comparator design requirements and allowing their optimization for low-power high-speed applications and low input capacitance. The technique also makes it possible to relax design requirements of stage amplifiers within the pipeline queue, since output swing and driving capability are significantly lower. In this brief, the proposal is validated using realistic hardware-behavioral models.", "paper_title": "Background Digital Calibration of Comparator Offsets in Pipeline ADCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000356879200015"}
