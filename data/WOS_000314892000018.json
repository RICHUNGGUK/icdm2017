The disordered protein can be an unfolded or intrinsically disordered state. Here, we introduce the latest version of the program, which has been enhanced to facilitate its general release and includes an intuitive user interface, as well as new approaches to treat data and analyse results.", "paper_title": "Characterization of disordered proteins with ENSEMBLE", "paper_id": "WOS:000314892000018"}
