We develop R-SPLINE-a Retrospective-search algorithm that alternates between a continuous Search using Piecewise-Linear Interpolation and a discrete Neighborhood Enumeration, to asymptotically identify a local minimum. R-SPLINE appears to be among the first few gradient-based search algorithms tailored for solving integer-ordered local SO problems. In addition to proving the almost-sure convergence of R-SPLINE's iterates to the set of local minima, we demonstrate that the probability of R-SPLINE returning a solution outside the set of true local minima decays exponentially in a certain precise sense. R-SPLINE, with no parameter tuning, compares favorably with popular existing algorithms.", "paper_title": "Integer-Ordered Simulation Optimization using R-SPLINE: Retrospective Search with Piecewise-Linear Interpolation and Neighborhood Enumeration", "paper_id": "WOS:000322829500003"}
