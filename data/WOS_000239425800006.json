Two recent papers showed independently that any globally-cooperative high-level MSC corresponds to the behaviors of some communicating finite-state machine - or equivalently a netchart. These difficult results rely either on Thomas' graph acceptors or Zielonka's construction of asynchronous automata. In this paper we give a direct and self-contained synthesis of netcharts from globally-cooperative high-level MSCs by means of a simpler unfolding procedure.", "paper_title": "The synthesis problem of netcharts", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425800006"}
