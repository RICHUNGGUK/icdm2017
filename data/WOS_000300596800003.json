However, such controllers exhibit degraded performance with change in process dynamics. To overcome this problem, a novel congestion controller based on active queue management (AQM) strategy for dynamically varying TCP/AQM networks known as adaptive generalized minimum variance (AGMV) is proposed. AGMV is the combination of the real-time parameter estimation and GMV. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated and compared with its adaptive minimum variance (AMV) counterpart under two distinct scenarios: TCP network with unknown parameters and TCP network with time varying parameters. Simulation results indicate that, in either case. AGMV is able to keep the queue length around the desired point. In addition, the superior performance of the proposed controller has been shown with regard to the PI controller, which is well-known in the AQM domain. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
