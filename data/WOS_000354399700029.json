These models are obtained by expanding the linearized Boltzmann collision operator into series, and a practical algorithm is proposed for evaluating the coefficients in the series. The sequence is proven to be convergent to the linearized Boltzmann operator, and it established a connection between the Shakhov model and the linearized collision model. The convergence is demonstrated by solving the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation. By observing the magnitudes of the coefficients, simpler models are developed through removing small entries in the coefficient matrices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
