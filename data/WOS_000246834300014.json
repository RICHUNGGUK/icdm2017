On the one hand, this allows the end user to change from wired to wireless infrastructure in even more application scenarios; on the other hand interference sensitive modes reduce the maximum range between the mobile station and the access point (AP). To extend the transmission range transparently, relay APs form a mesh network and provide wireless connection over large areas. Besides path selection, a crucial capability of a wireless mesh network is the ability to share the available spectrum among the participants. In this work, we classify two inherently different MAC protocols according to this ability. The well-known IEEE 802.11 DCF takes the position of a typical CSMA/CA protocol, whereas the Mesh Network Alliance (MNA) represents a distributed, reservation-based approach. To assess their performance, we follow a dual approach: first we develop a method to compute the capacity bounds of the protocols in the considered scenarios. It helps to estimate the absolute gain of spectrum sharing in wireless mesh networks. Second, the WARP2 simulation engine is used to compare the distributed behaviour of both protocols. This results in a relative evaluation. A final conclusion is drawn by combining the simulation and the theoretical results. It underlines the significant possibilities of the MNA approach and shows future directions for capacity gains. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
