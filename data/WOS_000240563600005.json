The manufacturing department must integrate the manufacturing and the workpiece position dispersions during the choice of tools and the machine operating modes and parameter values to respect the functional constraints. In this article, the authors suggest a model for the turning dispersions taking into account not only geometrical specifications of position or orientation, but also the experience of method actors. A representation using the principle of know-how maps in two or three dimensions is privileged. The most interesting aspect is that these maps include tacit and explicit knowledge. An experimental study realized on a machine tool (HES 300) allows one to elaborate knowledge maps especially for the turning process.", "paper_title": "Maps of dispersions for machining processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000240563600005"}
