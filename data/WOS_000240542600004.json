In particular, the large hub ports have heavy congestions in getting the containers in and out of the ports. Therefore the ports are regarded as the bottleneck in the logistics. In this paper, we analyze the new requirements of port logistics to figure out heavy congestions and then present the system prototype for identification and positioning or tracking in the port environments. Our solution is composed of three parts: RFID, electronic container seal, and RTLS system. The system design focuses on three parts: 1) the standard compliance with the ISO, 2) the energy saving mechanism to maintain the longevity of tags as long as possible, and 3) the high identification rate in the presence of multiple tags. The performance evaluation of the system is also included in the paper. These systems will provide a complete range of port logistics services.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of a smart tag system for IT-based port logistics", "paper_id": "WOS:000240542600004"}
