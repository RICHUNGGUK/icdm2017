The results of an experimental study of applying the Kullback-Leibler distance to the problem of oil palm classification are presented. It is shown that the proposed algorithm has an excellent accuracy and it can be computed very fast. The overall proposed system is simple and useful for oil palm farmers and entrepreneurs.
