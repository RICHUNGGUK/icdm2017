Previous works have emphasized the advantage of setting Renyi's exponent to a value different from one in the context of BSS. In this paper, we focus on zero-order Renyi's entropy minimization for the blind extraction of bounded sources (BEBS). We point out the advantage of choosing the extended zero-order Renyi's entropy as a cost function in the context of BEBS, when the sources have non-convex supports.", "paper_title": "Zero-entropy minimization for blind extraction of bounded sources (BEBS)", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300093"}
