The system consists of a server monitoring center, Internet network and PC-based multiparameter monitors. Using the B/S model, the clients can browse web pages via the server monitoring center and download and install ActiveX controls. The physiological multi-parameters are collected, displayed and remotely transmitted. The experimental results show that the system is stable, reliable and operates in real time. The system is suitable for use in physiological multi-parameter remote monitoring for family and community health care. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
