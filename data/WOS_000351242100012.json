Typically such schemes are not resilient to adversaries who are able to collect a considerable amount of session transcripts, and can process them automatically in order to extract the secret. In this paper we discuss a possible enhancement to graphical passwords aiming at making infeasible to the attacker to automatically process the collected transcripts. In particular, we investigate the possibility of replacing static graphical challenges with on-the-fly edited videos. In our approach, the system challenges the user by showing her a short film containing a number of pre-defined passevents and the user replies with the proof that she recognized such events. We present a proof-of-concept prototype, FilmPW, and discuss some issues related to event life-cycle management. Our preliminary experiments show that such an authentication mechanism is well accepted by users and achieves low error rates.", "paper_title": "On user authentication by means of video events recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000351242100012"}
