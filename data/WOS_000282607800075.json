The control limits on the bivariate binomial control region can be obtained. The detection ability of the cause selecting control charts is compared to those of Shewhart attributes control charts and the bivariate binomial control region by different correlation. Numerical example and simulation study show that the cause selecting control charts perform better than Shewhart attributes control charts anti the bivariate binomial control region.
