But it is not limited in this domain, it can also occur in any software system that is subject to changes. With the introduction of service composition technique in the Web services area, a variety of message interactions are resulted among the composed services. As a result, Web Services Feature Interactions problem becomes inevitable. This paper investigates the detection of this problem and proposes a novel multilayer detection system (WSFIDS) by taking inspiration from the immune system. With the application of some immune principles, the system provides an effective method to detect both known and previously unknown feature interactions.", "paper_title": "Detecting the Web services feature interactions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200016"}
