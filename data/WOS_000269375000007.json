The present approach achieves sufficient accuracy at the immersed boundary and overcomes deficiencies in previous IB methods by introducing additional constraints - a compatibility for the interpolated velocity boundary condition related to mass conservation and the formal decoupling of the pressure on this surfaces. The immersed boundary-approximated domain method (IB-ADM) developed in the present study satisfies these conditions with an inexpensive computational overhead. The IB-ADM correctly predicts the near-wall velocity, pressure and scalar fields in several example problems, including flows around a very thin solid object for which incorrect results were obtained with previous IB methods. In order to have sufficient near-wall mesh resolution for LES and DNS computations, the present approach uses local mesh refinement. The present method has been also successfully applied to computation of the wall-pressure space-time correlation in DNS of turbulent channel flow on grids not aligned with the boundaries. When applied to a turbulent flow around an airfoil, the computed flow statistics - the mean/RMS flow field and power spectra of the wall pressure - are in good agreement with experiment.
