Recently an effort has been exercised to advance with logics that possess a symmetric difference ([13, 14]) - with so called orthocomplemented difference lattices (ODLs). This paper further contributes to this effort. In [13] the author constructs an ODL that is not set-representable. This example is quite elaborate. A main result of this paper somewhat economizes on this construction: There is an ODL with 3 generators that is not set-representable (and so the free ODL with 3 generators cannot be set-representable). The result is based on a specific technique of embedding orthomodular lattices into ODLs. The ODLs with 2 generators are always set-representable as we show by characterizing the free ODL with 2 generators - this ODL is MO(3) x 2(4).", "paper_title": "ORTHOCOMPLEMENTED DIFFERENCE LATTICES WITH FEW GENERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000288625300005"}
