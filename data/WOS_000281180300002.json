SUTIL selection mechanism prioritizes networks with higher relevance to the application and lower energy consumption and it enables full and seamless connectivity to mobile user devices and applications. Consequently, SUTIL contributes to realize the vision of ubiquitous computing, in which services, devices, and sensor-enriched environments interact anytime, anywhere to accomplish human designed tasks. The provided solution is based on utility function and integer linear programming and it aims at: (i) maximizing the user satisfaction while meeting application QoS and (ii) minimizing the energy consumption of devices when connecting to a target network. The solution is global since it considers for a given base station all devices that are simultaneously candidate for handoff. Simulation results showed the benefits of SUTIL usage in NGN environments. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
