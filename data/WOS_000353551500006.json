Firstly, the distributed image retrieval platform with multi-agent is constructed by using Aglet development system, the lifecycle and the migration mechanism of agent is designed and planned for multi-agent image retrieval by using the characteristics of mobile agent. Then, considering the redundant image brought by distributed multi-agent retrieval, the duplicate images in distributed retrieval results are filtered based on the perceptual hashing feature extracted in the compressed-domain. Finally, weight-based hamming distance is utilized to re-rank the retrieval results. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can effectively filter the duplicate images in distributed image retrieval results as well as improve the accuracy and speed of compressed-domain image retrieval.", "paper_title": "A Compressed-Domain Image Filtering and Re-Ranking Approach for Multi-Agent Image Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000353551500006"}
