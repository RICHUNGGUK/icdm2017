The development of membrane action in RC slabs restrained against lateral displacements at the edges in buildings and bridge structures significantly increases their load carrying capacity. The benefits of compressive membrane action are usually not taken into account in currently available design methods based on yield-line theory. By extending the existing knowledge of compressive membrane action, it is possible to design slabs in building and bridge decks economically with less than normal reinforcement. The processes involved in the development of ANN model such as the creation of a database of test results from previous research studies, the selection of architecture of the network from extensive trial and error procedure, and the training and performance validation of the model are presented. The ANN model was found to predict accurately the ultimate strength of fully restrained RC slabs. The model also was able to incorporate strength enhancement of RC slabs due to membrane action as confirmed from a comparative study of experimental and yield line-based predictions. Practical applications of the developed ANN model in the design process of RC slabs are also highlighted.", "paper_title": "Artificial neural network model for the strength prediction of fully restrained RC slabs subjected to membrane action", "paper_id": "WOS:000243390000005"}
