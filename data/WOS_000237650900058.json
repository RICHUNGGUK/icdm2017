It also discusses a new design methodology of power reduction techniques for high-performance chips. As confirmed through the experiment, we are maximizing the performance of the chip in terms of speed and power. The simulation results of the proposed method are compared and possible improvements and applications are discussed.", "paper_title": "Design trade-offs and power reduction techniques for high performance circuits and system", "paper_id": "WOS:000237650900058"}
