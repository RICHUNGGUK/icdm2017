In this paper, we propose a fault-tolerant tableless routing protocol called E-cube(+), inspired from e-cube routing protocol, to support intelligent rerouting. A range of fault-tolerant routing properties of E-cube(+) (such as loop-freeness, failure recovery guarantees, and bounded latency) have been derived and analyzed. Experiment results also show that E-cube(+) is able to route data properly without complicated and energy-intensive routing table lookup processes even when node failures occur.", "paper_title": "E-Cube(+) Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks in the Presence of Network Failures", "paper_id": "WOS:000352416700001"}
