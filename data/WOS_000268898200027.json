We first compute the sub-band decomposition and electrostatic force field described by a Schrodinger-Poisson coupled system solved by a Newton-Raphson iteration using the eigenvalue/eigen-function decomposition. The transport in the classical direction for each sub-band modeled by semiclassical Boltzmann-type equations is solved by conservative semi-lagrangian characteristic-based methods. Numerical results are shown for both the thermodynamical equilibrium and time-dependent simulations in typical nowadays nanoMOSFETs. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
