The objective is to minimize the sum of facility and assignment costs. We prove that the competitive ratio for Online Facility Location is Theta (log n/log log n). On the negative side, we show that no randomized algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio better than Omega (log n/log log n) against an oblivious adversary even if the demands lie on a line segment. On the positive side, we present a deterministic algorithm which achieves a competitive ratio of O (log n/log log n) in every metric space.", "paper_title": "On the competitive ratio for Online Facility Location", "paper_id": "WOS:000251647800001"}
