The wireless sensors devices can real-time acquire contextual information and send it to the information system by using wireless communication technologies. These wireless communication technologies are including radio frequency identification (RFID), ZigBee, and Bluetooth. The resulting environment, called SAS, combines a Shopping Automation System (SAS) with wireless communication technology and wireless sensors devices to raise customer satisfaction and improve firm competitiveness. The performance of the SAS in providing personal ubiquitous service investigated empirically through deployment in a popular, large-scale sporting goods store. The proposed system is found to significantly improve daily business operations.", "paper_title": "Developing a Smart Shopping Automation System: Ambient Intelligence in Practice", "paper_id": "WOS:000324972600006"}
