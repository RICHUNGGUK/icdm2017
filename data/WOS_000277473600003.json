We show that any string graph with in edges can be separated into two parts of roughly equal size by the removal of O(m(3/4)root log m) vertices. This result is then used to deduce that every string graph with n vertices and no complete bipartite subgraph K(t,t) has at most c(t)n edges, where c(t) is a constant depending only on t. Another application shows that locally tree-like string graphs are globally tree-like: for any epsilon > 0, there is an integer g(epsilon) such that every string graph with n vertices and girth at least g(epsilon) has at most (1 + epsilon)n edges. Furthermore, the number of such labelled graphs is at most (1 + epsilon)(n) T(n), where T(n) = n(n-2) is the number of labelled trees on n vertices.", "paper_title": "A Separator Theorem for String Graphs and its Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000277473600003"}
