Calculated IP value remains almost constant along the series of isomers, while EA value depends on the nitro group position, increasing by ca. 0.2 eV on passing from 6- to 1-NBaP (or 3-NBaP) isomer. Stability, mu and alpha values decrease in the order 6-NBaP < 1-NBa similar to 3-NBaP, the largest mu variation being predicted to be 1.5 D (30%) by DFT computations. The results obtained herein are consistent with the observed greater mutagenic activity of 3- and 1-NBaP in comparison to 6-NBaP isomer, suggesting that both binding to enzyme, which depends on electric properties, and reduction process, which is related to EA value may be crucial steps in the mutagenic mechanism of this series of isomers.", "paper_title": "Electronic properties of some nitrobenzo[a]pyrene isomers: a possible relationship to mutagenic activity", "paper_id": "WOS:000256010300006"}
