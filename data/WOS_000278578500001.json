In this paper, a vEB-tree (van Emde Boas tree)-based architecture is proposed for interactive VoD services in peer-to-peer networks. The proposed architecture divides a video into many segments that are distributed among participating peers. In this architecture, it includes a vEB-tree-based topology, searching procedures for demand segments, and a segment distribution scheme. It not only efficiently provides interactive operations but also reduces control messages. Additionally, each peer stores segments based on the proposed segment distribution scheme to reduce server stress. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperforms other competing architectures in terms of jump latency, server stress, and cost of maintaining searching topology.
