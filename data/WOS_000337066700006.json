We present syntactic results showing: the fidelity of the behaviour of the linear connectives of the enriched effect calculus; the conservativity of the enriched effect calculus over its non-linear core (the effect calculus); and the non-conservativity of intuitionistic linear logic when considered as an extension of the enriched effect calculus. The second half of the article investigates models for the enriched effect calculus, based on enriched category theory. We give several examples of such models, relating them to models of standard effect calculi (such as those based on monads), and to models of intuitionistic linear logic. We also prove soundness and completeness.", "paper_title": "The enriched effect calculus: syntax and semantics", "paper_id": "WOS:000337066700006"}
