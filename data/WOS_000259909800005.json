The expected first hitting time is one of the most important theoretical issues of evolutionary algorithms, since it implies the average computational time complexity. In this paper, we establish a bridge between the expected first hitting time and another important theoretical issue, i.e., convergence rate. Through this bridge, we propose a new general approach to estimating the expected first hitting time. Using this approach, we analyze EAs with different configurations, including three mutation operators, with/without population, a recombination operator and a time variant mutation operator, on a hard problem. The results show that the proposed approach is helpful for analyzing a broad range of evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we give an explanation of what makes a problem hard to EAs, and based on the recognition, we prove the hardness of a general problem.
