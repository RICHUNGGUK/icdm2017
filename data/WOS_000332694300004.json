We evaluate the usability and the impact of the use of an audio and haptic-based videogame on the development of orientation and mobility skills in school-age learners who are blind. The results show that the interfaces used in the videogame are usable and appropriately designed, and that the haptic interface is as effective as the audio interface for orientation and mobility purposes.", "paper_title": "Development of Navigation Skills through Audio Haptic Videogaming in Learners who are Blind", "paper_id": "WOS:000332694300004"}
