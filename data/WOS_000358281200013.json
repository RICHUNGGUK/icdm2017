Shearing interferometry and direction-indicating colour schlieren are implemented in conjunction with high-speed time-resolved imaging. Comparisons between the results provided by the two flow visualization systems are made at incident shock strengths of Mach 1.28 and Mach 1.35. The results from both systems indicate the complex nature of the transient compression and expansion systems developed during the interaction behind the various shock fronts. The direction-indicating results prove valuable in eliminating the ambiguity with respect to the sign of the high-order fringes found in the shearing interferometry results.", "paper_title": "High-speed imaging of shock wave focusing in concave profiles using shearing interferometry and direction-indicating colour schlieren", "paper_id": "WOS:000358281200013"}
