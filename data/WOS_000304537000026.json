The identification of replication origins helps to reveal the mechanism of the regulation of DNA replication. However, only few eukaryotic replication origins were characterized not long ago; nevertheless, recent genome-wide approaches have boosted the number of mapped replication origins. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of eukaryotic replication origins, we have constructed a Database of Eukaryotic ORIs (DeOri), which contains all the eukaryotic ones identified by genome-wide analyses currently available. A total of 16 145 eukaryotic replication origins have been collected from 6 eukaryotic organisms in which genome-wide studies have been performed, the replication-origin numbers being 433, 7489, 1543, 148, 348 and 6184 for humans, mice, Arabidopsis thaliana, Kluyveromyces lactis, Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster, respectively.", "paper_title": "DeOri: a database of eukaryotic DNA replication origins", "paper_id": "WOS:000304537000026"}
