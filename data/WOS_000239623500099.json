SVMs are trained with the interpolation error distribution of down-sampled interpolated image to estimate interpolation error of the source image. Interpolation correction is employed to the interpolated result of source image with SVMs regression to obtain more accuracy result image. Error correction results of linear, cubic and warped distance adaptive interpolation algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme.", "paper_title": "Support vector machines based image interpolation correction scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500099"}
