Then, an iterative shrinkage (IS) algorithm from compressed sensing is adopted to further improve the estimation performance by using the TD-LS solution as the initial value of IS in the case of sparse channel. Simulation shows that our algorithm combining TD-LS and IS performs better on bit error rate than the frequency-domain LS and matching pursuit in sparse Hilly Terrain channel when the same LS equalizer is adopted.", "paper_title": "An efficient sparse channel estimator combining time-domain LS and iterative shrinkage for OFDM systems with IQ-imbalances", "paper_id": "WOS:000310226800017"}
