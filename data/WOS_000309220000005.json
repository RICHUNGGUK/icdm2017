This paper proposes a nonlinear synchronization scheme for the time-delay chaotic system in the presence of noise. In this scheme, an integrator is introduced to suppress the influence of channel noise in the synchronization process. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed scheme which is strongly robust against noises, especially the high-frequency noises.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of Time-Delay Chaotic System in Presence of Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000005"}
