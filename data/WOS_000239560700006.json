Assuming that articulations can be modeled as near-isometries, we show an axiomatic construction of an articulation-invariant distance between shapes, formulated as a generalized multidimensional scaling (CMDS) problem and solved efficiently. Some numerical results demonstrating the accuracy of our method are presented.", "paper_title": "Matching two-dimensional articulated shapes using generalized multidimensional scaling", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700006"}
