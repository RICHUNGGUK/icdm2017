Here a set of points P is given; the objective is to choose minimum number of points in P to pierce the unit disks centered at all the points in P. We first propose a very simple algorithm that produces 12-approximation result in O(n log n)time. Next, we improve the approximation factor to 4 and then to 3. The worst case running time of these algorithms are O(n(8) log n) and O(n(15) log n) respectively. A part from the space required for storing the input, the extra work-space requirement for each of these algorithms is O(1). Finally, we propose a PTAS for the same problem. Given a positive integer k, it can produce a solution with performance ratio (1+1/k)(2) in n(O(k)) time", "paper_title": "APPROXIMATION ALGORITHMS FOR A VARIANT OF DISCRETE PIERCING SET PROBLEM FOR UNIT DISKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340137400004"}
