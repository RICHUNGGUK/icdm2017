Trust negotiation (TN) frameworks have been proposed as a better solution for open environments, in which parties may get in touch and interact without being previously known to each other. In this paper, we illustrate PROTUNE, a rule-based TN system. By describing PROTUNE, we will illustrate the advantages that arise from an advanced rule-based approach in terms of deployment efforts, user friendliness, communication efficiency, and interoperability. The generality and technological feasibility of PROTUNE's approach are assessed through an extensive analysis and experimental evaluations.", "paper_title": "A Rule-Based Trust Negotiation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000281989800003"}
