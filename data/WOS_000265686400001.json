The combined number system is called RNS/SD for short. Since the performance of RNS/SD arithmetic circuits depends on the choice of the moduli set (a set of pairwise prime numbers), the purpose of this work is to compare RNS/SD number systems based on different sets. Five specific moduli sets of different lengths are selected. Moduli-set-specific forward and reverse RNS/SD converters are introduced for each of these sets. A generic conversion technique for moduli sets consisting of any number of elements is also presented. Finite impulse response (FIR) filters are used as reference designs in order to evaluate the performance of RNS/SD processing. The designs are evaluated with respect to delay and circuit area in a commercial 0.13 mu m CMOS process. For the case of FIR filters it is shown that generic moduli sets with five or six moduli results in designs with the best area x delay products.", "paper_title": "Forward and Reverse Converters and Moduli Set Selection in Signed-Digit Residue Number Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000265686400001"}
