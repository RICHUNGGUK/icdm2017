So, the identification of different behaviors of nodes is one of the important issues in OMNs. In this paper, we propose a Distributed Strategy Identification Scheme (DISIDE), using which a node identifies other nodes' strategies locally. In the proposed scheme, a node learns from its own observation, while receiving or forwarding messages to other nodes. In addition, it learns from other nodes by exchanging information. Based on these observations, each node identifies other nodes' strategies insa distributed manner. We implement DISIDE on different routing protocols with the existing cooperative strategy adaptation scheme, DISCUSS. Simulation results show that the detection efficiency of the network varies between 70-100% in real, map based and random entity mobility models. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
