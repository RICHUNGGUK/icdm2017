In the pickup and delivery problem with transfer (PDPT), for each request, its load picked up at the pickup point is allowed to be dropped at a transshipment point before it is picked up again and delivered to the delivery point by another vehicle. This paper analyzes the maximum travel cost that can be saved by introducing a transshipment point to the pickup and delivery problem (PDP). We show that the bounds are in proportion to square root of the number of cycles in an optimal PDPT solution and also square root of the number of requests. We furthermore present an instance that the bound is the tight for a special case.", "paper_title": "Worst case analysis for pickup and delivery problems with transfer", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300009"}
