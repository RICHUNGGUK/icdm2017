To follow the evolution, Search Engines have been undergoing continuous updates in order to provide the user with a well-targeted, personalized and improved experience of the web. Along with this focus on content quality and user preferences, search engines have also been striving to integrate Semantic Web primitives, in order to enhance their intelligence. Current work discusses the evolution of search engine ranking factors in a Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 context. A benchmark crawler LSHrank, has been developed, which employs known search engine APIs and evaluates results against various already established metrics, in different domains and types of web content The ultimate LSHrank objective is the development of a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) mechanism that will enrich and alter the content of a website in order to achieve its optimal ranking in search engine result pages (SERPs).
