To separate static and dynamic code, several static analyses and type systems have been put forward. We consider Pfenning's type theory with irrelevant quantification which is compatible with a type-based notion of equality that respects eta-laws. We extend Pfenning's theory to universes and large eliminations and develop its meta-theory. Subject reduction, normalization and consistency are obtained by a Kripke model over the typed equality judgement. Finally, a type-directed equality algorithm is described whose completeness is proven by a second Kripke model.", "paper_title": "ON IRRELEVANCE AND ALGORITHMIC EQUALITY IN PREDICATIVE TYPE THEORY", "paper_id": "WOS:000302505000029"}
