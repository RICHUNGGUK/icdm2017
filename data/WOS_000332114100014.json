We describe the conditions under which such a word exists. Moreover, a natural generalization of Fine and Wilf's Theorem is proved. Finally, we introduce and describe a new family of words sharing properties with the so-called central words. In particular, under some simple conditions, we prove that these words are pseudopalindromes, a result consistent with the fact that central words are palindromes.", "paper_title": "MULTIPSEUDOPERIODIC WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000332114100014"}
