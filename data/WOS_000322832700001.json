We construct a generalized numerical flux at element edges on the basis of a nonstaggered inhomogeneous dual mesh, which reproduces the one postulated by Kurganov and Tadmor under the assumption of homogeneous storage coefficient. Numerical simulations of two-phase flow in strongly heterogeneous porous media illustrate the performance of the proposed scheme and highlight the important rule of the permeability-porosity correlation on finger growth and breakthrough curves.
