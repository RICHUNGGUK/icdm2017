Despite the research that has been conducted to examine the factors that explain teachers' intention to use technology, few have developed a model to statistically explain the interactions among these factors and how they influence teachers' intention to use technology. Five variables (perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, subjective norm, facilitating conditions, and attitude towards use) and behavioural intention to use technology were used to build a research model in this study and structural equation modelling was used for parameter estimation and model testing. Self-reported data were gathered from 592 teachers from schools in Singapore. Results revealed a good model fit and of the nine hypotheses formulated in this study, eight were supported. Subjective norm was not found to be a significant influence on teachers' intention to use technology while the other four variables were. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
