Unfortunately, deep submicron CMOS process technology is marred by increasing susceptibility to wear. Prolonged operational stress gives rise to accelerated wearout and failure due to several physical failure mechanisms, including hot-carrier injection (HCI) and negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI). Each failure mechanism correlates with different usage-based stresses, all of which can eventually generate permanent faults. While the wearout of an individual core in many-core CMPs may not necessarily be catastrophic, a single fault in the interprocessor network-on-chip (NoC) fabric could render the entire chip useless, as it could lead to protocol-level deadlocks, or even partition away vital components such as the memory controller or other critical I/O. In this article, we study HCI- and NBTI-induced wear due to actual stresses caused by real workloads, applied onto the interconnect microarchitecture and develop a critical path model for NBTI-induced wearout. A key finding of this modeling is that, counter to prevailing wisdom, wearout in the CMP's on-chip interconnect is correlated with lack of load observed in the NoC routers rather than high load. We then develop a novel wearout-decelerating scheme in which routers under low load have their wear-sensitive components exercised without significantly impacting cycle time, pipeline depth, area, or power consumption of the overall router. A novel deterministic approach is proposed for the generation of appropriate exercise-mode data, ensuring design parameter targets are met. We subsequently show that the proposed design yields an similar to 2,300x decrease in the rate of wear.", "paper_title": "Use It or Lose It: Proactive, Deterministic Longevity in Future Chip Multiprocessors", "paper_id": "WOS:000362344900019"}
