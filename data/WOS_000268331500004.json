More specifically, a method for verifying the equivalence of logic program modules is devised and proved correct. The idea is to adapt a translation-based verification technique, which was originally devised for complete programs only, for program modules. In addition, optimization strategies are addressed in order to exploit the modular structure of programs in verification tasks. A number of experiments on verification strategies are also conducted using lpeq which implements the verification method for the smodels system. The preliminary experimental results reported in this article suggest that the modularization of equivalence verification leads to potential time savings especially if the modules involved share a common context.", "paper_title": "A Translation-based Approach to the Verification of Modular Equivalence", "paper_id": "WOS:000268331500004"}
