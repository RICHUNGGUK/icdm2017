Since then, some attempts have been made to make CFA efficient, but none of these solutions is suitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we will propose a new CFA algorithm that can be used in such environments.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Constrained Fuzzy Arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000266677000012"}
