These processes can perform quantum computations, but it is challenging to design graphs with desired scattering behavior. In this paper, we study and construct momentum switches, graphs that route particles depending on their momenta. We also give an example where there is no exact momentum switch, although we construct an arbitrarily good approximation.", "paper_title": "MOMENTUM SWITCHES", "paper_id": "WOS:000358188700005"}
