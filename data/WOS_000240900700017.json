We discuss how the choice of atomic partial charges and the length of the trajectories affect the predicted structures of the dimers and compare our results to those of earlier MD-simulations, which were restricted to only 0.7 ns. Our results confirm that monomers of P6G easily undergo relative rotations within the dimer, but we found new conformations of the R6G dimer at longer simulation times. In addition, we analyzed in detail the energy change during the formation of dimers. With suitable corrections, the electrostatic energy from an Ewald treatment agrees with the results from an approach relying on a residue-based cutoff. For P6G, we show that the strong solvent-mediated electrostatic attraction between the monomers is counteracted by an almost equally large solvent-induced entropy contribution to yield a small driving force to dimer formation, in very good agreement with the free-energy change from a thermodynamic-integration procedure. Thus, earlier rationalizations of the dimer formation, based only on energy arguments, yield a qualitatively wrong picture.", "paper_title": "Molecular-dynamics simulations of pyronine 6G and rhodamine 6G dimers in aqueous solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240900700017"}
