A program in DSA form does not perform any destructive update of scalars and array elements; that is, each element is written at most once. As DSA makes the dependencies between variable references explicit, it facilitates complex analyses and optimizations of programs. Existing transformations into DSA perform a complex data flow analysis with exponential analysis time, and they work only for a limited class of input programs. Our method removes irregularities from the data flow by adding copy assignments to the program, so that it can use simple data flow analyses. The presented DSA transformation scales very well with growing program sizes and overcomes a number of important limitations of existing methods. We have implemented the method and it is being used in the context of memory optimization and verification of those optimizations. Experiments show that in practice, the method scales well indeed, and that added copy operations can be removed in case they are unwanted.", "paper_title": "A practical dynamic single assignment transformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000250227600004"}
