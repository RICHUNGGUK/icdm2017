In this work, the features of neuron division and neuron budding are introduced into the framework of spiking neural P systems, which are processes inspired by neural stem cell division. With neuron division and neuron budding, a spiking neural P system can generate exponential work space in polynomial time as the case for P systems with active membranes. In this way, spiking neural P systems can efficiently solve computationally hard problems by means of a space-time tradeoff, which is illustrated with an efficient solution to SAT problem.", "paper_title": "Spiking neural P systems with neuron division and budding", "paper_id": "WOS:000293188100005"}
