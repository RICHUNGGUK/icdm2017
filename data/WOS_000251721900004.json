By analyzing the growing process and the key factors, a causal graph and a system dynamical model, which can describe the changes of corporate lifecycle, are built. The system dynamical model is coded using C# language. The test of the model is done by simulation and the results show that the method of the model is valid for simulating the revolution of corporation lifecycle, and can be served as computer-based tool for managers to make decisions for the future growth of the organization.
