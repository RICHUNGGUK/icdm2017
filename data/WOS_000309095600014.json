It assumes a spatial domain decomposition of particles into Voronoi cells. It is a gradient method which attempts to minimize a cost function by displacing Voronoi sites associated with each processor/subdomain along steepest descent directions. Excellent load balance has been obtained for quasi-2D and 3D practical applications, with up to 440 . 10(6) particles on 65,536 MPI tasks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
