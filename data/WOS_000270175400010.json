A new concept of interesting knowledge based on both accuracy and coverage is defined in this paper for dynamic information systems. An incremental model and approach as well as its algorithm for inducing interesting knowledge are proposed when the object set varies over time. A case study validates the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Incremental Approach for Inducing Knowledge from Dynamic Information Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000270175400010"}
