The proposed MOWG design uses signal reuse techniques to reduce hardware cost in the MOWG transformation, whereas it increases the speed by eliminating the inverters from the critical path. This is accomplished through reconstructing the key and initial vector loading algorithm and the feedback polynomial of the linear feedback shift register. The proposed WG design uses properties of the trace function to optimize the hardware cost in the WG transformation. The application-specific integrated circuit and field-programmable gate array implementations of the proposed designs show that their areas and power consumptions outperform the existing implementations of the WG cipher.", "paper_title": "New Implementations of the WG Stream Cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000341565300003"}
