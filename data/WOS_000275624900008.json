The generic (sharing) context lemmas are provided for may- as well as two variants of must-convergence, which hold in a broad class of extended process- and extended lambda calculi, if the calculi satisfy certain natural conditions. As a guide-line, the proofs of the context lemmas are valid in call-by-need calculi, in call-by-value calculi if substitution is restricted to variable-by-variable and in process calculi like variants of the pi-calculus. For calculi employing beta-reduction using a call-by-name or call-by-value strategy or similar reduction rules, some iu-variants of ciu-theorems are obtained from our context lemmas. Our results reestablish several context lemmas already proved in the literature, and also provide some new context lemmas as well as some new variants of the ciu-theorem. To make the results widely applicable, we use a higher-order abstract syntax that allows untyped calculi as well as certain simple typing schemes. The approach may lead to a unifying view of higher-order calculi, reduction. and observational equality. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
