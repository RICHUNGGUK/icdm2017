Sufficient conditions for this problem to be solvable are derived, where the zero dynamics is unstabilisable under an arbitrary switching. When the switching signal satisfies an average dwell time scheme, H-infinity output tracking is achieved by virtue of a designed switched integral controller. A numerical example is illustrated to show the effectiveness of the main result.", "paper_title": "Output tracking control of cascade switched nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000340192900006"}
