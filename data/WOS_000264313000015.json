The shortest paths in semidirected circulant graphs are called the restricted shortest paths in 2-circulant graphs. In this paper we show that the problem of finding the restricted shortest paths is equivalent (1) to solving an optimization problem which involves Diophantine equations and (2) to the closest vector problem in a subset of a point lattice of all cyclic paths of the graph. We also present our new, efficient algorithm for constructing the restricted shortest paths which requires O(log n) arithmetic operations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
