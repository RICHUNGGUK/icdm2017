This work contributes to user modeling and intelligent interfaces research by extending existing research on eye-tracking in HCl to on-line capturing of high-level user mental states for real-time interaction tailoring. We first describe the empirical work we did to understand the user meta-cognitive behaviors to be modeled. We then illustrate the probabilistic user model we designed to capture these behaviors with the help of on-line information on user attention patterns derived from eye-tracking data. Next, we describe the evaluation of this model, showing that gaze-tracking data can significantly improve model performance compared to lower level, time-based evidence. Finally, we discuss work we have done on using pupil dilation information, also gathered through eye-tracking data, to further improve model accuracy. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
