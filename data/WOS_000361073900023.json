This paper discusses the repulsive forces between two clay particles on the basis of the model in which two identical plates with finite length are symmetrically placed about a mid-plane. It is proven that the electrical repulsion calculated by the method commonly adopted in the literature is actually the osmotic repulsion, which only considers the contribution from excess osmotic pressure but ignores the contribution from Maxwell's stress. A formula, which includes not only potential itself but potential gradient terms, is proposed to determine the total repulsive force between two clay particles. Finally, numerical calculations show that the errors due to neglecting the potential gradient terms can be up to over 25%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
