A new technique is proposed to avoid the so called \"secular'' terms and to improve the computation efficiency of the HAM. The closed form expressions are obtained for the two dimensional flow; two branches of solutions are found first. For the non-slip case, we arrive at the convergence results by a third order iterative, which is better than that of a twenty-fifth order iterative in the literature obtained by classical HAM. Moreover, the effects of pertinent parameters on the axisymmetric flow and heat transfer are analyzed and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
