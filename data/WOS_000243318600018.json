Monitoring such multilingual workflows in the Grid requires an instrumentation infrastructure that is capable of dealing with workflow components implemented in different programming languages. Moreover, Grid workflows introduce multiple levels of abstraction and all levels must be taken into account in order to understand the performance behaviour of a workflow. As a result, any instrumentation infrastructure for Grid workflows should assist the user/tool to conduct the monitoring and analysis at multiple levels of abstraction. This paper presents a novel instrumentation infrastructure for Grid services that addresses the above-mentioned issues by supporting the instrumentation of multilingual Grid workflows at multiple levels of abstraction using a unified, highly interoperable interface.", "paper_title": "An instrumentation infrastructure for grid workflow applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318600018"}
