The formalism was validated on simulated data and applied to real neurons recorded from the rat somatosensory cortex. From the general Poisson exact breakdown, a considerable number of mutual information measures introduced in the neural computation literature can be directly derived, including the exact breakdown (Pola, Thiele, Hoffmann, & Panzeri, 2003), the Poisson exact breakdown (Scaglione, Foffani, Scannella, Cerutti, & Moxon, 2008) the synergy and redundancy between neurons (Schneidman, Bialek, & Berry, 2003), and the information lost by an optimal decoder that assumes the absence of correlations between neurons (Nirenberg & Latham, 2003; Pola et al., 2003). The general Poisson exact breakdown thus offers a convenient set of building blocks for studying the role of correlations in population codes.", "paper_title": "General Poisson Exact Breakdown of the Mutual Information to Study the Role of Correlations in Populations of Neurons", "paper_id": "WOS:000277594200002"}
