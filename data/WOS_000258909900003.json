This article provides bounds for the super connectivity kappa(1) of the Cartesian product of two connected graphs, and thus generalizes the main result of Shieh on the super connectedness of the Cartesian product of two regular graphs with maximum connectivity. Particularly, we determine that kappa(1) (K-m x K-n) = min (m + 2n - 4,2m + n - 4] for m + n > 6 and state sufficient conditions to guarantee kappa(1) (K-2 x G) = 2 kappa (G). As a consequence, we immediately obtain the super connectivity of the n-cube for n > 3.
