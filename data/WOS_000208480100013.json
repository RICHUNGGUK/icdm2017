We discuss the modular architecture of the system, and describe the entire loop from multimodal input analysis to multimodal output generation. We also describe how the Virtual Guide detects the level of politeness of the user's utterances in real-time during the dialogue and aligns its own language to that of the user, using different politeness strategies. Finally we report on our first user tests, and discuss some potential extensions to improve the system.", "paper_title": "Natural interaction with a virtual guide in a virtual environment A multimodal dialogue system", "paper_id": "WOS:000208480100013"}
