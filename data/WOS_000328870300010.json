Most of the previous approaches do not specify the case of subflows on paths with different characteristics. Moreover, the transport protocol derived from the canonical multi-path NUM exhibits flappiness in the subflows because of the non-strictly convexity of the optimization problem. This paper introduces a modified multi-path NUM model and proposes a novel approach to overcome the mentioned issues. Using Jensen's inequality, the multi-path NUM is approximated to a strictly convex and separable problem which can be solved efficiently by dual-based decomposition method. The algorithm successively solving a sequence of approximation problems is proven to converge at the global optimum of the original problem. Moreover, considering the separable form of the approximation utility and the dual-based nature of the proposed algorithm, the reverse engineering frameworks of the current TCPs are used to develop a series of multi-path TCPs that are compatible with corresponding regular single-path TCPs.
