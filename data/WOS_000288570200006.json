Results for velocity profiles in divergent and convergent channels are presented for various values of Hartmann and Reynolds numbers. The convergence of the obtained series solutions is explicitly studied and a proper discussion is given for the obtained results. Comparison between HAM and numerical solutions showed excellent agreement. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
