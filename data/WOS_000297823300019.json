Precise and accurate mathematical modelling of multiple response process behaviour holds the key for a better quality product with minimum variability in the process. Artificial neural network (ANN)-based nonlinear grinding process model using backpropagation weight adjustment algorithm (BPNN) is used extensively by researchers and practitioners. However, suitability and systematic approach to implement Levenberg-Marquardt (L-M) and Boyden, Fletcher, Gold-farb and Shanno (BFGS) update Quasi-Newton (Q-N) algorithm for modelling and control of grinding process is seldom explored. This paper provides L-M and BEGS algorithm-based BPNN models for grinding process, and verified their effectiveness by using a real life industrial situation. Based on the real life data, the performance of L-M and BFGS update Q-N are compared with an adaptive learning (A-L) and gradient descent algorithm-based BPNN model. The results clearly indicate that L-M and BEGS-based networks converge faster and can predict the nonlinear behaviour of multiple response grinding process with same level of accuracy as A-L based network.
