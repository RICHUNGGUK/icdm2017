The sufficient conditions on global exponential robust stability established in this paper are easily verifiable. An example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our results.", "paper_title": "Global exponential robust stability of reaction-diffusion interval neural networks with continuously distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000280919700006"}
