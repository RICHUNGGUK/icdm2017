The factors are derived from practical experience reported by industry professionals, through a survey involving 57 Brazilian small, medium and large software organizations. Some of them produce software with commonality between applications, and have mature processes, while others successfully achieved reuse through isolated, ad hoe efforts. The paper compiles the answers from the survey participants, showing which factors were more associated with reuse success. Based on this relationship, a guide is presented, pointing out which factors should be more strongly considered by small, medium and large organizations attempting to establish a reuse program.
