No-signaling boxes are the abstract objects for studying non-locality, and wirings are local operations on the space of no-signaling boxes. This means that, no matter how non-local the nature is, the set of physical non-local correlations must be closed under wirings. Then, one approach to identify the non-locality of nature is to characterize the closed sets of non-local correlations. Although non-trivial examples of wirings of no-signaling boxes are known, there is no systematic way to study wirings. In particular, given a set of no-signaling boxes, we do not know a general method to prove that it is closed under wirings. In this paper, we propose the first general method to construct such closed sets of non-local correlations. We show that a well-known measure of correlation, called maximal correlation, when appropriately defined for non-local correlations, is monotonically decreasing under wirings. This establishes a conjecture about the impossibility of simulating isotropic boxes from each other, implying the existence of a continuum of closed sets of non-local boxes under wirings. To prove our main result, we introduce some mathematical tools that may be of independent interest: we define a notion of maximal correlation ribbon as a generalization of maximal correlation, and provide a connection between it and a known object called hypercontractivity ribbon; we show that these two ribbons are monotone under wirings too.", "paper_title": "Monotone Measures for Non-Local Correlations", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900044"}
