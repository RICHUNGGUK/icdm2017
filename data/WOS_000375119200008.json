The method uses data decomposition based on the differential attribute profiles and Theta-mapping for the extraction of the most-contrasted connected-components. Their filtering is achieved based on multicriterion threshold function. The method is evaluated by comparing the output DTM with the reference Light Detection and Ranging data (LiDAR).", "paper_title": "Detection of Ground in Point-clouds Generated from Stereo-pair Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000375119200008"}
