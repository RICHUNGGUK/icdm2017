With this massive increase in application heterogeneity, the ability to have a general purpose resource management technique that performs well in heterogeneous environments is becoming increasingly important. In this paper, we present Multi-Tier Resource Allocation (MTRA) as a novel fine-grained resource management technique for distributed systems. The core idea is based on allocating resources to individual tasks in a tiered or layered approach. To account for heterogeneity, we propose a dynamic resource allocation method that adjusts resource allocations to individual tasks on a cluster node based on resource utilisation levels. We demonstrate the efficacy of this technique in a data-intensive computing environment, MapReduce data processing framework in Hadoop YARN. Our results demonstrate that MTRA is an effective general purpose resource management technique particularly for data-intensive computing environments. On a range of MapReduce benchmarks in a Hadoop YARN environment, our MTRA technique improves performance by up to 18%. In a Facebook workload model it improves job execution times by 10% on average, and up to 56% for individual jobs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
