Other than defining the visual affective model based on empirical knowledge, a data-driven learning framework is proposed to extract the emotion-related knowledge from a set of emotion-annotated images. In a divide-and-conquer manner, the images are clustered into several emotion-specific scene subgroups for model learning. The visual affection is modeled with Gaussian mixture models based on color features of local image patches. For the purpose of affective filtering, the feature distribution of the target is aligned to the statistical model constructed from the emotion-specific scene subgroup, through a piecewise linear transformation. The transformation is derived through a learning algorithm, which is developed with the incorporation of a regularization term enforcing spatial smoothness, edge preservation, and temporal smoothness for the derived image or video transformation. Optimization of the objective function is sought via standard nonlinear method. Intensive experimental results and user studies demonstrate that the proposed affective filtering framework can yield effective and natural effects for images and videos.", "paper_title": "Data-Driven Affective Filtering for Images and Videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000361751900027"}
