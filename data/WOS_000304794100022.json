For bivariate spline spaces S(5,5,3,3) and S(4,4,2,2), the instability in the dimension is shown over certain types of T-meshes. This result could be considered as an attempt to answer the question of how large the polynomial degree (m,m') should be relative to the smoothness (r,r') to make the dimension of a spline space stable. We show in particular that the bound m >= 2r+1 and m' > 2r'+1 are optimal. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
