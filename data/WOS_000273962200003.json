In order to solve problems and support complex decision-making processes, knowledge and experience have to be transmitted between diverse individuals and organizations. Thus, knowledge-sharing can be considered a fundamental element in any knowledge-oriented process, because it fosters collaboration, and facilitates experiential knowledge discovery, distribution, and use. We present the E-Decisional Community, a proposal for an integrated knowledge-sharing platform where several entities are able to share experiential knowledge. Its main concern is to promote experiential knowledge evolution and sharing through generations of decision makers, aiming at the creation of a marketplace where knowledge is provided as a service.", "paper_title": "Smart Knowledge-Sharing Platform for E-Decisional Community", "paper_id": "WOS:000273962200003"}
