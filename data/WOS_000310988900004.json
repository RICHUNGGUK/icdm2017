With the use of a dynamic state-feedback control, two Hopf bifurcation points in the ML neuron model with Type II excitability can be relocated to new desired locations simultaneously. Also, with the proposed control law, the neuronal excitability characteristics can be transformed from Type I excitability to Type II excitability by changing the type of bifurcation, in which the neuron goes from quiescence to periodic spiking from a saddle node on an invariant circle bifurcation to a Hopf bifurcation. Simulation results are provided.", "paper_title": "Bifurcation control of the Morris-Lecar neuron model via a dynamic state-feedback control", "paper_id": "WOS:000310988900004"}
