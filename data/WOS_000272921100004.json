Using the stroboscopic map of the discrete dynamical system, we obtain the globally attractive condition of predator-extinction periodic solution of the system. We also obtain the permanent condition of the system by the theory of impulsive delay differential equation. Our results indicate that the discrete time delay has influence to the dynamical behaviors of the system. Finally, the numerical analysis is inserted to illustrate the results. (C) 2009 IMACS.
