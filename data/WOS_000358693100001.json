With the development of internet of things (IOT), food traceability system can let the consumer participate in the whole process of the supervision of food production. Thus, the consumers can understand information behind the food. The existing egg traceability systems are lack of unified standard, and they are not practical and not popular. The data sources are not intelligent, timeliness and advantages enough. This paper puts forward an egg traceability system based on video capture and wireless networking technology. In this paper, the authors put forward the general structure of the egg traceability and develop the platform based on the sensor network.", "paper_title": "The egg traceability system based on the video capture and wireless networking technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000358693100001"}
