Toward this end, Kotter and Kschischang propose the use of subspace codes to provide error correction in the network coding context. The primary construction for subspace codes is the lifting of rank-metric or matrix codes, a process that preserves the structural and distance properties of the underlying code. Thus, to characterize the structure and error-correcting capability of these subspace codes, it is valuable to perform such a characterization of the underlying rank-metric and matrix codes. This paper lays a foundation for this analysis through a framework for classifying rank-metric and matrix codes based on their structure and distance properties. To enable this classification, we extend work by Berger on equivalence for rank-metric codes to define a notion of equivalence for matrix codes, and we characterize the group structure of the collection of maps that preserve such equivalence. We then compare the notions of equivalence for these two related types of codes and show that matrix equivalence is strictly more general than rank-metric equivalence. Finally, we characterize the set of equivalence maps that fix the prominent class of rank-metric codes known as Gabidulin codes. In particular, we give a complete characterization of the rank-metric automorphism group of Gabidulin codes, correcting work by Berger, and give a partial characterization of the matrix-automorphism group of the expanded matrix codes that arise from Gabidulin codes.", "paper_title": "Equivalence for Rank-Metric and Matrix Codes and Automorphism Groups of Gabidulin Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000344524100023"}
