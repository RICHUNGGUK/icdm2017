Moreover, the sleep schedules can be constructed using simple systematic algorithms. We also discuss how the proposed protocols can be implemented in mobile devices for adapting to dynamic network conditions in DTN. Theoretical analysis is given to demonstrate the energy efficiency and scalability of the proposed protocols. Simulation results show that the proposed protocols reduce the energy consumption in the idle listening mode up to 35 percent in comparison with other existing asynchronous clock-based sleep scheduling protocols, and more than 90 percent compared with the protocol without power management, while maintaining comparable packet delivery delay and delivery ratio.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Asynchronous Sleep Scheduling Protocols for Delay Tolerant Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292881600008"}
