We derive the upper and lower bit error rate (BER) bounds for the proposed UEP DNC scheme with maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding over Rayleigh fading channels. Numerical results show that the derived analytical bounds are tight and our proposed UEP DNC scheme based on fountain codes has a strong UEP property.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis of Unequal Error Protection Distributed Network Coding Based on Fountain Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681300012"}
