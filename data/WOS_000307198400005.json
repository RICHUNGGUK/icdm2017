In particular, within the domains of image processing and image understanding, regularity-based analysis can be used to describe local image shape and appearance. However, estimating the Holder exponent is not a trivial task, and current methods tend to be computationally slow and complex. This work presents an approach to automatically synthesize estimators of the pointwise Holder exponent for digital images. This task is formulated as an optimization problem and Genetic Programming (GP) is used to search for operators that can approximate a traditional estimator, the oscillations method. Experimental results show that GP can generate estimators that achieve a low error and a high correlation with the ground truth estimation. Furthermore, most of the GP estimators are faster than traditional approaches, in some cases their runtime is orders of magnitude smaller. This result allowed us to implement a real-time estimation of the Holder exponent on a live video signal, the first such implementation in current literature. Moreover, the evolved estimators are used to generate local descriptors of salient image regions, a task for which a stable and robust matching is achieved, comparable with state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, the evolved estimators produced by GP could help expand the application domain of Holder regularity within the fields of image analysis and signal processing. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
