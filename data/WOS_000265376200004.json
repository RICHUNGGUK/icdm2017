We developed a macroscopic approach that incorporates salient attributes of the cortex based on combining tools of nonlinear dynamics, information theory, and the known organizational and anatomical features of cortex. Justifications for this approach and demonstration of its effectiveness are presented. We also demonstrate certain capabilities of this model in producing efficient sparse representations and providing the cortical computational maps.", "paper_title": "Self-Organization in a Parametrically Coupled Logistic Map Network: A Model for Information Processing in the Visual Cortex", "paper_id": "WOS:000265376200004"}
