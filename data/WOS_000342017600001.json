It enables us to track the location of a user by means of trilateration, using the distance between fixed nodes deployed at predetermined locations and a mobile base station. In addition, we propose a method to determine the optimal placement of the fixed nodes using minimum Bayes error estimation based on Gaussian distributions. As a result, this method can accurately estimate the position of the mobile base station with a minimum number of fixed nodes.", "paper_title": "An Efficient Localization Method Based on Adaptive Optimal Sensor Placement", "paper_id": "WOS:000342017600001"}
