The expressions are given in terms of the Meijer G-function, and in terms of a finite sum of hypergeometric functions, and can be easily computed by means of well-known mathematical software tools. As a consequence of the generality of the alpha-mu distribution as well as of the results, these statistics comprise those for the product of arbitrary combinations of other useful distributions such as One-Sided Gaussian, Negative Exponential, Rayleigh, Weibull, Gamma, and Nakagami-m. As an application example, the outage probability for the cascade channel is presented.", "paper_title": "Product of alpha-mu Variates", "paper_id": "WOS:000377706800016"}
