Although the underlying theory for such a study seems intimidating, one can obtain interesting results in this area without too much effort. In this gentle introduction we take the reader on a journey through the basic analytical tools of that theory, giving some illustrative examples using regular expressions. Additionally, new asymptotic average-case results for several epsilon-NFA constructions are presented, in a unified framework. It turns out that, asymptotically, and in the average case, the complexity gap between the several constructions is significantly larger than in the worst case. Furthermore, one of the epsilon-NFA constructions approaches the corresponding epsilon-free NFA construction, asymptotically and on average. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
