Variable spreading factor (VSF) is utilized to improve the data throughput of the system in non-frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. In this contribution, an analytical approach is proposed to compute a new expression for the bit error rate (BER) performance of the STS-based CDMA system against pre-despreading signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) for different values of spreading factor. The other contribution of the paper is deriving a new analytical expression for the throughput enhancement of the VSF STS-based CDMA system in non-frequency selective Rayleigh fading channel. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate that using VSF method in STS-based CDMA system improves the throughput of the system by keeping the BER performance at a target level.
