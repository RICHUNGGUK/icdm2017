We apply multiresolution decomposition to the spread and to the industrial production, and investigate if the term spread presents information that can help predict the path followed by industrial production. We also investigate if all the predictive ability of the spread is due to the monetary policy. The results suggest that the yield spread contains relevant information, and this predictive power varies across time patterns. Inasmuch, the results indicate that the predictive power of the spread is not totally explained by monetary policy. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
