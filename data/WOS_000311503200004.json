We completely classify singular tropical surfaces of maximal-dimensional geometric type, show that they can generically have only finitely many singular points, and describe all possible locations of singular points. More precisely, we show that singular points must be either vertices, or generalized midpoints and barycenters of certain faces of singular tropical surfaces, and, in some case, there may be additional metric restrictions to faces of singular tropical surfaces.", "paper_title": "Tropical Surface Singularities", "paper_id": "WOS:000311503200004"}
