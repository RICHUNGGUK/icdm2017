Transport Audiovisuel avec Protection Inegale des Objets et Controle d'Admission). It is designed in a way that the FEC overhead induced by redundant packets is perfectly controlled by the sender. In order to achieve that, TAPIOCA calculates on-the-fly the optimal erasure code to be used, video data unit by video data unit, under a given bitrate constraint. In addition, and contrary to the well-known PET (Priority Encoding Transmission) system, the video data units of each layer are encoded separately. This is especially useful when all layers are not output from the video coder at the same time. Simulation results for MPEG-4 video streaming show that the proposed FEC system can be very efficient even if packet losses are due to network congestion. Moreover, comparison with PET system shows that TAPIOCA exhibits better performance, considering criteria including the decodable frame rate, protection system efficiency and computational cost.
