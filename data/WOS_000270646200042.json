The parameter selection is an important factor that impacts the performance of SVMs. Evolution Strategy with Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) is an evolutionary optimization strategy, which is used to optimize the parameters of SVMs in this paper. Compared with the traditional SVMs, the optimal SVMs using CMA-ES have more accuracy in predicting the Lorenz signal. The industry case illustrates that the proposed method is very successfully in forecasting the short-term fault of large machinery. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
