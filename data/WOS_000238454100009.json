In addition to the standard LR operations, Shift and Reduce, the new algorithm uses a third operation called Invalidate, which reverses a previously made reduction. This operation makes the mathematical justification of the algorithm significantly different from its prototype. On the other hand, the changes in the implementation are not very substantial, and the algorithm still works in time O(n(4)).", "paper_title": "Generalized LR parsing algorithm for boolean grammars", "paper_id": "WOS:000238454100009"}
