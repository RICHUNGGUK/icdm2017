The internal Steiner tree problem involves finding an internal Steiner tree T whose total cost Sigma((u,v)is an element of E(T)) c(u, v) is the minimum. In this paper, we first show that the internal Steiner tree problem is MAX SNP-hard. We then present a (2 rho + 1)-approximation algorithm for solving the problem on complete graphs, where rho is an approximation ratio for the Steiner tree problem. Currently, the best-known rho is In 4+is an element of < 1.39. Moreover, for the case where the cost of each edge is restricted to being either 1 or 2, we present a 9/7-approximation algorithm for the problem. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
