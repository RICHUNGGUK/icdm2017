Although it is an extensively studied topic, there are still few results regarding synchrony in locally coupled systems. In this paper we give a rigorous proof to show that large numbers of coupled chaotic oscillators with parameter mismatch in a 2D lattice can be synchronized by providing a sufficiently large coupling strength. We demonstrate how the obtained result can be applied to construct an oscillatory network for scene segmentation. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
