It leads to a numerical approximation of this response through the resolution of a small system of equations which, contrary to element-based methods, does not result from a refined spatial discretization. This strategy has already been validated for assemblies of isotropic plates. In this paper, we extend it to the case of orthotropic planar structure. The method is illustrated through various orthotropic plate vibration problems under several types of harmonic loading in the medium-frequency range. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
