This paper introduces a specification framework for the delivery of industrial learning and training, addressing the needs for the \"knowledge\" workers of the factories of the future. A review of the relevant background, including the activities associated with the industrial learning and its basic methods as well as some emerging paradigms, is first provided. A Teaching Factory based paradigm is then suggested as the conceptual foundation of this framework. A cognitive framework, addressing the major building blocks of the industrial learning process, namely the attitude the knowledge the skills and the competences is being defined. An appropriate technology framework, dealing with the needs of engineers and blue-collar workers, for practising the manufacturing knowledge content within digital environments, is suggested at this point. Finally, the approach of the future implementation of the specific framework is being discussed.", "paper_title": "On industrial learning and training for the factories of the future: a conceptual, cognitive and technology framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000319363100006"}
