Important properties of this framework are investigated, and a general non-deterministic Kripke-style semantics is provided. This general semantics is then used to provide a constructive (and very natural), sufficient and necessary coherence criterion for the validity of the strong cut-elimination theorem in such a system. These results suggest new syntactic and semantic characterizations of basic constructive connectives.", "paper_title": "ON CONSTRUCTIVE CONNECTIVES AND SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287816900010"}
