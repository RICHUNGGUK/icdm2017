The circuit has been designed and optimized to be included in an IEEE 802.15.4 standard receiver. In order to minimize power consumption, active loads and currents mirrors have been replaced by optimized inductors and transformers. Moreover, an exhaustive study of the mixed-mode parameters has been carried out, enabling the definition of single-ended figures of merits in terms of mixed-mode S-parameters. The LNA has been implemented using a 0.35 mu m RFCMOS technology. Performances are a noise figure of 4.3 dB, a power gain of 21 dB, and a phase balance of 180 +/- 1 degrees. Regarding non-linear behaviour, the obtained 1 dB-compression point obtained is -9.5 dB m while intermodulation intercept point is -3 dB m, dissipating 6 mA from 1.5 V supply voltage.
