They are based on graph theory and their complexity is O(root nm) where n is the number of variables and m is the sum of the cardinalities of the domains. They improve previous algorithms that ran respectively in O(n (m + n log n)) and O((n + k)(m + n log n)) where k is the cardinality of the union of the domains.", "paper_title": "Improved algorithm for the soft global cardinality constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000238117300023"}
