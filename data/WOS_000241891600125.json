Unlike previous IAs and Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs), in which the population dimension is constant during the evolutionary process, the population size is computed adaptively according to a cloning threshold. This not only enhances convergence speed but also gives more chance to escape from local minima. Extensive simulations are performed on trap functions and their performances are compared both quantitatively and statistically with other immune and evolutionary optmization methods.", "paper_title": "Clonal selection algorithm with dynamic population size for bimodal search spaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000241891600125"}
