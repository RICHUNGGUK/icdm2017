We present a family of invariant games which are variations of Wythoff's game. The set of P-positions of these games is given by a pair of complementary Beatty sequences related to the irrational quadratic number alpha(k) = (1;(1, k) over bar). We also provide a recursive characterization of this set. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Invariant games", "paper_id": "WOS:000280276200014"}
