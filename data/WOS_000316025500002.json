It is known that the problem is challenging. Although remarkable achievements have been made with the SIMP (Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization) framework, a number of critical issues are yet to be fully resolved. In the paper, we present an approach of a shape equilibrium constraint strategy with the level-set/X-FEM framework. We formulate the topology optimization problem under (spatially-distributed) stress constraints into a shape equilibrium problem of active stress constraint. This formulation allows us to effectively handle the stress constraint, and the intrinsic non-differentiability introduced by local stress constraints is removed. The optimization problem is made into one of continuous shape-sensitivity and it is solved by evolving a coherent interface of the shape equilibrium concurrently with shape variation in the structural boundary during a level-set evolution process. Several numerical examples in two dimensions are provided as a benchmark test of the proposed shape equilibrium constraint strategy for minimum-weight and fully-stressed designs and for designs with stress constraint satisfaction.", "paper_title": "Shape equilibrium constraint: a strategy for stress-constrained structural topology optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000316025500002"}
