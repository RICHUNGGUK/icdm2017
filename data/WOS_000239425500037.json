Documents formatted in XML are appropriately represented as graph data structures. It will be shown that the Self-Organizing Maps can be trained in an unsupervised fashion to group XML structured data into clusters, and that this task is scaled in linear time with increasing size of the corpus. It will also be shown that some simple prior knowledge of the data structures is beneficial to the efficient grouping of the XML documents.", "paper_title": "Clustering XML documents using Self-Organizing Maps for structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500037"}
