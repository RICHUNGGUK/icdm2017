In our context, a clausal constraint is a disjunction of inequalities of the form x >= d and x <= d. We classify the complexity of constraints based on clausal patterns. A pattern abstracts away from variables and contains only information about the domain elements and the type of inequalities occurring in a constraint. Every finite set of patterns gives rise to a (clausal) constraint satisfaction problem in which all constraints in instances must have an allowed pattern. We prove that every such problem is either polynomially decidable or NP-complete, and give a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing the tractable cases. Some of these tractable cases are new and have not been previously identified in the literature.", "paper_title": "Complexity of clausal constraints over chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000252108200006"}
