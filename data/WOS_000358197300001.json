Solving a clustering problem from the real world often poses significant challenges in spite of the fact that extensive research has been devoted to this topic. In this paper we present a tabu Search algorithm for a new problem class called cohesive clustering which arises in a variety of business applications. The class introduces an objective function to produce clusters as \"pure\" as possible, to maximize the similarity of the elements in each given cluster. Tabu search intensification and diversification strategies are employed in order to produce enhanced outcomes. The computational results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "A tabu search algorithm for cohesive clustering problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000358197300001"}
