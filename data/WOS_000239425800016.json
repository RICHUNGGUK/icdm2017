We first show how one can deal with infinite step sequences and the corresponding occurrence nets (processes) and causal structures. We then discuss how to improve the succinctness of both finite and infinite processes generated from step sequences. In the latter case, the proposed constructions avoid infinite branching in the case of bounded nets.", "paper_title": "Infinite process semantics of inhibitor nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425800016"}
