Within each interval, RED-BL provides a mapping of workload to a set of geographically distributed data centers. To this end, RED-BL uses the geographical and temporal variations in electricity prices as exhibited by electrical energy markets. In addition, we incorporate the transition costs associated with a change in workload mapping from one interval to the next, over a planning window comprising multiple such intervals. This results in a sequence of worldoad mappings that is optimal over the entire planning window, even though the workload mapping in a given interval may not be locally optimal. Our evaluation of RED-BL uses electricity prices from the US markets and workload traces from live Internet applications with millions of users. We find that RED-BL can reduce the electric bill by as much as 45% compared to the case when the workload is uniformly distributed. When compared to existing workload relocation solutions, for a wide range of data center deployment sizes, RED-BL achieves electricity cost savings that are 8.28% higher, on average. This seemingly modest reduction can save millions of dollars for the operators. The cost of this saving is an inexpensive computation at the start of each planning window. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
