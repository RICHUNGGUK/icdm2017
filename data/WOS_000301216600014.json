In this paper, a low complexity algorithm based on Local Search (LS) is proposed for spatial-TDMA networks such that the power consumption is minimized without sacrificing throughput or delay. More specifically, given a schedule of a pre-defined frame length we search for a low power schedule with the same length. Numerical investigations reveal that the proposed heuristic has a competitive performance and achieves considerable gains when compared to previously proposed scheduling techniques. Despite the centralized nature of the algorithm, its low complexity and high accuracy make it a very competitive solution for the power efficient scheduling problem. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
