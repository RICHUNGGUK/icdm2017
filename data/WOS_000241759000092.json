In this paper, an important operator in PDGA, primal-dual mapping, is discussed and a new statistics-based primal-dual mapping scheme is proposed. The experimental results on the dynamic optimization problems generated from a set of stationary benchmark problems show that the improved PDGA has stronger adaptability and robustness than the original for dynamic optimization problems.", "paper_title": "An improved Primal-Dual Genetic Algorithm for optimization in dynamic environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000241759000092"}
