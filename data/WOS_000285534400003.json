Two key factors, local winds and simulated waves produced by the numerical model, were used as input parameters of the proposed ANN model. The waves were simulated by the numerical model from a wave action equation indicating the physical processes of energy transfer and wave propagation. Simulated wave input is a very important parameter for the proposed ANN model, allowing for the accurate calculation of water waves in the sea. The applicable Mike21_SW model was chosen to provide an accurate calculation. Through model verification, the proposed ANN model has a particularly accurate calculation at the peak of each typhoon and at its occurrence time. The computed waves of each typhoon were examined to be consistent with the observed waves. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
