The purpose of the concept of quasi-randomness is to express how much a given graph \"resembles\" a random one. Moreover, a regular partition approximates a given graph by a bounded number of quasi-random graphs. Regarding quasi-randomness, we present a new spectral characterization of low discrepancy, which extends to sparse graphs. Concerning regular partitions, we introduce a concept of regularity that takes into account vertex weights, and show that if G = (V, E) satisfies a certain boundedness condition, then G admits a regular partition. In addition, building on the work of Alon and Naor [Proceedings of the 36th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), Chicago, IL, ACM, New York, 2004, pp. 72-80], we provide an algorithm that computes a regular partition of a given (possibly sparse) graph G in polynomial time. As an application, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme for MAX CUT on (sparse) graphs without \"dense spots.\"", "paper_title": "QUASI-RANDOMNESS AND ALGORITHMIC REGULARITY FOR GRAPHS WITH GENERAL DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277585000010"}
