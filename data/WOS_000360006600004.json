These factors are also present in stereoscopic media, where there are additional parameters associated with the camera arrangement (e.g., separation, orientation). The predicted amount of depth from disparity can be obtained trigonometrically; however, perceived depth in complex scenes often differs from geometric predictions based on binocular disparity alone. To evaluate the extent and the cause of deviations from geometric predictions of depth from disparity in naturalistic scenes, we recorded stereoscopic footage of an indoor scene with a range of camera separations (camera interaxial (IA) ranged from 3 to 95 mm) and displayed them on a range of screen sizes. In a series of experiments participants estimated 3D distances in the scene relative to a reference scene, compared depth between shots with different parameters, or reproduced the depth between pairs of objects in the scene using reaching or blind walking. The effects of IA and screen size were consistently and markedly smaller than predicted from the binocular viewing geometry, suggesting that observers are able to compensate for the predicted distortions. We conclude that the presence of multiple realistic monocular depth cues drives normalization of perceived depth from binocular disparity. It is not clear to what extent these differences are due to cognitive as opposed to perceptual factors. However, it is notable that these normalization processes are not task specific; they are evident in both perception- and action-oriented tasks.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Tolerance to Stereoscopic 3D Image Distortion", "paper_id": "WOS:000360006600004"}
