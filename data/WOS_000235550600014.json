Our work is focused on a set of tools for the measurement of patient activity. In this paper, we propose a few indicators of the patient activities of daily living, such as mobility, agitation, repartitions of stays, and displacements. As a result of this work, a diagnostic system was developed that could lead to a deeper knowledge of human activity rhythms in normal situations.", "paper_title": "A model for the measurement of patient activity in a hospital suite", "paper_id": "WOS:000235550600014"}
