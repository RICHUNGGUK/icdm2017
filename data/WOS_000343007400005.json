This approach known as MOQZEA (Multiobjective Quality Zone Based Evolutionary Algorithm) is a hybrid evolutionary algorithm adapted to use a novel fitness function, based on the definition of quality zones for the different objective functions considered. This approach is conceived to solve wireless network design problems without previous information of the required number of transmitters, considering simultaneously a high number of objective functions and optimizing multiple configuration parameters of the transmitters.", "paper_title": "Design of in-building wireless networks deployments using evolutionary algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000343007400005"}
