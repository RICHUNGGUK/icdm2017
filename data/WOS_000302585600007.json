The query distribution is known by the algorithm that constructs the data structure but not by the algorithm that queries it. Assume that the dictionary has n items. When all queries in the dictionary are equiprobable, and all queries not in the dictionary are equiprobable, we show how to construct a data structure in O(n) space where queries require O(1) probes and the contention is O(1/n). Asymptotically, all of these quantities are optimal. For arbitrary query distributions, we construct a data structure in O(n) space where each query requires O(log n/log log n) probes and the contention is O(log n/(n log log n)). The lack of knowledge of the query distribution by the query algorithm prevents perfect load leveling in this case: for a large class of algorithms, we present a lower bound, based on VC-dimension, that shows that for a wide range of data structure problems, achieving contention even within a polylogarithmic factor of optimal requires a cell-probe complexity of Omega(log log n).
