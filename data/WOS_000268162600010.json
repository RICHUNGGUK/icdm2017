Unlike existing solutions, iMesh uses no global computation and generates constant per-node storage load. In iMesh, new service providers (i.e., actors) publish their location information in four directions, updating an information mesh. Information propagation for relatively remote services is restricted by a blocking rule, which also updates the mesh structure. Based on an extension rule, nodes along mesh edges may further advertise newly arrived relatively near service by backward distance-limited transmissions, replacing previously closer service location. The final information mesh is a planar structure constituted by the information propagation paths. It stores locations of all the service providers and serves as service directory. Service consumers (i.e., sensors) conduct a lookup process restricted within their home mesh cells to discover nearby services. We analytically study the properties of iMesh including construction cost and distance sensitivity over a static network model. We evaluate its performance in static/dynamic network scenarios through extensive simulation. Simulation results verify our theoretical findings and show that iMesh guarantees nearby (closest) service selection with very high probability, > 99 percent (respectively, > 95 percent).", "paper_title": "Localized Distance-Sensitive Service Discovery in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268162600010"}
