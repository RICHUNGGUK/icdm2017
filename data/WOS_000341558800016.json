This paper proposes a synthetic double sampling (DS) np chart which comprises two sub-charts, i.e. the DS np and conforming run length (CRL) sub-charts. For the zero-state case, the synthetic DS np chart surpasses its standard counterpart, i.e. the synthetic np and the basic DS np chart, and other np type charts like the standard np, combined synthetic and np (Syn-np), variable sample size (VSS) np, exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) np and cumulative sum (CUSUM) np charts, for detecting increases in the fraction of non-conforming items p, for most shift sizes. The synthetic DS np chart also performs reasonably well in the steady-state case in comparison with other charts mentioned above. Thus, among the competing charts, the synthetic DS np chart stands out as one of the best charts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
