Geo Cross exploits the natural planar feature of urban maps without resorting to cumbersome planarization. Its feature of dynamic loop detection makes Geo Cross suitable for highly mobile VANET. We have shown that in pathologic cases, Geo Cross's packet delivery ratio (PDR) is consistently higher than Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing's (GPSR's) and Greedy Perimeter Coordinator Routing's (GPCR's). We have also shown that caching (Geo Cross + Cache) provides the same high PDR but uses fewer hops.
