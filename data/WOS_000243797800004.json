In accomplishing the task of management fraud detection, auditors could be facilitated in their work by using Data Mining techniques. This study investigates the usefulness of Decision Trees, Neural Networks and Bayesian Belief Networks in the identification of fraudulent financial statements. The input vector is composed of ratios derived from financial statements. The three models are compared in terms of their performances. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
