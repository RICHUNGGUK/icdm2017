This paper studies an Identity-based Strong Designated Verifier Signature (IBSDVS) scheme based on bilinear pairings by combining ID-based cryptosystem with the designated verifier signature scheme. We analyze the security of the scheme and the result shows that the security of our proposed scheme is closely related to the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem and the scheme is against delegatability attack.
