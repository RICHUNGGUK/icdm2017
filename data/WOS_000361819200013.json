However, CAI tool is currently lack of use in teaching and learning fashion design. The present research hence proposes a tool functions as a digital tutor poviding an intuitive visual aid for learning principles. The interfaces are designed based on two viewpoints: fashion style and design elements. Style Cognition Space and Style Cluster View are designed for visualizing fashion style knowledge, while Comparison View of Design Elements Effects and Elementary Attribute Space are designed for visualizing knowledge of design elements. Several skills of graphic user interface and information visualization are used, such as Details on demand, Portals, and Zoom. To obtain evaluations from users, three workshops of fashion design were held. Using questionnaires, all participants were asked to answer several questions about ease of use, effectiveness, and satisfaction. Whether professional lecturers or inexperienced novices at fashion, all users rate the system as highly satisfactory after use.", "paper_title": "A digital tutor for learning fashion design", "paper_id": "WOS:000361819200013"}
