This is achieved by mapping the multivariate input data to a Hilbert space of time-varying vector-valued functions, whose inner products (kernels) are combined in an online fashion. The proposed algorithm is equipped with novel adaptive sparsification criteria ensuring a finite dictionary, and is computationally efficient and suitable for nonstationary environments. We also show the ability of the proposed vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space to serve as a feature space for the class of multikernel least-squares algorithms. The benefits of adaptive multikernel (MK) estimation algorithms are illuminated in the nonlinear multivariate adaptive prediction setting. Simulations on nonlinear inertial body sensor signals and nonstationary real-world wind signals of low, medium, and high dynamic regimes support the approach.", "paper_title": "Multikernel Least Mean Square Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000330040800002"}
