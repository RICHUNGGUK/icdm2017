To improve the equiareality of given NURBS surfaces, an optimization algorithm using the Mobius transformations is presented in this paper. The optimal Mobius transformation is obtained by computing the intersection of two planar algebraic curves, whose coefficients are computed explicitly for Bezier and B-spline surfaces, while numerically for NURBS surfaces. Examples are given to show the performance of our algorithm for visualization and tessellation applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
