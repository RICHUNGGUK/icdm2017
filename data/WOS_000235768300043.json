The use of Fourier phase information of fingerprint images makes possible to achieve robust recognition for weakly impressed, low-quality fingerprint images. Experimental evaluations using two different types of fingerprint image databases demonstrate efficient recognition performance of the proposed algorithm compared with a typical minutiae-based algorithm and the conventional phase-based algorithm.", "paper_title": "A fingerprint recognition algorithm combining phase-based image matching and feature-based matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300043"}
