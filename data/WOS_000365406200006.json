The objective is to have a greater visibility over supply chain operations, decision making and planning with positive impacts on the productivity and performance. In this paper, a collaborative framework is proposed to improve the business competitiveness of supply chains. Different dimensions including business and marketing, interfirm collaborative aspects, and quality and conformity in this framework are taken into account. Competence as an encompassing factor for human aspect to implement and operate the proposed framework is also scrutinized. All stated dimensions are then put together under one umbrella and implemented within a decision support system using online analytical processing database. The wood industry in Quebec North Shore region is chosen as an example of a supply chain and the case study throughout this paper.", "paper_title": "An Approach Toward a Conceptual Collaborative Framework Based on a Case Study in a Wood Supply Chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000365406200006"}
