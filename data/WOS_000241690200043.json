Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is one such algorithm based on swarm intelligence and is derived from a model inspired by the collective foraging behavior of ants. Taking advantage of the ACO in traits such as self-organization and robustness, this paper proposes a novel document clustering approach based on ACO. Unlike other ACO-based clustering approaches which are based on the same scenario that ants move around in a 2D grid and carry or drop objects to perform categorization. Our proposed ant-based clustering approach does not rely on a 2D grid structure. In addition, it can also generate optimal number of clusters without incorporating any other algorithms such as K-means or AHC. Experimental results on the subsets of 20 Newsgroup data show that the ant-based clustering approach outperforms the classical document clustering methods such as K-means and Agglomerate Hierarchical Clustering. It also achieves better results than those obtained using the Artificial Immune Network algorithm when tested in the same datasets.", "paper_title": "A novel ant-based clustering approach for document clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200043"}
