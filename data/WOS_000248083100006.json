However, the current OBS architecture is very complex, requiring costly fiber delay lines and quality-of-service (QoS) management techniques. In this paper, we propose a new OBS architecture based on photonic container switching to be deployed in the core network. We show that our architecture will solve most of the complexities of existing OBS mechanisms and, in fact, will make the core an all-optical zero-packet-loss network that will also guarantee equal QoS to all of the users. The packets are actually packed in fixed-size containers, which will be converted into an optical burst and transmitted through the network. Obviously, a major issue to solve in our architecture is the scheduler design that ensures zero packet loss and no optical-to-electrical switchings in the intermediate nodes. We devise a divide-and-conquer solution for the scheduler design problem and present some officient algorithms for the same. We also analyze the performance of our algorithms under varying traffic conditions and network topologies to ascertain their efficiency and robustness.", "paper_title": "A novel photonic container switched architecture and scheduler to design the core transport network", "paper_id": "WOS:000248083100006"}
