In our method, the Newton iterative MFEM is used for solving all the equations of the conduction-convection problems. The stability and convergence analysis in H (1)-norm of u(h)(n), T(h)(n) and the L (2)-norm of p(h)(n) are derived. The theory analysis shows that our method is stable and have a good precision. Some numerical results are also given, which show that the coupled Newton iterative MFEM is highly efficient for the stationary conduction-convection problems.", "paper_title": "A coupled Newton iterative mixed finite element method for stationary conduction-convection problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000279707900001"}
