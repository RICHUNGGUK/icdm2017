Space and time separated representations generalize Proper Orthogonal Decompositions-POD-avoiding any a priori knowledge on the solution in contrast to the vast majority of POD based model reduction technologies as well as reduced bases approaches. Moreover, PGD allows to treat efficiently models defined in degenerated domains as well as the multidimensional models arising from multidimensional physics (quantum chemistry, kinetic theory descriptions, ... ) or from the standard ones when some sources of variability are introduced in the model as extra-coordinates.", "paper_title": "A Short Review on Model Order Reduction Based on Proper Generalized Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000300094800001"}
