This problem consists in assigning periodic tasks to distributed processors in the context of fixed priority preemptive scheduling. CPRTA is built on dynamic constraint programming together with a learning method to find a feasible processor allocation under constraints. Two efficient new approaches are proposed and validated with experimental results. Moreover, CPRTA exhibits very interesting properties. It is complete (if a problem has no solution, the algorithm is able to prove it); it is non-parametric (it does not require specific tuning) thus allowing a large diversity of models to be easily considered. Finally, thanks to its capacity to explain failures, it offers attractive perspectives for guiding the architectural design process. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
