NET. We applied the equations of stress transformation to plane stress problems to calculate the stresses with respect to the 1-2 axes, which are rotated counterclockwise through an angle theta about the x-y origin, and showed the visual results on the screen. in addition, we used animation to observe the change of plane stress. This program was then used in teaching courses, such as Mechanics of Materials and Linear Algebra. Use of the software may help students to understand principal stresses, principal axes, Mohr's circle, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, similar matrices, and invariants. 02008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
