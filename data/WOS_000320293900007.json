In this paper, we propose an integrated management solution which takes advantages of both virtual machine resizing and server consolidation to achieve energy efficiency and quality of service in virtualized data centers. A novelty of the solution is to integrate linear programming, ant colony optimization, and control theory techniques. Empirical results show that our approach can achieve power savings of 41.3% compared to an uncontrolled system, while ensuring application performance. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
