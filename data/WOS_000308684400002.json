Depending on the domain and the techniques used to design the ontology, this fact could be a decisive factor to decide if the reasoning platform is useful or not. In this paper we describe an application case of a multi-agent architecture to parallelize a medical diagnosis system based on ontologies and description logics. The aim of this paper is to show the improvement of the time efficiency of the system in which is based this work using the proposed architecture. Results show that the use of the new architecture (which is based in the use of a master-slave architecture and the use of multi-threading) shows that global efficiency can be highly improved.
