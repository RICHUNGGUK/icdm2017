In particular, total classification with a good generalization level can be obtained, provided no individual belongs to both classes. The method is iterative: at each iteration a new piece of the surface is found via the solution of a Linear Programming model. Theoretically, the larger the number of iterations, the better the classification accuracy in the training set; numerically, we also found that the generalization ability does not deteriorate on the cases tested. Nonetheless, we have included a procedure that computes a lower bound to the number of errors that will be generated in any given validation set. If needed, an early stopping criterion is provided. We also showed that each piece of the discriminating surface is equivalent to a neuron of a feed forward neural network (FFNN); so as a byproduct we are providing a novel training scheme for FFNNs that avoids the minimization of non convex functions which, in general, present many local minima. We compare this algorithm with a new linear SVM that needs no pre tuning and has an excellent performance on standard and synthetic data. Highly encouraging numerical results are reported on synthetic examples, on the Japanese Bank dataset, and on medium and small datasets from the Irvine repository of machine learning databases. 2011 (C) Elsevier B.V.
