Application of parallel processing in time and frequency domain brought new findings in description of wind power plants working under transient conditions. Proposed algorithms represents standard Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) as well as alternative methods associated with Cohen's class: Choi-Williams Distribution (CUT) and Zhao-Atlas-Marks Distribution (ZAMD). In order to explore advantages and disadvantages of the method several experiments were performed using model of squirrel-cage induction machine connected directly to the grid. Investigated phenomena concerned power distortion caused by switching-on capacitor banks and faults as well as influence of wind speed on instantaneous character of the transient states.", "paper_title": "Power Distortion Issues in Wind Turbine Power Systems Under Transient States", "paper_id": "WOS:000261582500006"}
