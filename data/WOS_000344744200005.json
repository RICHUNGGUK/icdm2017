The framework collects live user context by analyzing sensory data obtained from a body sensor network and multimedia content available from live heterogeneous Internet-based services. Finally, we share the implementation details and test results.", "paper_title": "Context-aware multimedia services modeling: an e-Health perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000344744200005"}
