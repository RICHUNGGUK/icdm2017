Although previous studies have addressed the importance of these variables, the understanding of the mediating effect of customer-perceived service value and the moderating effect of customer-perceived service guarantee strength on customer post-purchasing behaviours still remain key issues. Design/methodology/approach - A statistical analysis of the collected questionnaires was computed based on the 498 usable responses from the four branches of the selected Chinese chain restaurant. Structural equation modelling is the essential analysis methodology used to examine the hypothesised relationships among the variables. Findings - Analysis confirms that customer satisfaction is positively influenced by service convenience, whereas customer loyalty is positively influenced by customer satisfaction. Furthermore, customer satisfaction is indirectly influenced by service convenience through perceived service value. Finally, another key finding is the relationship between service convenience and customer satisfaction, which is stronger for customers who perceive high service guarantee strength than for those who perceive low service guarantee strength. Originality/value - The study contributes to a conceptual model that, reflecting the mediating role of customer-perceived service value and the moderating role of customer-perceived service guarantee strength, indicates the effect of service convenience on customers' post-purchasing behaviours.", "paper_title": "The effect of service convenience on post-purchasing behaviours", "paper_id": "WOS:000285567500016"}
