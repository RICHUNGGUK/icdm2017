Diverse synaptic properties contribute to such robust synchronization. Synaptic current induced by an input spike is dependent on the voltage of post-synaptic neuron in real neural systems. Current-based synapse models, which neglect the voltage-dependent properties of synaptic currents, are widely used for analysis of robust synchronization in neural networks due to their simplicity. However, it was found in this paper that the voltage-dependent properties of synaptic currents play a key role in robust network synchronization in most cases, implying that current-based synapses are oversimplified for analysis of robust network synchronization.
