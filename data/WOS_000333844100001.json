In order to improve the fairness of the wireless multimedia sensors networks, each node should take into account the choices of joining a appropriate routing coalition. This paper presents a game theoretic approach, called coalitional routing game (CRG), which is guideline for nodes to choose the best coalition. The objective of the proposed method is to achieve fairness and QoS efficiency for each node in joining the routing coalition. The Shapley value is used as a solution for the CRG. The coalitional routing game is implemented in DSR protocol in network simulator NS-2 to verify its performance with simulations. Numerical analysis and simulations are conducted, and the results demonstrate that the CRG improves performance of the DSR compared to the same network with only DSR protocol.", "paper_title": "Game Theoretic Approach in Adapting QoS Routing Protocol for Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333844100001"}
