The first metric is a measure of structural information loss based on the Fisher information about the position of the structures in the observed images. The second metric acts as a categorical indicator of the type of distortion that images underwent. These two metrics constitute the inner state of a virtual cognitive model, viewed as a system whose output is the automatic visual quality estimate. The use of a 2-D metric fills the intrinsic incompleteness of methods based on a single metric while providing consistent response across different image impairment factors and blind distortion classification capability with a modest computational overhead. The high accuracy and robustness of the method are demonstrated through cross-validation experiments.", "paper_title": "Two-Dimensional Approach to Full-Reference Image Quality Assessment Based on Positional Structural Information", "paper_id": "WOS:000300559700007"}
