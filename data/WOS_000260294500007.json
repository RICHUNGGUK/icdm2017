In this paper, we present a nonuniform bilateral filtering (NBF) method for point sets and surface attributes based on local geometry feature. In order to adapt the algorithm to irregular sampling, local sampling density is introduced to traditional bilateral filtering, and a global approach for volume preservation is proposed. Experiments show that our approach is stable, effective and easy to use.", "paper_title": "Nonuniform bilateral filtering for point sets and surface attributes", "paper_id": "WOS:000260294500007"}
