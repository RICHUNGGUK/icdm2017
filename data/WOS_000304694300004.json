Our method contains two stages: feature detection and feature refinement. First, the normal tensor voting method is modified to detect the initial features, which may include some pseudo features. Then, at the feature refinement stage, a novel salient measure deriving from the idea of neighbor supporting is developed. Benefiting from the integrated reliable salient measure feature, pseudo features can be effectively discriminated from the initially detected features and removed. Compared to previous methods based on the differential geometric property, the main advantage of our method is that it can detect both sharp and weak features. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm is robust, effective, and can produce more accurate results. We also discuss how detected features are incorporated into applications, such as feature-preserving mesh denoising and hole-filling, and present visually appealing results by integrating feature information.", "paper_title": "Feature detection of triangular meshes via neighbor supporting", "paper_id": "WOS:000304694300004"}
