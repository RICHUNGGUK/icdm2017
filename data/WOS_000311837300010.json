The design strategies that allow us to optimally take advantage of such parallelism, in order to efficiently map on GPU the hierarchy of layers and the canonical neural computations, are proposed. Specifically, the advantages of a cortical map-like representation of the data are exploited. Moreover, a GPU implementation of a novel neural architecture for the computation of binocular disparity from stereo image pairs, based on populations of binocular energy neurons, is presented. The implemented neural model achieves good performances in terms of reliability of the disparity estimates and a near real-time execution speed, thus demonstrating the effectiveness of the devised design strategies. The proposed approach is valid in general, since the neural building blocks we implemented are a common basis for the modeling of visual neural functionalities.", "paper_title": "Real-time simulation of large-scale neural architectures for visual features computation based on GPU", "paper_id": "WOS:000311837300010"}
