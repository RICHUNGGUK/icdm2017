A few eigenmodes of the independent substructures and their associated derivative matrices are assembled into a reduced eigenequation to recover the eigensolutions and eigensensitivities of the global structure. Consequently, only the concerned substructures and the reduced eigenequation are re-analyzed in the optimization process, thus reducing the computational load of the traditional model updating methods which perform on the global structure. Applications of the proposed substructure-based model updating to a frame structure and a practical bridge demonstrate that the present method is computationally effective and efficient.
