They both have sublogarithmic diameter, and are fairly sparse compared to hypercubes. In this paper, we focus on another important property, namely the genus. The genus of a graph is the minimum number of handles needed for drawing the graph on the plane without edges crossing. We will investigate the upper bound and lower bound for the genus of pancake graph and compare these values with the genus of the star graph as well as that of the hypercube.", "paper_title": "On the Genus of Pancake Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000293157600009"}
