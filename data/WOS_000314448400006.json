To improve the coverage for test documents and to raise classification accuracy, some associative classifiers generate a huge number of association rules during the mining step. We present two algorithms to increase the computational efficiency of associative classification: one to store rules very efficiently, and the other to increase the speed of rule matching, using all of the generated rules. Empirical results using three large-scale text collections demonstrate that the proposed algorithms increase the feasibility of applying associative classification to large-scale problems.
