Moreover, we present the tail concentration function (which depends on the diagonal section of a copula) as a tool to give a description of tail dependence at finite scale. The tail concentration function is hence used to introduce a graphical tool that can help to distinguish different families of copulas in the copula test space. Moreover, it serves as a basis to determine the grouping structure of different financial time series by taking into account their pairwise tail behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
