The free-text CAA system Atenea [1] had simple adaptation possibilities by keeping static student profiles [2]. In this paper, we present a new adaptive version called Willow. It is based on Atenea and adds the possibility of dynamically choosing the questions to be asked according to their difficulty level, the students' profile and previous answers. Both Atenea and Willow have been tested with 32 students that manifested their satisfaction after using them. The results stimulate us to continue exploiting the possibilities of incorporating dynamic adaptation to free-text CAA.", "paper_title": "On the dynamic adaptation of computer assisted assessment of free-text answers", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300054"}
