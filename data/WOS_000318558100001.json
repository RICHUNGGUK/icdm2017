In this paper, a multi-paradigm decision modeling framework is proposed to support decision modeling at three levels of abstraction based on domain-specific modeling (DSM). This framework designs a domain-specific modeling language (DSML) for decision modeling to raise the abstraction level of modeling, transforms the domain-specific models to formalism-based models to enable formal analysis and early verification and validation, and implements the semantics of the DSML based on a Python scripts framework which incorporates the decision model into the whole simulation system. The case study shows that the proposed approach incorporates domain expertise and facilitates domain modeler's participation in CoSES to formulate the problem using DSML in the problem domain, and enables formal analysis and automatic implementation of the decision model in the solution domain.", "paper_title": "A multi-paradigm decision modeling framework for combat system effectiveness measurement based on domain-specific modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000318558100001"}
