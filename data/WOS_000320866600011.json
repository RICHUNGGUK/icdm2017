The maximum-likelihood (ML) diversity-combining method is employed to improve BER performance of the system. Analytical BER expression of the proposed ML receiver is derived. The analytical results, validated by computer simulation, show that the proposed ML receiver can suppress the composite hostile jamming more effectively than some existing conventional diversity-combining receivers. The ML receiver is also found to be robust against inaccurate estimation of the required side information.", "paper_title": "Jamming Rejection Using FFH/MFSK ML Receiver Over Fading Channels With the Presence of Timing and Frequency Offsets", "paper_id": "WOS:000320866600011"}
