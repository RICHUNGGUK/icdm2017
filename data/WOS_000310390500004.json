We present a complete software and hardware framework for implementing the system, which is based on an array of commodity Microsoft Kinect (TM) color-plus-depth cameras. Contributions include an algorithm for merging data between multiple depth cameras and techniques for automatic color calibration and preserving stereo quality even with low rendering rates. Also presented is a solution to the problem of interference that occurs between Kinect cameras with overlapping views. Emphasis is placed on a fully CPU-accelerated data processing and rendering pipeline that can apply hole filling, smoothing, data merger, surface generation, and color correction at rates of up to 200 million triangles/s on a single PC and graphics board. Also presented is a Kinect-based markerless tracking system that combines 2D eye recognition with depth information to allow head-tracked stereo views to be rendered for a parallax barrier autostereoscopic display. Enhancements in calibration, filtering, and data merger were made to improve image quality over a previous version of the system. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
