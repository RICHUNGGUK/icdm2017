To solve this problem, we propose a method of cloud-based image coding that is different from current image coding even on the ground. It no longer compresses images pixel by pixel and instead tries to describe images and reconstruct them from a large-scale image database via the descriptions. First, we describe an input image based on its down-sampled version and local feature descriptors. The descriptors are used to retrieve highly correlated images in the cloud and identify corresponding patches. The down-sampled image serves as a target to stitch retrieved image patches together. Second, the down-sampled image is compressed using current image coding. The feature vectors of local descriptors are predicted by the corresponding vectors extracted in the decoded down-sampled image. The predicted residual vectors are compressed by transform, quantization, and entropy coding. The experimental results show that the visual quality of reconstructed images is significantly better than that of intra-frame coding in HEVC and JPEG at thousands to one compression.", "paper_title": "Cloud-Based Image Coding for Mobile Devices-Toward Thousands to One Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000319228500013"}
