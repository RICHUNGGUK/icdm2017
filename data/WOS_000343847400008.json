The inter-laminar contact is modeled with an augmented Lagrangian approach. Numerical results show that the widely used \"unconditionally stable\" beta-Newmark method presents instability problems in the transient simulation of delaminated composite plate structures with large deformation. To overcome this instability issue, an energy and momentum conserving composite implicit time integration scheme presented by Bathe and Baig is used. It is found that a proper selection of the penalty parameter is very crucial in the contact simulation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
