It leads in speed over the existing software packages in the same category by huge margins. This article details the description of the parallel version of HOM4PS-2.0, named HOM4PS-2.Opara. Excellent scalability in the numerical results shows that the parallelization of the homotopy method always provides a great amount of extra computing resources to help solve polynomial systems of larger size which would be very difficult to deal with otherwise.
