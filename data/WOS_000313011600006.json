The proposed approach combines the geostatistical interpolation of punctual kriging, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and fuzzy logic based approaches. Images degraded with Gaussian white noise are restored by first utilizing fuzzy logic for selecting pixels that needs kriging. Three fuzzy systems are employed. Both type-I and type-II fuzzy sets in addition with neuro fuzzy classifier (NFC) have been used for the detection of noisy pixels. To avoid edge pixels, a post processing technique is used to check the edge pixel connectivity up to lag 5. If the pixel under consideration is an edge pixel, it is excluded from the fuzzy map and thus not estimated. The concept of punctual kriging is then used to estimate the intensity of a noisy pixel. ANN is employed to minimize the cost function of the kriging based pixel intensity estimation procedure. ANN, in contrast to analytical methodologies, avoids both matrix inversion failure and negative weights problems. Image restoration performance based comparison has been made against adaptive Weiner filter and existing fuzzy kriging approaches. Experimental results using 450 images are used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Different image quality measures are used to compare the efficacy of the proposed NFC and fuzzy type-II approaches for detecting noisy pixels in conjunction with ANN and kriging based estimation.
