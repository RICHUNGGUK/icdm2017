An analytical and a simulation method using the Artificial Bee Colony optimization algorithm are described and used for the determination of the proposed model parameters. The presented model is applied to three case studies; Greece, Portugal and Europe-27.(3) The accuracy of the obtained results is confirmed through comparison with actual data. In addition, the model can also be used to accurately forecast future trends. It is illustrated that the gender gap is continuously decreasing, while in the last years, women seem to outperform men in the field of science and technology. The estimation and forecasting ability of the model can be used as an extremely valuable tool for decision and policy makers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
