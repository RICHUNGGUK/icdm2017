To reduce the complexity of this task, existing approaches typically apply the same set of optimizations to all procedures within a program, without regard to their particular structure. This paper develops a new method-specific approach that automatically selects the best optimizations on a per method basis within a dynamic compiler. Our approach uses the machine learning technique of logistic regression to automatically derive a predictive model that determines which optimizations to apply based on the features of a method. This technique is implemented in the Jikes RVM Java JIT compiler. Using this approach we reduce the average total execution time of the SPECjvm98 benchmarks by 29%. When the same heuristic is applied to the DaCapo+ benchmark suite, we obtain an average 33% reduction over the default level O2 setting.", "paper_title": "Method-specific dynamic compilation using logistic regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000202972500016"}
