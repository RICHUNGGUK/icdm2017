IoT needs to be pushed towards a more open, interoperable and collaborative IoT. The first step has been the Web of Things (WoT). WoT evolves the IoT with a common stack based on web services. But, even when a homogeneous access is reached through web protocols, a common understanding is not yet acquired. For this purpose, the Semantic Web of Things (SWoT) is proposed for the integration of the semantic web on the WoT. This work analyses the SWoT, presenting its different levels to offer an IoT convergence. Specifically, we analyse the trends for capillary networks and for cellular networks with standards such as IPSO, ZigBee, OMA, and the oneM2M initiative. This work also analyses the impact of the semantic-annotations/metadata in the performance of the resources.", "paper_title": "Semantic Web of Things: an analysis of the application semantics for the IoT moving towards the IoT convergence", "paper_id": "WOS:000334070200006"}
