Results are presented for a 3D Clark-Y hydrofoil fixed at an angle of attack of alpha = 8 degrees at a moderate Reynolds number, Re = 7 x 10(5), for both subcavitating (sigma = 2.00) and sheet/cloud cavitating conditions (sigma = 0.80). The experimental studies were conducted in a cavitation tunnel at Beijing Institute of Technology, China. The numerical simulations are performed via the commercial code CFX using a transport equation-based cavitation model, the turbulence model utilizes the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) approach with the Wall-Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity model. The results show that numerical predictions are capable of capturing the initiation of the cavity, growth toward the trailing edge, and subsequent shedding, in accordance with the quantitative features observed in the experiment. The detailed analysis of the vorticity transport equation shows strong correlation between the cavity and vorticity structure, the transient development of sheet/cloud cavitation has significantly changed the interaction between the leading edge and trailing edge vortices, and hence the magnitude as well as the frequency of the hydrodynamic load fluctuations. Compared to the subcavitating case, the sheet/cloud cavitation leads to much higher turbulent boundary layer thickness and substantial increase in velocity fluctuation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
