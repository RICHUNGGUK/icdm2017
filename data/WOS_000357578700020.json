Nowadays, malicious software, which is also known as malware, imposes a larger threat to these mobile devices. Recently, many news items were posted about the increase of the Android malware. There were a lot of Android applications pulled from the Android Market because they contained malware. The vulnerabilities of those Applications or Android operating systems are being exploited by the attackers who got the capability of penetrating into the mobile systems without user authorization causing compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the applications and the user. This paper, it gave an update to the work done in the project. Moreover, this paper focuses on the Android Operating System and aim to detect existing Android malware. It has a dataset that contained 104 malware samples. This Paper chooses several malware from the dataset and attempting to analyze them to understand their installation methods and activation. In addition, it evaluates the most popular existing anti-virus software to see if these 104 malware could be detected.", "paper_title": "Android Platform Malware Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000357578700020"}
