A combination encoding scheme and genetic operators are designed for solving combination optimization problems. We apply this combination GA to the portfolio optimization problem which can be reformulated approximately as a combination optimization problem. Experimental results show that the proposed combination GA is effective in solving the portfolio optimization problem.", "paper_title": "A combination genetic algorithm with applications on portfolio optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623800023"}
