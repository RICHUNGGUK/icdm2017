Recent trends toward cloud computing and outsourcing has led to the requirement for facial expression recognition to be performed remotely by potentially untrusted servers. This paper presents a system that addresses the challenge of performing facial expression recognition when the test image is in the encrypted domain. More specifically, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first known result that performs facial expression recognition in the encrypted domain. Such a system solves the problem of needing to trust servers since the test image for facial expression recognition can remain in encrypted form at all times without needing any decryption, even during the expression recognition process. Our experimental results on popular JAFFE and MUG facial expression databases demonstrate that recognition rate of up to 95.24 percent can be achieved even in the encrypted domain.", "paper_title": "Facial Expression Recognition in the Encrypted Domain Based on Local Fisher Discriminant Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000323642900008"}
