The main characteristic of BLPP is that the outer optimization (upper level) problem is constrained by an inner optimization (lower level) problem. In this paper, a Lagrangean relaxation method is proposed to obtain an acceptable feasible solution by solving a sequence of one-level mixed-integer problems. The computational results on some examples were taken from literatures and randomly generated problems indicate that the method is able to solve the BLPP efficiently.", "paper_title": "Lagrangean relaxation-based algorithm for bi-level problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000345371800001"}
