Most of the modern P2P bots launch attacks in a stealthy way and the detection approaches based on the malicious traffic of bots are inefficient. In this paper, an approach that aims to detect Peer-to-Peer (P2P) botnets is proposed. Unlike previous works, the approach is independent of any malicious traffic generated by bots and does not require bots' information provided by external systems. It detects P2P bots by focusing on the instinct characteristics of their Command and Control (C&C) communications, which are identified by discovering flow dependencies in C&C traffic. After discovering the flow dependencies, our approach distinguishes P2P bots and normal hosts by clustering technique. Experimental results on real-world network traces merged with synthetic P2P botnet traces indicate that 1) flow dependency can be used to detect P2P botnets, and 2) the proposed approach can detect P2P botnets with a high detection rate and a low false positive rate.", "paper_title": "Detecting P2P botnets by discovering flow dependency in C&C traffic", "paper_id": "WOS:000339877700003"}
