This learning algorithm trains a special class of reformulated RBFNNs, known as cosine RBFNNs, by updating selected adjustable parameters to minimize the class-conditional variances at the outputs of their radial basis functions (RBFs). The experiments verify that quantum neural networks (QNNs) and cosine RBFNNs trained by the proposed learning algorithm are capable of identifying uncertainty in data classification, a property that is not shared by cosine RBFNNs trained by the original learning algorithm and conventional feed-forward neural networks (FFNNs). Finally, this study leads to a simple classification strategy that can be used to improve the classification accuracy of QNNs and cosine RBFNNs by rejecting ambiguous feature vectors based on their responses.", "paper_title": "Training reformulated radial basis function neural networks capable of identifying uncertainty in data classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240511600011"}
