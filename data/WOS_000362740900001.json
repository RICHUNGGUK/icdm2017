There is a need for the study of introducing risk management and existing security management standard (e.g., ISO27001) to ensure the stability and reliability of IoT services. K-ISMS is a representative certification system that evaluates the security management level of the enterprise in Korea and is possible to apply as a standardized process to enhance the security management of IoT services. However, there are growing concerns about the quality deterioration of the K-ISMS certification assessment these days because of internet security incidents occurring frequently in K-ISMS certified enterprises. Therefore, various researches are required to improve the accuracy and objectivity of the certification assessment. Since existing studies mainly focus on simple statistical analysis of the K-ISMS assessment results, analysis on the cause of certification assessment fault based on past data analysis is insufficient. As a method of managing the certification inspection quality, in this paper, we analyze the association among the fault items of the K-ISMS certification assessment results using association rule mining which involves identifying an association rule among items in the database.", "paper_title": "A Study of K-ISMS Fault Analysis for Constructing Secure Internet of Things Service", "paper_id": "WOS:000362740900001"}
