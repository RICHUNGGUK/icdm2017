The stochastic computer network (SCN), in which each edge has several capacities and the accuracy rate, has multiple terminals. This paper is aimed mainly to evaluate the system reliability for an SCN, where system reliability is the probability that the demand can be fulfilled under the total accuracy rate. A minimal capacity vector allows the system to transmit demand to each terminal under the total accuracy rate. This study proposes an efficient algorithm to find all minimal capacity vectors by minimal paths. The system reliability can then be computed in terms of all minimal capacity vectors by the recursive sum of disjoint products (RSDP) algorithm.", "paper_title": "Stochastic computer network with multiple terminals under total accuracy rate", "paper_id": "WOS:000314751500001"}
