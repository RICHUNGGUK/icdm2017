Recently, IC routing and related researches have been extended from Manhattan architecture (gimel(2)-geometry) to Y-/X-architecture (gimel 3 -/gimel 4-geometry) to improve the chip performance. This paper presents an O(n log n) heuristic, X-OAT, for obstacle-avoiding Steiner minimal tree construction in the X-geometry plane (gimel-OASMT). In this paper, based on obstacle-avoiding constrained Delaunay triangulation, a full connected tree is constructed and then embedded into gimel-OASMT by zonal combination. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the gimel-OASMT problem. Compared with most recent works on OARSMT problem, X-OAT obtains up to 30-Kx speedup with quality solution. We have tested randomly generated cases with up to 10 K terminals and 10-K rectilinear obstacles within 4 seconds on a Sun V880 workstation (755-MHz CPU and 4-GB memory). The high efficiency and accuracy of X-OAT make it extremely practical and useful in the routing phase.", "paper_title": "lambda-OAT: lambda-geometry obstacle-avoiding tree construction with o (n log n) complexity", "paper_id": "WOS:000250415500015"}
