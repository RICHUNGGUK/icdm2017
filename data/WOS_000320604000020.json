From this perspective, a hydrodynamic lattice Boltzmann model for simulating immiscible multiphase flows with high density and high viscosity ratios, up to O(1000) and O(100) respectively, is presented and validated against analytical solutions. The method is based on a two phase flow model with operators extended to handle N immiscible fluids. The current approach is O(N) in computational complexity for the number of different gradient approximations. This is a major improvement, considering the O(N-2) complexity found in most works. A sequence of systematic and essential tests have been conducted to establish milestones that need to be met by the proposed approach (as well as by other methods). First, the method is validated qualitatively by demonstrating its ability to address the spinodal decomposition of immiscible fluids. Second, the model is quantitatively verified for the case of multilayered planar interfaces. Third, the multiphase Laplace law is studied for the case of three fluids. Fourth, a quality index is developed for the three-phase Laplace-Young's law, which concerns the position of the interfaces between the fluids resulting from the different surface tensions. The current model is compatible with the analytical solution, and is shown to be first order accurate in terms of this quality index. Finally, the multilayered Couette's flow is studied. In this study, numerical results can recover the analytical solutions for all the selected test cases, as long as unit density ratios are considered. For high density and high viscosity ratios, the analytical solution is recovered for all tests, except that of the multilayered Couette's flow. Numerical results and a discussion are presented for this unsuccessful test case. It is believed that other LB models may have the same problem in addressing the simulation of multiphase flows with variable density ratios. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
