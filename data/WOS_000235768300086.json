Only 20 keystroke patterns of user's password typing, where the length of password is no more than 10, are used for building a KBS. The features in the time domain and those in the frequency domain are separately scored by the rules that we developed, and arbitrary given keystroke patterns are classified on the basis of total scores. The results show that our KBS is competitive in comparison with others due to its cheap computational cost, cheap usability cost, and the practically acceptable classification accuracy.", "paper_title": "Keystroke biometric system using wavelets", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300086"}
