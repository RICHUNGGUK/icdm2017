The EMD is stimulated with drifting sinusoidal gratings, which are often used in motion vision research, thus enabling direct comparison with neural responses from motion-sensitive neurones in the fly brain. When sinusoidal gratings are displayed on a cathode ray tube monitor, they are modulated by the refresh rate of the monitor. This generates a pulsatile signature of the visual stimulus, which is also seen in the neural response. Such pulsatile signals make a Laguerre domain identification method for estimating the parameters of a single EMD suitable, allowing estimation of both finite and infinite-dimensional dynamics. To model the response of motion-sensitive neurones with large receptive fields, a pool of spatially distributed EMDs is considered, with the weights of the contributing EMDs fitted to the neural data by a sparse estimation method. Such an EMD-array is more reliably estimated by stimulating with multiple sinusoidal gratings, since these provide higher spatial excitation than a single sinusoidal grating. Consequently, a way of designing the visual stimuli for a certain order of spatial resolution is suggested.", "paper_title": "Identification of the Reichardt Elementary Motion Detector Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000350427300006"}
