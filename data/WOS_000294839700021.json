We point out that Opthof and Leydesdorff draw their conclusions based on a very limited amount of data. We also criticize the statistical methodology used by Opthof and Leydesdorff. Using a larger amount of data and a more appropriate statistical methodology, we do find a significant correlation between the CPP/FCSm indicator and peer judgment.", "paper_title": "On the correlation between bibliometric indicators and peer review: reply to Opthof and Leydesdorff", "paper_id": "WOS:000294839700021"}
