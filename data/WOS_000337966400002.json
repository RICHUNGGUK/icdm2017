Bandwidth being a critical shared-resource, we formulate the problem as an optimization problem that minimizes bandwidth demand between clusters of VMs of a tenant; and we prove it as NP-hard. We develop fast online heuristics as an integrated resource allocator (IRA) that decides on the admission of dynamically arriving requests, and allocates resources for the accepted ones. We also present a modified version of IRA, called B-IRA that bounds the cost of bandwidth allocation, while exploring smaller search space for solution. We demonstrate that, IRA accommodates significantly higher number of requests in comparison to a load-balancing resource allocator (LBRA) that does not consider reducing bandwidth between clusters of VMs. IRA also outperforms B-IRA when traffic demands of VMs in an input are not localized.", "paper_title": "An Online Integrated Resource Allocator for Guaranteed Performance in Data Centers", "paper_id": "WOS:000337966400002"}
