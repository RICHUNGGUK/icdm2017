Modeling and simulation of the process based on finite element analyses has great interests to industrial practices. This paper deals with the prediction of the position of the lateral roll during cylindrical roll bending. In the numerical model, the rolls are assumed to be rigid bodies and the plate is assumed to be made of elasto-plastic material, with a bilinear material model corresponding to the results from tensile tests. Shell elements are applied to the plate and automatic node-to-surface contacts are selected for the interfaces between the plate and the rolls. The nonlinear equations are resolved by fully integrated Belytschko-Tsay shell formulation under the well-known ANSYS/LS-DYNA environment with explicit time integration. The positions of the lateral roll predicted by the numerical simulations agree well with experiments. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V.
