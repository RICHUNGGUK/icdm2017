Using Multivariate Data Analysis, satisfactory PLS models were generated for each receptor subtype separately. The models were based on simple and easily interpretable drug-like and constitutional descriptors, while the inclusion of MOLCONN-Z descriptors in the initial pool of variables had no considerable impact in model predictivity. By simultaneous analysis of both types of activity, a consensus PLS model for dual PPAR-/ activity could be derived, displaying the molecular features, which may lead to a balanced activity. All models were validated by permutation tests, by dividing the data set into training and test sets, as well as by external validation using a blind test set. Detailed inspection of PPAR- and PPAR- crystal structures and molecular simulation supported the differentiation of most important descriptors in the separate PLS models, e.g. the higher impact of lipophilicity and bulk descriptors in PPAR- and PPAR- activity respectively, as well as the effect of specific structural descriptors. Molecular simulation provided also explanation for the behavior of certain outliers in the PLS models.", "paper_title": "Analysis of PPAR-/ Activity by Combining 2-D QSAR and Molecular Simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000320725900004"}
