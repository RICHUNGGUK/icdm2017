In general, however, this condition is unnecessary. Then the fitting can be further improved. Considering a representative quadrant of E, we first draw two auxiliary circular arcs tangent to E at the axes but having a gap epsilon at their boundary, such that the small arc S lies outside the large arc L. Meanwhile the extreme errors of S and L w.r.t. E are epsilon and -epsilon respectively. Giving the radii of S and L a decrement -epsilon/2 and an increment epsilon/2 brings them to join smoothly. Thus, reducing the overall error to minimum, an analytic solution in implicit form is derived. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
