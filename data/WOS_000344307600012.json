The game captures the adversarial interaction between the attacker and the project manager who has a secret she wants to protect but must share with a team of individuals selected from within her organization. Our interdisciplinary work is important in the face of the multipronged approaches utilized by well-motivated attackers to circumvent the fortifications of otherwise well-defended targets.", "paper_title": "Secure Team Composition to Thwart Insider Threats and Cyber-Espionage", "paper_id": "WOS:000344307600012"}
