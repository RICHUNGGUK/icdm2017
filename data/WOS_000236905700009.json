We present the key concepts and an initial interface for the RecipeSheet, a spread sheet-like environment with explicit support for creating and comparing alternative scenarios, based on the principles of subjunctive interfaces. A key feature of the RecipeSheet is that alternative scenarios can differ in terms of the processing used to calculate cells' values; in the context of the Web, this is useful for gathering and comparing results from alternative resources that offer nominally the same processing. We show various usage cases for our prototype, including an example from Web-based bioinformatics.", "paper_title": "An enhanced spreadsheet supporting calculation-structure variants, and its application to Web-based processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905700009"}
