This approach takes advantage of substructuring technique that is specially tailored to address the analysis and form-finding problem of slack cables subjected to arbitrary loads, and to reduce the overall analysis costs. At the overall structural level, a robust procedure is employed for detecting the instabilities and limiting the corresponding incremental displacements. The effectiveness of the proposed method for the analysis of highly unstable or variable-form structures is demonstrated by a number of analysis examples of slack cable systems.
