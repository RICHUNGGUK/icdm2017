However, these techniques often require human intervention to steer computation towards meaningful results. In this demo, we present VIZDOM, a new system for interactive analytics through pen and touch. VIZDOM's frontend allows users to visually compose complex workflows of ML and statistics operators OH an interactive whiteboard, and the back end leverages recent advances in workflow compilation techniques to run these computations at interactive speeds. Additionally, we are exploring approximation techniques for quickly visualizing partial results that incrementally refine over hire. This demo will show VIZDOM's capabilities by allowing users to interactively build complex analytics workflows using real-world datasets.", "paper_title": "Vizdom: Interactive Analytics through Pen and Touch", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800092"}
