We assume that the network employs network coding to simultaneously deliver the packets available at the source to all the destinations. We show that this problem can be looked at as a network generalization of the wiretap channel of type II introduced in a seminal paper by Ozarow and Wyner. In particular, we show that the transmitted information can be secured by using the Ozarow-Wyner approach of coset coding at the source on top of the existing network code. This way, we quickly and transparently recover some of the results available in the literature on secure network coding for wiretap networks. Moreover, we use this framework to derive new bounds on the code alphabet size that are independent of the network size, and provide algorithms for explicit construction of secure network codes. We also analyze the amount of information that can be leaked to the wiretapper as a function of the number of wiretapped edges.", "paper_title": "Secure Network Coding for Wiretap Networks of Type II", "paper_id": "WOS:000300845900007"}
