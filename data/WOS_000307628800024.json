Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is presented as linguistic and ambiguous information including several types of subjectivities, and so effects of SRI activities for the investment based on the CSR are formulated as fuzzy numbers. Furthermore, several types of portfolio models, considering direct evaluation approach of SRI, fuzzy variance including SRI, and biased future return derived from random simulation, are proposed. In order to evaluate these portfolio performances, a practical example derived from the current market is provided.", "paper_title": "SOCIALLY RESPONSIBLE INVESTMENT-BASED PORTFOLIO SELECTION PROBLEMS WITH FUZZINESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000307628800024"}
