This PA is based on a half stacked folded pseudo-differential structure (HSFDS) cascoded. This demonstrator is composed by only one stage. It provides a maximal gain of 10 dB at 2.2 GHz with a bandwidth at -3 dB (B-w-3 dB) of 43%. At 1.95 GHz, the maximal output power (P-max) is 23.3 dBm with a power added efficiency (PAE) of 12%. The output power at 1 dB compression (OCP1) is 21 dBm. At 2.4 GHz, Pmax is 23 dBm with a PAE of 11.3%. At this frequency, the OCP1 is 20 dBm.", "paper_title": "Design challenges of a fully integrated 65 nm CMOS half cascode SFDS PA", "paper_id": "WOS:000300360900003"}
