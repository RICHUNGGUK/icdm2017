The aim of this study was to construct an automatic technique for wheeze detection and monitoring using spectral analysis. Wheezes from 13 patients with diagnosed asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia were recorded and a time-frequency wheeze detector (TF-WD) based on TF wheeze characteristics was constructed. The TF-WD was evaluated using 337 wheezes by comparing its findings with those from clinical auscultation performed by two experts. In addition, the TF-WD was tested against artificial noise. The experimental and testing results justified the efficient performance and high noise robustness of the TF-WD. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
