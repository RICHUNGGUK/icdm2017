This has led to an interesting research topic: granular computing (GrC). Although many excellent research contributions have been made, there remains an important issue to be addressed: What is the essence of measuring a fuzzy-information granularity of a fuzzy-granular structure? What is needed to answer this question is an axiomatic constraint with a partial-order relation that is defined in terms of the size of each fuzzy-information granule from a fuzzy-binary granular structure. This viewpoint is demonstrated for fuzzy-binary granular structure, which is called the binary GrC model by Lin. We study this viewpoint from from five aspects in this study, which are fuzzy BINARY-granular-structure operators, partial-order relations, measures for fuzzy-information granularity, an axiomatic approach to fuzzy-information granularity, and fuzzy-information entropies.", "paper_title": "Information Granularity in Fuzzy Binary GrC Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000289158100005"}
