They have covering radius rho = 3 and 4, and are halves of binary Hamming and binary extended Hamming codes of length n = 2 (m) -1 and 2 (m) , where m is even. There are also shown some combinatorial (binomial) identities which are new, to our knowledge.These completely regular codes induce, in the usual way, i.e., as coset graphs, three infinite families of distance-regular graphs of diameter three and four. This description of such graphs is new.", "paper_title": "New families of completely regular codes and their corresponding distance regular coset graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000329240200013"}
