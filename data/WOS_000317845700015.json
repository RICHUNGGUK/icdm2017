We explain a new canonical string representation for a polygonal shape approximation from which the proposed spectral feature is derived. This spectral feature is a composition of Fourier coefficients of the shape function that is derived from the canonical representation. We applied the proposed feature in classification of lung nodules by means of our hierarchical learning scheme proposed in another study. The results show that the spectral feature is promising for lung nodule recognition.", "paper_title": "Object recognition by spectral feature derived from canonical shape representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000317845700015"}
