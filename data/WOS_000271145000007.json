As structured groups are more appealing to users than flat image collections, we propose an image clustering algorithm, with an incremental version that handles time-varying collections. A 3D graph-based visualization technique reflects the classification state. While this classification visualization is itself interactive, we show how user feedback may assist the classification, thus enabling a user to improve it. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
