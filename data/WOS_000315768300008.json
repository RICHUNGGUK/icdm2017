Using as a guide the current context for assembly simulation, we have analyzed the existing techniques used in developing gesture-based interface and extracted the constituent elements for an assembly gesture interface. The interface we propose offers support for assembly/disassembly operation, replace or delete components inside a virtual scene. To improve the current practice in virtual assembly simulation, our interface is an efficient method for assembly operations and a competitive approach for the current assembly simulation techniques.", "paper_title": "Novel Interface for Simulation of Assembly Operations in Virtual Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000315768300008"}
