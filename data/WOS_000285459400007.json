Two CA (Z(d), Q, f(A), nu(A)) and (Z(d), Q, f(B), nu(B)) are called automorphic, if there is a pair of permutations (pi, phi) of nu and Q, respectively, such that (f (B), nu(B)) = (phi(-1) f(A)(pi)phi, nu(pi)(A)), where nu(pi) denotes a permutation of nu and f(pi) denotes a permutation of arguments of local function f corresponding to nu(pi). This automorphism naturally induces a classification of CA, such that it generally preserves the global properties of CA up to permutation. As a typical example of the theory, the local functions of 256 ECA (1-dimensional 3-nearest neighbors 2-states CA) are classified into 46 classes. We also give a computer test of surjectivity, injecitivity and reversibility of the classes.", "paper_title": "Automorphism Classification of Cellular Automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000285459400007"}
