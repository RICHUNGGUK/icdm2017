The number of constraints is cn, where c is a constant. We prove that for every possible distribution, either the resolution complexity is almost surely polylogarithmic for sufficiently large c, or it is almost surely exponential for every c > 0. We characterize the distributions of each type. To do so, we introduce a closure operation on constraint sets which yields the set of all constraints that, in some sense, appear implicitly in the random CSP.", "paper_title": "A DICHOTOMY THEOREM FOR THE RESOLUTION COMPLEXITY OF RANDOM CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315579100002"}
