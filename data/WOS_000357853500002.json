Two types of multigrid methods and a multigrid preconditioned Newton-Krylov method are investigated, and both steady and unsteady algorithms are considered in this paper. For steady algorithms, a new strategy is introduced to determine the CFL number, which has been proved to be critical in achieving the effective and stable convergence for p-multigrid methods. We also suggest a modified smoothing technique to further improve the efficiency of the algorithms. For unsteady algorithms, special attention has been paid to the cycling strategy and the full multigrid technique, and we point out a significant difference on the parameter selection for unsteady computations. The capabilities of the resulted solvers have been examined by performing steady and unsteady RANS simulations. Comparative assessment in terms of efficiency, robustness, and memory consumption are carried out for all solvers.
