The linex loss function is often used when losses are asymmetric, but it has the disadvantage that it can only be used if the moment-generating function of the posterior distribution exists. Blinex loss has the advantage that it can always be calculated. Also many authors have argued that a bounded loss function is to be preferred. We have obtained the optimum sample size for a number of distributions when the cost of sampling is linear. The form of the posterior risk function does not allow an analytical solution so simulation is necessary.", "paper_title": "Bayesian sample size determination for the bounded linex loss function", "paper_id": "WOS:000335214900002"}
