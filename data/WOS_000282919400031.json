The fuzzy part, IS designed based on deviation of the last, target direction. The results are compared with two conventional covariance matrix presetting methods with and without jerk model The proposed method is rather robust with respect to the values of sampling time Simulation results show a superior performance of the proposed covariance presetting method in various scenarios.", "paper_title": "TRACKING HIGHLY MANEUVERING TARGETS USING FUZZY COVARIANCE MATRIX PRESETTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000282919400031"}
