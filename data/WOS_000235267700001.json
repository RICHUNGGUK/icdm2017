Since the perfect cryptography assumption is unrealistic for cryptographic primitives with visible algebraic properties, we extend the classical Dolev-Yao model by permitting the intruder to exploit these properties. More precisely, we are interested in theories such as Exclusive or and Abelian groups in combination with the homomorphism axiom. We show that the intruder deduction problem is in PTIME in both cases, improving the EXPTIME complexity results of Lafourcade, Lugiez and Treinen. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
