The 'cut-off phenomenon', or abrupt convergence, provides an answer to this problem. When a sample of Markov chains, or more generally of exponentially converging processes, is simulated in parallel, it remains far from its stationary distribution until a deterministic instant, and approaches it exponentially fast afterwards. The cut-off instant is explicitly known, and can be detected algorithmically using appropriate stopping times. The technique is illustrated on the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck diffusion.", "paper_title": "Convergence times for parallel Markov chains", "paper_id": "WOS:000239627400022"}
