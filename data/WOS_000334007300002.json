We show that a word contains n/sigma((r-1))-1 + o(n) powers of exponent r, at most n/sigma+o(n) runs, and also (1+2/sigma-1)n + o(n) palindromes. We also explore their abelian variants and prove that a binary word contains Theta(n(3/2)) abelian squares on the average, while its number of abelian cubes is related to Franel numbers. Finally, as a consequence, we show that a binary word has almost surely O(n(3/2)) abelian squares. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
