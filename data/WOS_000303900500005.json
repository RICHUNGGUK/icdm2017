Set partition coding (SPC) is efficient in intra-frame de-correlation for still images. Based on SPC, a novel image sequence coding system, called motion differential SPC (M-D-SPC), is presented in this paper. It removes inter-frame redundancy by re-using the significance map of a previously SPC coded frame. Every frame is encoded and decoded separate from other frames. Furthermore, there is no reconstruction of encoded frames in the encoder, as is done with interframe prediction methods. The M-D-SPC exhibits an auxiliary key frame coding framework, which achieves higher coding efficiency compared to the all-intra-coding schemes and meanwhile maintains the beneficial features of SPC all-intra-coding, such as computational simplicity, rate scalability, error non-propagation, and random frame access. SPIHT-based simulations on hyperspectral images, 3D/4D medical images, and video show greater compression efficiency than the standard intraframe coding method of motion JPEG2000.
