If for all vertices v is an element of V, the sets B r(v) are different, then we say that G is r-twin-free. In r-twin-free graphs, we prolong the study of the extremal values that can be achieved by the main classical parameters in graph theory, and investigate here the number of edges, the minimum degree, the size of a maximum independent set, as well as radius and diameter.", "paper_title": "EDGE NUMBER, MINIMUM DEGREE, MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET, RADIUS AND DIAMETER IN TWIN-FREE GRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000263354000008"}
