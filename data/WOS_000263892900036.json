Different subsystems are required to reach their respective target sets at different termination times. The goal is to minimize the maximum of these termination times. By introducing a discrete variable to represent the system termination ordering, were formulate this problem as a discrete optimization problem. A discrete filled function method is developed to solve this discrete optimization problem. For illustration, a numerical example is solved. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
