Through a simple variational formulation, the framework allows the user to design the orientation field with intuitive controls, by interactively manipulating singularities and field directions. The resulting field is then used to guide a parallel synthesis. Our contribution is twofold: a design tool for orientation fields with a natural boundary condition, and a parallel texture synthesis adapted specifically for using such fields in feature alignment. We demonstrate the advantages of the procedure through examples on planar and curved patches with trivial topology.", "paper_title": "Orientation Field Guided Texture Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000324661300009"}
