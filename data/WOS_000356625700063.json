Sambamba is a faster alternative to samtools that exploits multi-core processing and dramatically reduces processing time. Sambamba is being adopted at sequencing centers, not only because of its speed, but also because of additional functionality, including coverage analysis and powerful filtering capability.", "paper_title": "Sambamba: fast processing of NGS alignment formats", "paper_id": "WOS:000356625700063"}
