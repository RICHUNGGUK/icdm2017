Specifically, we present a method for instruction in programming using a semester-long project of developing a ray tracer. This effort is part of a larger project, known as tau is an element of chi nu eta, in which a broad range of undergraduate courses are taught using computer graphics as the motivating application. An overview of this project is provided, along with description and results from the first trial CS2 course instructed using this technique.", "paper_title": "Graphics-based learning in first-year computer science", "paper_id": "WOS:000251667500003"}
