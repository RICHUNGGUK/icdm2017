In this paper, we research an anti-worm mechanism that actively distributes the anti-worm code to the authorized hosts. We propose a Balanced Tree based Propagation strategy(BTP) for an anti-worm strategy with a mathematic model. By varying the model parameters, the impacts can be studied. Some simulation results show us that the new strategy is effective and feasible.", "paper_title": "An anti-worm with balanced tree based spreading strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000238282100068"}
