First, the pupil is binarized using the intensity threshold, then use morphologic method to denoise the eyelashes and eyelids noise. The geometrical method is used to calculate the coordinates of the pupil. Second, the outer (or limbus) boundary is localized using the shrunk image with the Hough transform and modified Canny edge detector in order to reduce computational cost. Third, the eyelids which are constrained to be within the outer boundary are estimated using the polynomial fitting method. The segmentation method was implemented and tested on iris database set which is captured by hand-held optical sensor device. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can separate the iris from the surrounding noises with good speed and accuracy.", "paper_title": "A novel iris segmentation method for hand-held capture device", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300064"}
