This study was conducted to realize high-precision sensors of 3D sound-space information for transmission to distant places and for preservation of sound data for the future. Proposed method comprises a compact and spherical object with numerous microphones. Each recorded signal from multiple microphones that are uniformly distributed on the sphere is simply weighted and summed to synthesize signals to be presented to a listener's left and right ears. The calculated signals are presented binaurally via ordinary binaural systems such as headphones. Moreover, the weight can be changed according to a human's 3D head movement. A human's 3D head movement is well known to be a crucially important factor to facilitate human spatial hearing. For accurate spatial hearing, 3D sound-space information is acquired as accurately reflecting the listener's head movement. We named the proposed method SENZI (Symmetrical object with ENchased Zillion microphones). The results of computer simulations demonstrate that our proposed SENZI outperforms a conventional method (binaural Ambisonics). It can sense 3D sound-space with high precision over a wide frequency range.", "paper_title": "3D Sound-Space Sensing Method Based on Numerous Symmetrically Arranged Microphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000342783900010"}
