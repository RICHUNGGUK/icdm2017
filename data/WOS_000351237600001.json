Effective countermeasures have to be developed to properly manage their critical timing effects. This article presents a methodology to avoid transition delay faults in field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based systems, with low area overhead. The approach is able to exploit temperature information and aging characteristics to minimize the cost in terms of performances degradation and power consumption. The architecture of a hardware manager able to avoid delay faults is presented and analyzed extensively, as well as its integration in the standard implementation design flow.", "paper_title": "SATTA: A Self-Adaptive Temperature-Based TDF Awareness Methodology for Dynamically Reconfigurable FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000351237600001"}
