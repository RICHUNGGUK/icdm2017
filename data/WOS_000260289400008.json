Many algorithms have been published giving fast implementations of these operations, and the best running time IS. Brunetti, A. Daurat, A.

Sci., vol, 4245, 2006, pp. 98-109] is O(N-2 logN) time, where N is the size of projections. In this paper we improve this result by providing an implementation of the filling operations in O(N-2). As a consequence, we reduce the time-complexity of the reconstruction algorithms for many classes of lattice sets having some convexity properties. In particular, the reconstruction of convex lattice sets satisfying the conditions of Gardner-Gritzmann [R.J. Gardner, P. Gritzmann, Discrete tomography: Determination of finite sets by X-rays, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 349 (1997) 2271-2295] can be performed in O(N-4)-time. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
