First, the advancing front mesh technique is used to cover the hole with newly created triangles. Next, the desirable normals of the new triangles are approximated using our desirable normal computing schemes. Finally, the three coordinates of every new vertex are re-positioned by solving the Poisson equation based on the desirable normals and the boundary vertices of the hole. Many experimental results and error evaluations are given to show the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A robust hole-filling algorithm for triangular mesh", "paper_id": "WOS:000251001400004"}
