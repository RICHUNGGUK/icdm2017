However, in disc drive systems using a short wavelength laser and a high NA objective lens, the deterioration of signal by disc tilt becomes serious. 3-axis actuators for active tilt compensation are used to compensate disc tilt. Hybrid-type 3-axis actuator, which has similar mechanical characteristics to conventional 3-axis actuators and simpler in its structure compared with them, is proposed in this paper. In order to optimize the configuration of the hybrid-type actuator, the electromagnetic circuit and moving part are designed by parametric investigations. The performance of the actuator is verified by experiments using proposed actuator. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
