However, the service for the impact factors is mainly designed for English-based journals only. A reference index system and database, 'Science Citation Index Processing System: SCIPS' has been developed for reference indexing and to evaluate the impact factors and immediacy indices. And the developed system is applied for Korean domestic journals. It can be easily ported to other domestic journals in other languages. The proposed system has two major steps of indexing and computation. For the indexing process, an error correction system for references of papers is implemented. The typos of reference listing are analysed and the major types are categorized. Then the correction lookup table and indices have been built to calculate more accurate impact factors. In the computation step, the actual impact factors and immediacy indices for the journals listed in the database are calculated. For the overall process, journal databases and indexing system for the journal contents have been built. In the experiments, the data obtained from the actually published papers from 2009 to 2011 of Journals are used and impact factor and immediacy index of 2011 are calculated. The experimental results show the validity of presented system. From the tables of 2011 of high cited rankings, the well known society or famous conferences are cited highly. Also, some international standard documents are highly cited in communication area. Writing errors of approximately 10 % in references degrades the evaluation accuracy of citation index and immediacy index. The error cases such as author error, abbreviation only, and unknown types are classified and analyzes to enhance the accuracy of the metrics.", "paper_title": "Error correction of reference indexing system including multimedia journals", "paper_id": "WOS:000351520200011"}
