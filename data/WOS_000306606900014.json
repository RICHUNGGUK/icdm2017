The GRP is a special Cauchy problem for a hyperbolic system with source terms whose initial condition is piecewise smooth. We briefly review the four solvers currently available and carry out a systematic assessment of these in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. These solvers are the building block for constructing high-order numerical schemes of the ADER type for solving the general initial-boundary value problem for inhomogeneous systems in multiple space dimensions, in the frameworks of finite volume and discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods.
