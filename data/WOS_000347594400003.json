Instead of applying the commonly used notion of strong independence, we replace it by the weaker, asymmetrical notion of epistemic irrelevance. We show how assessments of epistemic irrelevance allow us to construct a global model out of given local uncertainty models, leading to an intuitive expression for the so-called irrelevant natural extension of a credal network. In contrast with Cozman [4], who introduced this notion in terms of credal sets, our main results are presented using the language of sets of desirable gambles. This has allowed us to derive some remarkable properties of the irrelevant natural extension, including marginalisation properties and a tight connection with the notion of independent natural extension. Our perhaps most important result is that the irrelevant natural extension satisfies a collection of epistemic irrelevancies that is induced by AD-separation, an asymmetrical adaptation of d-separation. Both AD-separation and the induced collection of irrelevancies are shown to satisfy all graphoid properties except symmetry. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
