Mobile services additionally differ from each other in their value-added to the end-user. Some services-such as emailing and voice-are more business oriented. On the other hand, various free-time oriented services are provided in new smartphones, such as imaging and music playback. The present paper studies how mobile services are used in different contexts. For this, the paper develops a specialized algorithm that can be used with handset-based usage data acquired straight from end-users in an established panel study process. Educated guesses can be drawn on the user context based on the developed algorithm. In the present exercise usage contexts were divided into home, office and \"on the move\". The algorithm is used with exemplary data from Finland and the UK covering 324 consumers in 2006. More than 70% of contextual use cases are correctly classified based on raw data. According to exemplary results particularly multimedia services are used \"on the move\", whereas legacy mobile services experience more evenly distributed usage across all contexts. The algorithm that identifies context based on raw data provides a new angle to mobile end-user research. In the future, the accuracy of the algorithm will be improved with the integration of seamless cell-id logging and GPS data.", "paper_title": "Contextual patterns in mobile service usage", "paper_id": "WOS:000265538200001"}
