A cost-effective frequency-quadrupling technique capable of generating millimeter-wave signals up to 72 GHz is proposed. The generated optical millimeter-wave signals have very high quality, with an optical carrier and harmonic distortion suppression ratio exceeding 36 dB. An optical modulation scheme that can support a 64-QAM, 16 Gbits/s orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing RoF system is also demonstrated. Results of this study demonstrate that both methods offer realistic solutions to support future wireless systems.
