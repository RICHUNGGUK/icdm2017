It consists of the genetic algorithm, including the new crossover operations and the hybrid mutation operations, and the ant colony systems with communication strategies. We also make an experiment with three classical data sets got from the TSP library to test the performance of the proposed method. The experiment results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than Chu et al.'s method (2004). (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
