Much current research has focused on the implementation of IT infrastructures in creating an effective knowledge management system. However, literature has suggested a number of other factors which must be considered. This study proposes a knowledge management model that views IT application and worker learning motivation as critical factors which promote knowledge sourcing activities, knowledge sourcing activities then stimulate learning outcomes in knowledge acquisition and application. Sample data collected from a high-tech company in Taiwan (n = 466) were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). Results showed that IT application and learning motivation are critical elements in successful knowledge management. Specifically, IT application and learning motivation influences learning outcome indirectly through knowledge sourcing channels, indicating that it is crucial for organizations to promote various channels of knowledge sharing in conjunction with IT investments and fostering learning motivation.", "paper_title": "The KM chain - Empirical study of the vital knowledge sourcing links", "paper_id": "WOS:000252820800009"}
