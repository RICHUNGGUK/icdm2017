When dealing with large datasets (particularly in 3D), it is difficult to evaluate the quality of the resulting models. However, if the different methods are successfully modelling the true underlying shape variation, the resulting models should be similar. If two different techniques lead to similar models, it suggests that they are indeed approximating the true shape change. In this paper we explore a method of comparing statistical shape models by evaluating the Bhattacharya overlap between their implied shape distributions. We apply the technique to investigate the similarity of three models of the same 3D dataset constructed using different methods.", "paper_title": "Comparing the similarity of statistical shape models using the Bhattacharya metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300018"}
