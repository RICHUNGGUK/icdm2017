This method employs a shifting process on the pixel distribution of a color image to correct its white reference point and ensure the white reference point is achromatic. The proposed method has been tested on numerous types of images which include indoor, outdoor, and underwater images. The qualitative and quantitative analyses have shown ample evidence that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods, such as the Grey World, the White Patch and the General Grey World methods. The resultant images are viewed to be more natural and suggest more pleasant visualization without the intervention of the saturation problem. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
