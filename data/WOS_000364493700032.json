This paper presents a high concurrent and ubiquitous home multimedia conferencing platform using a service component architecture. For the proposed architecture, we focus on the design of a home multimedia conferencing platform framework, as well as home conferencing components, session management for media signaling, load balancing, and concurrent control for conferencing process management. We also present an efficient network address translation and a firewall traversal schema. High concurrency of the proposed architecture is achieved by coordinated distributed home conferencing services and concurrent control for conferencing process management. The performance of the proposed home multimedia conferencing platform has been evaluated, and the results show that the proposed architecture greatly improves the concurrency.", "paper_title": "Concurrent home multimedia conferencing platform using a service component architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000364493700032"}
