The front-end includes the differential low noise amplifier, the down-conversion mixer, the LO buffer, the IF buffer and the bandgap reference. A modified common source topology is used as the input stages of the down-conversion mixer (and the LNA) to improve IIP2 of the receiver RF front-end while maintaining high IIP3. A shunt LC network is inserted into the common-source node of the switching pairs in the down-conversion mixer to absorb the parasitic capacitance and thus improve IIP2 and lower down the 1/f noise of the down-conversion mixer. The direct-conversion receiver RF front-end has been implemented in 0.18 A mu m CMOS process. The measured results show that the 2 GHz receiver RF front-end achieves +33 dBm in-band IIP2, 21 dB power gain, 6.2 dB NF and -2.3 dBm in-band IIP3 while only drawing 6.7 mA current from a 1.8 V power supply.", "paper_title": "A low power direct conversion receiver RF front-end with high in-band IIP2/IIP3 and low 1/f noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000289103200002"}
