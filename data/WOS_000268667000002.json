Properties of intuitionistic fuzzy approximation operators are examined. Relationships between intuitionistic fuzzy rough set approximations and intuitionistic fuzzy topologies are then discussed. It is proved that the set of all lower approximation sets based on an intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation space forms an intuitionistic fuzzy topology; and conversely, for an intuitionistic fuzzy rough topological space, there exists an intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation space such that the topology in the intuitionistic fuzzy rough topological space is just the set of all lower approximation sets in the intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation space. That is to say, there exists an one-to-one correspondence between the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy reflexive and transitive approximation spaces and the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy rough topological spaces. Finally, intuitionistic fuzzy pseudo-closure operators in the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy rough approximations are investigated.", "paper_title": "On intuitionistic fuzzy rough sets and their topological structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000268667000002"}
