It is shown that such data can be feasibly compressed without knowledge of the secret key. Block ciphers operating in various chaining modes are considered and it is shown how compression can be achieved without compromising security of the encryption scheme. Further, it is shown that there exists a fundamental limitation to the practical compressibility of block ciphers when no chaining is used between blocks. Some performance results for practical code constructions used to compress binary sources are presented.", "paper_title": "On Compression of Data Encrypted With Block Ciphers", "paper_id": "WOS:000310156500025"}
