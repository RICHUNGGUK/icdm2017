The mean of an input or output weight is defined as the average of the maximum and the minimum attainable values of the weight when the efficient decision making unit under evaluation remains efficient. Alternate optimal weights usually exist in the linear programming solutions of efficient decision-making units and the optimal weights obtained from most of the linear programming software are some what arbitrary. Our proposed model can yield more rational weights without a priori information about tie weights. Input and output weights can be used to compute cross-efficiencies of decision-making units in peer evaluations or group decision-making units, which have similar production processes via cluster analysis. If decision makers want to avoid using weights with extreme or zero values to access performance of decision-making units, then choosing weights that are close to their means, may be a rational choice.
