In this paper, computational strategies using auxiliary indicator matrices are introduced for efficiently handling mixtures of multivariate normal distributions when the data are missing at random and have an arbitrary missing data pattern, meaning that missing data can occur anywhere. We develop a novel EM algorithm that can dramatically save computation time and be exploited in many applications, such as density estimation, supervised clustering and prediction of missing values. In the aspect of multiple imputations for missing data, we also offer a data augmentation scheme using the Gibbs sampler. Our proposed methodologies are illustrated through some real data sets with varying proportions of missing values. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
