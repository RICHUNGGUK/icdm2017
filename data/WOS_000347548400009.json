Automatic control and feedback loops appear to be an effective solution to simultaneously accommodate for performance uncertainties due to the tiny scale gates variability, varying and poorly predictable computing demands and limited energy storage constraints. This paper presents the example of an embedded video decoder controlled by several feedback loops to carry out the trade-off between decoding quality and energy consumption, exploiting the frequency and voltage scaling capabilities of the chip. The inner loop controls the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling through a fast predictive control strategy. The outer loop computes the scheduling set-points needed by the inner loop to process frames decoding. The feedback loops have been implemented on a stock PC and experimental results are provided.", "paper_title": "Energy-aware feedback control for a H.264 video decoder", "paper_id": "WOS:000347548400009"}
