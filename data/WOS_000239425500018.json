In this paper we described the approach that we adopted to satisfy the requirements of all the tasks, CAS and CO, in Thorough, Focused, and Fetch Browse mode, using the same underlying system The retrieval approach is based on the construction of a collection sub-tree, consisting of all nodes that contain one or more of the search terms. Nodes containing search terms are then assigned a score using a TF_IDF variant, scores are propagated upwards in the document XML tree, and finally all XML elements are ranked. We present results that demonstrate that the approach is versatile and produces consistently good performance across all INEX 2005 tasks.", "paper_title": "GPX - Gardens point XML IR at INEX 2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500018"}
