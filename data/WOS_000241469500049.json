The first one, B*-Consensus, is resilient to up to f < n/2 permanent faults, and can solve consensus in three communication steps. R*-Consensus, our second algorithm, is f < n/3 resilient, and can solve consensus in two communication steps. These algorithms are optimal with respect to the time complexity versus resilience tradeoff. We compare our algorithms to other consensus algorithms in the crash-recovery model.", "paper_title": "Optimal and practical WAB-based consensus algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000241469500049"}
