The uncertain design parameters, which usually exist in the object function and constraint conditions, are modeled as interval sets. The proposed method can endure the variation of structural performance resulting from the variation of uncertain design parameters. According to the variation range of them, the range or interval of the optimal objective function and the optimal solution can be determined. In this sense, the optimal solution is one domain rather than a point. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the feasibility and superiority of the non-probabilistic optimization method in comparison with the conventional and probabilistic optimization methods.", "paper_title": "Structural anti-optimization with interval design parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000275417500004"}
