In this paper, we demonstrate the possibility to design for experience, not by formalizing and rationalizing it, but instead by supporting open-ended engagement and appropriation. We illustrate this approach through Affector, a case study in affective computing, in which we focus on user interpretation and construction of emotional experience over its computational modeling. We derive design and evaluation strategies for enchantment that focus on supporting the ongoing construction and interpretation of experience by human participants over the course of interaction. We suggest that enchanting experiences may be designed only by approaching enchantment obliquely: not by engineering it in, but by providing opportunities where it may emerge.", "paper_title": "The disenchantment of affect", "paper_id": "WOS:000255542000002"}
