For triangle-free templates, a general collection of graph families for which the partitioning problem can be solved in polynomial time is described. For templates with a triangle, the problem is in some cases shown to be NP-complete.", "paper_title": "Complexity of conditional colouring with given template", "paper_id": "WOS:000342624900004"}
