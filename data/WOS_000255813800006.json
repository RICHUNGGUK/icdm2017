We extended the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by introducing components of subjective task value into a model for studying learners' continuance intentions in Web-based learning. Based on survey data from 286 respondents, SEM was employed to assess the model. The results indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, computer self-efficacy, attainment value, utility value, and intrinsic value were significant predictors of individuals' intentions to continue using Web-based learning, while anxiety had a significant negative effect. The results suggested the beneficial effect of positive subjective task value on stimulating learners' intentions to continue using Web-based learning, which is as important as performance expectancy and effort expectancy. implications and limitations of our study are discussed.
