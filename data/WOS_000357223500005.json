Instead of the conventional force/length hysteresis model, a Prandtl-Ishlinskii (P-I) model of a dual pneumatic artificial muscle (PAM) system is presented. For the comparison, an alternative hysteresis model such as Bouc-Wen (B-W) model is also considered. All model parameters are identified by real code genetic algorithm (RCGA). Different feedback control strategies are combined with a feed-forward controller based on a P-I model for hysteresis compensation to reduce the tracking error of the dual PAM system. The experimental results validated the use of the proposed controller for trajectory tracking of PAM systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
