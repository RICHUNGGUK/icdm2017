Some properties of the weighting function associated with orness level are analyzed. Then two special classes of ANOWA operator with maximum entropy and minimum variance are proposed, and the orness of the BADD OWA operator is discussed. For a given orness level, these ANOWA operators can be uniquely determined. Their aggregation values for any aggregation elements set always monotonically increase with their orness levels. Therefore they can be used as a parameterized aggregation method with orness as its control parameter and to represent the decision maker's preference.
