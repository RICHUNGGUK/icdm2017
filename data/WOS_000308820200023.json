Further extraction of these relations by intelligent decision-support systems using data mining as a tool is discussed. The paper envisages the possibility of establishing a common solution platform for product development and customization leading to increased profitability and better resource utilization. It showcases ways to link these different ontological models leading to cross platform compatibility. It also tries to explore manufacturer-customer relationship and using them to provide quality analysis methods for further improvement in the product processing model.", "paper_title": "A framework for ontology based decision support system for e-learning modules, business modeling and manufacturing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000308820200023"}
