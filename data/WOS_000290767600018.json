Our key idea is to construct a global model from a prerecorded motion database and utilize them to construct full-body human motion in a maximum a posteriori framework (MAP). We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system by controlling a variety of human actions, such as boxing, golf swinging, and table tennis, in real time. One unique property of our system is its ability to learn priors from a large and heterogeneous motion capture database and use them to generate a wide range of natural poses, a capacity that has not been demonstrated in previous data-driven character posing systems.", "paper_title": "Performance-based control interfaces using mixture of factor analyzers", "paper_id": "WOS:000290767600018"}
