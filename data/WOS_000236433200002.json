To function normally, MANETs demand an efficient and distributed medium access control (MAC) protocol. However, characteristics of MANETs such as radio link vulnerability, mobility, limited power pose great challenges oil MAC design. This paper surveys the recent advances in MAC design for MANETs. We first identify the challenges that are facing MAC ill MANETs. Then we discuss the proposed MAC schemes according to their design goals, focusing on some critical design issues, and tradeoffs. Finally, we point out some future research directions.
