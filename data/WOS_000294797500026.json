Rather than using the output error and the error change of the system, the EASFSC uses a sliding surface and its differential as the input variables of a fuzzy logic controller (FLC) in a self-organizing fuzzy controller (SOFC) to generate a control input through fuzzy operation. It also applies an adaptive law to modify the fuzzy consequent parameter of the FLC in the SOFC to improve the stability of the system. The stability of the EASFSC was proven by using the Lyapunov stability theorem. The EASFSC eliminates the problem faced by the implementation of an SOFC where the determination of the stability of the system is difficult. It also overcomes the difficulty of finding appropriate membership functions and fuzzy rules for the design of an FLC. Experimental results showed that the EASFSC has better control performance than the SOFC for robotic motion control.", "paper_title": "ENHANCED ADAPTIVE SELF-ORGANIZING FUZZY SLIDING-MODE CONTROLLER FOR ROBOTIC MOTION CONTROL", "paper_id": "WOS:000294797500026"}
