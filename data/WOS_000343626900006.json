The incorporation of mobile smart devices in these services has become a popular trend. Existing services require that these devices are located in the same local network. This paper presents the design and implementation of an integrated service architecture that supports the remote control of home appliances and the sharing of digital media between indoor and outdoor devices. The proposed design follows standards related to digital homes, and this study presents the details of its hardware and software components.
