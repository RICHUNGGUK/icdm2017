Different from the existing methods, the secret data is embedded into the prediction errors produced by the neural network nonlinear predictor, and the non-uniform quantization method is used to embed secret data. The proposed method can achieve higher embedding payload while keeping smaller distortion, and experimental results are given to show the advantage of this scheme.", "paper_title": "Data hiding in neural network prediction errors", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300040"}
