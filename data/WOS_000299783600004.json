Standard query techniques such as nearest neighbours do not account for this difference between source and target; they perform retrieval but do not learn to make timbral analogies. This paper addresses this issue by considering timbral query as a multivariate regression problem from one timbre distribution onto another. We develop a novel variant of multivariate tree regression: given only a set of unlabelled and unpaired samples from two distributions on the same space, the regression learns a cross-associative mapping which assumes general similarities in structure of the two distributions, yet can accommodate differences in shape at various scales. We demonstrate the technique with a synthetic example and with a concatenative synthesizer.", "paper_title": "Learning Timbre Analogies from Unlabelled Data by Multivariate Tree Regression", "paper_id": "WOS:000299783600004"}
