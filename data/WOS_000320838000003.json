Due to the thin slice thickness of digital human data, the static slices can be regarded as a sequence of temporal deformation of the same slice. This gives light to the method of object contour tracking for the segmentation task for the digital human data. In this paper, we present an adaptive geometric active contour tracking method, based on a feature image of object contour, to segment tissues in digital human data. The feature image is constructed according to the matching degree of object contour points, image variance and gradient, and statistical models of the object and background colors. Utilizing the characteristics of the feature image, the traditional edge-based geometric active contour model is improved to adaptively evolve curve in any direction instead of the single direction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust to automatically handle the topological changes, and is effective for the segmentation of digital human data.
