We implemented an appearance-based emotion detection algorithm that uses Gabor features and a k nearest neighbors classifier. We tested the performance of this algorithm on two datasets with different ground truth strengths (a firm ground truth dataset and a weak ground truth dataset). Then we split the dataset into three subsets reflecting different levels of users' facial expressiveness (low, mid and high) and performed separate emotion detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
