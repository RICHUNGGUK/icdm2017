In the proposed method, the structures and parameters of the fuzzy models are encoded into a particle and evolve together so that the optimal structure and parameters can be achieved simultaneously. An improved version of the original PSO algorithm, the cooperative random learning particle swarm optimization (CRPSO), is put forward to enhance the performance of PSO. CRPSO employs several sub-swarms to search the space and the useful information is exchanged among them during the iteration process. Simulation results indicate that CRPSO outperforms the standard PSO algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE) on the functions optimization and benchmark modeling problems. Moreover, the proposed CRPSO-based method can extract accurate T-S fuzzy model with appropriate number of rules. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
