Each peer must be robust enough in order to take in account the incomplete and locally inconsistent information of its source databases, typical in Web applications. We consider a peer as a local epistemic logic system with its own belief, independent from other peers and their own beliefs. The traditional extensional semantics for mappings between peers destroys such epistemic independence of peers: the beliefs of other peers (also when change dynamically) are locally introduced into a given peer, so that its own belief depends directly and automatically from other peers. Moreover, the information that one peer provides to another peer may be inconsistent with the information known by the later. This motivates the need of a new, alternative semantic characterization of P2P mappings based not on the extension but on the meaning of concepts used in the mappings. We present a novel proposal, based on intensional logic, and show that it adequately models this weakly-coupled framework and supports decidable query answering.", "paper_title": "Intensional semantics for P2P data integration", "paper_id": "WOS:000240496900003"}
