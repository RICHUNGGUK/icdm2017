Without assuming the global Lipschitz conditions of activation functions, sufficient conditions for the existence and exponential stability of the almost periodic solutions are established by using the fixed point theorem and differential inequality techniques. The results of this paper are new and they complement previously known results. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
