The main object of this work is to extend the above characterization to the class of lower semicontinuous functions. To this end, we establish a new approximate mean value inequality involving three points. We also show that an analogue of the Rockafellar maximal monotonicity theorem holds for this class of functions and we discuss the case of arbitrary subdifferentials.", "paper_title": "Subdifferential characterization of approximate convexity: the lower semicontinuous case", "paper_id": "WOS:000256964400007"}
