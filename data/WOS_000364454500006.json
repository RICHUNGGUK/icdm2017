We construct a new code that is exponentially more efficient, but can still be used in many of these applications. Using the new code we obtain exponential improvements over several known results, including the following: (1) For any epsilon > 0, we show the existence of an n-vertex graph G where every set of o(n) vertices has expansion 1-epsilon, but G's adjacency matrix has more than exp(log(delta) n) eigenvalues larger than 1 - epsilon, where delta depends only on epsilon. This answers an open question of Arora, Barak, and Steurer [Proceedings of the 2010 IEEE 51st Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, 2010, pp. 563-572], who asked whether one can improve over the noise graph on the Boolean hypercube that has poly(log n) such eigenvalues. (2) A gadget that reduces Unique Games instances with linear constraints modulo K into instances with alphabet k with a blowup of k(polylog(K)), improving over the previously known gadget with blowup of k(Omega(K)). (3) An n-variable integrality gap for Unique Games that survives exp(poly(log log n)) rounds of the semidefinite programming version of the Sherali-Adams hierarchy, improving on the previously known bound of poly(log log n). We show a connection between the local testability of linear codes and Small-Set Expansion in certain related Cayley graphs and use this connection to derandomize the noise graph on the Boolean hypercube.", "paper_title": "MAKING THE LONG CODE SHORTER", "paper_id": "WOS:000364454500006"}
