Furthermore, the end-to-end (E2E) delay requirements of premium services need queueing delay guarantee in network nodes throughout the transmission path. For this purpose, a framework for deterministic delay guarantee is proposed in this article. It incorporates the deterministic delay model in the ingress edge node as well as in the SCUs of core nodes. On this basis, the configuration of the assembler and the offset time is addressed by means of an optimization problem under the delay constraints. Scenario studies are carried out with reference to realistic transport network topologies. Compared to statistical delay models in the literature, the deterministic model has advantages in rendering robust absolute delay guarantee for individual FEC flows, which is especially appreciated in the provisioning of premium services. By performance evaluation in comparison with the statistical models, it is shown that the adopted deterministic delay models lead to practical delay bounds in a magnitude that is close to the delay estimations by stochastic analysis.", "paper_title": "A framework for deterministic delay guarantee in OBS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000283589400009"}
