There are, very likely, many different ways to regularize an adaptive filter. In this letter, we propose one possible way to do it based on a condition that makes intuitively sense. From this condition, we show how to regularize the recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm.", "paper_title": "Regularization of the RLS Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000293664300003"}
