Using the wavelet transform, the present paper extends the multiresolution analysis to the shape space, developing a novel multiresolution shape framework, capable of being incorporated into most of ASM variants. The tests performed with two different types of images, face images (AR database) and chest radiographs (JSRT database), demonstrate how this new generation of algorithms significantly reduce the computational cost, more than halving it, while maintaining the same levels of accuracy.", "paper_title": "Full Multiresolution Active Shape Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000307772900017"}
