However, biomedicine is an evolving field (new knowledge emerges from research, etc.); therefore, a standard ontology construction process is required to keep the ontology up-to-date. This paper proposes to deal with the construction of a specialized ontology as the discovery of a new knowledge structure. The proposed bilingual bio-ontology contains more than 250 concepts about physiology, function and structure of human digestive system. Hence, the paper proposes a methodology for building a bilingual (English/Arabic) ontology for the digestive system in the biology domain. In conclusion, this paper presents a first step towards the creation of a bilingual bio-ontology through the integration of its sub-ontologies.", "paper_title": "BUILDING A BILINGUAL BIO-ONTOLOGY PLATFORM FOR KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY", "paper_id": "WOS:000297957500032"}
