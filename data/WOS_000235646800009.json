The following five problems are studied: delete k vertices such that (a) each of the given l terminals is separated from the others, (b) each of the given C pairs of terminals is separated, (c) exactly e vertices are cut away from the graph, (d) exactly e connected vertices are cut away from the graph, (e) the graph is separated into at least l components. We show that if both k and l are parameters, then (a), (b) and (d) are fixed-parameter tractable, while (c) and (e) are W[1]-hard. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
