The kernel technology of this vision-based system locates the cameras that are utilized to point and simulate the positions of multiple viewers. Camera calibration based on computer vision is employed during the camera's locating process. The applications in multiuser collaborative environments allow the viewers to view various positions and in numerous directions. However, traditional calibration approaches are not suitable for these cases sufficiently. A novel calibration pattern based on pseudo-random arrays is designed for multiuser collaborative applications. The pattern has a simple and regular structure, easily extracts features, achieves robust recognition using local information, and does not limit viewer positions and directions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system provides a effective platform for applications in multiuser collaborative environments.", "paper_title": "A vision-based augmented-reality system for multiuser collaborative environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000258767200004"}
