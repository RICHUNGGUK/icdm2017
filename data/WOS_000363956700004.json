Each originally two-dimensional vehicle logotype is transformed to a three-dimensional feature tensor applying the extended structural tensor method. All such exemplary logo-tensors which correspond to a single class are stacked to form a 4D logo-class-tensor. Decomposing each 4D logo-class-tensor into the orthogonal tensor subspace allows classification of unknown logotypes. The proposed system allows reliable vehicle logo recognition in real conditions as shown by experiments.", "paper_title": "An Improved Vehicle Logo Recognition Using a Classifier Ensemble Based on Pattern Tensor Representation and Decomposition", "paper_id": "WOS:000363956700004"}
