Design/methodology/approach - An analysis of primary materials, and of recent secondary materials, is carried out. Findings - The legislative and regulatory framework failed to take note of the unique attributes of information resources, and attempted to treat them in the same manner as more traditional resources. Records of the early days of USA radio are very limited. More positively, radio information resources played a major part in developing several aspects of society, including education, agriculture, and jazz culture. Research limitations/implications - The study shows lessons for development of current information society. The research is limited to one communication medium, in one country, in one decade. It is not a full historical analysis of the development of radio broadcasting, rather it is limited to information resource aspects, largely of public sector broadcasting. Originality/value - The paper is the first study of the early development of radio broadcasting from an information perspective. It shows the value of the \"information-as-resource\" model for analysing developments in the communication of information.", "paper_title": "Even in an age of wonders: radio as an information resource in 1920s America", "paper_id": "WOS:000320742000006"}
