To reduce the costs of rule evaluation task, which is one of the key procedures in data mining post-processing, we have developed the rule evaluation support method with rule evaluation models, which are obtained with objective indices of mined classification rules and evaluations of a human expert for each rule. Then we have evaluated performances of learning algorithms for constructing rule evaluation models on the meningitis data mining as an actual problem and five rulesets from the five kinds of UCI datasets. With these results, we show the availability of our rule evaluation support method.", "paper_title": "Developing a rule evaluation support method based on objective indices", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500066"}
