And, network based anomaly detection schemes can reduce the complexity, but they have a limitation to figure out the pattern of the distributed global scale network attack. In this paper, we propose an efficient and fast method for detecting distributed global-scale network attack symptoms in high-speed backbone networks. The proposed method is implemented at the aggregate traffic level. So, our proposed scheme has much lower computational complexity, and is implemented in very high-speed backbone networks. In addition, the proposed method can detect attack patterns, such as attacks in which the target is a certain host or the backbone infrastructure itself, via collaboration of edge routers on the backbone network. The effectiveness of the proposed method are demonstrated via simulation.", "paper_title": "Fast Detection of Distributed Global Scale Network Attack Symptoms and Patterns in High-speed Backbone Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000270806900001"}
