These substances may prevent oxidative stress by scavenging free radicals. Two principal mechanisms exist for scavenging free radicals: the electron transfer and hydrogen atom transfer. In this investigation, a theoretical study of the antiradical capacity of five ommochromes was performed within the density functional theory framework. Vertical ionization energy and vertical electron affinity were used to study the electron transfer mechanism between ommochromes and four free radicals: CH3O center dot, NO2 center dot, HO center dot, and HOO center dot. For the hydrogen transfer mechanism, dissociation energy (D-0) and Gibbs free energy were calculated, taking into account hydrogen atoms at different positions in the ommochromes. Both mechanisms are thermodynamically possible. The best antiradical is ommatin D. The UV/VIS spectra for ommochromes were obtained with ommatin D registering as the ommochrome with the greatest lambda(max) value. In summary, ommatin D is the best antiradical and also the redder molecule. These results are important and may help to elucidate the function of these molecules in the animal kingdom.", "paper_title": "Antiradical capacity of ommochromes", "paper_id": "WOS:000359539700033"}
