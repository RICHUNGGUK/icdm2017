It is shown that the commonly used Complete Quadratic Combination method (CQC) in previous optimization work is not only computationally expensive but also results in non-convergent design pattern due to the low computing accuracy of random responses for large-scale problems. To circumvent these difficulties, an efficient and accurate optimization procedure integrating the Pseudo Excitation Method (PEM) and Mode Acceleration Method (MAM) is introduced into the dynamic topology optimization. In this framework, random responses are calculated using the PEM to ascertain a high efficiency over the CQC. More importantly, the accuracy of random responses is improved indirectly by solving the pseudo harmonic responses involved in the PEM with the help of the MAM. Numerical examples fully demonstrate the validity of the developed optimization procedure and its potential applications in practical designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
