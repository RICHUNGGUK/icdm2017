The problem is to decide whether a given calculus admits (reductive) cut elimination. We show that for commutative single-conclusion sequent calculi containing generalised knotted structural rules and arbitrary logical rules the problem can be decided by resolution-based methods. A general cut-elimination proof for these calculi is also provided.", "paper_title": "Towards an algorithmic construction of cut-elimination procedures", "paper_id": "WOS:000255227600005"}
