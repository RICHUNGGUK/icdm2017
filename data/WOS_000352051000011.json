The numerical modeling and simulation play a vital role in their development. In our efforts to build the above thermoacoustic systems, we have carried out numerical analysis using the procedures of CFD on the above systems. The results of the analysis are compared with those of DeltaEC (freeware from LANL, USA) simulations and the experimental results wherever possible. For the CFD analysis commercial code Fluent 6.3.26 has been used along with the necessary boundary conditions for different working fluids at various average pressures. The results of simulation indicate that choice of the working fluid and the average pressure are critical to the performance of the above thermoacoustic devices. Also it is observed that the predictions through the CFD analysis are closer to the experimental results in most cases, compared to those of DeltaEC simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
