In this paper, we develop an intelligent retrieval system for patent analysis that helps companies manage patent documents more effectively. By composing both bibliographic coupling and text mining approaches, this paper proposes a hybrid structure for higher search accuracy. An experimental prototype called PRAP (Patent Retrieval and Analysis Platform) was developed. Testing indicates that the PRAP has significantly increased the accuracy of patent retrieval compared to traditional patent search methods. We believed that our works have provided a feasible architecture for an intelligent patent retrieval system. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
