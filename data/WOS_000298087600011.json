Its efficiency depends on the spectral radius-in [0,1)-of a certain matrix in the definition of the preconditioner. In a recent work, the authors improved this algorithm (i.e., reduced the spectral radius) for general block-angular problems by adding a quadratic regularization to the logarithmic barrier. This barrier was shown to be self-concordant, which guarantees the convergence and polynomial complexity of the algorithm. In this work, we focus on linear multicommodity problems, a particular case of primal block-angular ones. General results are tailored for multicommodity flows, allowing a local sensitivity analysis on the effect of the regularization. Extensive computational results on some standard and some difficult instances, testing several regularization strategies, are also provided. These results show that the regularized interior-point algorithm is more efficient than the nonregularized one. From this work it can be concluded that, if interior-point methods based on conjugate gradients are used, linear multicommodity flow problems are most efficiently solved as a sequence of quadratic ones.
