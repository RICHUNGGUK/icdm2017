The objective of the present paper is to analyze the behavior of finite particle formulations based on projection methodologies, investigating in particular how these approaches behave in approximating 1D and 2D second-order problems. Moreover, the issue of choosing suitable projection functions is discussed and 1D and 2D numerical tests, showing the second-order accuracy of the methods under investigation, are performed.
