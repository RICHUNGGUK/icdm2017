The proposed realizations provide high voltage and current tracking accuracy, as well as large voltage and current transfer bandwidths. Simulation results show that the first proposed wide-band CCII- bandwidth is about 972 MHz. Targeting low-power dissipation, a second low-power version of the wide-band CCII- is proposed at the expense of lower bandwidth and accuracy. The proposed CCII- realizations are layout-friendly because they can be easily fabricated in a systematic modular layout fashion. In addition, a fair comparison is held between the proposed realizations and the only FCS-based CCII- realizations in the literature to show the strength of the proposed circuits. The proposed two CCII- realizations show excellent immunity to process variations and transistor mismatch. In addition, they are insensitive to the temperature variations. Finally, two common CCII- applications are presented.", "paper_title": "NOVEL FCS-BASED LAYOUT-FRIENDLY ACCURATE WIDE-BAND LOW-POWER CCII- REALIZATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000279796900006"}
