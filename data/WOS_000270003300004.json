A new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional is constructed by dividing the time-varying delay into a constant part and a variant part. A less conservative criterion, which benefits from partitioning the constant delay part, is achieved in terms of linear matrix inequalities. An illustrative example is provided to show the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed result.", "paper_title": "Discrete-time complex networks: a new synchronisation stability criterion", "paper_id": "WOS:000270003300004"}
