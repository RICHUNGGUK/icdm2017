In most routing protocols of DTNs, each node is required to honestly relay messages. However, some nodes may violate this principle, and relay messages in a greedy way in order to maximize their own benefit. The existing security solutions in DTNs cannot cope with the greedy behavior because of the greedy nature of nodes. We propose a message matching-based detection (MMBD) method where a smart mobile trusted module (MTM) is introduced to monitor the forwarding sequence of messages buffered in the node to prevent the greedy behavior. This method requires less computation time and fewer resources than the trusted computing group attestation. Furthermore, as shown in simulation results, this method can offer a fair routing environment in DTNs, and it can increase the average message delivery ratio of the network when the greedy behavior occurs.
