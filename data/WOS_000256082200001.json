We can purchase a coupon at a price of 0 < s <= 1 times its face value and the number of potential purchasable coupons is a given integer l. The customer has the option to buy the goods by cash completely or by a discount coupon. However, each piece of goods can only use one coupon and the coupon used must have enough balance for the goods. The objective is to minimize the total cost for purchasing all the goods. In this paper, we reduce the problem to a special bin packing model. We consider the online problems for all 0 < s <= 1 and 1 <= t <= infinity. We present optimal online algorithms for all 0 < s <= 1 when l = infinity and l = 1. For 2 <= l < infinity, we give both a lower bound and an algorithm, and show the algorithm is optimal for l = 2.", "paper_title": "Online coupon consumption problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000256082200001"}
