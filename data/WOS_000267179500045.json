In recent years, some methods have been presented for diagnosing learning problems of learners for adaptive learning systems. In this paper, we present a new method to diagnose learning barriers of learners based on fuzzy rules. The proposed method evaluates the learning degree and infers the probability of learning barriers of the learners based on fuzzy rules. It provides us a useful way to diagnose the learning barriers of the learners in adaptive learning systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
