With little to no maintenance, each sensor node within a WBAN must operate with less than 100 mu W of power consumption. Impulse radio architecture can be utilized to achieve this goal. This paper reports a low-power transmitter unit consisting of a Data Generator Block, an Impulse Generator Block and a Buffer. The Data Generator Block converts any electrochemical sensor current ranging from 0.2 to 2 mu A to digital data. This block consumes a power in the range of 2.575-4.29 mu W. The Impulse Generator Block utilizes an RC network to generate impulses of approximately 55 ns duration. Both the Data Generator Block and the Impulse Generator Block can operate with a 1 V supply. Finally, a Buffer circuit, which operates with a 2 V supply, is used to drive a standard 50 Omega load such as an external antenna. The peak current consumption of the impulses is 2.11 mA with a peak output voltage of 72 mV, making it extremely suitable for short range wireless communication. The entire system has been designed and fabricated using a 90 nm standard CMOS process. The average power consumption of the system is only 22.10 mu W.", "paper_title": "Low-power sensor signal monitoring and impulse radio architecture for biomedical applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000329222700020"}
