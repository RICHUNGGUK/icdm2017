Three formats were compared with respect to the instruction of two circumscribed intensive care topics. The formats included international video-linked (VL) tutorials in combination with web-based tutorials (VL + WB), web-based tutorials only (WB), and conventional classroom tutorials (C). Physical therapy students were assigned to one of the three groups at each site. The learning outcomes included grades and evaluation of the learning experience. The instructors provided written feedback on their experience with the instructional formats. Grades were comparable across instructional groups at both sites with the exception of one question for the HK group. The VL + WB groups valued learning from international peers. VL learning outcomes appeared to be comparable to conventional formats and may augment students' learning satisfaction. Modifications are recommended to accommodate differences in the language proficiency of students. The instructors acknowledged that preparation for VL tutorials was unique and challenging. Further research targeted at cross cultural interaction via IVC is needed to determine whether quality of learning outcomes are topic dependent. Cross cultural IVC appears to be both a distinct teaching as well as learning experience for health professional students. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
