Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) aims at giving people the knowledge of recommendation concerning a finite set of objects evaluated with multiple preference-ordered attributes (known as criteria). Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA) is a powerful tool for MCDA via assigning objects to several predefined and preference-ordered decision classes. Most of previous strategies are to induce a minimal set of \"if...then.'' rules. In this paper, we provide strategies to induce a new rule set as the substitution for the classical minimal rule set. The main contributions include: (1) providing methods to induce certain rules in two situations respectively: multi-criteria and mix-attributes; (2) providing the concept of believe factor and its three measuring degrees for exploring valuable uncertain information within rough boundary regions; (3) providing the properties of believe factor with explanations from the viewpoint of class-based rough model; (4) proposing an extended Net Flow Score method in consideration of both partial and total orders in multicriteria ranking, via our proposed decision rules. A numerical example is used for illustration of overall problem-solving procedures and for a comparison with the existing representative proposals.", "paper_title": "Dominance-based decision rule induction for multicriteria ranking", "paper_id": "WOS:000209204300002"}
