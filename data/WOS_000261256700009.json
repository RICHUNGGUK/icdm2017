Forty native speakers of Chinese from Taiwan were recruited. Scores for reading comprehension showed that dynamic display did not significantly affect reading Comprehension. Presentation method, speed, and task type, however, were significant factors in reading comprehension, In addition, the interaction between presentation method and speed significantly affected reading comprehension. When the presentation method was in a word-by-word format, there was no significant difference in reading comprehension under different speed levels. However, when the presentation method was in a character-by-character format, reading comprehension was significantly higher for the lower speeds of 150 and 250 cpm than for 350 cpm.
