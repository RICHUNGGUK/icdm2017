The framework not only helps analyze and compare the complexity of WDM switching networks but also explains interesting properties of different designs. Then several important problems arising from this idea are addressed, and complexity bounds are derived. We also give several applications of the proposed model, including explicit constructions of nonblocking WDM switching fabrics.", "paper_title": "WDM switching networks, rearrangeable and nonblocking [w, f]-connectors", "paper_id": "WOS:000236097800013"}
