HTIA integrates the Taguchi method and the traditional immune algorithm (TIA), providing a powerful global exploration capability. Taguchi method (TM) has been widely used in experimental designs for problems with multiple parameters, and is incorporated into TIA in this paper for the crossover operation to select a better gene. The effectiveness and efficiency of HTIA are demonstrated by several case studies, and the results are compared with other methods published before. Test results show that the proposed method is feasible, robust, and more effective than many other previously developed computation algorithms. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.
