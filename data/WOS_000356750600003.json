In this paper, we propose a methodology to model texture properties by means of fuzzy sets defined on bidimensional spaces. In particular, we have focused our study on the fineness property that is considered as the most important feature for human visual interpretation. In our approach, pairwise combinations of fineness measures are used as a reference set, which allows to improve the ability to capture the presence of this property. To obtain the membership functions, we propose to learn the relationship between the computational values given by the measures and the human perception of fineness. The performance of each fuzzy set is analyzed and tested with the human assessments, allowing us to evaluate the goodness of each model and to identify the most suitable combination of measures for representing the fineness presence.
