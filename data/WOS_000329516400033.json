The model is based on providing a high ranging accuracy (intersensor distance) between a pair of transceivers placed on the adjacent segments of the joint center of rotation. The measured distance is then used to compute the joint angles based on the law of cosines. The performance of the method was compared with a flexible goniometer by simultaneously measuring joint flexion-extension angles at different angular velocities, ranging between 8 and 90 degrees/s. The measurement errors were evaluated by the average differences between two sets of data (ranging from 0.8 degrees for slow movement to 2.8 degrees for fast movement), by standard deviation (ranging from 1.2 degrees to 4.2 degrees for various movement speeds) and by the Pearson correlation coefficient (greater than 0.99) which demonstrates the very good performance of the UWB-based approach. The experimental results have shown that the system has sufficient accuracy for clinical applications, such as rehabilitation.", "paper_title": "A Novel Approach to Joint Flexion/Extension Angles Measurement Based on Wearable UWB Radios", "paper_id": "WOS:000329516400033"}
