Multi-channel design is a promising technique to alleviate interference as a primary reason for long latency of TDMA aggregation scheduling. Indeed, it provides more potential of parallel transmissions over different frequency channels, thus minimizing time latency. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-channel minimum latency aggregation scheduling protocol, named MC-MLAS, using a new joint approach for tree construction, channel assignment, and transmission scheduling. To our best knowledge, this is the first work in the literature which combines orthogonal channels and partially overlapping channels to consider the total latency involved in data aggregation. Extensive simulations verify the superiority of MC-MLAS in WSNs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
