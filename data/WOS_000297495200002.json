This paper shows how a single tensor-product spline of degree (3,6) can cap a polar configuration with a C-2 surface. By design, this C-2 polar spline joins C-2 with surrounding bi-3 tensor-product splines and thereby complements algorithms that smoothly cap star-like, multi-sided regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
