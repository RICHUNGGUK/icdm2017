In the telecommunication domain, understanding the distinction between potential adopters and existing users is an important issue, as the use of information and communication technologies is associated with what has become known as the digital divide. This study attempts to develop a theoretical framework that identifies utilitarian and hedonic values as the key predictors of MDS acceptance and continuance. It also investigates the difference in the determinants between potential adopters and existing users. The proposed research model is empirically tested by using survey data collected from 120 potential adopters and 354 existing users. The results of structural equation modeling (SEM) show that the proposed research model provides a significant explanation of the variance of adoption intention and continued usage intention toward MDS. This study also clarifies the moderating role of direct experience with MDS in behavioral intention toward it. The results of this study would provide some guidelines to overcoming the digital divide in the context of MDS. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.
