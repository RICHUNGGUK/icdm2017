It looks at an algorithm published in 1943 by M. H. A. Newman, which decides whether a lambda-calculus term is typable without actually computing its principal type. Newmans algorithm seems to have been completely neglected by the type-theorists who invented their own rather different typability algorithms over 15 years later.", "paper_title": "M. H.
