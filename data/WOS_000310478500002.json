Because of its microscale nature, strict attention should be paid when introducing macroscopic inputs to the model. One of the challenging issues dealing with macroscale and microscale treatment is the implementation of boundary conditions. In this regard constant-temperature boundaries are frequently used in energy transfer problems. Such boundaries are simply modeled in NavierStokes based solvers, but they are not so harnessed in lattice-Boltzmann models. One of the problems is that the calculated tangential heat flux is not zero along such boundaries in most of the previous models. In the present paper, a model has been developed, which has the capability of controlling tangential heat flux along the constant-temperature boundaries. It aims to set the heat flux nearly zero along the boundary in midplane grid schemes.
