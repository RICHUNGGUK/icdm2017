Orthogonalization of block variables is introduced to deal with the problem of variable selection. Projections based on least squares are used to construct the modeling space in order to search for the best regression directions for chemical modeling. A suitable prediction space for such a model is further defined to confine the usage range of the model. Three real data sets were analyzed to check the performance of the proposed modeling method. The results obtained from Monte-Carlo cross-validation (MCCV) showed that the proposed modeling method might provide better results for QSAR and QSPR modeling than PCR and PLS with respect to both fitting and prediction abilities.
