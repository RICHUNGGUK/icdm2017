The measure gives an upper bound for the number of Newton steps sufficient to approximate the path discretely starting from one end and thus produce an approximate zero for the endpoint. This motivates the study of short paths or geodesics in the condition metric.", "paper_title": "Complexity of Bezout's Theorem VI: Geodesics in the Condition (Number) Metric", "paper_id": "WOS:000264479700002"}
