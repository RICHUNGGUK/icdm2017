In the Closest Substring problem k strings s(1),..., s(k) are given, and the task is to find a string s of length L such that each string si has a consecutive substring of length L whose distance is at most d from s. We present two algorithms that aim to be efficient for small fixed values of d and k: for some functions f and g, the algorithms have running time f(d) center dot n(O(log d)) and g(d, k) center dot n(O(log log k)), respectively. The second algorithm is based on connections with the extremal combinatorics of hypergraphs. The Closest Substring problem is also investigated from the parameterized complexity point of view. Answering an open question from [P. A. Evans, A. D. Smith, and H. T. Wareham, Theoret. Comput. Sci., 306 (2003), pp. 407-430, M. R. Fellows, J. Gramm, and R.

Rossmanith, Algorithmica, 37 (2003), pp. 25-42], we show that the problem is W[1]-hard even if both d and k are parameters. It follows as a consequence of this hardness result that our algorithms are optimal in the sense that the exponent of n in the running time cannot be improved to o(log d) or to o(log log k) (modulo some complexity-theoretic assumptions). Consensus Patterns is the variant of the problem where, instead of the requirement that each s(i) has a substring that is of distance at most d from s, we have to select the substrings in such a way that the average of these k distances is at most delta. By giving an f(delta) center dot n(9) time algorithm, we show that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable. This answers an open question from [M. R. Fellows, J. Gramm, and R.
