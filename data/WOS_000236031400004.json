The combination of FDM signals in the digital domain has several advantages over analog approaches. We show what DAC specifications are needed to build such systems and explain important limiting factors. Special attention is given to the multi-channel generation issues. This reveals that in some cases the DAC specifications are less stringent than what is generally expected.", "paper_title": "Application of high-speed, high-accuracy dacs for generation of multiple channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000236031400004"}
