This approach is illustrated on the primate mitochondrial DNA sequences for 11 different species. Analysis shows an overall qualitative agreement among the three similarity matrices of the primate mitochondrial DNA sequences for 11 different species. We also construct the dendrogram tree for primate mitochondrial DNA sequences. The phylogeny obtained is generally consistent with evolutionary trees constructed in previous studies.", "paper_title": "A simple method to construct the similarity matrices of DNA sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200005"}
