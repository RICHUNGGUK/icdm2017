Linear algebra over this semiring can be developed in the usual way. We observe that any problem of the max-Lukasiewicz linear algebra can be equivalently formulated as a problem of the tropical (max-plus) linear algebra. Based on this equivalence, we develop a theory of the matrix powers and the eigenproblem over the max-Lukasiewicz semiring. (C) 2014 The Authors.
