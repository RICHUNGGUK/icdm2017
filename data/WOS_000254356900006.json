In this paper, we describe the method for an analysis and further subsequent optimization of complex transportation System safety and reliability based on their complex sensitivity investigation. Reasonable applications of this theoretical tool can also be used for improvement of complex transportation system resistance against terrorist activities.", "paper_title": "Operation safety and reliability improvement of large transport systems by complex sensitivity investigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000254356900006"}
