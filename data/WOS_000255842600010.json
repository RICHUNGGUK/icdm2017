This approach is different from the queue theory, which is a main method to design some railway subsystems in the literature. With some simple assumptions, we solve the corresponding master equation describing the train aggregation behavior. Using the least square trigonometric approximation, we construct a continuous rate function for a real example, and show the evolution of the size of train cluster with time. Also the variance and relative error of the train aggregation are calculated.", "paper_title": "Train aggregation in a railway subsystem by markov approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000255842600010"}
