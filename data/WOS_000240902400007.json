In case of a failure, the time to recovery is an important metric, since the amount of lost information and the performance of carried application strongly depends on the time of service interruption. Moreover, as the current trend in network development is moving toward a unified solution providing support for voice, data and various multimedia services, different application and users may tolerate different time of service interruption. Therefore, it is imperative to provide recovery-time guaranteed connections in WDM optical networks. In this paper, we propose a new shared-segment protection algorithm, called AGBSP-QoP, to provision connection requests according to their differentiated recovery-time requirements. Given a working path, AGBSP-QoP first computes all possible recovery-time guaranteed working-backup segment pairs, and then dynamically selects a least-cost eligible subset based on a dexterously constructed auxiliary graph. We conduct simulations under single class of service and multiple classes of service, and compare AGBSP-QoP with other protection algorithms. The results show that AGBSP-QoP yields the best performance and can properly provision connection requests according to their differentiated recovery-time requirements.", "paper_title": "Connection provisioning with guaranteed recovery time in survivable WDM optical networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240902400007"}
