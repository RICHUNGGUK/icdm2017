By using fixed point technic, we prove an existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium point for the interval general BAM neural networks with delays. By using a proper Lyapunov functions, we get a sufficient condition to ensure the global robust exponential stability for the interval general BAM neural networks with delays, and we just require that activation function is globally Lipschitz continuous, which is less conservative and less restrictive than the monotonic assumption in previous results. In the last section, we also give an example to demonstrate the validity of our stability result for interval neural networks with delays.", "paper_title": "Global robust exponential stability of interval general BAM neural network with delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000236499700005"}
