In order to account for a case in which no augmented matrix is introduced, the control law is designed as a compound form of feedback and feedforward, and the gains of feedback and feedforward are solved by LMI (Linear Matrix Inequalities). The strategy is applied to the anti-interference control of NSV attitudes, and the convergence of tracking errors is analyzed according to the Lyapunov method. Simulation results based on the NSV demonstrate the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Robust adaptive fuzzy control design for nearspace vehicle", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200024"}
