To realize MDO, Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) is adopted with the aim of achieving design reuse and automation. The aim of the ongoing research at Linkoping University is to shift from manual modeling of disposable geometries to Computer Aided Design (CAD) automation by introducing generic high level geometry templates. Instead of repeatedly modeling similar instances of objects, engineers should be able to create more general models that can represent entire classes of objects. The proposed methodology enables utilization of commercial design tools, hence taking industrial feasibility into consideration. The concept of High Level CAD templates (HLCt) will be proposed and discussed as the building blocks of flexible and robust CAD models, which in turn enables high fidelity geometry in the MDO loop. Furthermore, quantification of the terms flexibility and robustness are presented, providing a means to measure the quality of the geometry models. Finally, application examples are presented in which the outlined framework is evaluated. The applications have been chosen from three ongoing research projects aimed at automating the design of transport aircraft, industrial robots, and micro air vehicles. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
