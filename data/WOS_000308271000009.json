The procedure is based on rearranging the conic projection equations such that the non linear terms are eliminated. It works with any kind of conic and does not require that the shape of the conic is known a-priori. The method was extensively tested using ellipses, but it can also be used for hyperbolas and parabolas. It was further applied to pairs of lines, which can be viewed as a degenerate case of hyperbola, without requiring the correspondence problem to be solved first. Critical configurations and numerical stability have been analyzed through simulations. The accuracy of the proposed algorithm was compared to that of traditional algorithms and of a trinocular vision system using a set of landmarks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
