One way to mitigate the risk of change propagation is to impose a design freeze on components at some point prior to completion of the process. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model-driven approach to optimal freeze sequence identification based on change propagation risk. Design/methodology/approach - A dynamic Bayesian network was used to represent the change propagation process within a system. According to the model, when a freeze decision is made with respect to a component, a probabilistic inference algorithm within the Bayesian network updates the uncertain state of each component. Based on this mechanism, a set of algorithm was developed to derive optimal freeze sequence. Findings - The authors derived the optimal freeze sequence of a helicopter design project from real product development process. The experimental result showed that our proposed method can significantly improve the effectiveness of freeze sequencing compared with arbitrary freeze sequencing. Originality/value - The methodology identifies the optimal sequence for resolution of entire-system uncertainty in the most effective manner. This mechanism, in progressively updating the state of each component, enables an analyzer to continuously evaluate the effectiveness of the freeze sequence.", "paper_title": "Design freeze sequencing using Bayesian network framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000360575300002"}
