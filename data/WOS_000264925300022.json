We first present and show a time scale version of the Bellman optimality principle. On this basis, using a chain rule of multivariables on timescales, we will derive Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations on a timescale for these kind of optimal control problems. Finally, the quantum timescale is considered as an example to illustrate our results. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
