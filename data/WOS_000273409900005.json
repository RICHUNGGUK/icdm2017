The current software designed to deploy job tasks uses forecasts of the target computers' future load profiles. Once the job task's future load profile is known, converting it to its cost profile needs further analysis as the cost depends on other factors such as its delays and variable background loads. This paper introduces a new charging mechanism for charging future job tasks, called the Cost Profiling Model. The model has been implemented in a Software Framework and evaluated for its prediction accuracy.
