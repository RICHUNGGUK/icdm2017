When there is no direct link between the source and the destination, an amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol that allows both the destination and the source to jam the eavesdropper is shown to achieve secrecy rates that grow linearly with the transmit power in dB, even if all the legitimate nodes have strictly fewer antennas than the eavesdropper. The number of achievable secure degrees of freedom is quantified and shown to match an upper bound when the number of antennas at the destination is sufficiently large. However, in the presence of a direct link between source and destination, this scaling rule no longer applies. The bottleneck of the AF scheme in the presence of a direct source-destination link is identified, motivating the use of another AF scheme and a novel compress-and-forward protocol that can achieve a positive number of secure degrees of freedom using an insecure feedback link.", "paper_title": "On the Secure Degrees of Freedom of Relaying With Half-Duplex Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000285842100020"}
