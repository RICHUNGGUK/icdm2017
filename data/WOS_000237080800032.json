Multi-agent based Distributed Intelligent Network Management model (MDINM) for the large-scale computer network, which utilizes key characteristics of the agent, such as autonomy, reactivity, and mobility, is put forward in this paper. This model can not only avoid transmitting a large amount of original data on the network to realize the distributed network management but also provides network management with more intelligence by realizing the dynamic self-management for the network. The experimental results show that MDINM is better than the existing network management solutions on performance for the large-scale computer network.", "paper_title": "Distributed intelligent network management model for the large-scale computer network", "paper_id": "WOS:000237080800032"}
