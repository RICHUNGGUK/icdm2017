We show that for any bridge-addable, monotone class A whose elements have vertex set {1, . . ., n}, the probability that a graph chosen uniformly at random from A is connected is at least (1 -0(n)(1)) e (1/2), where 0(n)(1) -> 0 as n -> infinity. This establishes the special case of the conjecture of McDiarmid, Steger and Welsh when the condition of monotonicity is added. This result has also been obtained independently by Kang and Panagiotou.", "paper_title": "Connectivity for Bridge-Addable Monotone Graph Classes", "paper_id": "WOS:000309680500001"}
