To compromise between diversity gain and multiple access interference (MAI), we propose an adaptive fuzzy inference system to infer adequate 2-D spreading factors and to assign the orthogonal variable spreading factor (OVSF) codes to active users for OFCDM mobile communication systems. Simulation results show that the proposed fuzzy-based code allocation (FBCA) scheme not only suppresses the MAIs induced by non-orthogonality but also exploit the diversity gain over time and frequency selective fading channels and then outperforms the orthogonal code allocation (OCA) scheme at all system loads.", "paper_title": "Performance of a Novel Fuzzy-Based Code Allocator for Two-Dimensional Spreading OFCDM Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000262693400002"}
