This evolution reveals missing blocks of the current Internet Protocol architecture, in particular in terms of virtual machine mobility management for addressing and locator-identifier mapping. In this paper, we propose some changes to the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) to cope with this gap. We define novel control-plane functions and evaluate them exhaustively in the worldwide public LISP testbed, involving five LISP sites distant from a few hundred kilometers to many thousands kilometers. Our results show that we can guarantee service downtime upon live virtual machine migration lower than a second across American, Asian and European LISP sites, and down to 300 ms within Europe, outperforming standard LISP and legacy triangular routing approaches in terms of service downtime, as a function of datacenter-datacenter and client-datacenter distances.", "paper_title": "Achieving Sub-Second Downtimes in Large-Scale Virtual Machine Migrations with LISP", "paper_id": "WOS:000209724400001"}
