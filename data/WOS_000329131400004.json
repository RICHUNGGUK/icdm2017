Existing techniques are less appropriate for large iteration spaces with increased numbers of irregularly spread holes. They either have to approximate the accessed regions, leading to overestimation of the final resources, or they require prohibited exploration time to find the storage size. In this work, we present a near-optimal and scalable methodology for storage-size, intrasignal, in-place optimization, that is, to compute the minimum amount of resources required to store the elements of a group (array), for irregular complex access schemes in the target domain of non-overlapping store and load accesses.", "paper_title": "Near-Optimal and Scalable Intrasignal In-Place Optimization for Non-Overlapping and Irregular Access Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000329131400004"}
