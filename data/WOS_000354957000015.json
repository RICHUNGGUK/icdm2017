A novel coupling scheme is introduced, in a general topological structure described by a directed or undirected graph, with a linear diffusive term and discontinuous sign term. Several criteria are derived based on the Lyapunov stability theory to ascertain the global exponential stability of synchronization manifold in the coupling scheme. Simulation results for several examples are given to substantiate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Global Exponential Synchronization of Multiple Memristive Neural Networks With Time Delay via Nonlinear Coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000354957000015"}
