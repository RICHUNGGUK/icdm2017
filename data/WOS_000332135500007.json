Design/methodology/approach - An improved PSO algorithm is designed. hhc Findings - The improved PSO method is an efficient and robust global optimizer for minimizing the SLL and placing null at arbitrary angles of a nonlinear antenna array. Originality/value - Some improvements, such as the design of some new formulae for both position and velocity updating, the introduction of an age variable, and the devise of an intensification searches using the cross entropy method, are proposed.", "paper_title": "Minimizing sidelobe levels and facilitating null placements of nonlinear antenna arrays using an improved particle swarm optimization method", "paper_id": "WOS:000332135500007"}
