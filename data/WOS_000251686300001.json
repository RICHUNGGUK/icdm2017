These services are no longer confined to the wired domain and are being extended over wireless networks. Although some of the existing wireless technologies can support some low-bandwidth applications, the bandwidth demands of many multimedia applications exceed the capacity of these technologies. The IEEE 802.16-based WiMax promises to be one of the wireless access technologies capable of supporting very high bandwidth applications. In this paper, we exploit the rich set of flexible features offered at the medium access control (MAC) layer of WiMax for the construction and transmission of MAC protocol data units (MPDUs) for supporting multiple VoIP streams. We study the quality of VoIP calls, usually given by R-score, with respect to the delay and loss of packets. We observe that loss is more sensitive than delay; hence, we compromise the delay performance within acceptable limits in order to achieve a lower packet loss rate. Through a combination of techniques like forward error correction, automatic repeat request, MPDU aggregation, and minislot allocation, we strike a balance between the desired delay and loss. Simulation experiments are conducted to test the performance of the proposed mechanisms. We assume a three-state Markovian channel model and study the performance with and without retransmissions. We show that the feedback-based technique coupled with retransmissions, aggregation, and variable length MPDUs are effective and increase the R-score and mean opinion score by about 40 percent.", "paper_title": "Improving quality of VoIP streams over WiMax", "paper_id": "WOS:000251686300001"}
