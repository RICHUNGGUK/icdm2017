When the network operates in a multi-hop fashion, the position of the PAN coordinator has a significant impact on the performance: it strongly affects network energy consumption for both topology formation and data routing. The development of efficient self-managing, self-configuring and self-regulating protocols for the election of the node that coordinates and manages the IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee WSN is still an open research issue. In this paper we present a cross-layer approach to address the problem of PAN coordinator election on topologies formed in accordance with the IEEE 802.15.4. Our solution combines the network formation procedure defined at the MAC layer by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard with a topology reconfiguration algorithm operating at the network layer. We propose a standard-compliant procedure (named PAN coordinator ELection - PANEL) to self-configure a IEEE 802.15.4/ZigBee WSN by electing, in a distributed way, a suitable PAN coordinator. A protocol implementing this solution in IEEE 802.15.4 is also provided. Performance results show that our cross-layer approach minimizes the average number of hops between the nodes of the network and the PAN coordinator allowing to reduce the data transfer delay and determining significant energy savings compared with the performance of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard.
