The use of a multiple time-scale integration scheme then allows the filtered pseudofermions to be evolved using a coarse step size. The algorithm is applied to N-f = 2 flavour simulations at two different quark masses. Polynomial filtering yields a reduction in the computational expense of the molecular dynamics integration of between three- and fivefold when compared to standard HMC. Significantly, the observed speedup is better at the lower quark mass. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.
