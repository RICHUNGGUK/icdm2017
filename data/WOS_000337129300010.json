Using this approach, it proposes MOEA/D-M2M, a new version of multiobjective optimization evolutionary algorithm-based decomposition. This proposed algorithm solves these subproblems in a collaborative way. Each subproblem has its own population and receives computational effort at each generation. In such a way, population diversity can be maintained, which is critical for solving some MOPs. Experimental studies have been conducted to compare MOEA/D-M2M with classic MOEA/D and NSGA-II. This letter argues that population diversity is more important than convergence in multiobjective evolutionary algorithms for dealing with some MOPs. It also explains why MOEA/D-M2M performs better.", "paper_title": "Decomposition of a Multiobjective Optimization Problem into a Number of Simple Multiobjective Subproblems", "paper_id": "WOS:000337129300010"}
