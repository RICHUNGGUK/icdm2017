EHW can adapt itself to unknown environment based on features of the reconfigurable hardware. This paper presents outlines of the idea of using some EHW agents in a distributed system. These agents need to set up a self-organized communication to achieve the predesigned goal. The experiment that is demonstrated during the presentation, is to distribute a serial adder into two EHW parts, where good results has been shown in a co-evolutionary process.", "paper_title": "Co-evolution for communication: An EHW approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000253616000010"}
