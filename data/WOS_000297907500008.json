The proposed technique accounts for structure's flexibility, soil flexibility, varying water levels and various boundary conditions. Simplified procedures are developed for practical assessment of the vibration periods, hydrodynamic loads and seismic response of structure-water systems including higher mode effects. The efficiency of the proposed techniques is validated through examples of structure-water systems with different configurations. We show that the proposed methods give excellent results when compared to more advanced finite element solutions including fluid-structure interaction capabilities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
