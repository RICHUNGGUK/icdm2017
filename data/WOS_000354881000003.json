Fuzzy logic systems are utilized to approximate the unknown nonlinear functions, and a new adaptive fuzzy tracking control technique for the problem under study is set up. Based on the technique above, we design a switching law and construct adaptive fuzzy controllers of subsystems explicitly by a recursive design algorithm to guarantee that all the signals in the resulting closed-loop system remain bounded and the system output of the closed-loop system converges to a small neighborhood of the reference signal. Multiple Lyapunov functions are exploited to get out of the conservativeness caused by adoption of a common Lyapunov function for all subsystems, which is commonly required when applying the backstepping-like recursive design scheme. A mass-spring-damper system is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
