Substream weighting, where the weights determine the prioritization order, can be important in multiple-input multiple-output interference channels. In this letter, a distributed algorithm is proposed for the problem of power minimization subject to weighted SINR constraint. The algorithm is based on two basic features, the well-known distributed power control algorithm by Yates in 1995 and a simple linear search to find feasible SINR targets. The power control law used in the proposed algorithm is proven to linearly converge to a unique fixed point.", "paper_title": "Balancing Weighted Substreams in MIMO Interference Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000209681600017"}
