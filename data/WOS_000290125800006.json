An outerplanar graph is represented by a plane embedding such that all vertices appear along its outer boundary. Two different plane embeddings of a rooted outerplanar graphs are called symmetric copies. Given integers n >= 3 and g >= 3, we give an O(n)-space and O(1)-time delay algorithm that generates all biconnected rooted outerplanar graphs with exactly n vertices such that the size of each inner face is at most g without delivering two symmetric copies of the same graph.", "paper_title": "Generation of Symmetric and Asymmetric Biconnected Rooted Outerplanar Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000290125800006"}
