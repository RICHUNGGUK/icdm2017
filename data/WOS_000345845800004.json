In this paper, the hardware requirements of the adaptive digital coherent transceivers are studied. Challenges and solutions for power-efficient implementation of the electro-optical front-end and digital signal processor are investigated. Different power-saving modes are also presented.", "paper_title": "Power-Efficiency Considerations for Adaptive Long-Haul Optical Transceivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000345845800004"}
