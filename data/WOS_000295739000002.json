They wish to use their respective strings to extract a common sequence of random bits with high probability but without communicating. How many such bits can they extract? The trivial strategy of outputting the first bits yields an agreement probability of (1 - epsilon)(k) < 2(-1.44k epsilon), where is the amount of noise. We show that no strategy can achieve agreement probability better than 2(-k epsilon/(1-epsilon)). On the other hand, we show that when k >= 10 + 2(1 - epsilon)/epsilon there exists a strategy which achieves an agreement probability of 0.003(k epsilon)(-1/2) . 2(-k epsilon/(1-epsilon)).", "paper_title": "On Extracting Common Random Bits From Correlated Sources", "paper_id": "WOS:000295739000002"}
