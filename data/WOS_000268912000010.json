From the quantitative observations of a particular trajectory (motion), the model is used to determine the moment of the forces produced by the muscles about each joint. These forces are evaluated according to the continuous system of equations of motion. An inverse dynamics analysis is performed in order to predict the joint torques developed by the muscles during the execution of the task. An elementary multibody mechanical system is used as an example to discuss the assumptions and procedures adopted.", "paper_title": "An analytical model for the ergometer rowing: inverse multibody dynamics analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000268912000010"}
