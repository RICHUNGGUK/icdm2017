Browsers support revisits with various tools, including bookmarks, history views and URL auto-completion. However, these tools only support revisits to a small number of frequently and recently visited pages. Several browser plugins and extensions have been proposed to better support the long tail of less frequently visited pages, using recommendation and prediction techniques. In this article, we present a systematic overview of revisitation prediction techniques, distinguishing them into two main types and several subtypes. We also explain how the individual prediction techniques can be combined into comprehensive revisitation workflows that achieve higher accuracy. We investigate the performance of the most important workflows and provide a statistical analysis of the factors that affect their predictive accuracy. Further, we provide an upper bound for the accuracy of revisitation prediction using an 'oracle' that discards non-revisited pages.", "paper_title": "Methods for web revisitation prediction: survey and experimentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000365413100001"}
