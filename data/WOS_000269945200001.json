The proposed algorithm achieves the decoupling of the lateral and yaw motion of a vehicle and the vehicle's yaw damping simultaneously by the feedback of both yaw rate and front steering angle. A trade-off is then made between the robust decoupling and yaw rate damping through the adjustment of the feedback gains with respect to vehicle speed. With this trade-off, the gain scheduled steering controller provides the desired yaw rate damping while keeping the yaw-lateral motion decoupled. The robustness of the yaw-lateral decoupling is achievable when arbitrary yaw damping is not required. The proposed control system is implemented on a steer-by-wire vehicle, and the experimental results are presented illustrating the benefits. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
