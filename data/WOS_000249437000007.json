The ontological framework presented here helps formalize learning object context as a complex interplay of different learning-related elements and shows how we can use semantic annotation to interrelate diverse learning artifacts. On top of this framework, the authors implemented several feedback channels for educators to improve the delivery of future Web-based courses.", "paper_title": "Using semantic web technologies to analyze learning content", "paper_id": "WOS:000249437000007"}
