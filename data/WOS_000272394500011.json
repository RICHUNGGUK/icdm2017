This technique is based on a multi-resolution layer to perform image restoration, and mainly utilizes the geometrical flow of the neighboring texture of the damaged regions as the basis of restoration. By performing the warp transform with geometrical flows, it transforms the textural variation into the nearing domain axis utilizing the bandelet decomposition method to decompose the non-relative textures into different bands, and then combines them with the affine search method to perform image restoration. The experimental results show that the proposed method can simplify the complexity of the repair decision method and improve the quality of HVS, and thus, repaired results to contain the image of contour of high change, and in addition, offer a texture image of high-frequency variation. These repair results can lead to state-of-the-art results.", "paper_title": "A Novel Bandelet-Based Image Inpainting", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500011"}
