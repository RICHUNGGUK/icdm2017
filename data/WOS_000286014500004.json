It serves official lists of earthquakes, stations and waveform data collected from various South Eastern European (SEE) countries. SDSAS contains three main components: (i) bash scripts to collect and to organize the seismic data by utilizing storage elements, LFC and metadata catalogue AMGA, (ii) C++ iterators that could be used by applications to access station data, earthquake data and information about seismic waveform files collected from regional SEE countries and (iii) a web services client in the form of C++ iterators to interface to comprehensive European seismology data from the ORFEUS datacenter. The client for the ORFEUS data is developed using the web services provided by the NERIES project. We provide usage examples for seismology data iterators and present various timings obtained from workflows that use SDSAS waveform objects.", "paper_title": "Seismic data server application service for SEEGRID seismology virtual organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000286014500004"}
