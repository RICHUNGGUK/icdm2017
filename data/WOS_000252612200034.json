This is done by finding the characteristic function of the decision variable and subsequently applying the Gil-Pelaez theorem to obtain a one-dimensional real integral. The integral is then converted to a contour integral which is evaluated using a variant of the Cauchy's integral formula to obtain an expression for E[Q(parallel to X parallel to)], where E parallel to is the expectation operator.", "paper_title": "Averaging Q(parallel to X parallel to) for a complex circularly Gaussian random vector X: A novel approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000252612200034"}
