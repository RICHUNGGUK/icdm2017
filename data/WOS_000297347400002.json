However, in existing algorithms, it is assumed that the mobility parameters of the networks are fixed, while they are stochastic and vary with time indeed. Therefore, the proposed clustering algorithms do not scale well in realistic MANETs, where the mobility parameters of the hosts freely and randomly change at any time. Finding the optimal solution to the cluster formation problem is incredibly difficult, if we assume that the movement direction and mobility speed of the hosts are random variables. This becomes harder when the probability distribution function of these random variables is assumed to be unknown. In this paper, we propose a learning automata-based weighted cluster formation algorithm called MCFA in which the mobility parameters of the hosts are assumed to be random variables with unknown distributions. In the proposed clustering algorithm, the expected relative mobility of each host with respect to all its neighbors is estimated by sampling its mobility parameters in various epochs. MCFA is a fully distributed algorithm in which each mobile independently chooses the neighboring host with the minimum expected relative mobility as its cluster-head. This is done based solely on the local information each host receives from its neighbors and the hosts need not to be synchronized. The experimental results show the superiority of MCFA over the best existing mobility-based clustering algorithms in terms of the number of clusters, cluster lifetime, reaffiliation rate, and control message overhead.", "paper_title": "A mobility-based cluster formation algorithm for wireless mobile ad-hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000297347400002"}
