Power oscillation is the result of dynamic interaction between generating units and/or loads in a power system, which results in increased losses, power quality degradation, and momentary overloading of the converters used in converter-based grid-connected microsources (MSs) in MGs. Designing an MS controller to mitigate these oscillations is not straightforward as other performance criteria may need to be compromised. The proposed structure employs a small series compensator to mitigate the oscillations. In this paper, the dependence of power/frequency variation is analytically shown. It is explained how by introduction of a series voltage, this dependence can be minimized. The derivation of the small-signal model used for eigenvalue analysis is briefly explained. To validate the modeling and show the performance and robustness of the proposed controller, time-domain simulations are used. Discussions on the size of the proposed compensator and also on using different control parameters are presented.", "paper_title": "Application of Integrated Series Compensator in Damping Power Oscillations in Standalone Microgrids", "paper_id": "WOS:000352308100001"}
