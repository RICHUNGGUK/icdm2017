The RF-MEMS LNA has a measured gain of 10.2-15.6 dB and 1.3-8.2 dB at 79-96 GHz when the Dicke switch is switched ON and OFF, respectively. Compared with the three-stage LNA used in this design the measured in-band noise figure (NF) of MEMS switched LNA is minimum 1.6 dB higher. To the authors' knowledge, the experimental results represent a first time demonstration of a W-band MEMS switched LNA monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) in a GaAs foundry process with a minimum NF of 5 dB. The proposed novel integration of such MEMS switched MMICs can enable more cost-effective ways to realize high-performance single-chip mm-wave reconfigurable radiometer front-ends for space and security applications, for example.
