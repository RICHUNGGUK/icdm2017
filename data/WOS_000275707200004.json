We consider the limitations and problems of classic portfolio analysis approach and resolve these problems by using fuzzy set theory. In the proposed method, both internal and external factors are evaluated in linguistic terms and in terms of fuzzy triangular numbers. The fuzzy numbers are fed into an industry attractiveness-business analysis matrix. The novelty of the proposed approach comes from the fact that fuzzy numbers are processed without using conventional methods, allowing for strategies to be ranked. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
