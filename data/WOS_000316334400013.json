The formulation of this new model is different from the original PSVM model, so a novel iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this model. A simulation test is first implemented on a classic two-spiral dataset, and then an empirical experiment is conducted on two publicly available credit datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed total least squares PSVM (TLS-PSVM) is at least comparable with PSVM and better than other models including standard SVM model.", "paper_title": "A total least squares proximal support vector classifier for credit risk evaluation", "paper_id": "WOS:000316334400013"}
