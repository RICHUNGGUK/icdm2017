A distributed power control scheme based on multiple power levels is proposed for medium and high rate applications. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can provide noticeable throughput improvement. This improvement is more significant in the cases of fading channels.", "paper_title": "Coded Random Access with Distributed Power Control and Multiple-Packet Reception", "paper_id": "WOS:000373740000002"}
