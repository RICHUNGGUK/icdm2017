CyberGIS Gateway is a key modality in the CyberGIS software environment. Scalable gateway application integration has been the focus of CyberGIS Gateway in order to efficiently develop highly interactive online geographic information systems (GIS) user interface components and couple a rich collection of heterogeneous and distributed geospatial data and analytical services for advanced cyberGIS capabilities on advanced cyberinfrastructure. An open mashup and service API approach is developed to address the integration challenges in CyberGIS Gateway application development. This approach is applied and evaluated in developing several representative cyberGIS data and analytical applications. The experience gained from the integration practice is shared. The education and outreach activities in CyberGIS Gateway are presented to illustrate the impact of CyberGIS Gateway in GIScience communities and the effective collaboration within the science gateway community.
