The LFSR instructions can sustain di r erent operation data widths, di r erent operating models. Instruction- level parallelism based on VLIW system structure and instruction inner parallelism by operating several steps at one time are exploited too. Corresponding reconfigurable hardware units to sustain the implementation of each instruction forcefully by configurating is also developed. The circuit can be used as an important accelerated unit in special processing for stream cipher.", "paper_title": "DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CONFIGURABLE LFSR INSTRUCTIONS TARGETED AT STREAM CIPHER PROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000209245200018"}
