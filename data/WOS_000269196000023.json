However, there still lacks a common implementation allowing one to freely combine these independent features, so as to test their ability to jointly improve phylogenetic and dating accuracy. Results: We propose a software package, PhyloBayes 3, which can be used for conducting Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular dating analyses, using a large variety of amino acid replacement and nucleotide substitution models, including empirical mixtures or non-parametric models, as well as alternative clock relaxation processes.", "paper_title": "PhyloBayes 3: a Bayesian software package for phylogenetic reconstruction and molecular dating", "paper_id": "WOS:000269196000023"}
