Both correlated sources communicate information about their observations to the FC through all orthogonal multiple access channel (MAC) without cooperating with each other. First, we characterize the optimal tradeoff source between the transmission cost, that is, power, and the distortion D. Then, we consider a joint optimization of coding and power scheduling from an information theory perspective, where the power scheduling is verified using Shannon capacity formula and the source-coding problem is analyzed using rate-distortion theory. We show that the joint optimization in the Gaussian one-helper problem can be solved analytically. We provide closed-form expressions for the optimal distortion and the optimal power scheduling in terms of the cost weights.
