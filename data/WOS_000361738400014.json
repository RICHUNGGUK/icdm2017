On the other hand, it is known that fitness assignment has a marked impact on the performance of evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm (EMOA). In this paper, a hybrid EMOA is proposed, which divides the population into several smaller subpopulations according to their distribution in the objective space. Each subpopulation is evolved by an individual EMOA, and a hybrid performance measure estimates the performance of these EMOAs. We focus on the fitness assignment and assume that all EMOAs used in the subpopulations adopt the same recombination operator. To evaluate performance of the proposed algorithm, we compare it with MOEA/D-M2M, MOE-A/D, SMS-EMOA and NSGA-II on 16 test instances. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than or similar to those compared EMOAs.", "paper_title": "A hybrid evolutionary multiobjective optimization algorithm with adaptive multi-fitness assignment", "paper_id": "WOS:000361738400014"}
