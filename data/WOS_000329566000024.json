We also relate the subtractive equations to the open problem of the order-incompleteness of lambda-calculus, by studying the connection between the notion of absolute unorderability in a specific point and a weaker notion of subtractivity (namely n-subtractivity) for partially ordered algebras. Finally we study the relation between n-subtractivity and relativized separation conditions in topological algebras, obtaining an incompleteness theorem for a general topological semantics of lambda-calculus.", "paper_title": "ORDERED MODELS OF THE LAMBDA CALCULS", "paper_id": "WOS:000329566000024"}
