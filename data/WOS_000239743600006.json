The findings show that if a capacitance is present at the source node of the differential pair, two phenomena occur that increase the phase noise: the switch time increases, lengthening the interval spent in a noisy balanced state and increasing the transistor noise excess factor; and at higher frequencies the unbalanced state starts to contribute phase noise. The analysis is based upon the superposition of piecewise linear equations using the EKV transistor model, which includes a concise formulation of the noise excess factor.", "paper_title": "Full oscillation cycle phase noise analysis of differential CMOS LC oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000239743600006"}
