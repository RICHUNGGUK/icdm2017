It has the advantage of flexibility in handling complicated geometry, h-p adaptivity, and efficiency of parallel implementation and has been used successfully in many applications. However, the limiters used to control spurious oscillations in the presence of strong shocks are less robust than the strategies of essentially non-oscillatory (ENO) and weighted ENO (WENO) finite volume and finite difference methods. In this paper, we investigated RKLDG methods with WENO and Hermite WENO (HWENO) limiters for solving convection-diffusion equations on unstructured meshes, with the goal of obtaining a robust and high order limiting procedure to simultaneously obtain uniform high order accuracy and sharp, non-oscillatory shock transition. Numerical results are provided to illustrate the behavior of these procedures. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
