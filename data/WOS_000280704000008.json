In addition, in previous research on power-aware routing protocols, the path bandwidth was often not considered. In this paper, we tackle these issues by proposing a power-aware routing protocol with low route requests (LRR) to find a path with high path bandwidth. By making a low number of routing requests (RREQs), mobile nodes help to broadcast the routing request only when they first receive the routing requests. In addition, based on the receipt of the routing requests from the neighboring nodes, mobile nodes record the location information of its one-hop neighboring nodes. In the path-reply phase, mobile nodes in the found path use the collected location information of their neighbors and our proposed relay model to modify the found path so that the found path has high bandwidth. In our simulation, we compared our proposed routing protocol (LRR) with ad hoc on-demand distance vector, dynamic source routing and min-max battery capacity routing in terms of the following: power consumption in the path-discovery phase and the path-reply phase, bandwidth of the found path, power consumed during data transmission and overall power consumption. In addition, we compared our two proposed routing protocols, the minimum power consumption routing protocol that selects one path with minimum transmission power from all paths and the LRR routing protocol, in terms of the following: the power consumption in the path-discovery phase, the path bandwidth and the overall power consumption. From the simulation results and the analysis, we can see that the proposed LRR routing protocol that uses a low number of routing requests and our proposed relay model to improve path bandwidth can efficiently reduce the overall power consumption.", "paper_title": "A Bandwidth-Based Power-Aware Routing Protocol with Low Route Discovery Overhead in Mobile Ad hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000280704000008"}
