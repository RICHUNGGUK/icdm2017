With the help of DLL to track the input phase, the proposed circuit can recover the burst-mode data in a short acquisition time and achieve large jitter tolerance. In addition, a 2.5-GHz four-phase clock generator is embedded in the chip. Implemented with a 0.18-mu m CMOS technology, experiment shows that the acquisition time can be accomplished in the time of 31 bits. Incoming 2.5-Gb/s input data of 2(31)-1 pseudorandom binary sequence, the retimed data has a root-mean-square jitter of 8.557 ps and a peak-to-peak jitter of 32.0 ps, and the measured bit error rate is less than 10(-10). The area of the whole chip is 1.4 x 1.4 mm(2), where the BMCDR circuit core occupies 0.81 x 0.325 mm(2). The total power consumption is 130 mW from a 1.8 V supply voltage.", "paper_title": "A 2.5-Gb/s DLL-Based Burst-Mode Clock and Data Recovery Circuit With 4x Oversampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000351751400020"}
