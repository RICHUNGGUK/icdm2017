The goal of the synthesis is to find a set of parameters that defines the PM with the best performance in terms of workspace capabilities, dexterity and isotropy. The PM is parametrized in terms of a reference element, and a non-directed search of these parameters is carried out. First, the inverse kinematics and instantaneous kinematics of the mechanism are presented. The latter is found using the screw theory formulation. An algorithm that explores a bounded set of parameters and determines the corresponding value of global indexes is presented. The concepts of a novel global performance index and a compound index are introduced. Simulation results are shown and discussed. The best PMs found in terms of each performance index evaluated are locally analyzed in terms of its workspace and local dexterity. The relationship between the performance of the PM and its parameters is discussed, and a prototype with the best performance in terms of the compound index is presented and analyzed.
