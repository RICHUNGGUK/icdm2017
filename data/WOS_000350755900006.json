When the forecasts are inaccurate, control room operators use their expertise, as well as the actual generation from previous days, to estimate the amount of energy to schedule. However, this is a challenge, and it would be useful for the operators to have additional information they can exploit to make better informed decisions. In this paper, we use techniques from time series analysis to determine if there are motifs, or frequently occurring diurnal patterns in wind generation data. We compare two different representations of the data and four different ways of identifying the number of motifs. Using data from wind farms in Tehachapi Pass and mid-Columbia Basin, we describe our findings and discuss how these motifs can be used to guide scheduling decisions.", "paper_title": "Identifying and Exploiting Diurnal Motifs in Wind Generation Time Series Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000350755900006"}
