In a ring signature, instead of revealing the actual identity of the message signer, it specifies a set of possible signers. The verifier can be convinced that the signature was indeed generated by one of the ring members; however, the verifier is unable to tell which member actually produced the signature. In this paper, we first propose a generalized ring signature scheme based on the original ElGamal signature scheme. The proposed ring signature can achieve unconditional signer ambiguity and is secure against adaptive chosen-message attack in the random oracle model. Then, based on the generalized ring signature scheme, a generalized multisigner ring signature scheme is introduced to increase the level of confidence or enforce cross-organizational joint message signing. Comparing to ring signatures based on RSA algorithm, the proposed generalized ring signature scheme has three advantages: 1) all ring members can share the same prime number p and all operations can be performed in the same domain; 2) by combining with multisignatures, we can develop the generalized multisigner ring signature schemes to enforce cross-organizational involvement in message leaking. It may result in a higher level of confidence or broader coverage on the message source; 3) the proposed ring signature is convertible. It enables the actual message signer to prove to a verifier that only she is capable of generating the ring signature.", "paper_title": "Generalized ring signatures", "paper_id": "WOS:000258027100003"}
