These versions use special consistency measures to admit some inconsistent objects in the lower approximations. The minimal consistency level that has to be attained by objects included in the lower approximations is defined using a prior knowledge or a trial-and-error procedure. In order to avoid dependence on prior knowledge, an alternative way of handling inconsistencies is to iteratively eliminate the most inconsistent objects (according to some measure) until the information system becomes consistent. This idea is a base of a new method of handling inconsistencies presented in this paper and called TIPStoC. The TIPStoC algorithm is illustrated by an example from the area of telecommunication and the efficiency of the new method is proved by a computational experiment.", "paper_title": "A Novel Method for Elimination of Inconsistencies in Ordinal Classification with Monotonicity Constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000324969000006"}
