It is an important pre-processing step in many vision applications. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm, Temporal Spectral Residual, for fast motion saliency detection. Different from conventional motion saliency detection algorithms that use complex mathematical models, our goal is to find a good tradeoff between the computational efficiency and accuracy. The basic observation for salient motions is that on the cross section along the temporal axis of a video sequence, the regions of moving objects contain distinct signals while the background area contains redundant information. Thus our focus in this paper is to extract the salient information on the cross section, by utilizing the off-the-shelf method Spectral Residual, which is a 2D image saliency detection method. Majority voting strategy is also introduced to generate reliable results. Since the proposed method only involves Fourier spectrum analysis, it is computationally efficient. We validate our algorithm on two applications: background subtraction in outdoor video sequences under dynamic background and left ventricle endocardium segmentation in MR sequences. Compared with some state-of-art algorithms, our algorithm achieves both good accuracy and fast computation, which satisfies the need as a pre-processing method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
