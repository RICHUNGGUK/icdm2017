We also obtain slightly weaker results for the corresponding unweighted problems. (ii) A randomized fully-dynamic algorithm for the all-pairs shortest-paths problem in directed unweighted graphs with an amortized update time of (O) over tilde (m root n) (we use (O) over tilde to hide small poly-logarithmic factors) and a worst case query time is O(n(3/4)). (iii) A deterministic O(n(2)log n) time algorithm for constructing an O(log n)-spanner with O(n) edges for any weighted undirected graph on n vertices. The algorithm uses a simple algorithm for incrementally maintaining single-source shortest-paths tree up to a given distance.", "paper_title": "On Dynamic Shortest Paths Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000293234800008"}
