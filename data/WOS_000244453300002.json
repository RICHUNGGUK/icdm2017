A graph is 3-realizable if, for every configuration of its vertices in E-N with N >= 3, there exists a corresponding configuration in E-3 with the same edge lengths. In this paper the two graphs V-8 and C-5 x C-2 are shown to be 3-realizable. As shown by Belk and Connelly, this means that the forbidden minors for 3-realizability are K-5 and K-2,K-2,K-2.", "paper_title": "Realizability of graphs in three dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000244453300002"}
