This paper summarises previous work in this area in order to define and characterise a revolutionary SE and social-networking framework for collaborative education, design and modelling of the next generation of smarter products. A conceptual framework and practical applications of SE approaches and social networking to support smarter product development is proposed. Future challenges that collaborative SE and interactive social networking techniques are likely to face in this domain are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Collaborative systems engineering and social-networking approach to design and modelling of smarter products", "paper_id": "WOS:000287026000003"}
