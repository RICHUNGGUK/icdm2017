The feedback delay line, by itself, is limited to producing an infinite sequence of exponentially decaying echoes. We introduce a new type of linear time-invariant echo effect whose impulse response is a generalized sum of damped complex sinusoids. This permits echo responses to be shaped as simple sinusoids, Fourier-based waveforms, and many other complex, possibly nonperiodic, patterns that would not be feasible with other existing methods. Additionally, because the response is complex-valued, it can be used to produce auto-panning echo effects with many kinds of spatial trajectories. The effect is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, as it only requires a parallel combination of feedback delay lines.", "paper_title": "Echo Shaping Using Sums of Damped Complex Sinusoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000355321900004"}
