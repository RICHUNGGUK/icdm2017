Based on a local routing protocol with a navigation parameter proposed in a previous paper [W. X. Wang et al., Phys. Rev. E 73, 026111 (2006)], this paper numerically investigates the distribution of travel time for transporting data packets from the origin to the destination in complex networks, including random networks, small-world networks and scale-free networks. Numerical results show that exponential distributions of travel time with various values of exponent in complex networks are obtained. Furthermore, the different values of the exponent can also intuitively prove the previous result for the optimal local routing strategy. Finally, violations of the First-Departure-First-Arrival situation in complex networks are discussed.", "paper_title": "TRAVEL TIME DISTRIBUTION FOR NETWORK FLOWS UNDER LOCAL ROUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000293018700003"}
