The sensor-to-controller delay and controller-to-actuator delay are modeled as two continuous-time discrete states Markov chains. Based on a practical and general model of actuator faults, the faulty networked control system is modeled as a Markovian jump system with two additive random delays. By using the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional method, the sufficient conditions on stochastic stability and H(infinity) performance for the faulty networked control system are given. The corresponding controllers design methods are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Furthermore, the proposed approach is extended to uncertain networked control system with actuator faults. Finally, an illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "ROBUST H(infinity) FAULT-TOLERANT CONTROL FOR UNCERTAIN NETWORKED CONTROL SYSTEM WITH TWO ADDITIVE RANDOM DELAYS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500025"}
