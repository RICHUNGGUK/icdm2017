Basing on nonsmooth analysis and control theory, several sufficient conditions concerning global exponential lag synchronization are obtained for the proposed system. In addition, the obtained results complement and extend earlier publications on memristive or conventional neural network dynamical systems with continuous or discontinuous right-hand side. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
