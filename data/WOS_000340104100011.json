They use the change in the received signal strength (RSS) of the links due to the movements of people to infer their locations. In this paper, we consider real-time multiple target tracking with RF sensor networks. We apply radio tomographic imaging (RTI), which generates images of the change in the propagation field, as if they were frames of a video. Our RTI method uses RSS measurements on multiple frequency channels on each link, combining them with a fade level-based weighted average. We introduce methods, inspired by machine vision and adapted to the peculiarities of RTI, that enable accurate and real-time multiple target tracking. Several tests are performed in an open environment, a one-bedroom apartment, and a cluttered office environment. The results demonstrate that the system is capable of accurately tracking in real-time up to four targets in cluttered indoor environments, even when their trajectories intersect multiple times, without mis-estimating the number of targets found in the monitored area. The highest average tracking error measured in the tests is 0.45 m with two targets, 0.46 m with three targets, and 0.55 m with four targets.", "paper_title": "Multiple Target Tracking with RF Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000340104100011"}
