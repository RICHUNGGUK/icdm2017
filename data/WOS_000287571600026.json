In order to reduce the temporal and spatial redundancy more effectively, motion compensation uses variable block sizes, while directional intra-prediction investigates all available coding modes to decide the best one. When the rate-distortion (R-D) optimization technique is used, an encoder finds the coding mode having minimum R-D cost. Due to the large number of coding modes combinations, the decision process requires extremely high computation. To reduce the complexity, selective intra-prediction and optimized inter-prediction method for Standard Definition and High Definitions test sequences is proposed, when P and B pictures are analyzed. Simulation results show that the coding time is reduced more than 15% in average, depending on Quantization Parameter (QP) values, when reducing the number of intra- and inter-candidate modes. However, there is negligible loss in term signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), until bit rate values slightly fluctuate depending on QP values. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
