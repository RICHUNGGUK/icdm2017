This is important for applications in which the model needs to be colored by just a handful of colors or when no relevant image exists for texturing the model. For instance, archaeologists argue that the great Roman or Greek statues were full of color in the days of their creation, and traces of the original colors can be found. In this case, our system lets the user scribble some desired colors in various regions of the mesh. Colorization is then formulated as a constrained quadratic optimization problem, which can be readily solved. Special care is taken to avoid color bleeding between regions, through the definition of a new direction field on meshes.", "paper_title": "Mesh Colorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000306181100005"}
