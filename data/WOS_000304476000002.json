Detailed comparisons with some similar approaches for some standard benchmark functions test validity of the proposed algorithm. Besides, the proposed algorithm is used in two typical nonlinear data reconciliation problems (distilling process and extraction process) and simulation results show its efficiency in nonlinear data reconciliation problems.", "paper_title": "A Novel Real-coded Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm and Its Application in Data Reconciliation", "paper_id": "WOS:000304476000002"}
