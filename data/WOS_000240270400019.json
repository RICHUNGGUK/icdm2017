The SOV language Korean is intriguing in the sense that it displays almost all the possibilities of these dimensions. This paper shows how a typed feature structure grammar, HPSG, together with the notions of 'type hierarchy' and 'constructions', can provide a robust basis for parsing the coordination constructions found in the language. We show that this system induces robust syntactic structures as well as enriched semantic representations for real-time applications such as machine translation, which require deep processing of the phenomena concerned.", "paper_title": "Coordination structures in a typed feature structure grammar: Formalization and implementation", "paper_id": "WOS:000240270400019"}
