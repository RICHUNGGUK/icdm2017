It exploits HVS filtering to transform the image in binary domain into continuous-tone domain for watermark embedding. Then a codeword search operation converts the watermarked continuous-tone image into binary domain. The scheme is flexible for two weighting factors are involved to adjust the watermark embedding strength and the average intensity of the watermarked image. Moreover, it can be used in some applications where original continuous-tone images are not available and the halftoning method is unknown.", "paper_title": "Visible watermarking for halftone images", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840400028"}
