Owing to the vague concepts frequently represented in flow of products, this paper presents a self-valuation and visualization system by integrating the RFID technology and EPC concept to protect products from counterfeiting by the means of mobile platform. In this paper, a system architecture is proposed which is capable of integrating mobile technology and EPC-RFID applications. The implementation roadmap of such system architecture is examined and explained in the context of a case study. The aims of the system are to provide greater visibility of the product logistic flow data and to improve the anti-counterfeit process, from traditional physical identification to self-validated location-based authentication. The case study illustrates the capability, benefits and advantages of using the proposed system, particularly its support of product authentication and supply chain activities in countering the global counterfeit problems.
