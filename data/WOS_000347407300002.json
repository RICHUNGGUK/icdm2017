We describe a method for obtaining solutions for coplanar and near-coplanar cases that consist of only regular structures, independent of grid refinement. The method, referred to as Compound Wave Modification (CWM), involves removing the flux associated with non-regular structures and can be used for simulations in two-and three-dimensions because it does not require explicitly tracking an Alfven wave. For a near-coplanar case, and for grids with 2(13) points or less, we find root-square-mean-errors (RMSEs) that are as much as 6 times smaller. For the coplanar case, in which non-regular structures will exist at all levels of grid refinement for standard FVMs, the RMSE is as much as 25 times smaller. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
