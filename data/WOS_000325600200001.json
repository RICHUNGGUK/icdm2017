The use of hesitant fuzzy sets is a powerful technique for representing this type of information and has been well studied. This paper explores aggregation methods for prioritized hesitant fuzzy elements and their application on personnel evaluation. First, the generalized hesitant fuzzy prioritized weighted average (GHFPWA) and generalized hesitant fuzzy prioritized weighted geometric (GHFPWG) operators are presented. Some desirable properties of the methods are discussed and special cases are investigated in detail. Previous research has indicated that many existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators are special cases of the proposed operators. Then, a procedure and algorithm for group decision making is provided using these proposed generalized hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Finally, the group decision making method is applied to a representative personnel evaluation problem that involves a prioritization relationship over the evaluation index.
