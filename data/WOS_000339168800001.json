Current models assume that the spatial impact area, i.e., the area in which a person affects a link's RSS, has constant size. This paper shows that the spatial impact area varies considerably for each link. Data from extensive experiments are used to derive a spatial weight model that is a function of the fade level, i.e., a measure of whether a link is experiencing destructive or constructive multipath interference, and of the sign of RSS change. In addition, a measurement model is proposed which calculates for each RSS measurement the probability of a person being located inside the derived spatial impact area. An online radio tomographic imaging (RTI) system is described which uses channel diversity and the presented models. Experiments in an open indoor environment, in a typical one-bedroom apartment and in a through-wall scenario are conducted to determine the performance of the proposed system. We demonstrate that the new system is capable of localizing and tracking a person with high accuracy (<= 0.30 m) in all the environments, without the need to change the model parameters.", "paper_title": "A Fade Level-Based Spatial Model for Radio Tomographic Imaging", "paper_id": "WOS:000339168800001"}
