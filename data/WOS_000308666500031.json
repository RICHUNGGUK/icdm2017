Specifically, two major contributions are made: (i) designing two new hybrid differential evolution algorithms with better performance than the pure differential evolution algorithm that was reported to have the best performance in a recent comparative study of several metaheuristic algorithms, i.e., Arabani et al., and (ii) proposing a more realistic and efficient operational policy that leads to shorter makespan than that developed by Yu and Egbelu. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and policy are shown based on the results of testing 30 problems and several other related issues are also investigated and discussed.
