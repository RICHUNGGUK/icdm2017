We also identify the properties of identity-based encryption that are sufficient to provide the confidentiality and consistency in designated tester public-key encryption with keyword search. The anonymity and confidentiality of identity-based encryption are sufficient for achieving confidentiality of designated tester public-key encryption with keyword search, and the confidentiality of identity-based encryption is sufficient for achieving consistency of designated tester public-key encryption with keyword search. Our constructions do not need any global set-up for the public parameters. We further extend our generic method to construct designated tester identity-based encryption with keyword search, where encryption is performed under the identity of a recipient instead of a public key.
