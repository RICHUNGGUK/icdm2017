Design/methodology/approach - This accuracy improvement is achieved by selecting the integration curve as straight segments lying in the middle of the triangular finite elements. An accuracy improvement is obtained as compared with selecting the integration curve as constituted by element sides. Findings - The improved FEM-RBCI method described in this paper leads to accuracies of the numerical results which are better than those obtained by selecting the integration curve by element sides. Originality/value - The paper presents results for a simple two-dimensional structure: a dielectric circular cylinder.", "paper_title": "Improving the integral equation in the hybrid FEM-RBCI method for scalar electromagnetic scattering problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000311269800001"}
