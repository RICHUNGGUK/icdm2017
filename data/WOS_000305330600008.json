In terms of this definition, we calculate the texture's directional features using Tamura's method and study the directional probability distribution of Contourlet coefficients. Then we find that the directional features tend to be conveyed across parent and child subbands. Based on this conclusion, we establish a novel probability distribution model of hidden direction variables under the condition of hidden state variable's distribution, named Contourlet HMT model with directional feature. The structure and training method of the model are presented as well. Moreover, an unsupervised context-based image segmentation algorithm is proposed on the basis of the proposed model. Its effectiveness is verified via extensive experiments carried out on several synthesized images and remote sensing images.", "paper_title": "Contourlet HMT model with directional feature", "paper_id": "WOS:000305330600008"}
