We have been studying the distributed antenna network (DAN) and the frequency domain wireless signal processing. In DAN, many antennas or clusters of antennas are spatially distributed over a service area, and they are connected by means of optical fiber links with DAN signal processing center. A number of distributed antennas cooperatively serve mobile users using spatial multiplexing, diversity, array, or relaying technique. In this paper, the recent advances in single-carrier DAN are introduced.
