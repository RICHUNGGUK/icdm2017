Based on terminal sliding,mode control theory, a continuous finite-time controller is presented to make the substratum concentration track the reference signal in finite time. The tracking error can not only be controlled to the sliding manifold from any initial state in finite time but also converge to zero along the sliding manifold in finite time. The global finite-time stability of the tracking error system is rigorous proved. Simulation results are presented to validate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "FINITE-TIME CONTROL OF A BIOREACTOR SYSTEM USING TERMINAL SLIDING MODE", "paper_id": "WOS:000271033100020"}
