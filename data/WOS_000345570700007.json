From the perspective of ar set programs that include function symbols, recent work has identified classes for which grounding routines can terminate either on the entire program [Calimeri et al. 2008] or on suitable queries [Baselice et al. 2009]. From the perspective of tabling, it has long been known that a tabling technique called subgoal abstraction provides good termination properties for definite programs [Tamaki and Sato 1986], and this result was recently extended to stratified programs via the class of bounded term-size programs [Riguzzi and Swift 2013]. In this article, we provide a formal definition of tabling with subgoal abstraction resulting in the SLG(SA) algorithm. Moreover, we discuss a declarative characterization of the queries and programs for which SLGSA terminates. We call this class strongly bounded term-size programs and show its equivalence to programs with finite well-founded models. For normal programs, strongly bounded term-size programs strictly includes the finitely ground programs of Calimeri et al. [2008]. SLGSA has an asymptotic complexity on strongly bounded term-size programs equal to the best known and produces a residual program that can be sent to an answer set programming system. Finally, we describe the implementation of subgoal abstraction within the SLG-WAM of XSB and provide performance results.", "paper_title": "Terminating Evaluation of Logic Programs with Finite Three-Valued Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000345570700007"}
