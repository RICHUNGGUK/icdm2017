It has the potential of large displacement, low mass force generation and misalignment compensation ability during micro manipulation. These capabilities are utilized for handling of miniature parts like pegs. The analysis of IPMC micro gripper and manipulator are carried out for developing a multi micro manipulation system that can handle pegs in micro assembly operation for shifting one to another hole position in a large work space (100 mm x 100 mm). By developing a prototype, it is demonstrated that IPMC based micro grippers are capable of handling the peg-in-hole assembly tasks in a multi micro manipulation system.", "paper_title": "Development of Multi Micro Manipulation System Using IPMC Micro Grippers", "paper_id": "WOS:000336449900002"}
