However, there has been insufficient research to determine if the electro-active polymer can reliably actuate common engineering mechanisms due to its nonlinear and time-variant nature. This paper explores a model-free approach for controlling, the position of an IPMC actuated rotary linkage for micro-manipulation. The mechanism was developed based on the mechanical characteristics of the IPMC actuators. A Proportional, Integral (PI) controller was initially developed and tested to control the tip displacement of the mechanism. Test results show that this classical controller is capable of actuating the rotary mechanism to microscopic deflections but would not completely stabilise at the steady state position. An adaptive, nonlinear tuning method called Iterative Feedback Tuning (IFT) was developed to tune the performance of the PI controller. Empirical results show that the new control scheme improved the steady state response. However, the enhancement of the transient response could not be definitively validated as solely the work of the IFT algorithm due to the time-variant and variable response behaviour of IPMCs.
