To cope with this problem, the paper presents an approach for ranking documents in IR, based on a vector-based ordering technique already considered in fuzzy logic for multiple criteria analysis purpose. Moreover, the proposed approach uses a possibilistic framework for evaluating queries to a document collection, which distinguishes between descriptors that are certainly relevant and those which are possibly relevant only. The proposal is evaluated on a benchmark collection that allows us to compare the effectiveness of this approach with a classical one. The proposed method provides an improvement of the precision w.r.t Mercure IR system.", "paper_title": "Rank-ordering documents according to their relevance in information retrieval using refinements of ordered-weighted aggregations", "paper_id": "WOS:000236463100004"}
