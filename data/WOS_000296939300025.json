In the proposed method, the initial columns are generated by using near-optimal dual variables for linear programming relaxation of Dantzig- Wolfe decomposition derived by the Lagrangian relaxation method. The column generation is executed just after the generation of base columns generated by near-optimal Lagrange multipliers. Computational results demonstrate that the integration of column generation and Lagrangian relaxation can drastically speed up the conventional column generation.", "paper_title": "AN INTEGRATED COLUMN GENERATION AND LAGRANGIAN RELAXATION FOR SOLVING FLOWSHOP PROBLEMS TO MINIMIZE THE TOTAL WEIGHTED TARDINESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300025"}
