Intracellular rhythms are recorded concurrently with field rhythms from this preparation in data sets of approximately 3 min durations. Cross-correlation, phase and frequency distribution are used to compare intracellular and field rhythms and generate groups of activity in the time-frequency domain. We find that patterns of activity present in time-frequency are obscured using other techniques and we characterize the activity that is omitted. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
