In these situations, a wavelet transform denoising stage can improve the extraction quality with low computational cost. Each ECG lead is processed to obtain its representation in the wavelet domain where the BSS systems improve their performance. The comparison of spectral parameters (main peak and power spectral density concentration) and statistics values (kurtosis) proves that the sparse decomposition in the wavelet domain of the observed mixtures reduces Gaussian contamination of these signals, speeds up the convergence and increase the quality of the extracted signal. The easy and fast implementation, robustness and efficiency are some of the main advantages of this technique making possible the application in real time systems as a support tool to clinical diagnostics.", "paper_title": "Wavelet denoising as preprocessing stage to improve ICA performance in atrial fibrillation analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300061"}
