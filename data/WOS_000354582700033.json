However, there are no theoretical foundations for proving the convergence of the RGGS algorithm, leaving the question as to whether an algorithm works for solid reasons. In this paper, we propose a generic theoretical framework consisting of three key Graph Shift (GS) components: the simplex of a generated sequence set, the monotonic and continuous objective function and closed mapping. We prove that the GS-type algorithms built on such components can be transformed to fit Zangwill's theory, and the sequence set generated by the GS procedures always terminates at a local maximum, or at worst, contains a subsequence which converges to a local maximum of the similarity measure function. The framework is verified by theoretical analysis and experimental results of several typical GS-type algorithms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
