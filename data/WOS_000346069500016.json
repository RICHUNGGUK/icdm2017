By discretising the delay interval into two segmentations with an unequal width, new delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the absolute and robust stability of neutral-type Lur'e systems are proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by employing a modified Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF). These conditions reduce the conservativeness in computing the maximum allowed delay bounds (MADBs) in many cases. Finally, several standard numerical examples are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Improved robust stability criteria for a class of Lur'e systems with interval time-varying delays and sector-bounded nonlinearity", "paper_id": "WOS:000346069500016"}
