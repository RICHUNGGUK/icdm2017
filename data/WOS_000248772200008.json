Team designing is modeled using the set of processes provided by the situated function-behavior-structure framework. This is a formal basis for understanding the drivers for change in the product to be designed and in the design team. We specifically focus on changes in a team's structure that emerge from interactions among individual team members and subteams.", "paper_title": "An ontology of situated design teams", "paper_id": "WOS:000248772200008"}
