Reliable credit scoring models are crucial for financial agencies to evaluate credit applications and have been widely studied in the field of machine learning and statistics. In this paper, a novel feature-weighted support vector machine (SVM) credit scoring model is presented for credit risk assessment, in which an F-score is adopted for feature importance ranking. Considering the mutual interaction among modeling features, random forest is further introduced for relative feature importance measurement. These two feature-weighted versions of SVM are tested against the traditional SVM on two real-world datasets and the research results reveal the validity of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Credit scoring by feature-weighted support vector machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000316087700004"}
