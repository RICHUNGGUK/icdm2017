An excellent example of the use of this \"wisdom of crowds\" is a prediction market. The purpose of our social network-embedded prediction market is to suggest that carefully designed market mechanisms can elicit and gather dispersed information that can improve our predictions. Simulation results show that our network-embedded prediction market can produce better predictions as a result of the information exchange in social networks and can outperform other non-networked prediction markets. It is shown that forecasting errors decrease with the cost of acquiring information in a network-embedded prediction market. We also develop an information system that combines the power of prediction markets with the popularity of Twitter. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
