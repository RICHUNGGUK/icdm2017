In particular, we focus on arithmetical properties of such systems when beta is a quadratic Pisot number. We study a class of roots beta > 1 of polynomials x(2) - mx - n, m >= n >= 1, and show that in this case the set Fin(-beta) of finite (-beta)-expansions is closed under addition, although it is not closed under subtraction. A particular example is beta = tau = 1/2(1 + root 5) the golden ratio. For such beta, we determine the exact bound on the number of fractional digits appearing in arithmetical operations. We also show that the set of (-tau)-integers coincides on the positive half-line with the set of (tau(2))-integers.", "paper_title": "ARITHMETICS IN NUMERATION SYSTEMS WITH NEGATIVE QUADRATIC BASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000288625300006"}
