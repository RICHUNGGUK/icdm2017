Noisy data in certain attributes cause difficulties for traditional clustering algorithms, because the high discrepancies within them can make objects appear too different to be grouped in the same cluster. This requires methods specially designed for subspace clustering. This paper presents our second approach to subspace and projected clustering based on self-organizing maps (SOMs), which is a local adaptive receptive field dimension selective SOM. By introducing a time-variant topology, our method is an improvement in terms of clustering quality, computational cost, and parameterization. This enables the method to identify the correct number of clusters and their respective relevant dimensions, and thus it presents nearly perfect results in synthetic datasets and surpasses our previous method in most of the real-world datasets considered.", "paper_title": "Dimension Selective Self-Organizing Maps With Time-Varying Structure for Subspace and Projected Clustering", "paper_id": "WOS:000351834400004"}
