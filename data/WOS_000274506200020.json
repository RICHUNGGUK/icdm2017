A more natural interface is provided by deforming a NURBS Surface so that it passes through a given target point; and by repeating such deformations we can make the surface follow one or more target curves, These deformations can be achieved by modifying the pseudo-inverse matrix of the basis functions, but this matrix is often ill-conditioned. However, the application of a modified FE approach to the weights and control points provides controllable deformations, which are demonstrated across a range of example shapes.", "paper_title": "Deforming NURBS Surfaces to Target Curves for Immersive VR Sketching", "paper_id": "WOS:000274506200020"}
