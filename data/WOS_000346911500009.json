These strong cyclic solutions are guaranteed to achieve the goal if they terminate, implying that there is a possibility that they may run into indefinite loops. In contrast, strong solutions are guaranteed to achieve the goal, but few planners can effectively handle FOND problems with strong solutions. In this study, we aim to address this difficult, yet under-investigated class of planning problems: FOND planning problems with strong solutions. We present a planner that employs a new data structure, MRDAG (multi-root directed acyclic graph), to define how the solution space should be expanded. Based on the characteristics of MRDAG, we develop heuristics to ensure planning towards the relevant search direction and design optimizations to prune the search space to further improve planning efficiency. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate MRDAG, the heuristics, and the optimizations for pruning the search space. Experimental results show that our strong algorithm achieves impressive performance on a variety of benchmark problems: on average it runs more than three orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art planners, MBP and Gamer, while demonstrating significantly better scalability.", "paper_title": "Fast Strong Planning for FOND Problems with Multi-Root Directed Acyclic Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000346911500009"}
