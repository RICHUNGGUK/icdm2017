The antenna ratio of total exposed antenna area to total gate oxide area is directly related to the amount of damage. Jumper insertion is a common technique applied at routing and post-layout stages to avoid and to fix the problems caused by the antenna effect. This paper presents an optimal algorithm for jumper insertion under the ratio upper bound. It handles Steiner trees with obstacles. The algorithm is based on dynamic programming while working on free trees. The time complexity is O(a vertical bar V vertical bar(2)) and the space complexity is O(vertical bar V vertical bar(2)), where vertical bar V vertical bar is the number of nodes in the routing tree and alpha is a factor depending on how to find a nonblocked position ona wire for a jumper.", "paper_title": "Optimal jumper insertion for antenna avoidance considering antenna charge sharing", "paper_id": "WOS:000248235900008"}
