In order to address this problem, we propose a tracking system including multiple-sensor integration and data fusion. The proposed tracking approach is free of the constraints of line-of-sight, less subject to environmental distortion, and with higher update rate. By incorporating electromagnetic and inertial sensors, the system yields continuous 6-DOF information. Based on a system dynamic model and estimation theories, a new multisensor fusion algorithm, cascade orientation and position-estimation algorithm, is proposed for the integrated tracking device. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithms achieve accurate orientation and position tracking with robustness.", "paper_title": "Multisensor Data Fusion in an Integrated Tracking System for Endoscopic Surgery", "paper_id": "WOS:000300260000013"}
