The proposed switching law is less strict than the average dwell time (ADT) switching in that each mode in the underlying system has its own ADT. By using the MDADT approach, a sufficient condition is obtained to guarantee the exponential stability with a weighted H performance for the underlying systems. A numerical example is given to show the validity and potential of the developed results on improving the disturbance attenuation performance.", "paper_title": "Weighted Hi infinity performance analysis of switched linear systems with mode-dependent average dwell time", "paper_id": "WOS:000320099900013"}
