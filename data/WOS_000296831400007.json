A geometrical simulation using the framework rigidity optimized dynamics algorithm (FRODA) based on rigid cluster decomposition is compared to the commonly employed elastic network model (specifically the Anisotropic Network Model ANM) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The essential dynamics are quantified by a mode subspace constructed from ANM and a principal component analysis (PCA) on FRODA and MD trajectories. Aggregate conformational ensembles are constructed to provide a basis for quantitative comparisons between FRODA runs using different parameter settings to critically assess how the predictions of essential dynamics depend on a priori arbitrary user-defined distance constraint rules. We established a range of physicality for these parameters. Surprisingly, FRODA maintains greater intra-consistent results than obtained from MD trajectories, comparable to ANM. Additionally, a mode subspace is constructed from PCA on an exemplar set of myoglobin structures from the Protein Data Bank. Significant overlap across the three model subspaces and the experimentally derived subspace is found. While FRODA provides the most robust sampling and characterization of the native basin, all three models give similar dynamical information of a native state, further demonstrating that structure is the key determinant of dynamics.
