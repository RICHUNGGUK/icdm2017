This article provides a comparative evaluation of several state-of-the-art natural language parsers, focusing on the task of extracting protein protein interaction (PPI) from biomedical papers. We measure how each parser, and its output representation, contributes to accuracy improvement when the parser is used as a component in a PPI system. Results: All the parsers attained improvements in accuracy of PPI extraction. The levels of accuracy obtained with these different parsers vary slightly, while differences in parsing speed are larger. The best accuracy in this work was obtained when we combined Miyao and Tsujii's Enju parser and Charniak and Johnson's reranking parser, and the accuracy is better than the state-of-the-art results on the same data.", "paper_title": "Evaluating contributions of natural language parsers to protein-protein interaction extraction", "paper_id": "WOS:000262959500016"}
