While it is unclear how exactly humans and other higher animals master these problems, it seems evident, that abstraction plays an important role. The use of abstract concepts allows us to define the system behavior on higher levels. In this paper we focus on the semantic mapping of indoor environments. We propose a method to extract an abstracted floor plan from typical grid maps using Bayesian reasoning. The result of this procedure is a probabilistic generative model of the environment defined over abstract concepts. It is well suited for higher-level reasoning and communication purposes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach using real-world data. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
