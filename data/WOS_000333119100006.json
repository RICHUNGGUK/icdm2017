When compared with traditional two-domain SVR (2DSVR), the major advantage of 3DFSVR is able to use the prior knowledge via the novel fuzzy domain to analyze uncertain data and signals, which will enhance the potentials of 2DSVR. The 3DFKF is presented to integrate the kernel and fuzzy membership functions into a three-domain function. Definition and solution of the fuzzy convex optimization problem are presented to construct the whole theoretical framework. Experiments and simulation results show the effectiveness of 3DFSVR for the uncertain image denoising.", "paper_title": "A Three-Domain Fuzzy Support Vector Regression for Image Denoising and Experimental Studies", "paper_id": "WOS:000333119100006"}
