One of the issues with reconciliation approaches is that an exponential number of optimal scenarios is possible. The resulting complexity is masked by the fact that a majority of reconciliation software pick up a random optimal solution that is returned to the end-user. However, the alternative solutions should not be ignored since they tell different stories that parsimony considers as viable as the output solution. In this paper, we describe a polynomial space and time algorithm to build a minimum reconciliation graph - a graph that summarizes the set of all most parsimonious reconciliations. Amongst numerous applications, it is shown how this graph allows counting the number of non-equivalent most parsimonious reconciliations.", "paper_title": "REPRESENTING A SET OF RECONCILIATIONS IN A COMPACT WAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000321005100012"}
