Feedback becomes important in discovery learning environments, where novice students are often overwhelmed by the cognitive load associated with learning and organizing new knowledge while at the same time monitoring their own learning progress. We focus on feedback mechanisms in Betty's Brain, a teachable agent system in the domain of river ecosystems. Our goal is to help improve students' abilities to monitor their agent, Betty's knowledge, and, in the process their own learning and understanding. Our studies demonstrate the effectiveness of guided metacognitive feedback in preparing students for future learning.", "paper_title": "The role of feedback in preparation for future learning: A case study in learning by teaching environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000239477100037"}
