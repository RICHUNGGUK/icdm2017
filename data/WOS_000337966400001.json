In this paper, we propose a novel two-tier index structure to facilitate the access of XML document in an on-demand broadcast system. It provides the clients with an overall image of all the XML documents available at the server side and hence enables the clients to locate complete result sets accordingly. A pruning strategy is developed to cut down the index size and a two-tier structure is proposed to further remove any redundant information. In addition, two index distribution strategies, namely naive distribution and partial distribution, have been designed to interleave the index information with the XML documents in the wireless channels. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments are also put forward to show the benefits of our indexing methods.", "paper_title": "Air Indexing for On-Demand XML Data Broadcast", "paper_id": "WOS:000337966400001"}
