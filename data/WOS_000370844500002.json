In their method, the authors first mine doctor-patient ties/relationships via Time-constraint Probability Factor Graph model (TPFG) from a medical social network. Next, they design a constraint-based optimization framework to efficiently improve the accuracy for doctor-patient relationship mining. Last, they propose a novel Individual Doctor Recommendation Model, namely IDR-Model, to compute doctor recommendation success rate based on weighted average method. The authors conduct experiments to verify the method on a real medical data set. Experimental results show that they obtain better accuracy of mining doctor-patient relationship from the network, and doctor recommendation results of IDR-Model are reasonable and satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Individual Doctor Recommendation in Large Networks by Constrained Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000370844500002"}
