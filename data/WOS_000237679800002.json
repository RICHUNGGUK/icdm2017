One commonly used discrepancy measure is the supremum of the pointwise differences over a suitably chosen range; the upper bound of the range is an arbitrary but sometimes crucial parameter. This paper shows that when we use Ripley's K -function as the summary function, it is possible to avoid using an arbitrary upper bound by using adapted distance dependent intensity estimators.", "paper_title": "Testing the complete spatial randomness by Diggle's test without an arbitrary upper limit", "paper_id": "WOS:000237679800002"}
