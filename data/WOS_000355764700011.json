In this paper, we aim to solve this question and provide three methods to find extensional approximations of fuzzy subsets mu. These methods are exhaustively explained for different Archimedean t-norms, and an example is provided to illustrate them.", "paper_title": "Approximating Arbitrary Fuzzy Subsets by Extensional Ones", "paper_id": "WOS:000355764700011"}
