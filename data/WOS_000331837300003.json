However, the state of the art in design and evaluation of data centers require designers to be expertly familiar with a prohibitively large number of domain-specific design tools that necessitate user intervention in each step of the design process. This is due to the lack of a holistic data center design tool. To fill this gap, this article presents an iterative green data center design framework, the Green Data Center Simulator (GDCSim), for the design and development of energy-efficient data centers.", "paper_title": "GDCSim: A Simulator for Green Data Center Design and Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000331837300003"}
