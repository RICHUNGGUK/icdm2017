The studied systems are in discrete-time form and the discretized dead-zone inputs are considered. In addition, the studied MIMO systems are composed of N subsystems, and each subsystem contains unknown functions and external disturbance. Due to the complicated framework of the discrete-time systems, the existence of the dead zone and the noncausal problem in discrete-time, it brings about difficulties for controlling such a class of systems. To overcome the noncausal problem, by defining the coordinate transformations, the studied systems are transformed into a special form, which is suitable for the backstepping design. The radial basis functions NNs are utilized to approximate the unknown functions of the systems. The adaptation laws and the controllers are designed based on the transformed systems. By using the Lyapunov method, it is proved that the closed-loop system is stable in the sense that the semiglobally uniformly ultimately bounded of all the signals and the tracking errors converge to a bounded compact set. The simulation examples and the comparisons with previous approaches are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control algorithm.", "paper_title": "Adaptive NN Controller Design for a Class of Nonlinear MIMO Discrete-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353122400009"}
