The recent work of Arnold, Falk, and Winther includes a well-developed theory of finite element methods for Hodge-Laplace problems, including a priori error estimates. In this work we focus on developing a posteriori error estimates in which the computational error is bounded by some computable functional of the discrete solution and problem data. More precisely, we prove a posteriori error estimates of a residual type for Arnold-Falk-Winther mixed finite element methods for Hodge-de Rham-Laplace problems. While a number of previous works consider a posteriori error estimation for Maxwell's equations and mixed formulations of the scalar Laplacian, the approach we take is distinguished by a unified treatment of the various Hodge-Laplace problems arising in the de Rham complex, consistent use of the language and analytical framework of differential forms, and the development of a posteriori error estimates for harmonic forms and the effects of their approximation on the resulting numerical method for the Hodge-Laplacian.", "paper_title": "A Posteriori Error Estimates for Finite Element Exterior Calculus: The de Rham Complex", "paper_id": "WOS:000344529500007"}
