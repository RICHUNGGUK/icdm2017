In this article, by the use of the Riccati equation to the (G\"/G) expansion method, we construct more new exact traveling wave solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation in a unified way involving arbitrary parameters. The obtained solutions are expressed in terms of hyperbolic, trigonometric and rational functions. When the parameters take special values, the solitary wave are derived from the traveling waves. The obtained solutions may be imperative and significant for the explanation of some practical physical problems.", "paper_title": "Further exact traveling wave solutions to the (2+1)-dimensional Boussinesq and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000315700100016"}
