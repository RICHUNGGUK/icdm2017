We construct a novel MAC-layer sensing framework for efficient acquisition of spectrum opportunities. Specifically, we employ the sequential probability ratio test and develop a new collaboration sensing scheme for multiuser to collaborate during multi-slot, in which we effectively utilize the resources of secondary users to sense the channels for efficient acquisition of spectrum opportunities. Subsequently, we formulate the proposed scheme as an optimization problem and derive an optimal solution with low complexity, which is based on dynamic programming theory. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme could offer good performance with efficient acquisition of spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio networks.", "paper_title": "Novel adaptive collaboration sensing for efficient acquisition of spectrum opportunities in cognitive radio networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000316010900009"}
