In particular, considering the need of processing the imprecise and uncertain information existing in practical applications, we investigate the problem of migrating fuzzy XML to fuzzy object-oriented databases. To find the object-oriented schema that best describes the existing fuzzy XML schema (DTD), we devise a comprehensive approach centering on a set of mapping rules. Such reengineering practices could not only provide a significant consolidation of the interoperability between fuzzy OO and fuzzy XML modeling techniques, but also develop the practical design methodology for fuzzy OO databases.", "paper_title": "Formal approach for reengineering fuzzy XML in fuzzy object-oriented databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000318646900006"}
