In this paper, we develop some extended IOWAD operators: the linguistic induced ordered weighted averaging distance (LIOWAD) operator, the uncertain induced ordered weighted averaging distance (UIOWAD) operator and the fuzzy induced ordered weighted averaging distance (FIOWAD) operator. Their main objective is to assess uncertain situations in which the available information is given in the form of linguistic variables, interval numbers and fuzzy numbers. Some special cases of these three new extensions are studied. Finally, we develop an application of the new operators in a group decision-making problem under an uncertain environment and illustrate it with a numerical example.", "paper_title": "EXTENDED INDUCED ORDERED WEIGHTED AVERAGING DISTANCE OPERATORS AND THEIR APPLICATION TO GROUP DECISION-MAKING", "paper_id": "WOS:000326678500007"}
