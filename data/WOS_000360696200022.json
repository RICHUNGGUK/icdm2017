The Service Design method, which is utilized for leading the combination of the quality function deployment (QFD) and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), is used to analyze the features of three Smart TV user interface design mockups. Scientific evidences, which include the effectiveness and efficiency testing data obtained from eye tracking experiments with six participants, are provided the information for analysing the affordance of these design mockups. The results of this research demonstrate a comprehensive methodology that can be used iteratively for redesigning, redefining and evaluating of Smart TV user interfaces. It can also help to make the design of Smart TV user interfaces relate to users' behaviors and needs. So that to improve the affordance of design. Future studies may analyse the data that are derived from eye tracking experiments to improve our understanding of the spatial relationship between designed elements in a Smart TV user interface.", "paper_title": "Integrating Service Design and Eye Tracking Insight for Designing Smart TV User Interfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000360696200022"}
