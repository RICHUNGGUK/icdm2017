They are always bonded together, and the latter one upholds the former one. In distributed computing, mobile agent model is the mainstream technology. With autonomy, communicativeness, mobility, and role, mobile agent model is more suitable for large-scale, resources-restrained WSN to deal with big data. This paper mainly studies migration schemes for mobile agents, determines core factors of migration strategy, and proposes SMLA and DMLA algorithms. And aiming at revealing the characteristics of target tracking, this paper puts forward pid-DMLA algorithm; and considering multiple agents' cooperation, it presents Mpid-DMLA algorithm. Moreover, this paper evaluates and analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of the above-mentioned four algorithms by simulations.", "paper_title": "Research on Migration Strategy of Mobile Agent in Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000327036100001"}
