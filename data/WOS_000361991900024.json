By results in Frey and Kani (Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 7053, pp. 1-19. Springer, Heidelberg, 2012) this means that one has to determine the intersection W of a Hurwitz space defined by curves of genus 3 together with cover maps of degree 4 to and a certain ramification type with the hyperelliptic locus in the moduli space of curves of genus 3. To achieve this aim we first study hyperelliptic curves of genus g as smooth curves C in and prove that, under mild conditions on K, the curve C can be given by a \"-normal form\", namely by an affine equation in two variables of partial degrees and 2 and hence of total degree g + 3, which is smaller than the degree of Weierstra normal forms. Such curves are naturally parameterized by a Hurwitz space . We then specialize to and introduce Hurwitz spaces for 4-covers with special ramification types. The study of these spaces enables us to determine that W is irreducible of dimension 4. Moreover we find an explicitly given K-rational family of curves C in (4, 2)-normal form such that the isomorphism classes of its members are in W(K) and such that the image of the family in W is Zariski-dense. For these curves we describe the \"inverse\" of the Donagi-Livn,-Smith construction.", "paper_title": "Normal forms of hyperelliptic curves of genus 3", "paper_id": "WOS:000361991900024"}
