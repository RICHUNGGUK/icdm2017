However, existing tools for ligand alignment treat the ligands as rigid objects even though most biological ligands are flexible. We present LigAlign, an automated system for flexible ligand alignment and analysis. When performing rigid alignments, LigAlign produces results consistent with manually annotated structural motifs. In performing flexible alignments, LigAlign automatically produces biochemically reasonable ligand fragmentations and subsequently identifies conserved structural motifs that are not detected by rigid alignment.
