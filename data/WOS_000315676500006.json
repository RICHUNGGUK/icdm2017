We also prove that the restriction of the sigma--superdecomposable measure to the sigma-algebra of all measurable sets is a sigma--decomposable measure. Finally we conclude this paper with two open problems.", "paper_title": "On decomposable measures constructed by using stationary fuzzy pseudo-ultrametrics", "paper_id": "WOS:000315676500006"}
