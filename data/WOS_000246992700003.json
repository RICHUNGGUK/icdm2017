The RSS based localization techniques can be divided into two categories: the distance estimation based and the RSS profiling based techniques. The path loss exponent (PLE) is a key parameter in the distance estimation based localization algorithms, where distance is estimated from the RSS. The PLE measures the rate at which the RSS decreases with distance, and its value depends on the specific propagation environment. Existing techniques on PLE estimation rely on both RSS measurements and distance measurements in the same environment to calibrate the PLE. However, distance measurements can be difficult and expensive to obtain in some environments. In this paper we propose several techniques for online calibration of the PLE in wireless sensor networks without relying on distance measurements. We demonstrate that it is possible to estimate the PLE using only power measurements and the geometric constraints associated with planarity in a wireless sensor network. This may have a significant impact on distance-based wireless sensor network localization. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
