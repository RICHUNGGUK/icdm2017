Using the M-matrix approach and the stochastic analysis method, some sufficient conditions are obtained to ensure three kinds of adaptive synchronization for the stochastic neutral-type neural networks. These three kinds of adaptive synchronization include the almost sure asymptotical synchronization, exponential synchronization in pth moment and almost sure exponential synchronization. Some numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and potential of the proposed design techniques.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Synchronization for Neutral-Type Neural Networks with Stochastic Perturbation and Markovian Switching Parameters", "paper_id": "WOS:000345629000049"}
