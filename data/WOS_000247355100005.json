We propose a new decoding algorithm for interleaved Reed-Solomon codes that attempts to correct all \"interleaved\" codewords simultaneously. In particular, interleaved encoding gives rise to multi-dimensional curves and more specifically to a variation of the Polynomial Reconstruction Problem, which we call Simultaneous Polynomial Reconstruction. We present and analyze a novel probabilistic algorithm that solves this problem. Our construction yields a decoding algorithm for interleaved RS codes that allows efficient transmission arbitrarily close to the channel capacity in the NBSC model. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
