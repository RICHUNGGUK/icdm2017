The existence and uniqueness of the solution and convergence of the proposed methods are proved in details. Finally an example shows the accuracy of these methods.", "paper_title": "A new study on first-order fuzzy Fredholm-Volterra integro-differential equations by Jacobi polynomials and collocation methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000347836800012"}
