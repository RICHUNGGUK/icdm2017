In this paper, we consider the part flow in a high-quality relay production system applying the corrective assembly approach by incorporating machining, measurement and reprocessing errors simultaneously, and formulate the production rate of high-quality products satisfying the predetermined assembly tolerance. Optimization is used to yield the maximum production rate by using reprocessing machine selection and design strategies. The results indicate the following: (1) the proposed optimization methodology effectively yields the maximum production rate and presents the optimal selection range and the optimal adjustment size of the reprocessing machine, and (2) the reprocessing accuracy affects the maximum production rate but has little effect on the optimal selection range and the optimal adjustment size.
