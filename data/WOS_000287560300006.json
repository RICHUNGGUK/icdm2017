Furthermore, Chen presented some modified schemes to repair these flaws. In this paper, we show that the modified schemes proposed by Chen are not secure. In particular, we present an attack that allows a dishonest referee, in case of a dispute, to decrypt all the future and past authenticated ciphertext between the contended parties. We also present a simple fix to prevent this attack.
