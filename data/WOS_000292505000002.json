The generalized curvilinear governing equations are solved by a fractional step method on a rectangular transformed domain. Of importance is to employ a higher order (either quadratic or cubic spline function) integral method for the top-layer non-hydrostatic pressure under a staggered grid framework. Model accuracy and efficiency, in terms of required vertical layers, are critically examined on a linear progressive wave case. The model is then applied to simulate waves propagating in a canal with variable widths, cnoidal wave runup around a circular cylinder, and three-dimensional wave transformation in a circular channel. Overall the results show that the curvilinear non-hydrostatic model using a few, e. g. 2-4, vertical layers is capable of simulating wave dispersion, diffraction, and reflection due to curved sidewalls.
