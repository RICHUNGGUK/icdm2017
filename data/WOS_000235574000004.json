Representations achieving these bounds have appeared previously, but 2-3 finger trees are much simpler, as are the operations on them. Further, by defining the split operation in a general form, we obtain a general purpose data structure that can serve as a sequence, priority queue, search tree, priority search queue and more.", "paper_title": "Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000235574000004"}
