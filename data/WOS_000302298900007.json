Until recently, few studies attempt end to discover important gene modules shared by both drugs and diseases. Results: Here, we propose a novel presentation of drug-gene-disease relationship, a 'co-module', which is characterized by closely related drugs, diseases and genes. We first define a network-based gene closeness profile to relate drug to disease. Then, we develop a Bayesian partition method to identify drug-gene-disease co-modules underlying the gene closeness data. Genes share similar notable patterns with respect not only to the drugs but also the diseases within a co-module. Simulations show that our method, comCIPHER, achieves a better performance compared with a popular co-module detection method, PPA. We apply comCIPHER to a set consisting of 723 drugs, 275 diseases and 1442 genes and demonstrate that our co-module approach is able to identify new drug-disease associations and highlight their molecular basis. Disease co-morbidity emerges as well. Three co-modules are further illustrated in which new drug applications, including the anti-cancer metastasis activity of an anti-asthma drug Pranlukast, and a cardiovascular stress-testing agent Arbutamine for obesity, as well as potential side-effects, e.g. hypotension for Triamterene, are computationally identified.", "paper_title": "A co-module approach for elucidating drug-disease associations and revealing their molecular basis", "paper_id": "WOS:000302298900007"}
