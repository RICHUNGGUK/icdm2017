This paper emphasizes a reduced order model of the blast furnace for process monitoring, control and optimization. It describes the assumptions, formulation and solution methods used in making the simulation model. It shows how reduced order model betters the currently available higher order models by reducing computation time and achieving greater accuracy. The effects of certain model parameters have also been studied to show the validity of the model. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
