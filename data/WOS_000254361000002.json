The heat of formation and the effective adsorption capacity are expressed as a function of H-2 distance from adsorbent. The heat of adsorption decreases rapidly with the distance and increasing H-2 loading results in weakening adsorption strength. The effects of nanotube packing and bundle thickness on hydrogen adsorption strength were investigated and the results show that the heat of adsorption can be improved slightly if hydrogen molecules are placed in thicker and inhomogeneously packed nanotube bundles. Only very small diameter nanotube bundles were found to hold promise for significant hydrogen storage for onboard applications.", "paper_title": "Molecular dynamics simulations on hydrogen adsorption in finite single walled carbon nanotube bundles", "paper_id": "WOS:000254361000002"}
