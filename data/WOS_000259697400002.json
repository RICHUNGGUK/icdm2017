Ant Wars contestants are virtual ants collecting food on a grid board in the presence of a competing ant. BrilliAnt has been evolved through a competitive one-population coevolution using genetic programming and fitnessless selection. In this paper, we detail the evolutionary setup that lead to BrilliAnt's emergence, assess its direct and indirect human-competitiveness, and describe the behavioral patterns observed in its strategy.", "paper_title": "Evolving strategy for a probabilistic game of imperfect information using genetic programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000259697400002"}
