We envision that the analysis of the results of a Web search can significantly take advantage of advanced graph drawing techniques. In this paper we strengthen our point by describing the visual functionalities of WhatsOnWeb, a meta search clustering engine explicitly designed to make it possible for the user to browse the Web by means of drawings of graphs whose nodes represent clusters of coherent data and whose edges describe semantic relationships between pairs of clusters. A prototype of WhatsOnWeb is available at http://whatsonweb.diei.unipg.it/.", "paper_title": "WhatsOnWeb: Using graph drawing to search the Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300043"}
