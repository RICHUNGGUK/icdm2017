This model is experimentally proved to be very robust and able to track one static or moving target in the presence of very strong noise or in the presence of a lot of distractors, even more salient than the target. This attentional property is not restricted to the visual case and can be considered as a generic attentional process of any spatio-temporal continuous input. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
