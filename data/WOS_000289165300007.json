In the latest version of ZigBee, enhancements are prescribed for the security sublayer but we show in this paper that problems persist. In particular, we show that the end-to-end application key establishment protocol is flawed and we propose a secure protocol instead. We do so by using formal verification techniques based on static program analysis and process algebras. We present a way of using formal methods in wireless network security, and propose a secure key establishment protocol for ZigBee networks.", "paper_title": "A Secure Key Establishment Protocol for ZigBee Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000289165300007"}
