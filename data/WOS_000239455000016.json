However, this paper will demonstrate that Wang-Li's scheme is vulnerable to parallel session attack and reflection attack. Furthermore, the current paper presents a more efficient and secure scheme that not only resolves such problems, but also involves fewer computations and communications than Wang-Li's scheme.", "paper_title": "Enhanced forward-secure user authentication scheme with smart cards", "paper_id": "WOS:000239455000016"}
