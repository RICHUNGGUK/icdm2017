This paper presents a systematic approach for constructing 3D human model using the front and side images of a person. The silhouettes of human body are first detected and the feature points on the silhouettes are subsequently identified. The feature points are further used to obtain the body dimensions that are necessary for identifying a template 3D human model. The shape of the template human model can be modified by the free-form deformation method. Moreover, the proposed approach has been applied for constructing the 3D human models of 30 subjects. The comparisons between the constructed 3D models and the 3D scanning models of the 30 subjects indicate that the proposed system is very effective and robust. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
