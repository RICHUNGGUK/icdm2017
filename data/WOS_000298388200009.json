Barnette and Grunbaum proved the existence of a removable edge in the same setting. We show that the sequence of contractions and the sequence of removals from G to K (4) can be computed in O(|V|(2)) time by extending Barnette's and Grunbaum's theorem. As an application, we derive a certificate for the 3-vertex-connectivity of graphs that can be easily computed and verified.", "paper_title": "Construction Sequences and Certifying 3-connectivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000298388200009"}
