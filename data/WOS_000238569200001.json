We show, for example, how it can be used to propagate set variables, multiset variables and variables which represent tuples of values. We also describe how the propagator for the global cardinality constraint (which is a generalization of the ALL-DIFFERENT constraint) can be generalized in a similar way. Experiments show that such propagators can be beneficial in practice, especially when the domains are large.", "paper_title": "The all different and global cardinality constraints on set, multiset and tuple variables", "paper_id": "WOS:000238569200001"}
