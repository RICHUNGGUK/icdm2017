The constructed models are Herbrand interpretations, in which the interpretation of the predicate symbols is specified by tree tuple automata (Comon et al. 1997). Our approach is based on formula transformation: a formula I center dot is transformed into a formula Delta(I center dot) s.t. I center dot has a model representable by a term tuple automaton iff Delta(I center dot) has a finite model.
