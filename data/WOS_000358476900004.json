The performance of Turkish residential buildings, determined by their levels of damage, directly relates to their structural systems. Damage parameters observed from previous earthquakes define structural parameters selected to be used in the present study. Five different types of frame R/C buildings were modeled. For the analysis, the model buildings vary according to the number of stories, column sizes, and reinforcement and concrete strength parameters. The analyses consider gravity forces and earthquake loads through 1975 and 2007 Turkish design codes. In a total of 720 different R/C buildings were investigated for the analysis to obtain capacity curves. A performance evaluation was employed by considering the Turkish design code (TDC-2007). The current study ignores irregularities such as soft stories or short columns. The study's analysis considers a comparison of the parameters' influence on the structural performance of the model buildings.", "paper_title": "Earthquake performance investigation of R/C residential buildings in Turkey", "paper_id": "WOS:000358476900004"}
