This approach is employed in this study as a basis for analysis of an infinite water channel. In order to achieve an accurate and efficient approach for this purpose, the imposed boundary condition should have two features: (a) the reservoir's bottom absorption which highly affects the pressure distribution inside the reservoir should be included in the formulation of the ABC; (b) the far-field base excitation, which is a significant factor during the vertical excitation should also be considered in the analysis. By separating the overall hydrodynamic pressure into scattered and incident pressure and involving the scattered term in the formulation of the ABC, an accurate and versatile boundary condition is obtained. This boundary condition is then applied in the analysis of several benchmark examples and the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
