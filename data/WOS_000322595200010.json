This is evident based on the high number of empirical, theoretical, and conceptual studies that are published on educational technology-related research. However, many open research questions and challenges remain unresolved. In this study, we are going to: 1) present an educational technology research agenda underpinned by extensive research and studies; 2) highlight the missing interconnections between empirical findings of published studies and the pedagogical theories; 3) discover if educational technology research is overly dominated by studies conducted in developed countries, while developing countries, for example, Arabic speaking populations in the Middle-East in general and the Gulf states, in particular, are overlooked by researchers. Based on our in-depth review of the existing literature, we will discuss the challenges of designing educational user interface, technology, and pedagogy-related research, and finally propose guidelines and recommendations for future research to overcome some of the existing challenges.", "paper_title": "Examining the Educational User Interface, Technology and Pedagogy for Arabic Speaking Children in Kuwait", "paper_id": "WOS:000322595200010"}
