This paper continues the investigation of the path-based design approach of the network survivability problem in existing ATM mesh networks. Our contribution consists in quantifying (1) the effects the selection of candidate paths per node pair has on the restoration ratio, (2) the effect of restoration schemes on the restoration ratio, (3) the effect of failure scenarios on the restoration ratio, and finally (4) the effect of network connectivity on the restoration ratio. Numerical results are presented under representative network topologies, various traffic demands and spare capacity distribution schemes. They provide additional guidelines for the design of survivable ATM mesh-type networks, from a network reliability viewpoint. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
