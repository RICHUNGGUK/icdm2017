In particular, we assume that, besides additive noise, the observed signal contains an interference term whose probability distribution is unknown, and only its range and maximum power are known. We discuss the evaluation of the detector performance and its design in this situation. Although this paper specifically deals with the design of spectrum sensors, its scope is wider, as the applicability of its results extends to a general class of problems that may arise in the design of receivers whenever there is uncertainty about how to model the environment in which one is expected to operate. The theory expounded here allows one to determine the performance of a receiver, by combining the available (objective) probabilistic information with (subjective) information describing the designer's attitude.", "paper_title": "Spectrum Sensing Under Uncertain Channel Modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000306391900001"}
