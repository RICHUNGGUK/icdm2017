We formulate makespan minimization as a problem of minimizing the wasted space. Applying a candidate set strategy to narrow the search space, combined with a wasted-space-based heuristic to update the pheromone information, an improved max-min ant system algorithm is presented. A specific local search method is incorporated to gain better performance. Appropriate parameter settings in the proposed algorithm are determined by extensive experiments. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms several previously studied algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
