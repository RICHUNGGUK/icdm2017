In this paper, assuming that at most c users collude, we give a characterization of the fingerprinting codes that have the best security index in a sense of \"(c, p/q)-secureness\" proposed by Orihara et al. The characterization is expressed in terms of intersecting families of sets. Using a block design, we also show that a distributor of data can only find asymptotically a set of c users including at least one culprit, no matter how good fingerprinting code is used.", "paper_title": "Best security index for digital fingerprinting", "paper_id": "WOS:000234948500021"}
