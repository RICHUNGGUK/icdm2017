Based on the Chebyshev orthogonal collocation technique implemented in Matlab (R) and Mathematica((c)), we show how different rather complicated transport phenomena problems involving partial differential equations and split boundary value problems can now readily be mastered. A description of several sample problems and the resolution methodology is discussed in this paper. The objective of the incorporation of this approach is to develop the numerical skills of the graduate students at King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals (KFUPM) and to broaden the extent of transport-phenomena problems that can be addressed in the course. We noted with satisfaction that the students successfully adopted this numerical technique for the resolution of problems assigned as term projects. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
