To this end, an algebraic structure called a semiring of formal polynomials with restricted idempotency of multiplication is taken and fix-point equations specifying (parallel) systems are constructed. Their solution provides an \"implementation\" of the system, in particular, a Petri net of various kind. Moreover, it determines a global information on capability of sending or receiving a message by objects from a local information on their readiness to do this.", "paper_title": "Equations for message passing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240603000007"}
