Utilizing the input delay approach and the descriptor model transformation, an equivalent continuous-time generalized Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system is obtained. Sufficient conditions for the existence of state feedback controller are derived in terms of linear matrix inequities (LMIs), which guarantee the requirements of H. performance criterion for the normal and possible actuator fault cases. In order to relax the conservatism of these obtained conditions, a feasible algorithm is provided to remove some slightly restricted conditions in LMIs. Finally, an illustrative example is given to show the validity of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Reliable H(infinity) Nonuniform Sampling Fuzzy Control for Nonlinear Systems With Time Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000261310500015"}
