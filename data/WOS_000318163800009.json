Their realizations are based on a transaction counter and an address-stack-based approach. The scalability analysis is based on different workloads mapped on various sizes of networks using different problem sizes. For the experiments, we use Nostrum NoC-based configurable multicore platform with a 2-D mesh topology and a deflection routing algorithm. Under the synthetic workloads, the average execution time for the PRC, RC, WC, PSO, and TSO models in the 8 x 8 network (64-cores) is reduced by 32.3%, 28.3%, 20.1%, 13.8%, and 9.9% over the SC model, respectively. For the application workloads, as the network size grows, the average execution time under these relaxed memory models decreases with respect to the SC model depending on the application and its match to the architecture. The performance improvement of the PRC and RC models over the SC model tends to be higher than 50% as observed in the experiments, when the system is further scaled up. The area cost in the network interface for the relaxed memory models is increased by less than 4% over the SC model.", "paper_title": "Scalability Analysis of Memory Consistency Models in NoC-based Distributed Shared Memory SoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000318163800009"}
