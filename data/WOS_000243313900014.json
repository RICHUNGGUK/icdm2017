A batch machine with capacity B (B < n) is able to process a batch of up to B jobs simultaneously and the time needed is equal to the maximum processing time among the jobs in the batch. This model is motivated by applications in the manufacturing of integrated circuits. In this paper, we present a polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for this problem.", "paper_title": "Minimizing total weighted completion time on identical parallel batch machines", "paper_id": "WOS:000243313900014"}
