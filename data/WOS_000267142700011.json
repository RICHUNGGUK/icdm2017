A rectangular partition is a partition of a rectangle R into a set of non-overlapping rectangles such that no four rectangles meet at a point. It was conjectured in [Y. Dinitz, M.J. Katz, R. Krakovski, Guarding rectangular partitions, in: 23rd European Workshop Computational Geometry, 2007, pp. 30-33] that every rectangular partition admits a polychromatic 4-coloring. In this note we prove the conjecture for guillotine subdivisions - a well-studied subfamily of rectangular partitions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
