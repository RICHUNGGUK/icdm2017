First, the behavior preservation is studied under time constraints in a refinement operation, and a sufficient condition for behavior preservation is obtained. Then, the property preservation is considered, and the results indicate that if the refinement operation of time Petri nets satisfies behavior preservation, it can also preserve properties such as boundedness and liveness. Finally, based on the behavior preservation, a reachability decidability algorithm of a refined time Petri net is designed using the reachability trees of its original net and subnet. The research results are illustrated by an example of designing, analyzing and verifying a real-time manufacturing system.", "paper_title": "Design, Analysis and Verification of Real-Time Systems Based on Time Petri Net Refinement", "paper_id": "WOS:000314179100004"}
