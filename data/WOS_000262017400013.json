However, the high parameter dimensionality can introduce significant complexity and may even render variation-aware performance analysis and optimization completely intractable. We present a performance-oriented parameter dimension reduction framework to reduce the modeling complexity associated with high parameter dimensionality. Our framework has a theoretically sound statistical basis, namely, reduced rank regression (RRR) and its various extensions that we have introduced for more practical VLSI circuit modeling. For a variety of VLSI circuits including interconnects and CMOS digital circuits, it is shown that this parameter reduction framework can provide more than one order of magnitude reduction in parameter dimensionality. Such parameter reduction immediately leads to reduced simulation cost in sampling-based performance analysis, and more importantly, highly efficient parameterized sub-circuit models that are instrumental in tackling the complexity of variation-tolerance VLSI system design.", "paper_title": "Performance-Oriented Parameter Dimension Reduction of VLSI Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000262017400013"}
