We analyze the traditional Davis, Putnam, Logemann and Loveland (DPLL) solving algorithm for QBF, then we improve the DPLL algorithm and propose the solving algorithm framework based on Small World Optimization Search (SWOS) algorithm, we apply this SWOS algorithm to determine the order of the DPLL branch variable. Our result proves that SWOS algorithm has a certain degree of effectiveness to improve the solving efficiency. It is valuable as an incomplete solution algorithm for search-based solver.", "paper_title": "Solving QBF with Heuristic Small World Optimization Search Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000359894600008"}
