This paper mainly considers the improvement of linearity and the optimization of power consumption. And a novel switching sequence is proposed which allows both to achieve a better compromise. Moreover, the fully dynamic comparator, which consumes no static power, and the optimization of SAR control logic, further reduce power consumption. The simulation results show that at 1.0V supply and 200 KS/s, the ADC achieves an signal-to-noise and distortion-ration (SNDR) of 59.78 dB and consumes 3.03 mu W, resulting in a figure-of-merit (FOM) of 19.0 fJ/conversion-step. The ADC core occupies an active area of only 260 x 220 mu m(2).", "paper_title": "A 3.03 mu W 10-BIT 200 KS/s SAR ADC IN 0.18 mu M CMOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000318373200011"}
