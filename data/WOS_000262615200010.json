The compound system which consists of subsystems is chaos-synchronized. In order to increase the secrecy of models of subsystem, state of synchronization section in each subsystem is constituted by fuzzy Model. Subsystems with the same chaotic dynamics are asynchronous at first, The considered non-linear feedback control is applied to the chaos synchronization control. The control input for the chaos synchronization can be made small by use of the Unstable Periodic Regions based on the chaotic characteristic of the subsystems, then. It is important that the mathematical model of the chaos system used in synchronization sections or the encryption section is not known by the third person. However, the mathematical model of the chaos known well is used for them. Using the state of the chaos synchronization section, bifurcation parameter is changed and chaos modulations are performed. And the chaos state of the encryption section is used for encryption of information signals. The chaos dynamics of the encryption section is generated using Chaos Neuron dynamics of Chaos Neural Network.", "paper_title": "A METHOD OF THE SECRECY COMMUNICATION USING FUZZY AND CHAOS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262615200010"}
