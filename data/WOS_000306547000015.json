The JIF is simple, reasonable, clearly defined, and comparable over time and, what is more, can be easily calculated from data provided by Thomson Reuters, but at the expense of serious technical and methodological flaws. The paper discusses one of the core problems: The JIF is affected by bias factors (e.g., document type) that have nothing to do with the prestige or quality of a journal. For solving this problem, we suggest using the generalized propensity score methodology based on the Rubin Causal Model. Citation data for papers of all journals in the ISI subject category \"Microscopy\" (Journal Citation Report) are used to illustrate the proposal.", "paper_title": "The generalized propensity score methodology for estimating unbiased journal impact factors", "paper_id": "WOS:000306547000015"}
