It is further required that if a demand edge is serviced, then all the demand edges of its component are also serviced. This paper presents GRASP and Path Relinking heuristics for the Clustered Prize-collecting Arc Routing Problem. For the constructive phase of the GRASP two different strategies are considered. One of them follows a bottom-up style whereas the other one is a top-down procedure. The best solutions obtained with both strategies are used as elite solutions for the Path Relinking. The results of extensive computational experiments are presented and analyzed.", "paper_title": "GRASP and Path Relinking for the Clustered Prize-collecting Arc Routing Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000316762000012"}
