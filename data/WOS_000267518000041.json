The coordination between the two parties is achieved through revenue sharing and bargaining in such a way that their respective profit is better than that resulted from a decentralized optimization. The key contract parameter, the revenue-sharing fraction, along with the maximum amount of monetary bargain space, is obtained under explicit and implicit information, respectively. Numerical illustrations of the contracts for various scenarios are also given. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
