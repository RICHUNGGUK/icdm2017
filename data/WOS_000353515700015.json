The analysis is based on a nonasymptotic converse bound expressed in terms of the distribution of a random variable termed the b-tilted information density, which plays a role similar to that of the d-tilted information in lossy source coding. We also analyze the fundamental limits of lossy joint-source-channel coding over channels with cost constraints.", "paper_title": "Channels With Cost Constraints: Strong Converse and Dispersion", "paper_id": "WOS:000353515700015"}
