Based upon a deterministic sampling framework, OCV allows multiple importance sampling functions to be combined in one algorithm. Its optimizing nature addresses a major problem with control variate estimators for rendering: users supply a generic correlated function which is optimized for each estimate, rather than a single highly tuned one that must work well everywhere. We demonstrate OCV with both direct lighting and irradiance-caching examples, showing improvements in image error of over 35% in some cases, for little extra computation time.", "paper_title": "Optimizing control variate estimators for rendering", "paper_id": "WOS:000240736800014"}
