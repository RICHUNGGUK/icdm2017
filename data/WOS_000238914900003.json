Network performance is evaluated using realistic traffic models through simulations and numerical analyses. Results show that stringent quality-of-service requirements of real-time services can be met whilst maintaining overall high bandwidth utilization regardless of the uniformity of traffic loads between customers. Compared with current solutions based on centralized control carried out at the central office, the proposed dynamic bandwidth allocation scheme offers significant savings of the downstream bandwidth. The downstream capacity is optimized for conventional broadcast services, irrespective of the network size and number of customers supported.
