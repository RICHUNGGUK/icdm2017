DFT control inputs and scan chain inputs are used as primary inputs of the circuit, and scan chain outputs are used as primary outputs of the circuit during test generation to eliminate the distinction between functional clock cycles and the various types of nonfunctional clock cycles. The result is 1) short test application times due to the nonscan DFT modes and the ability to use limited scan operations and 2) the ability to detect all the combinationally irredundant faults due to the scan mode.", "paper_title": "Transparent DFT: A design for testability and test generation approach for synchronous sequential circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000237956000019"}
