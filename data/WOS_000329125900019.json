However, there is a lack of research into the effect of process disturbances when operating flexibly, justifying a need for validated dynamic models of the PCC process. This review critically examines the dynamic PCC process models developed to date and analyses the different approaches used, as well as the model complexity and their limitations. Dynamic process models coupled with economic analysis will play a crucial role in process control and optimisation. Also discussed are key areas that need to be addressed in future dynamic models, including the lack of reliable dynamic experimental data for their validation, development of feasible flexible operation and process control strategies, as well as process optimisation by integrating accurate process models with established economic analysis tools.
