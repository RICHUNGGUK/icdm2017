In this paper, we find that under similar condition, the number of faulty edges can be much greater and the same result still holds. More precisely, we show that, for up to vertical bar F vertical bar = 2n - 5 faulty edges, each edge of the faulty hypercube Q(n) - F lies on a cycle of every even length from 6 to 2(n) with each vertex having at least two healthy edges adjacent to it, for n >= 3. Moreover, this result is optimal in the sense that there is a set F of 2n - 4 conditional faulty edges in Q(n) such that Q(n) - F contains no hamiltonian cycle. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
