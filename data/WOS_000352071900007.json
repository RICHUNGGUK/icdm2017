A new methodology to estimate thermal loads on concrete dams taking into account processes which were previously unconsidered, such as: the evaporative cooling, the night radiating cooling or the shades, has been recently reported. The application of this novel approach in combination with a three-dimensional finite element method to solve the heat diffusion equation led to a precise characterization of the thermal field inside the dam. However, that approach may be computationally expensive. This paper proposes the use of a new one-dimensional model based on an explicit finite difference scheme which is improved by means of the reported methodology for computing the heat fluxes through the dam faces. The improved model has been applied to a case study where observations from 21 concrete thermometers and data of climatic variables were available. The results are compared with those from: (a) the original one-dimensional finite difference model, (b) the Stucky-Derron classical one-dimensional analytical solution, and (c) a three-dimensional finite element method. The results of the improved model match well with the observed temperatures, in addition they are similar to those obtained with (c) except in the vicinity of the abutments, although this later is a considerably more complex methodology. The improved model have a better performance than the models (a) and (b), whose results present larger error and bias when compared with the recorded data.", "paper_title": "An improved 1D-model for computing the thermal behaviour of concrete dams during operation.
