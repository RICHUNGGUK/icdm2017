These novel imaging modalities enable the quantitative investigation of spatio-temporal reaction and transport phenomena in the living animal or the human body. This article will highlight the significant role that rigorous systems engineering methods can play for interpreting the wealth of in vivo measurements. A methodology to integrate medical imaging modalities with rigorous computational fluid dynamics entitled image-based computational fluid dynamics (iCFD) will be introduced. The quantitative analysis of biological systems with rigorous mathematical methods is expected to accelerate the introduction of novel drugs by providing a rational foundation for the systematic development of new medical therapies. Rigorous engineering methods not only advance biomedical research, but also aid the translation of laboratory research results into the bedside practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
