However, recently, there is a growing interest in (dynamic) equilibrium route choice models in which travelers not only select their paths based on an estimated deterministic travel time, but also based on travel time reliability, in this article defined as the probability that the actual travel time deviates from the anticipated value. We extend the linear programming cell transmission model-based dynamic traffic assignment (LP CTM-DTA) model to account for travelers consideration of uncertainty regarding saturation flow rates (in this article referred to as capacities). It is shown that these reliability considerations can be accounted for by simply reducing the road capacities appearing in the constraint set of the classical LP CTM-DTA model. More importantly, we provide results on the amount of capacity reduction necessary to ensure a certain reliability level. Although in the proposed model any probability distribution can be used to model the uncertainty, the selection of a specific probability distribution can potentially be burdensome for the modeler. To this end, we also present results on the class of symmetric probability distributions that has been particularly popular in the robust optimization literature. Properties for this broad class of distributions will be derived within the context of the introduced model. In numerical case studies, the model predicts that travel patterns can be significantly different when accounting for travelers reliability considerations.", "paper_title": "A Dynamic Route Choice Model Considering Uncertain Capacities", "paper_id": "WOS:000301234800001"}
