Thus, many studies have proposed techniques to extract wisdom from these user-generated datasets. Some of these works have focused on extracting semantic relationships through the use of search logs or social annotations, but only hierarchical relationships have been considered. The goal of this paper is to detect various semantic relationships (hierarchical and non-hierarchical) between concepts using search logs and social annotations. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach constructs adequate relationships. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
