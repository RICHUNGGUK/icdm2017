The velocities on the inlet and outlet were determined according to the motion of the diaphragm. The case with heart beat rate of 75 beats per minute (bpm) was simulated. Two models were studied. It is found that, in the diastolic cycle, a vortex ring forms in the conjunction of the blood chamber and the inlet tube. This vortex ring can provide good wash-out on the wall.", "paper_title": "Unsteady flow in a 3D centrally-actuated type artificial heart", "paper_id": "WOS:000251413500003"}
