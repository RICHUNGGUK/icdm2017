In this paper, we propose the problem of mining highly diverse patterns called non-redundant diversity patterns (NDPs). In this framework, entropy is adopted to measure the diversity of itemsets. In addition, an algorithm called NDP miner is proposed to exploit both monotone properties of entropy diversity measure and pruning power for the efficient discovery of non-redundant diversity patterns. Finally, our experimental results are given to show that the NDP miner can efficiently identify non-redundant diversity patterns.", "paper_title": "Mining non-redundant diverse patterns: an information theoretic perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000292503700007"}
