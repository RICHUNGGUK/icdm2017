The energy dissipation model for traffic flow is derived. Simulations are carried out to examine the energy dissipation in traffic flow on a curved road with friction coefficient and radii of curvature. Results analysis show that the total energy dissipation increases with an increase in the friction coefficient and radii of curvature. Moreover, the energy dissipation rate varies with the density and road length, which is in good agreement with the real traffic situations.", "paper_title": "MOTION ENERGY DISSIPATION IN TRAFFIC FLOW ON A CURVED ROAD", "paper_id": "WOS:000319985700006"}
