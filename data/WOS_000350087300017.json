This solution involves only elementary mathematical functions, however, it requires finding a root of a transcendental equation numerically. Although not particularly complicated in principle, this process is tedious in implementation as it requires considering several distinct types of solutions determined by the initial conditions as well as developing procedures for selecting the correct branches of the inverse trigonometric functions at multiple turning points. While this exact solution has been mentioned in the literature, its detailed description has been lacking.
