However, there are no publicly available databases of handwritten music scores for the research community. In this paper, we present the CVC-MUSCIMA database and ground truth of handwritten music score images. The dataset consists of 1,000 music sheets written by 50 different musicians. It has been especially designed for writer identification and staff removal tasks. In addition to the description of the dataset, ground truth, partitioning, and evaluation metrics, we also provide some baseline results for easing the comparison between different approaches.", "paper_title": "CVC-MUSCIMA: a ground truth of handwritten music score images for writer identification and staff removal", "paper_id": "WOS:000307754300005"}
