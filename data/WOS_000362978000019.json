When viewed as a whole, the appearance of a single large image emerges, i.e. each tile approximates a small block of pixels. ASCII art is a related (and older) graphic design technique for producing images from printable characters. Although automatic procedures for both of these visualization schemes have been studied in the past, some are computationally heavy and cannot offer real-time and interactive performance. We propose an algorithm able to reproduce the quality of existing non-photorealistic rendering techniques, in particular ASCII art and image mosaics, obtaining large performance speed-ups. The basic idea is to partition the input image into a rectangular grid and use a decision tree to assign a tile from a pre-determined codebook to each cell. Our implementation can process video streams from webcams in real time and it is suitable for modestly equipped devices. We evaluate our technique by generating the renderings of a variety of images and videos, with good results. The source code of our engine is publicly available.", "paper_title": "Fast Rendering of Image Mosaics and ASCII Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000362978000019"}
