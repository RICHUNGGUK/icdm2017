Traditionally rendering and accessing blogs are normally conducted at a stationary PC. However, such a scheme hinders blog users from writing and reading blogs timely. A short-lived idea came out and passed away suddenly. To facilitate the instant blog updating and retrieving, we combined cellular messaging (SMS/MMS messaging and MMS/ WAP push) and open-source software (Blosxom and Apache) to develop a novel system for the Blog Rendering and Accessing INstantly (BRAINS). BRAINS enables blog users to note down their whims and share interests anytime and anywhere. Blog journalists can utilize their mobile phones in hand to compose and deliver blogs to BRAINS by SMS and MMS messaging at their pleasure. Through pre-registering on BRAINS, readers also can get the up-to-date blogs content or the incoming blog notification immediately by MMS push or WAP push. With pervasive networks like the GPRS, 3G, public WLAN (PWLAN) and fixed DSL networks BRAINS makes mobile blog rendering and accessing more evident. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
