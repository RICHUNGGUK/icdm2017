The scope of the proposed techniques is discussed for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the selected PAHs in the presence of interferences and sample matrix effects. The target compounds were 9 of the 16 United States Environmental Protection Agency (US-EPA) priority PAHs: fluoranthene, benzo[a]anthracene, chrysene, benzo [b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, benzo[a]pyrene, dibenzo[a,h]anthracene, benzo[ghi]perylene, indeno [1,2,3-cd]pyrene, and one internal standard: 2-2' binaphthyl. The suitability of these methods was compared under different chemical situations, where they were demonstrated to be powerful tools to resolve complex mixtures of analytes of similar structure in the presence of unexpected compounds. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of samples required the joint effort of the different algorithms to exploit the advantages of fast screening (PARAFAC and MCR-ALS) and accurate analyte determination (U-PLS/RBL) provided by the different methods.
