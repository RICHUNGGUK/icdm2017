A major reason is that a nonintrusive approach can continually authenticate users without interrupting their operations. In this paper, a novel approach to nonintrusive authentication of smartphone users involving flick gestures is proposed. Sixteen histogram-based features of flick gestures, including five novel features related to the habitual touch positions of a user, were used for authentication. Empirical results based on 51 participants indicated that the proposed approach was feasible. The equal error rate of the proposed approach was approximately 4.37% similar to 5.13% when the histogram-based features were calculated based on 30 flicks and decreased to approximately 2.35% similar to 2.99% for features based on 60 flicks. In addition, the experimental results revealed that the five novel features proposed are effective. Possible applications and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.", "paper_title": "A Novel Nonintrusive User Authentication Method Based on Touch Gestures for Smartphones", "paper_id": "WOS:000362465600004"}
