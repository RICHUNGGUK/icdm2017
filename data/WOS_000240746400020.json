We prove that non-deterministic systems of this type, using polynomial production functions, characterize the Turing computable sets of natural numbers, while deterministic systems, with polynomial production functions having non-negative coefficients, compute strictly more than semilinear sets of natural numbers. A series of research topics to be addressed in this framework are mentioned.", "paper_title": "Membrane computing and economics: Numerical P systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000240746400020"}
