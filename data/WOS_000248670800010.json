Recent applications of scatter search have shown its merit as a global optimization technique for single-objective problems. However, the application of scatter search to multiobjective optimization problems has not been fully explored in the literature. We test the proposed procedure on a suite of problems that have been used extensively in multiobjective optimization. Additional tests are performed on instances that are an extension of those considered classic. The tests indicate that our adaptation of scatter search is a viable alternative for multiobjective optimization.", "paper_title": "SSPMO: A scatter tabu search procedure for non-linear multiobjective optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000248670800010"}
