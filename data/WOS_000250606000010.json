A notable exception is the study of Cayley graphs that model a wide array of symmetric networks of theoretical and practical interest. Properties established for all, or for certain subclasses of, Cayley graphs are extremely useful in view of their wide applicability. In this paper, we obtain a number of new relationships between Cayley (di)graphs and their subgraphs and coset graphs with respect to subgroups, focusing in particular on homomorphism between them and on relating their internode distances and diameters. We discuss applications of these results to well-known and useful interconnection networks such as hexagonal and honeycomb meshes as well as certain classes of pruned tori. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
