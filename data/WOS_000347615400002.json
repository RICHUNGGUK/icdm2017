Automating the PCD conversion process can drastically reduce the cost of generating as-built BIMs. Due to the widespread existence of planar structures in civil infrastructures, detecting and extracting planar patches from raw PCDs is a fundamental step in the conversion pipeline from PCDs to BIMs. However, existing methods cannot effectively address both automatically detecting and extracting planar patches from infrastructure PCDs. The existing methods cannot resolve the problem due to the large scale and model complexity of civil infrastructure, or due to the requirements of extra constraints or known information. To address the problem, this article presents a novel framework for automatically detecting and extracting planar patches from large-scale and noisy raw PCDs. The proposed method automatically detects planar structures, estimates the parametric plane models, and determines the boundaries of the planar patches. The first step recovers existing linear dependence relationships amongst points in the PCD by solving a group-sparsity inducing optimization problem. Next, a spectral clustering procedure based on the recovered linear dependence relationships segments the PCD. Then, for each segmented group, model parameters of the extracted planes are estimated via singular value decomposition (SVD) and maximum likelihood estimation sample consensus (MLESAC). Finally, the -shape algorithm detects the boundaries of planar structures based on a projection of the data to the planar model. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively by experiments on two types of PCDs from real-world infrastructures, one captured directly by laser scanners and the other reconstructed from video using structure-from-motion techniques. To evaluate the performance comprehensively, five evaluation metrics are proposed which measure different aspects of performance. Experimental results reveal that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods, in the sense that the method automatically and accurately extracts planar patches from large-scaled raw PCDs without any extra constraints nor user assistance.", "paper_title": "A Sparsity-Inducing Optimization-Based Algorithm for Planar Patches Extraction from Noisy Point-Cloud Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000347615400002"}
