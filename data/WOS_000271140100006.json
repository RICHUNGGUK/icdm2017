However, owing to their fundamental structure, they have little resistance to unexpected noise among observation sequences. In other words, unexpected noise in a sequence might \"break\" the normal transmission of states for this sequence, making it unrecognizable to trained models. To resolve this problem, we propose a leave-one-out-training strategy, which will make the models more robust. We also propose a leave-one-out-testing method, which will compensate for some of the negative effects of this noise. The latter is actually an example of a system with a single classifier and multiple classifications. Compared with the 98.00 percent accuracy of the benchmark HMMs, the new system achieves a 98.88 percent accuracy rate on handwritten digits.", "paper_title": "Leave-One-Out-Training and Leave-One-Out-Testing Hidden Markov Models for a Handwritten Numeral Recognizer: The Implications of a Single Classifier and Multiple Classifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000271140100006"}
