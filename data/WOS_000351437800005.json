However, this trend has also led to a dramatic increase in their power consumption. This article surveys research works on analyzing and improving energy efficiency of GPUs. It also provides a classification of these techniques on the basis of their main research idea. Further, it attempts to synthesize research works that compare the energy efficiency of GPUs with other computing systems (e.g., FPGAs and CPUs). The aim of this survey is to provide researchers with knowledge of the state of the art in GPU power management and motivate them to architect highly energy-efficient GPUs of tomorrow.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Methods for Analyzing and Improving GPU Energy Efficiency", "paper_id": "WOS:000351437800005"}
