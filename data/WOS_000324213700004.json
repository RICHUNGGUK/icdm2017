Usage contextual information has been studied in marketing research since the last century; however, little research in design engineering focuses on it. Therefore, in this paper, we analyzed the relations between usage context information and the design of products. A usage coverage model is established to integrate users and their expected usage scenarios into product family assessment. We map the user's individual capacity together with a given product into the usage context space. The overlapping between the required usage and feasible usage can be measured. Based on this mechanism, several usage coverage indices are proposed to assess the compliance of a given product family to the expected set of usage scenarios to be covered. The original method is demonstrated on a scale-based product family of jigsaws in a redesign context. Constraint programming technique is applied to solve the physics-based causal loops that determine usage performances in a set-based design approach. Designers can rely on the results to eliminate redundant units in the family or modify the configuration of each product. The contribution of the paper is to provide an inter-disciplinary point of view to assessing the composition and configuration of a product family design.", "paper_title": "A usage coverage-based approach for assessing product family design", "paper_id": "WOS:000324213700004"}
