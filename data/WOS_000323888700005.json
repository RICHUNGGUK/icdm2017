Our results include the following: 1. The number of copies of an H with an independent set of size s can be computed exactly in O*(2(s)n(k-s+ 3)) time and poly(n, k) + O(2(s)n(2)) space, or in O*(4(s)n(k-s+3)) time and poly(n, k) space. (The O* notation omits poly(k) factors.) To obtain these algorithms we provide fast algorithms for computing the permanent of a k x n matrix over rings and semirings. 2. The number of copies of any H having minimum (or maximum) node-weight (with arbitrary real weights on nodes) can be found in O(n(omega k/3) + n(2k/3)+(o(1))) time, where omega < 2.38 is the matrix multiplication exponent and k is divisible by 3. Similar results hold for other values of k. Also, the number of copies having exactly a prescribed weight can be found within this time. These algorithms extend the technique of Czumaj and Lingas [in Proceedings of SODA 2007, ACM, New York, SIAM, Philadelphia, 2007, pp. 986-994] and give a new (algorithmic) application of multiparty communication complexity. 3. Finding an edge-weighted triangle of weight exactly 0 in general graphs requires O(n(3-epsilon)) time for all epsilon > 0, unless the 3SUM problem on N numbers can be solved in O(N2-epsilon) time. This suggests that the edge-weighted problem is much harder than its node-weighted version.", "paper_title": "FINDING, MINIMIZING, AND COUNTING WEIGHTED SUBGRAPHS", "paper_id": "WOS:000323888700005"}
