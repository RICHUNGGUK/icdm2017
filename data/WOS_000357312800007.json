Inspried by the idea of geometric Bonferroni mean, we develop the triangular fuzzy geometric Bonferroni mean (TFGBM) operator and triangular fuzzy weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (TFWGBM) operator, based on which we design two procedure for multiple attribute decision making under the triangular fuzzy environments. In the end, a practical example for evaluating the network security evaluation of computer network information system with triangular fuzzy information is given to testify the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An approach to network security evaluation of computer network information system with triangular fuzzy information", "paper_id": "WOS:000357312800007"}
