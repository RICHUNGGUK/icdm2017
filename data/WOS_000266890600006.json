Node deployment, dynamic topology control, and data transmission in WSN all consume a large amount of energy. Therefore, proper adjustment of transmission power (TP) contributes much energy saving. In this paper, a new TP adjustment method based on Fuzzy Control Theory, called FCTP, is proposed for the dynamic topology control. The simulation results show that this method is more robust to tolerate accidental interfere, more rapidly convergent, and more energy efficient than other TP adjustment approaches, which lead to longer network lifetime.
