A sufficient condition for the robust measure object is derived and it ensures the poles of the closed-loop system to remain within the specified union region when the perturbation or uncertainty appears. In order to get a set of poles and the corresponding state feedback controller which allow the system to have a maximum allowable perturbation or uncertainty for region pole constraint, the harmony search algorithm is employed to address the related optimization problem based on stochastic optimization approach. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
