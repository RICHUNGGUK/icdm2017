However in some applications, only the motion field along a predefined line is needed, while the rest of the redundant 2D region (Cong et al., CVPR, 2009) can be ignored. In this paper, we propose a general framework for estimating one-dimensional (1D) motion field using the norm metric, which can be flexible for adding any constraints depending on the specific intention. Compared with 2D methods in model calculation, which often obtain a local optimal solution, our 1D version has the advantage of real-time global optimization and sub-pixel accuracy with a large displacement capacity. The synthesized experiments have justified the effectiveness of our 1D model. Two vision applications are investigated: (i) for crowd counting, we design a novel unified framework for both line of interest and region of interest counting using our 1D motion model to mosaic the dynamic blobs. Such a framework can adapt to new site without scene-specific learning and overcome overfitting. (ii) For visual odometry, we apply our 1D model to estimate the linear velocity of the robot in real time and obtain a comparable result with the benchmark Encoder. Experiments verified that our proposed model can produce satisfactory results in real time.", "paper_title": "Real-time one-dimensional motion estimation and its application in computer vision", "paper_id": "WOS:000356094700006"}
