As a result, solutions of contact line phenomena vary continuously with mesh spacing; this paper presents examples of that variation. A mesh-dependent dynamic contact angle model is then presented, that is based on fundamental hydrodynamics and serves as a more appropriate boundary condition at a moving contact line. This new boundary condition eliminates the stress singularity at the contact line; the resulting problem is thus well-posed and yields solutions that converge with mesh refinement. Numerical results are presented of a solid plate withdrawing from a fluid pool, and of spontaneous droplet spread at small capillary and Reynolds numbers.
