Typically, the deployment of VoD is done in an arbitrary manner, without utilizing a proper engineering approach. In this paper, we present an engineering approach to deploy VoD services over IP-based hospitality networks, such as those networks seen in hotels and hospitals. In particular, our approach aims to determine the total number of VoD sessions that can be sustained by an existing hospitality network, while satisfying the QoS requirements of all network services, and at the same time leaving adequate capacity for future growth. We gauge the capacity of the hospitality network to sustain VoD services using both analysis and simulation. The capacity is gauged considering VoD quality of service requirements of throughput and delay constraints. Our analysis utilizes the principles of queuing theory, and our simulation is performed using OPNET simulation.
