The proposed model is based on a hierarchical three-level renewal process concept, which leads directly to some important MAC protocol performance metrics, such as throughput and average frame service time. The applicability of the model is demonstrated by extensive simulation results.", "paper_title": "A generic framework for modeling MAC protocols in wireless broadband access networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000249615400006"}
