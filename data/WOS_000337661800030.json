Based on the Markovian system approach and linear matrix inequality technique, a new sufficient condition has been derived such that the estimation error system is exponentially stable in the mean square sense and achieves a prescribed mixed H-infinity and passivity performance level. The estimator parameter is then determined by solving a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). A numerical example is presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed design method.
