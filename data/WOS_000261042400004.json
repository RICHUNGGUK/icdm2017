Drawing on recent findings in the cognitive psychology literature, it conceptualizes perceived behavioral control as consisting of two dimensions -IT self-efficacy and facilitating conditions - and links these two dimensions respectively to IT continuance intention and behavior. Field data from a longitudinal survey of document management system usage among administrators and staff personnel at a governmental agency in Ukraine provides empirical support for our extended model. Our study advances the emerging body of research on IT continuance by extending the theoretical boundaries of the IT continuance model, and contributes to IT acceptance and usage research by clarifying the conceptualization and effect of the PBC construct.", "paper_title": "INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONTINUANCE: A THEORETIC EXTENSION AND EMPIRICAL TEST", "paper_id": "WOS:000261042400004"}
