The identification method for online real-time acquisition personnel iris image using preprocessing algorithm to improve the quality of image for subsequent feature extraction. Moreover, we use the coarse-to-fine approach to precisely extract the iris information. We combine the edge extraction method and the connected domain characteristics of multistage de-noising method to locate the inner and outer boundary. Finally we use image multiple features template matching method to recognize the iris information. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can correctly identify the iris image quickly. It can meet the requirements of the prison site management.", "paper_title": "Prison Identification Technology Research Based on Iris Image Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000369380900001"}
