Fuzzy Delphi Method and Grey Delphi Method are applied to quantify experts' attitudes to regional road safety, urban road safety and highway safety. Comparing the results of two methods, the different results of two methods are analyzed, and then the final safety performance indicators are obtained by taking the intersection of results of two methods. Finally, three sets of performance indicators are constructed, which can be described and evaluated the safety level of region, urban road and highway, respectively. The research findings show that the method used in this paper is feasible and practical and can be provided as a reference for the administrative authority of road safety. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
