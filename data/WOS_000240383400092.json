How to organize an overwhelming amount of information and hence make an efficient retrieval from the Internet is always the hot topic in knowledge management as well as information retrieval. The Topic Map (TM) offers a framework for modeling and representing knowledge resources and plays a role as \"GPS\" in the information universe. It is hereby introduced into our study to organize document resources. By employing the concept of TM, a multilayer Topic-Map-based model is proposed in this paper. It organizes the concepts generalized from domain document contents in a hierarchical way and leads the searching process in a narrower topic space. The proposed model has been used to Chinese document organization, which makes knowledge navigating more efficiently.", "paper_title": "A multilayer topic-map-based model used for document resources organization", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400092"}
