The analysis of quasi-brittle materials can be performed using constitutive laws based upon damage mechanics. The finite element code RFPA2D (Rock Failure Process Analysis) based on damage mechanics was used to simulate a loading-type failure process around an underground excavation (model tunnel) in brittle rock. One of the features of RFPA2D is the capability of modeling heterogeneous materials. In the current model, the effect of the homogeneous index (m) of rock on the failure modes of a model tunnel in rock was studied. In addition, by recording the number of damaged elements and the associated amount of energy released, RFPA2D is able to simulate acoustic activities around circular openings in rock. The results of a numerical simulation of a model tunnel were in very good agreement with the experimental test using the acoustic emission technique. Finally, the influence of the lateral confining pressure on the failure mechanism of the rock around the model tunnel was also investigated by numerical simulations.
