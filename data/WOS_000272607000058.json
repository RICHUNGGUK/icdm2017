The proposed algorithm, as a new hybrid algorithm, consists of two phases. A tuning based on TS's fuzzy model is applied to identify the fuzzy structure, and also a fuzzy cluster validity index is utilized to determine the optimal number of clusters. To obtain a more precision model, GA and PSO are performed to conduct fine tuning for the obtained parameter set of the premise parts and consequent parts in the aforementioned fuzzy model. The proposed algorithm is successfully applied to three tested examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
