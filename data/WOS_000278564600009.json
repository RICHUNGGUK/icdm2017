(2002) [10]). In this paper, we study the problem of simultaneously satisfying a family of equations over an infinite group G. Let EQ(G)vertical bar k vertical bar denote the problem of determining the maximum number of simultaneously satisfiable equations in which each equation has occurrences of exactly k different variables. When G is an infinite cyclic group, we show that it is NP-hard to approximate EQ(G)(1)[3] to within 48/47 - epsilon, where EQ(G)(1)[3] denotes the special case of EQ(G)[3] in which a variable may only appear once in each equation; it is NP-hard to approximate EQ(G)(1)[2] to within 30/29 - epsilon; it is NP-hard to approximate the maximum number of simultaneously satisfiable equations of degree at most d to within d - epsilon for any epsilon; for any k >= 4, it is NP-hard to approximate EQ(G)vertical bar k vertical bar within any constant factor. These results extend Hastad's results (Hastad (2001)[17]) and results of (Engebretsen et al. (2002) [10]), who established the inapproximability results for equations over finite Abelian groups and any finite groups respectively. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
