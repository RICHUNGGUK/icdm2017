Results showed that surface treatment significantly affected legibility and visual fatigue, and surface treatment can improve legibility and reduce visual fatigue under intense ambient illumination. However, there is no significant difference on bending curvature. In addition, due to no significant difference between anti-glare 43% haze and anti-glare 7.5% haze, it is suggested that electronic paper manufacturers may use cheaper options for cost consideration.
