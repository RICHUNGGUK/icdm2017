This positive result stands in contrast to well-known impossibility results (Barak et al. in Advances in Cryptology-CRYPTO'01, 2002), for general obfuscation and recent impossibility and implausibility (Goldwasser and Kalai in 46th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), pp. 553-562, 2005) results for obfuscation of many cryptographic functionalities. Whereas other positive obfuscation results in the standard model apply to very simple point functions (Canetti in Advances in Cryptology-CRYPTO'97, 1997; Wee in 37th ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing (STOC), pp. 523-532, 2005), our obfuscation result applies to the significantly more complex and widely-used re-encryption functionality. This functionality takes a ciphertext for message m encrypted under Alice's public key and transforms it into a ciphertext for the same message m under Bob's public key. To overcome impossibility results and to make our results meaningful for cryptographic functionalities, our scheme satisfies a definition of obfuscation which incorporates more security-aware provisions.", "paper_title": "Securely Obfuscating Re-Encryption", "paper_id": "WOS:000294804700003"}
