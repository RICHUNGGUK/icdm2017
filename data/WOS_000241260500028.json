Design/methodology/approach - Our approach is based principally on the application of graph theory to the study of relationships between variables using specific set theory concepts. Findings - A result such as the fact that A covers B, for example, can be interpreted in terms of the latter set being formed of direct influences from elements in the former set in relation to one or more than one relationships. Analogously, the invariant set concept may be interpreted as the set maintaining its structure and status, remaining constant with respect to any possible relationships. Originality/value - From a practical point of view, in the context of the study of networks within an ecosystem, authors (such as Patten et al and Patten) have demonstrated that indirect effects between the variables of an ecosystem outweigh direct effects. This is the notion that the present authors have borne in mind in order to extend previous results to indirect influences from a discrete perspective.", "paper_title": "Coverage, invariability and orbits by structural functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260500028"}
