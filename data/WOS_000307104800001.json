To design and analyze this kind of antennas, a simple method based on an equivalent circuit model is introduced. Using this method a low cross-polarization of about -21 dB below the main beam peak and wide 3-dB gain bandwidth of 19.5% are obtained at X-band frequency. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
