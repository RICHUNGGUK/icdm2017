We consider a situation where a coalition of malicious users generates a pirated digital content in which a binary sequence w is embedded subject to the marking assumption. Here, the size of the coalition is assumed to be less than or equal to a known constant c >= 2. We evaluate the number of candidates of the coalition that can also generate w subject to the marking assumption. It is shown that the number of such candidates is completely determined as a function of w for the case of c = 2. In addition, we give a sufficient condition under which all the malicious users are correctly identified from w for the case of c >= 3. Relationships between Gamma(q) and other existing classes of codes are discussed as well.", "paper_title": "A Digital Fingerprinting Code Based on a Projective Plane and Its Identifiability of All Malicious Users", "paper_id": "WOS:000293818300025"}
