Since it may be undesirable to build near-optimal topologies according to the existing metrics, we model a weight sum of signal interference noise ratio of the receiving node in a link and energy consumption as weight of link. The minimum weight sum of any link can be solved by using the Lemma 1 and the formula (10) proposed in this paper. A Localized Two-Goal Optimization (LTGO) algorithm is proposed to ensure that all approximate minimum-edge-cost paths exist in final topology. We also propose a Localized Symmetric Link Maintenance (LSLM) algorithm to ensure that all links are symmetric in final topology if all links in original topology are symmetric. Finally, we verify through simulation that the topologies produced by LTGO+LSLM show good performance in terms of interference reduction and energy efficiency when the node density is not less than 2 nodes/km(2) and the weights of transmission power and interference are set as 0.1 and 0.9 respectively, where its interference is lower than that in the baseline topology and its transmission power is as at most 0.33 times as that in the baseline topology.", "paper_title": "Localized Topology Control for Reducing Interference and Improving Energy Efficiency by Two-Goal Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000321021200007"}
