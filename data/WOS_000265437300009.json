MTES is able to detect the closed directions around the agent and determines the estimated best direction to capture a moving target avoiding the obstacles nearby. We have also developed a new prey algorithm (Prey-A*) to test the existing and our predator algorithms in our experiments. We have obtained an impressive improvement over moving target search, real-time target evaluation search, and real-time edge follow with respect to path length. Furthermore, we have also tested our algorithm against A*.", "paper_title": "Real-Time Moving Target Evaluation Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000265437300009"}
