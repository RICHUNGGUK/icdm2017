To investigate into a PPI network from both topological and functional points of view, this work proposes a methodology that exploits ontology-based biological knowledge for network analysis. To speed up the procedure, an agent-based framework is also presented for supporting distributed computing. The preliminary results show that through the knowledge obtained from gene ontology, our work in analyzing building blocks of PPI networks can give a higher resolution than that of previous ones. Also our agent-based framework can successfully speed up the task of network analysis in an adaptive manner. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
