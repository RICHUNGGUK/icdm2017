An RFID bookshelf has the antennas of RFID readers in the boards, and detects the location of an RFID tag attached to a book. However, the accuracy is not good with the experience of the existing system, and sometimes reads the tag of the next or even further area. In this paper, we propose a method to improve the location detection using naive Hayes classifer, and show the experimental result. We obtained 78.6% of F-measure for total 12658 instances, and show the advantage against the straightforward approach of calculating the center of gravity of the read readers. More importantly, we show the performance is less dependent of a change of layouts and a difference of books by leave-I-layout/book-out cross validation. This is favorable for the feasibility in library operation.", "paper_title": "Location Recognition in RFID Bookshelves", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480800005"}
