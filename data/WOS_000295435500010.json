Consequently, the Medium Access Control (MAC) layer design is crucial, due to its influence on the transceiver, which is the most energy-consuming component of a sensor node. Among the different MAC protocols designed for WSNs, preamble sampling techniques provide extremely low energy consumption at low loads and have a notably simple operation and a lack of synchronisation requirements, which are characteristics that are especially appealing to WSNs. In this work, a survey of the different types of MAC protocols designed for WSNs is presented with a special focus on preamble sampling MAC protocols. The aim of this work is to give a detailed overview and classification of the most relevant preamble sampling MAC protocols, being motivated by the extremely large number of MAC protocols designed for WSNs in recent years. Moreover, a simple set of guidelines for matching the most suitable MAC protocol category to a given application is provided in this work. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
