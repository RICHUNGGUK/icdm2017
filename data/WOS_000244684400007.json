This system combines a basic system composed of a multi-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) manipulator and a mobile platform with an additional module for construction, national defense and emergency-rescue. According to an additional module type combined with a basic system, it can be used in a various fields. In this study, we describe a prototype of construction robot which helps a human operator handle easily construction materials in case of using the cooperation system on construction site. This study introduces an additional module for construction and a robot control algorithm for a HRC (Human-Robot Cooperation). In addition, it proposes a novel construction method to install construction materials with robot on construction site.", "paper_title": "MFR (Multipurpose Field Robot) for installing construction materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000244684400007"}
