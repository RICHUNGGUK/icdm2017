An efficient depth-first search strategy, together with a reduction method known as the 'Old Node Method', is introduced to improve the descendant path choice by means of an evaluation function that allows the selection of the most promising node to be expanded at any level of the path. The sub-set of the state space representing the most promising scenarios holds a set of feasible and quasi-optimal solutions.", "paper_title": "A time stamp reduction method for state space exploration using colored Petri nets", "paper_id": "WOS:000303168500006"}
