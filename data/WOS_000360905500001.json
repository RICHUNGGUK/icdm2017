Such information, when available, is mainly input manually. However, manual methods for creating and updating data are not only costly but also time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to long delays. This paper proposes a hierarchical polygonization method for automatic generation and updating of lane-level road network data for navigation from a road marking database that is managed by government transport department created by digitizing or extraction from aerial images. The proposed method extends the hierarchy of a road structure from 'road-carriageway-lane' to 'road-carriageway-lane-basic lane'. Basic lane polygons are constructed from longitudinal road markings, and their associated navigational attributes, such as turning information and speed limit, are obtained from transverse road markings by a feature-in-polygon overlay approach. A hierarchical road network model and detailed algorithms are also illustrated in this paper. The proposed method can accelerate the process of generating and updating lane-level navigation information and can be an important component of a road marking information system for road management.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical polygonization for generating and updating lane-based road network information for navigation from road markings", "paper_id": "WOS:000360905500001"}
