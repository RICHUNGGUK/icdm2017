Such projects consist of teams working together, but sited in different geographic locations. Under these conditions, Global Software Engineering is having a profound impact on the way products are conceived, designed, constructed and tested. One of the problems with this area is the lack of tools which supports the distributed process. Focusing on the testing process, this paper presents SABUMO-dTest, a framework based on Semantic technologies that allows software organizations to represent testing processes with the final aim of trading their services or modeling their testing needs in a social and competitive environment. The proposed framework benefits from a set of shared and controlled vocabularies that permit knowledge and process sharing with potential partners, experts and testing service providers. The evaluation of the system included two kinds of projects, the ones in which testing was not determined by SABUMO-dTest and the ones developed under its influence. Results show remarkable outcomes in SABUMO-dTest driven projects.", "paper_title": "SABUMO-dTest: Design and Evaluation of an Intelligent collaborative distributed testing framework", "paper_id": "WOS:000331779200006"}
