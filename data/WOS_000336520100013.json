A test procedure is proposed in this case that exhibits more power as compared to existing methods. The power of the proposed test is assessed for several alternative distributions by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, the proposed test is illustrated with a real data set.", "paper_title": "Testing exponentiality based on Type-I censored data", "paper_id": "WOS:000336520100013"}
