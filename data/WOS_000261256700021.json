We fabricated four red emission devices with different structures. The general bias-dependent color shift of the emissions was characterized for the first three devices. The color shift can be explained by the presence of either two different recombination zones, or a doped layer composed of two emitting materials. By avoiding the structures that induced the color shift. a bias-independent red emitting device was fabricated. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
