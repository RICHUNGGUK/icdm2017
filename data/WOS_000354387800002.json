The method has already been successfully validated for DNS of an academic flow and has been applied to flows around complex geometries (e.g. airfoils and turbomachinery blades). During these studies, the advantages of the dissipation properties of the method have been highlighted, showing a natural tendency to dissipate only the under-resolved scales (i.e the smallest scales present on the mesh), leaving the larger scales unaffected. This phenomenon is further enhanced as the polynomial order is increased. Indeed, the order increases the dissipation at the largest wave numbers, while its range of impact is reduced. These properties are spectrally compatible with a subgrid-scale model, and hence DGM may be well suited to be used for an implicit LES (ILES) approach. A validation of this DGM/ILES approach is here investigated on canonical flows, allowing to study the impact of the discretisation on the turbulence for under-resolved computations. The first test case is the LES of decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) at very high Reynolds number. This benchmark allows to assess the spectral behaviour of the method for implicit LES. The results are in agreement with theory and are even slightly more accurate than other numerical results from literature, obtained using a pseudo-spectral (PS) method with a state-of-the-art subgrid-scale model. The second benchmark is the LES of the channel flow. Three Reynolds numbers are considered: Re-tau = 395, 590 and 950. The results are compared with DNS of Moser et al. and Hoyas et al., also using PS methods. Both averaged velocity and fluctuations are globally in good agreement with the reference, showing the ability of the method to predict equilibrium wall-bounded flow turbulence. To show that the method is able to perform accurate DNS, a DNS of HIT at Re-lambda = 64 and a DNS of the channel flow at Re-tau = 180 are also performed. The effects of the grid refinement are investigated on the channel flow at Re-tau = 395, highlighting the improvement of the results when refining the mesh in the spanwise direction. Finally, the modification of the ILES parameters, that is the Riemann solver and of the SIP coefficient, is studied on both cases, showing a significant influence on the choice of the Riemann solver.
