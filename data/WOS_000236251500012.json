Array-CGH can identify chromosomal regions that have been gained or lost, with a resolution of similar to 1 mb, for the cutting-edge techniques. The extraction of discrete profiles from raw array-CGH data has been studied extensively, but subsequent steps in the analysis require flexible, efficient algorithms, particularly if the number of available profiles exceeds a few tens or the number of array probes exceeds a few thousands. Results: We propose two algorithms for computing minimal and minimal constrained regions of gain and loss from discretized CGH profiles. The second of these algorithms can handle additional constraints describing relevant regions of copy number change. We have validated these algorithms on two public array-CGH datasets.", "paper_title": "Computation of recurrent minimal genomic alterations from array-CGH data", "paper_id": "WOS:000236251500012"}
