In this paper, based on a tiered mobile FSO network model, a localized Delaunay triangulation (LDT) algorithm for the topology control of the upper tier is proposed. Then we study how the lower tier is supported by the upper tier. An effective dynamic multipoint-to-point access (DMPPA) method is presented, which can \"enlarge\" the access degree without sacrificing the connectivity of the upper tier. Meanwhile, a mutual \"help\" strategy is proposed to balance the residual energy of the cluster heads and improve the node distribution uniformity. Simulation results show that the LDT algorithm can produce a high-connectivity topology and satisfy node degree constraints and that the DMPPA method and the \"help\" strategy can ensure the network quality of service and extend the survival time of the whole FSO network.", "paper_title": "Topology Control Algorithm and Dynamic Management Scheme for Mobile FSO Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361204300008"}
