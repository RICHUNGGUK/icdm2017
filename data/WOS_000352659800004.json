In this paper, a new class of multi-stable NNs using sinusoidal dynamics with exponential number of attractors is introduced. The sufficient conditions for multi-stability of the proposed system are posed using Lyapunov theorem. In comparison to the other methods in this class of multi-stable NNs, the proposed method is used as a classifier by applying a learning process with respect to the topological information of data and conditions of Lyapunov multi-stability. The proposed NN is applied on both synthetic and real world datasets with an accuracy comparable to classical classifiers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
