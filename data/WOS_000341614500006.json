The non-linear model is firstly approximated by a polynomial. Afterwards, parameter estimation based on measured data is taken as the initial value for the proposed iterated algorithm. As the estimation method, the well-known Least Square Estimation (LSE), artificial neural networks (ANN) or Bayesian methodology (BM) can be used. With respect to the knowledge of initial parameters the measured data are transformed to meet best the non-linear regression criteria (orthogonal data projection). The original and transformed data are used in the next step of the designed iterated algorithm to receive better parameter estimation. The iteration is repeated until the algorithm converges into a final result. The proposed methodology can be applied on all non-linear models that could be approximated by a polynomial function. The illustrative examples show the convergence of the designed iterated algorithm.", "paper_title": "ITERATED NON-LINEAR REGRESSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000341614500006"}
