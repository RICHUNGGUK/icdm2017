In the system, each agent manages its local data, and communication and cooperation actions, executed by the agents, consist of asking and answering queries. The abstract notions of classification and infomorphism are used to clarify the roles of queries and mappings in the system. The query reformulation task is modelled by the composition of an appropriate infomorphisms. In order to specify classifications and infomorphisms executable Prolog-like clauses and generelized terms are used. Logic programming systems are chosen because of the logical variables and partial data representation, effective techniques of data unification and partial evaluation, suitable built-in terms and procedures, and automated reasoning.", "paper_title": "Some Notes on Declarative Specification of Semantic Data Integration Task in a Peer-to-peer Agent System", "paper_id": "WOS:000274651600006"}
