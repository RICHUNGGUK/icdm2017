We first introduce the Dempster-Shafer framework to model the uncertainty associated with possible outcomes. We then describe an approach for decision making when our uncertainty is captured using the Dempster-Shafer model and where the payoffs are numeric values. An important part of this approach is the role of the decision attitude as well as the aggregation of the possible payoffs. We then look at the situation where the payoffs, rather than being numbers, are values drawn from an ordinal scale. This requires us to provide appropriate operations for combining payoffs drawn from an ordinal scale.
