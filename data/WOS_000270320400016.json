Franco derived the sufficient order conditions as well as the necessary and sufficient order conditions for his Adapted Runge-Kutta-Nystrom methods (in short notation ARKN methods) based on the B-series theory [J.M. Franco, Runge-Kutta-Nystrom methods adapted to the numerical integration of perturbed oscillators, Comput. Phys. Comm. 147 (2002) 770-787]. Unfortunately, some fundamental mistakes have been made in the derivation of order conditions in that paper. In view of importance of the algebraic order theory for ARKN methods, a new and correct derivation of the order conditions for the ARKN methods is presented in this short note. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
