The method is based on a second-order velocity/scalar reconstruction near the IB. A novel algorithm has been developed for the 113 method to handle conjugate heat transfer. The fluid-solid interface is constructed as a collection of disjoint faces of control volumes associated to different material zones. Coupling conditions for the material zones have been developed such that continuity and conservation of the scalar flux are satisfied by a second-order interpolation. Predictions of the local Nusselt number on the cylinder surface show good agreement with the experimental data. The effect of the Boussinesq approximation on this problem was also investigated. Comparison with the variable density formulation suggests that, in spite of a small thermal expansion coefficient of water, the variable density formulation in a transitional flow with mixed convection is preferable.
