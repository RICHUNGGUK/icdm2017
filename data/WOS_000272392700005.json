Echo instructions have been proposed as a method for reducing code size. This paper presents a new type of echo instruction, split echo. and evaluates an implementation of both split echo and traditional echo instructions on a MIPS R3000 based processor. Evaluation results show that memory requirement is reduced by 12% on average with small additional hardware cost.", "paper_title": "Code Compression with Split Echo Instructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272392700005"}
