Stamps, similar to nodal and modified nodal circuit element stamps, are developed to include these elements in the circuit matrix equation without the need of deriving equivalent circuit models consisting of interconnections of elements characterized only by currents and voltages, as in the current practice. The method is applied to derive circuit stamps of memristive, memcapacitive, meminductive, and other complex device models. The method reduces the size of the overall circuit matrix and allows easy model evaluation and linearization during the circuit iterative solution process.", "paper_title": "Extended Nodal Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000298327500009"}
