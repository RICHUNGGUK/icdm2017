It weights the regions optimally and improves the performance of the region-based retrieval system based oil relevance feedback. Due to the semantic gap between the low level feature representation and the high level concept in a query image, semantically relevant images may exhibit very different visual characteristics, and may be scattered in several Clusters in the feature space. Our main goal is finding semantically related clusters and their weights to reduce this semantic gap. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed region filtering and weighting method in comparison with the area percentage method and region frequency weighted by inverse image frequency method, respectively.
