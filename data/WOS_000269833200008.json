For this type of neural network, it was found that there are essentially two different dynamical phases: the chaos phase, with almost all trajectories converging to a single chaotic attractor, and the memory phase, with almost all trajectories being attracted toward fixed-point attractors acting as memories. We found that if a neural network is designed in the chaos phase, the eigenvalue spectrum of its synaptic matrix behaves like that of a random matrix (i.e., all eigenvalues lie uniformly distributed within a circle in the complex plan), and if it is designed in the memory phase, the eigenvalue spectrum will split into two parts: one part corresponds to a random background, the other part equal in number to the memory attractors. The mechanism for these phenomena is discussed in this letter.", "paper_title": "Correlation Between Eigenvalue Spectra and Dynamics of Neural Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000269833200008"}
