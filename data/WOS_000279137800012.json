The paper also presents a description of the learning activities performed along the past ten years of a course where, in five of them, Competition-based Learning has been used. Finally, the experience gained is described together with an analysis of the feedback obtained from the students' surveys. The good survey results, and their similarity along the years, suggest that the combination of game theory with the use of friendly competitions provides a strong motivation for students: helping to increase their performance.
