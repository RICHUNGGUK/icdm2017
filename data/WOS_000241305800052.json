These distortions may seriously damage both speech characteristics and intelligibility, and consequently be harmful to many speech applications. To solve this problem, we proposed a dereverberation algorithm based on multi-channel linear prediction. The method is as follows. First we calculate prediction filters that cancel out the room reverberation but also degrade speech characteristics by causing excessive whitening of the speech. Then, we evaluate the prediction-filter degradation to compensate for the excessive whitening. As the reverberation lengthens, the compensation performance becomes worse due to computational accuracy problems. In this paper, we propose a new computation that may improve compensation accuracy when dealing with long reverberation.", "paper_title": "On a blind speech dereverberation algorithm using multi-channel linear prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800052"}
