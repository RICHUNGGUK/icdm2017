This new polymorphic protocol attempts to benefit from the high efficiency of proactive behavior ( in terms of quicker response to transmission requests) and the limited network traffic overhead of the reactive behavior, while being power, mobility, and vicinity-density ( in terms of number of neighbor nodes per specified area around a mobile node) aware. The proposed protocol is based on the principle of adaptability and multibehavioral modes of operations. It is able to change behavior in different situations in order to improve certain metrics like maximizing battery life, reducing communication delays, improving deliverability, etc. The protocol is augmented by an optimization scheme, adapted from the one proposed for the Optimized Link State Routing protocol (OLSR) in which only selected neighbor nodes propagate control packets to reduce the amount of control overhead. Extensive simulations and comparison to peer protocols demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed protocol in improving performance and in extending battery power longevity.", "paper_title": "OPHMR: An optimized polymorphic hybrid multicast routing protocol for MANET", "paper_id": "WOS:000244894900006"}
