We show how this generic formalisation can be used in the deconstruction, analysis and understanding of performative action and more broadly in live performance. Two examples of this form of analysis are shown: the installation piece Deus Oculi; and Stelare's Ping Body performance piece. The analysis of these pieces renders visible the varied (re)mappings of the causal nature of interaction, direct and indirect effects, and how these are perceived and exploited by the various members of performance social groupings. Our aim, then, is to provide a model that can be used to explore the relationships that exist in performative activities across domains.", "paper_title": "Formalising performative interaction", "paper_id": "WOS:000238085600002"}
