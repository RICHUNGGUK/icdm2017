The key insight is simple: the Lipschitz condition means that the feedback in the differential equation is weak. We define a class of polynomial-space computation tableaux with equally weak feedback, and show that they are still polynomial-space complete. The same technique also settles Ko's two later questions on Volterra integral equations.", "paper_title": "Lipschitz Continuous Ordinary Differential Equations are Polynomial-Space Complete", "paper_id": "WOS:000278521500007"}
