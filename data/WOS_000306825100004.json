The Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) model is constructed to calculate the weight of various factors, and get comprehensive character value. The Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) is present to decide the backup suppliers. By performing Axiomatic Fuzzy Set (AFS) clustering method (X. D. Liu et al. IEEE Transaction on Systems, Man, Cybernetics, 2005), the final suppliers are selected and evaluated. In this paper, quantitative and qualitative factors, such as technical capability, product appearance, JIT capability, price, delivery rate and sale service rate are considered to determine suitable suppliers. Numerical example that fifteen suppliers and six criteria are studied and the experimental results show that the proposed evaluation framework is very well suited as supplier selection decisions even with the inter-correlation criteria/attributes.", "paper_title": "Supplier Evaluation and Selection Using Axiomatic Fuzzy Set and DEA Methodology in Supply Chain Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000306825100004"}
