The polyelectrolyte A(6)B(12)A(6) was selected as the triblock polymer, and the solvophobic B blocks have no charges, while the solvophilic A blocks are charged. The simulation results showed: at higher concentration (above 50% systems), relatively small charges on the solvophilic block do not alter the bicontinuous phase inherent to uncharged solution, but at moderate concentrations (50% system), even though the charge per solvophilic bead is very small, the order lamellar structures become disturbed.", "paper_title": "Mesoscopic simulation study on a weakly charged block polyelectrolyte in aqueous solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000235749700004"}
