This paper presents analytical models to estimate yield for a pipelined design based on delay distributions of individual pipe stages. Using the proposed models, it is shown that a change in logic depth and an imbalance between stage yields can improve the design yield and the area of a pipeline a circuit. A novel statistical methodology is developed to enhance yield of a pipelined circuit under an area constraint. Based on the concept of area borrowing, the results show that incorporating a proper imbalance among stage areas in a four-stage pipeline improves design yield up to 15.4% for the same area (and reduces area up to 8.4% under a yield constraint) compared with a balanced design.", "paper_title": "Delay modeling and statistical design of pipelined circuit under process variation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241567000011"}
