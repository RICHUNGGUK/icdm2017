Separability due to the simple recourse structure allows to study a one-dimensional version instead. Based on an explicit formula for the objective function, we derive a complete description of the class of probability density functions such that the objective function is convex. This result is also stated in terms of random variables. Next, we present a class of convex approximations of the objective function, which are obtained by perturbing the distributions of the right-hand side parameters. We derive a uniform bound on the absolute error of the approximation. Finally, we give a representation of convex simple integer recourse problems as continuous simple recourse problems, so that they can be solved by existing special purpose algorithms.", "paper_title": "Simple integer recourse models: convexity and convex approximations", "paper_id": "WOS:000238743300011"}
