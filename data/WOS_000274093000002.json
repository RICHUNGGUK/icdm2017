An interesting issue is to design an effective mechanism to guide the bidders to collectively minimize the overall cost without explicitly disclosing the bids. We consider a winner determination problem for combinatorial reverse auction and study how to support the bidders' decisions without explicitly disclosing the bids of others. We propose an information revelation scheme for a buyer to guide the sellers to generate potential winning bids to minimize the overall cost. The main results include: (1) a problem formulation for the combinatorial reverse auction problem: (2) a solution methodology based on Lagrangian relaxation; (3) a scheme to guide the sellers to generate potential winning bids for the bidders in multi-round combinatorial reverse auctions based on revelation of Lagrangian multipliers; (4) a heuristic algorithm for finding a near-optimal feasible solution and (5) results and analysis of our solution algorithms.
