A new boundary treatment is adopted in the numerical experiment in order to capture the velocity slip and the temperature jump of the wall boundary. Velocity and temperature profiles are in good agreement with the analytic results, which exhibits the availability of this model and boundary treatment in describing thermal micro-flow with viscous heat dissipation. We also find the upper boundary's temperature jump is zero at the critical Ec, which is around 3.0 with different Kn.", "paper_title": "Lattice Boltzmann method in simulation of thermal micro-flow with temperature jump", "paper_id": "WOS:000238265800001"}
