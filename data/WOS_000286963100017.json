We consider the process with a general initial configuration and establish the asymptotic behaviour (and its fluctuation) of the ultimate proportion of ignorants as the population size grows to infinity. Our approach leads to explicit formulas so that the limiting proportion of ignorants and its variance can be computed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
