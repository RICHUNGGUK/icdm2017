The proposed mechanism realizes more flexible by changing their QoS control strategies dynamically than a conventional videoconference system. We modelled the prototype of our modified FVCS and implemented the proposed mechanism by varying QoS parameters. The prototype system shows its capability of flexible problem solving against QoS degradation, along with other possible problems within the given time limitation.", "paper_title": "Adaptive QoS control mechanism in flexible videoconference system", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122000032"}
