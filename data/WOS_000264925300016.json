An n x n matrix A is said to be a reflexive (anti-reflexive) matrix with respect to the generalized reflection matrix P if A = PAP. (A = -PAP). In this paper, three iterative algorithms are proposed for solving the linear matrix equation A(1)X(1)B(1) + A(2)X(2)B(2) = C over reflexive (anti-reflexive) matrices X-1 and X-2. When this matrix equation is consistent over reflexive (anti-reflexive) matrices, for any reflexive (anti-reflexive) initial iterative matrices, the reflexive (anti-reflexive) solutions can be obtained within finite iterative steps in the absence of roundoff errors. By the proposed iterative algorithms, the least Frobenius norm reflexive (anti-reflexive) solutions can be derived when spacial initial reflexive (anti-reflexive) matrices are chosen. Furthermore, we also obtain the optimal approximation reflexive (anti-reflexive) solutions to the given reflexive ( anti-reflexive) matrices in the solution set of the matrix equation. Finally, some numerical examples are presented to support the theoretical results of this paper. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
