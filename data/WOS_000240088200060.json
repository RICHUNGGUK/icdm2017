Recently, fractal dimension has been exploited to reduce the dimensionality of the data space. FDR(Fractal Dimensionality Reduction) is one of the most famous fractal dimension based feature selection algorithm proposed by Traina in 2000. However, it is inefficient in the high dimensional data space for multiple scanning the dataset. Take advantage of the Z-ordering technique, this paper proposed an optimized FDR, ZBFDR(Z-ordering Based FDR), which can select the feature subset through scanning the dataset once except for preprocessing. The experimental results show that ZBFDR algorithm achieves better performance.", "paper_title": "The practical method of fractal dimensionality reduction based on z-ordering technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000240088200060"}
