A tool for the decision Support process was developed based on a multi-agent system that incorporates a case-based reasoning system and automates the business control process. The case-based reasoning system automates the organization of cases and the retrieval stage by means of a Maximum Likelihood Hebbian Learning-based method, an extension of the Principal Component Analysis which groups similar cases by automatically identifying clusters in a data set in an unsupervised mode The multi-agent system was tested with 22 small and medium sized companies in the textile sector located in the northwest of Spain during 29 months. and the results obtained have been very satisfactory (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
