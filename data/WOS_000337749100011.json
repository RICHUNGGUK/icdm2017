Guidelines and design equations are demonstrated, fulfilling the full integration of the whole new architecture. The development of a microwave monolithic integrated circuit prototype based on TriQuint GaN technology for 7 GHz applications is reported. 10.5 dB of Gain, 38.1 dBm of saturated output power and 42% of efficiency at 7 dB of output back-off have been demonstrated by experimental results.
