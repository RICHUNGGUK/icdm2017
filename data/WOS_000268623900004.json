It is part of a transformation effort initiated by the Office of the Public Sector Development Commission (OPDC) on m-government - more mobile, responsive, and flexible government. The paper also aims to identify possible roadblocks from successfully integrating performance measurement into a management process. Design/methodology/approach - In-depth interviews with 12 executives and top administrators from private firms and public agencies, and document reviews are performed. The analysis on the participants' opinions is based on the applications of the grounded theory. The interview's findings are verified with document reviews. The roadblocks are identified and substantiated by two experts. Findings - For past and present practices, performance measurement is part of management tool and responsibility, a quality management system, and a learning organization. Its future viewpoints include a driver towards good governance, transparency, and accountability, and a success factor of performance audit and organizational competency/capability. Four important roadblocks in implementing performance measurement in an organization relate to staff empowerment, budgeting, external knowledge, and linkage with software usages. Practical implications - The findings provide important information into the OPDC's planning process on its m-government transformation initiative. Originality/value - The paper attempts to blend knowledge on performance measurement from both the private and public sectors. It highlights the greater roles and expectations on performance measurement in an organization.", "paper_title": "Performance measurement: roles and challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000268623900004"}
