However, the way of using information systems and the way of processing information for HRM have evolved and dramatically improved over the last decade. More and more HRM systems today are being changed to e-HRM systems. This is mainly due to the advent of Internet technology and the emerging concept of business intelligence. Our study shows the evolution of information systems and information processing in the HRM domain and provides an implementation case in a large Chinese state-run factory. The experiences and lessons learned from this case reveal several common problems in developing information systems in the HRM domain.", "paper_title": "Intelligent information processing in human resource management: an implementation case in China", "paper_id": "WOS:000241201000011"}
