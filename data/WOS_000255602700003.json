Sometimes the width of the provided seismic gap to facilitate the large relative displacements at the isolation level of a seismically isolated building is limited. Hence, there is a possibility of poundings of the building with adjacent structures during strong earthquakes. This work investigates, through numerical simulations using a specially developed software, how potential poundings of seismically isolated buildings with adjacent structures affects the effectiveness of seismic isolation.
