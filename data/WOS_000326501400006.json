In this paper, we present our exploratory investigation on a hybrid DCN solution of utilizing wireless transmissions in DCNs. Our work aims to solve the congestion problem caused by a few hot nodes to improve the global performance. We model the wireless transmissions in DCN by considering both the wireless interference and the adaptive transmission rate. Besides, both throughput and job completion time are considered to measure the impact of wireless transmissions on the global performance. Based on the model, we formulate the problem of channel allocation as an optimization problem. We also design an approximation algorithm with an approximation bound of 1/2 and a genetic algorithm to address the scheduling problem. A series of simulations are performed to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of our wireless DCN scheme.", "paper_title": "Dynamic Scheduling for Wireless Data Center Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000326501400006"}
