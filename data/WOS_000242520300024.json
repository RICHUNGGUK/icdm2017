Therefore recent studies have implemented such applications by application layer multicasting through organizing the multicast group in a peer-to-peer overlay network. QoS requirements limit the transmission time and the number of receivers to which each node can transmit. Such a communication scheme in an overlay network can be regarded as a degree- and delay-constrained minimum-cost broadcasting problem, and appears to be NP-complete. This study proposes a novel genetic algorithm for resolving this difficult broadcasting problem and, then, compares it with some state-of-the-art methods. Simulation results with a series of problems demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
