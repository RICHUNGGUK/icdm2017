Because of both unobserved variables and intricate dependency structures, mixture models for random graphs constitute a good case study. We first present four different variational estimates for the parameters of these models. We then compare their accuracy through simulation studies and show that the variational Bayes estimates seem the most accurate for moderate graph size. We finally re-analyse the regulatory network of Escherichia coli with this approach.", "paper_title": "Accuracy of variational estimates for random graph mixture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000304272800005"}
