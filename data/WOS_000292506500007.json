In this paper, a ranking method of interval-valued data is used to describe the degree of dominance in the interval-valued information system. Therefore, the fuzzy rough technique is employed to construct the rough approximations of upward and downward unions of decision classes, from which one can induce at least and at most decision rules with certainty factors from the interval-valued decision system. Some numerical examples are employed to substantiate the conceptual arguments.", "paper_title": "Dominance-based fuzzy rough approach to an interval-valued decision system", "paper_id": "WOS:000292506500007"}
