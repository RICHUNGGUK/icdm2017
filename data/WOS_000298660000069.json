In this work, the currently available methods for detecting inconsistencies in systems of equations coming from both static and dynamic models are briefly reviewed. For the dynamic case, a new algorithm is proposed. The proposed algorithm allows a detailed diagnosis of the dynamic degrees of freedom and valid initial conditions of differential-algebraic equation (DAE) systems. The algorithm is scalable for large problems and is a promising diagnosis tool to spread the usage of equation-oriented dynamic simulators. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
