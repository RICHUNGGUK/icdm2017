This platform has been implemented by researchers to accomplish static ergonomic analyses including Rapid Upper Limb Assessment, NIOSH lifting equation and Static Strength Prediction. However, considering only static posture information limits the capacity of ergonomics analysis. In this study, the methodology of performing dynamic ergonomics analysis based on this Virtual Interactive Design platform is proposed. This environment allows velocity and angular velocity of specified body segments/joints calculated for designed tasks to be used to assess the corresponding risk levels based on Job Risk Classification Model. The motion calculation is completed based on the captured interaction between human participants and virtual workplace/mockup. To evaluate the validity and reliability of this upgraded platform, potential errors are analyzed by comparing outputs from several designed experimental conditions. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
