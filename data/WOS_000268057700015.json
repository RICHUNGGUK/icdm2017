Furthermore, the constraints for the overhead crane operation are also considered and satisfied. Those constraints are that when the crane is moving, the swing angle has to be small; the swing speed has to be slow, and the moving force is limited. The fuzzy descriptor system is chosen to represent the dynamics of the overhead crane, and a guaranteed cost fuzzy control design is proposed for the fuzzy descriptor system. Moreover, this study also illustrates why the fuzzy descriptor system instead of traditional T-S fuzzy system is selected here as the model of the overhead crane. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control design scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
