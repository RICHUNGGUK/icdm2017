Photolithography is usually the bottleneck process with the most expensive equipment in a semiconductor wafer fabrication system. Usually, photolithography area controls the performance of whole semiconductor manufacturing system. To improve the performances of the photolithography area with dynamic dispatching combination rules, a dynamic scheduling method based on Kohonen neural network (KNN) was proposed in this paper. A dynamic scheduling framework is also proposed. The method has been integrated into the dynamic scheduling framework. A KNN-based sample learning algorithm for selecting best combination rules is presented. Finally, the results of simulation experiments indicate that the proposed method is effective and feasible in real-time scheduling of semiconductor fabrication system under both closed-loop release policy and open-loop release policy.", "paper_title": "Dynamic scheduling of photolithography process based on Kohonen neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000347893700006"}
