For this reason, this year two groups participated in the QA@CLEF track using different approaches. In this paper we describe the work of Alicante 2 group. This paper describes AliQAn, a monolingual open-domain Question Answering (QA) System developed in the Department of Language Processing and Information Systems at the University of Alicante for CLEF-2005 Spanish monolingual QA evaluation task. Our approach is based fundamentally on the use of syntactic pattern recognition in order to identify possible answers. Besides this, Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is applied to improve the system. The results achieved (overall accuracy of 33%) are shown and discussed in the paper.", "paper_title": "AliQAn, Spanish QA system at CLEF-2005", "paper_id": "WOS:000241359000051"}
