We provide an algorithm to compute them. We give some examples of the results obtained with this algorithm and give lower bounds on the number of vertices for the (n - 1)-additive case, proving that it grows much faster than the number of vertices of the general fuzzy measures. The results in the paper suggest that the structure of k-additive measures might be more complex than expected from their definition and, in particular, that they are more complex than general fuzzy measures.
