A standard neural network model is used to represent discrete-time nonlinear systems whose nonlinearity satisfies the sector conditions. H-infinity control performance for the closed-loop system including the standard neural network model, the reference model, and state feedback controller is analyzed using Lyapunov-Krasovskii stability theorem and linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach. The H infinity controller, of which the parameters are obtained by solving LMIs, guarantees that the output of the closed-loop system closely tracks the output of a given reference model well, and reduces the influence of disturbances on the tracking error. Three numerical examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed H infinity output tracking design approach.", "paper_title": "H-infinity Output Tracking Control of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Systems via Standard Neural Network Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000343704900016"}
