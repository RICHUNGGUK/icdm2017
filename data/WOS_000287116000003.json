The idea is to consider competitive conditional preference clauses structured as a tree, of the type \"preferably P(1) or ... or P(n); if P(1) then preferably P(1.1) or ...; if P(2) then preferably P(2,1) or ...,\" where the P(i)s are not exclusive (thus the notion of competition). The paper defines two possible interpretations of such queries and outlines two evaluation techniques which follow from them.
