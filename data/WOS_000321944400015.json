In addition, several new utility functions are introduced which allow the user to access the Google Geocoding, Distance Matrix, and Directions APIs. The result is an easy, consistent and modular framework for spatial graphics with several convenient tools for spatial data analysis.", "paper_title": "ggmap: Spatial Visualization with ggplot2", "paper_id": "WOS:000321944400015"}
