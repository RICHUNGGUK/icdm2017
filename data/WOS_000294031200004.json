It is based on an exclusion test and an inclusion test. The exclusion test in a cell exploits Taylor expansion of the polynomial at the center of the cell. The inclusion test uses Smale's alpha-theorems to certify the existence and unicity of a solution in a cell. Under the condition of simple roots for the distance minimization problem, we analyze the complexity of the algorithm in terms of a condition number, which is the inverse of the distance to the set of degenerate systems. We report on some experimentation on representative examples to illustrate the behavior of the algorithm. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
