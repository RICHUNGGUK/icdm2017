The method can be used in situations where the information about attribute weights is partly known, the weights of decision makers are expressed in exact numerical values or triangular fuzzy numbers, and the attribute values are triangular fuzzy numbers. The method transforms fuzzy decision matrices into their expected decision matrices, constructs the corresponding normalized expected decision matrices by two simple formulas, and then aggregates these normalized expected decision matrices into a complex decision matrix. Moreover, the decision makers are asked to provide their preferences gradually in the course of interactions. By solving linear programming models, the method diminishes the given alternative set gradually, and finally finds the most preferred alternative. By using the method, the decision makers can provide and modify their preference information gradually in the process of decision making so as to make the decision result more reasonable. The method can not only reflect the importance of the given arguments and the ordered positions of the arguments, but also relieve the influence of unfair arguments on the decision result. Finally, a practical problem is used to illustrate the developed method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
