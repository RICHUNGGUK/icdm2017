SMSS can significantly reduce the total number of complex multipliers up to 28%. The proposed mixed-radix multipath delay commutator processors can support 128/256 and 256/512-point FFTs using SMSS. The proposed processors have been designed and implemented with 90-nm CMOS technology, which can reduce the total hardware complexity by 20%. The proposed processors having eight-parallel data paths can achieve a high throughput rate up to 27.5 GS/s at 430 MHz. In addition, the proposed processors can support any FFT size using additional stages.", "paper_title": "Novel Shared Multiplier Scheduling Scheme for Area-Efficient FFT/IFFT Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000364208100010"}
