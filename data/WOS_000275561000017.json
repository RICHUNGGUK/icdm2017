In this paper, we design orthogonal-like space-time coded CPM systems for three and four transmit antennas based on orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal space-time codes. Although the signals from transmit antennas in the proposed orthogonal-like space-time coded CPM systems are not orthogonal, the fast decoding/demodulation is maintained like the two transmit antenna case. Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed orthogonal-like space-time coded CPM systems for four transmit antennas is much better than that of the OST-CPM systems for two transmit antennas.", "paper_title": "Orthogonal-Like Space-Time-Coded CPM Systems With Fast Decoding for Three and Four Transmit Antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000275561000017"}
