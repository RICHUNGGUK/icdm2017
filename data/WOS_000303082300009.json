To understand the natural laws for organizing the social structure, we focus on the fighting behavior of crickets, Gryllus bimaculatus, and investigate the neuronal mechanisms to adjust aggressiveness associated with a neuromodulatory biological amine: serotonin (5-HT). In this paper, we present a working theory of a neurophysiological mechanism based on the past biological studies on the 5-HT hypothesis, and a mathematical model of the mechanism. We analyzed this model and concluded that this neurophysiological mechanism makes the forgetting process slower. Next, we fitted our theoretical forgetting curve to an experimental curve and estimated the parameters of our model. These estimated values were in agreement with common belief in biological science.
