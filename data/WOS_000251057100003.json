However, the architectural aspects are often ignored in the design and the Web application is not specified enough. This development process produces a gap between the Web design models and the final implementation. To overcome this limitation, we extend the different Web methodologies with a generic approach called WebSA. WebSA is based on the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm that promotes models as the primary artifacts needed to carry out a software project from beginning to end. To do this, WebSA proposes a Model Driven Development made up of a set of UML architectural models and QVT model transformations as a mechanism for (1) integrating the functional aspects of the current Web methodologies with the architectural models as well as for (2) defining a set of transformations from the architectural models to platform-specific models such as J2EE, .NET, etc. To illustrate our approach, in this paper we combine WebSA with the OO-H method, to tackle the design of a running example such as the Travel Agency system.", "paper_title": "The websa approach: Applying model driven engineering to web applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000251057100003"}
