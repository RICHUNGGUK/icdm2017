Features from different objects may twist with each other, and any matched feature points may belong to different objects for many traditional object recognition algorithms. To recognize occlusions, we should not only match objects from different view points but also match features extracted from the same object. In this paper, we propose a method to consider these two perspectives simultaneously by encoding various types of features, such as geometry, color and texture relationships among feature points into a matrix and find the best quadratic feature correlation model to fit them. Experiments on our own built dataset and the publicly available PASCAL VOC dataset shows that, our method can robustly classify objects and handle occluded objects under large occlusions, and the performance is among the state-of-the-art.", "paper_title": "OBJECT CLASSIFICATION AND OCCLUSION HANDLING USING QUADRATIC FEATURE CORRELATION MODEL AND NEURAL NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000289156600007"}
