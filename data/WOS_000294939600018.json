Linear contact models are applied throughout this work as they allow for an analytical solution of consecutive oblique impacts. The many-particle systems considered are the discharge of particles from a hopper and particle movement in a shaken container. Results for many-particle systems are robust with respect to the applied integration method and step size once particle interactions are resolved with a sufficient number of steps. The integration schemes are also evaluated based on consecutive particle/wall contacts. Integration of consecutive contacts in a discrete element framework implies repeatedly solving non-continuous systems of differential equations. Various termination conditions for the normal force models and adaptive time stepping for one-step integration methods are investigated. The effect of softened contacts on particle trajectories is discussed. Based on these insights, recommendations for the most accurate integration schemes are made. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
