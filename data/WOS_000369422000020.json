Design/methodology/approach - Modeling each laminate of the laminated core of electrical devices requires prohibitively many finite elements (FEs). To overcome this restriction a higher order multiscale FE method with the magnetic vector potential A has been developed to cope with 3D problems considering edge effects. Findings - The multi-scale FE approach facilitates an accurate simulation of the eddy current losses with minimal computer resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate a remarkable accuracy and low computational costs. The effect of regularization on the results is shown. Practical implications - The eddy current losses are of great interest in the design of electrical devices with laminated cores. Originality/value - The multi-scale FE approach takes also into account of the edge effects in 3D.", "paper_title": "Multi-scale FEM and magnetic vector potential A for 3D eddy currents in laminated media", "paper_id": "WOS:000369422000020"}
