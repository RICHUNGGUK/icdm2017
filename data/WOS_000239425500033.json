XCLS does not require the pair wise similarity to be computed between two individual documents, rather it measures the similarity at clustering level utilising the structural information of XML documents. Quality of the clustering solution depends on the calculation of the level similarity, and whether the level similarity can represent the documents' structural similarity correctly. In this paper, we present the performance of XCLS for clustering the structural descriptions (ordered labeled trees) of XML documents. We have reported 5 sub-tasks corresponding to 5 corpuses as provided by the INEX 2005 document mining track.", "paper_title": "XML documents clustering by structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239425500033"}
