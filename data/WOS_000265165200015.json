In this paper, we propose a modification to iterated fast local search algorithm (IFLS) with a new recombination crossover operator and the modified IFLS is addressed as NIFLS. The ideas we incorporate in the NIFLS are iterated self-improvement with evolutionary based perturbation tool, which includes (i) recombination crossover as perturbation tool and (ii) self-improvement in mutation operation followed by a local search. Three schemes of NIFLS are proposed and the obtained solution qualities by the three schemes are compared. We test our algorithm on all the benchmark instances of QAPLIB, a well-known library of QAP instances. The performance of proposed recombination crossover with sliding mutation (RCSM) scheme of NIFLS is well superior to the other two schemes of NIFLS. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
