The method is based on the superimposition of a mask set over the original image and works even when the homology of the feature is trivial and in arbitrary dimension. We tested the method on computer-generated data, 2D images of blood vessels, 2D satellite images and 3D images of collagen fibers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
