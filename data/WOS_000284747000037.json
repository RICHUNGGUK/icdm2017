In minimizing makespan, the proposed heuristic functions are usually more efficient than the previous functions in the required number of states and computation time. We prove that these heuristic functions are all admissible and one of them is more informed than that using resource cost reachability matrix. We also propose improved versions of these heuristic functions that find a first near-optimal solution faster. In addition, we modify the heuristic function of Yu, Reyes, Cang, and Lloyd (2003b) and propose an admissible version in all states. The experimental results using a random problem generator show that the proposed heuristic functions perform better as we expected. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
