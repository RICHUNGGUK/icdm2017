Rapid execution and high accuracy is obtained by combining equations which are of Fredholm's second kind with compact operators on almost the entire boundary with a recursive compressed inverse preconditioning technique. Then an elastic problem with mixed boundary conditions is formulated and solved in an analogous manner and with similar results. This opens up for the rapid and accurate solution of several elliptic problems of mixed type. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
