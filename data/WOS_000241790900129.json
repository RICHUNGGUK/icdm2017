Intelligent support is essential for managing and interpreting this great amount of information. One of the well-known constraints specifically related to microarray data is the large number of genes in comparison with the small number of available experiments. In this context, the ability of design methods capable of overcoming current limitations of state-of-the-art algorithms is crucial to the development of successful applications. In this paper we demonstrate how a supervised fuzzy pattern algorithm can be used to perform DNA microarray data reduction over real data. The benefits of our method can be employed to find biologically significant insights relating to meaningful genes in order to improve previous successful techniques. Experimental results on acute mycloid leukemia diagnosis show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Using fuzzy patterns for gene selection and data reduction on microarray data", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900129"}
