Hence, stochastic optimization algorithms with promising performance in solving global optimization problems have received considerable attention for finite element model updating purposes in recent years. In this study, the performance of an evolutionary strategy in the finite element model updating approach was investigated for damage detection in a quarter-scale two-span reinforced concrete bridge system which was tested experimentally at the University of Nevada, Reno. The damage sequence in the structure was induced by a range of progressively increasing excitations in the transverse direction of the specimen. Intermediate nondestructive white noise excitations and response measurements were used for system identification and damage detection purposes. It is shown that, when evaluated together with the strain gauge measurements and visual inspection results, the applied finite element model updating algorithm of this article could accurately detect, localize, and quantify the damage in the tested bridge columns throughout the different phases of the experiment.", "paper_title": "Finite Element Model Updating Using Evolutionary Strategy for Damage Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000287362200005"}
