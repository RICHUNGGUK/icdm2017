However, the previous security schemes proposed for ad hoc networks either suffer from the structure support problems or have security flaws. This paper examines the weaknesses of a Bohio-Miri's recent work, and then proposes our new schemes to enhance the security and the performance. The security of the proposed protocols is proved in the random oracle model. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
