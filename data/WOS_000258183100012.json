The structure and parameters of an FIS are generated through reinforcement learning, whereas an action set for training the consequents of the FIS is evolved via genetic algorithms (GAs). The proposed EDSGFIS algorithm can automatically create, delete, and adjust fuzzy rules according to the performance of the entire system, as well as evaluation of individual fuzzy rules. Simulation studies on a wall-following task by a mobile robot show that the proposed EDSGFIS approach is superior to other related methods.", "paper_title": "An evolutionary approach toward dynamic self-generated fuzzy inference systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258183100012"}
