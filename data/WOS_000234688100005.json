The nature of imprecision and uncertainty is incompleteness. Product data model, being a core of intelligent manufacturing system, consists of all concerned data in the product life cycle. It is possible that crisp data as well as incomplete data are involved in product data model. So EXPRESS, being a powerful tool to develop a product data model, should be extended for this purpose. Using fuzzy sets and possibility distributions, this paper extends the EXPRESS to make it possible to model fuzzy engineering information", "paper_title": "Extending EXPRESS for imprecise and uncertain engineering information modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000234688100005"}
