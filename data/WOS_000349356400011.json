Nevertheless recent study shows that more than 90 % of Haar features are non-discriminative under the single-threshold weak classifiers. In this paper, we present a new cascade AdaBoost face detection approach based on multi-threshold weak classifiers, called multi-threshold AdaBoost (MTAdaBoost). Compared with the existing multi-threshold approaches, the proposed approach is capable of intelligently choosing multiple thresholds, by computing the solutions of two optimal problems. Furthermore, its computational complexity is O(N), i.e. linear with respect to the number of examples, which is of the same scale as that of the single-threshold weak classifiers. This is made possible by exploiting the Kadane algorithm. The experimental results show that the usage of the proposed multi-threshold weak classifier leads to an effective face detector with much less features and at the same time maintaining the same or even better performance, when comparing to the conventional single-threshold weak classifier. In particular, less features give rise to simpler structure, which amounts to significant reduction of training time as well as faster detection speed. As a result, empirically our method processes an image with only half of the time consumed by the single-threshold weak classifiers.", "paper_title": "An efficient multi-threshold AdaBoost approach to detecting faces in images", "paper_id": "WOS:000349356400011"}
