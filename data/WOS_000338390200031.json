The approach is based on sojourn probabilities and it is assumed that these probabilities are known a prior. A new Lyapunov functional is constructed and two main theorems are proved in this paper. Theorem 1 gives a sufficient condition for a switched system with known sojourn probabilities to be mean square stable. Theorem 2 gives a sufficient condition for the design of a stabilizing controller. The applications of these theorems and the corresponding corollary and lemma are demonstrated by three numerical examples. Finally, some future research is proposed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
