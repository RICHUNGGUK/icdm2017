The classification feature enables MPLS (Multi-protocol Label Switch) to support differentiated types of services (Diffserv) with needed QoS. The differentiated service model provides a variety of mechanisms to achieve different objectives (such as call level or packet level satisfaction). To design a good service model, which can balance the call level and packet level QoS performances, is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose two objective-oriented service models for the VoIP services over the DiffServ/MPLS networks. They can be modeled as the continuous time Markov chains (CTMC) and the performance are assessed in details. The salient point for the proposed service models is to solve the myth of the trade-off between the service quality (user's concern) and the system revenue (system provider's concern) - involving how to meet each user's SLA requirements while maximizing system revenue. The analytical results in this paper can provide useful information to both user and service provider for signing a cost-effective contract which provides a better trade-off between cost and QoS.
