In this paper, a class of MDS convolutional codes is introduced whose column distances reach the generalized Singleton bound at the earliest possible instant. Such codes are called strongly-MDS convolutional codes. They also have a maximum or near-maximum distance profile. The extended row distances of these codes will also be discussed briefly.", "paper_title": "Strongly-MDS convolutional codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000234944700014"}
