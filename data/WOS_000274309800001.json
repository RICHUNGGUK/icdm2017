Current methods try to reduce the \"curse of dimensionality\" by using statistical intra-feature set calculations, or classifiers that are based on the given dataset. In this paper, we present SoFoCles, an interactive tool that enables semantic feature filtering in microarray classification problems with the use of external, well-defined knowledge retrieved from the Gene Ontology. The notion of semantic similarity is used to derive genes that are involved in the same biological path during the microarray experiment, by enriching a feature set that has been initially produced with legacy methods. Among its other functionalities, SoFoCles offers a large repository of semantic similarity methods that are used in order to derive feature sets and marker genes. The structure and functionality of the tool are discussed in detail, as well as its ability to improve classification accuracy. Through experimental evaluation, SoFoCles is shown to outperform other classification schemes in terms of classification accuracy in two real datasets using different semantic similarity computation approaches.
