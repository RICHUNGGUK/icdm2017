Relevant literature, however has identified that individual perceptions, beliefs, and biases significantly influence security policy compliance behavior. Security awareness programs need, therefore, to be aligned with the factors affecting the internalization of the communicated security objectives. This paper explores the role of cognitive and cultural biases in shaping information security perceptions and behaviors. We draw upon related literature from contiguous disciplines (namely behavioral economics and health and safety research) to develop a conceptual framework and analyze the role of cognitive and cultural biases in information security behavior. We discuss the implications of biases for security awareness programs and provide a set of recommendations for planning and implementing awareness programs, and for designing the related material. This paper opens new avenues for information security awareness research with regard to security decision making and proposes practical recommendations for planning and delivering security awareness programs, so as to exploit and alleviate the effect of cognitive and cultural biases on shaping risk perceptions and security behavior.
