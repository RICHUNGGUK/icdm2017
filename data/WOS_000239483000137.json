After analyzing character of MIMO system, an additional control is designed to track trajectory. Then VSC algorithm is adopted to eliminate the difference. By estimating outputs of next step, VSC inputs and additional inputs are obtained directly by two kinds of trained SVMs, and so recognition of system parameters is avoided. A linear MIMO system is introduced to prove the scheme, and simulation shows that the high identification precision and quick training speed.", "paper_title": "A VSC method for MIMO systems based on SVM", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000137"}
