The methodology has permitted the elaboration of a hybrid technique that combines the most popular, classical, topology-shape-metric approach to orthogonal drawings on the grid and a genetic algorithm that is directed, in its evolutionary process, at multicriteria decision making in a fuzzy environment. In the traditional use of the topology-shape-metric approach, a single fixed planar embedding is obtained in the planarization step. Thereafter this embedding is subjected to the orthogonalization and compaction steps. However, this sequence does not guarantee that the fixed planar embedding will generate a final drawing of a good quality. Moreover, every topology-shape-metric step is classified as a NP-hard problem, and choices as well as heuristics used in previous stages have a direct impact on subsequent ones. Taking this into account, the developed hybrid technique generates a greater number of planar embeddings by varying the order of edges' insertion when forming the planar embeddings in planarization step. Thus, the problem is formulated as a permutation-based combinatorial optimization problem. The genetic algorithm is applied at the planarization step of the topology-shape-metric. This allows one to generate the population with the corresponding number of planar embeddings. Each planar embedding obtained in the planarization step is submitted to the orthogonalization and compaction. Their results serve for applying the procedures of multicriteria decision making in a fuzzy environment. Thus, in the evolutionary process, the genetic algorithm is able to select individuals, which provide more harmonious solutions (relatively of the solutions obtained with traditional applying the topology-shape-metric approach) from the point of view of the aesthetic criteria that are usually utilized at the three steps of automatic graph drawing. This is convincingly demonstrated by experimental results given in the paper. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
