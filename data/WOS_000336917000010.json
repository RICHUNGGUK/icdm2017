Thus, it is very valuable to perform the extraction on multiple feature sets. This paper addresses the issue of multiset correlation feature extraction (MCFE) in multiple feature representations. A novel method is proposed to carry out the MCFE for classification, called multiset canonical correlations using globality-preserving projections (MCC-GPs), which can perform joint dimensionality reduction for high-dimensional data. MCC-GP integrates correlational characteristics of feature pairs and global geometric information of data in the transformed low-dimensional space. This makes MCC-GPs have better discriminant ability than a previous method proposed by the authors, called multiset integrated canonical correlation analysis (MICCA), which only considers correlations for recognition tasks. Furthermore, MCC-GP can subsume two popular feature extraction methods into its framework under some constraints. This also provides a new insight for these two methods. The proposed method is applied to pattern recognition and examined using the COIL-100 and ETH-80 object databases and AR, CMU PIE, and Yale face databases. Extensive experimental results show that MCC-GP outperforms MICCA and multiset canonical correlation analysis in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency.", "paper_title": "Multiset Canonical Correlations Using Globality Preserving Projections With Applications to Feature Extraction and Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000336917000010"}
