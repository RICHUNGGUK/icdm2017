Thus, a reliable soft sensor of MI is crucial in the quality control of this practical process. The least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) has been proven to offer strong potential in forecasting MI, particularly by employing an appropriate meta-heuristic algorithm to determine the values of its two main parameters of the bandwidth of the Gaussian REF kernel \"sigma\" and the punishment factor \"gamma\". However, these meta-heuristic algorithms have the drawbacks of being hard to understand and reaching the global optimal solution slowly. In this paper, an adaptive mutation fruit fly optimization algorithm (AM-FOA) is first proposed, which has the advantages of being easy to understand and fast convergence to the global optimal solution. Researches on the AM-FOA-LSSVM are further accomplished with the data from a real PP plant, and the results are compared with LSSVM, PSO-LSSVM and FOA-LSSVM models in detail. The research results show the validity of the proposed approach in the practical melt index prediction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
