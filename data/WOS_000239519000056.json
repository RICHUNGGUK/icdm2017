Nevertheless, there are two ways in order to improve video games accessibility : the use of sound or the use of touch. Even if the latter turns out to be the main exploited solution, the use of touch remains substantial. Indeed, touch is the base of Braille learning and Braille knowledge is the only way for visually impaired persons to access written information alone without any technical help such as computer and vocal analysis [1]. This article introduces our works about tactile video games. It shows games like Snake or Maze, which can be played from a Braille display. Finally, these works have led us to think about the way to introduce tactile games as play aspect in Braille learning[2,3].", "paper_title": "Semi automatic generator of tactile video games for visually impaired children", "paper_id": "WOS:000239519000056"}
