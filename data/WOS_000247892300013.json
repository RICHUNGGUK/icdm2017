The method has many advantages. It can be completed automatically and is independent of a specific database. Firstly, we convert metadata into ontology. Then input a rule set to a reasoner, which supports rule-based inference over the ontology model. The outputs of the reasoner describe the prior knowledge in metadata. Finally, incorporate the prior knowledge into data mining.", "paper_title": "Incorporating metadata into data mining with ontology", "paper_id": "WOS:000247892300013"}
