Those approaches propose schemas that can range from simple keyword based descriptions to complex hierarchical organization of information. However, effective media asset management requires more than content searching and retrieval: underlying infrastructures are usually complex, require the use of a number of different equipment and management decisions have to be done based on information available from the multimedia metadata layer as well as on data describing system resources and capabilities. In this paper we propose a new ontology that aggregates information from different sources and enables a top level business oriented view of multimedia archives.", "paper_title": "A semantic management model to enable the integrated management of media and devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000277643600003"}
