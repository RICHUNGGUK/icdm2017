In order to improve knowledge management, Cops (Communities of Practice) are used as powerful tools. By operating CoPs internally and externally, they have made improvements like increased core competency, induced innovation learning, enhanced working efficiency and promoted responsiveness. In order to run Cops successfully, the evaluation of Cop is also crucial. CoP operators need to understand the current position systemically and determine the currently practiced activities. In order to do this, they need visible and quantifiable metrics for measurement. After deciding the current status of CoP, new objectives and strategies for their improvement are provided. In this paper, we intend to assess the condition of CoPs indirectly, not to measure the efficiency of CoP directly. This research provides a holistic. systematic, and comprehensive framework with maturity stages for navigating CoPs, and provides a road map for moving from immature, inconsistent activities to mature, disciplined approaches aligned to strategic business imperatives.
