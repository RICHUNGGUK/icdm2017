We first present necessary and sufficient conditions for the convex hull of integer points contained in a general convex set to be closed. This leads to useful results for special classes of convex sets such as pointed cones, strictly convex sets, and sets containing integer points in their interior. We then present a sufficient condition for the convex hull of integer points in general convex sets to be a polyhedron. This result generalizes the well-known result due to Meyer (Math Program 7:223-225, 1974). Under a simple technical assumption, we show that these sufficient conditions are also necessary for the convex hull of integer points contained in general convex sets to be a polyhedron.", "paper_title": "Some properties of convex hulls of integer points contained in general convex sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000324232100020"}
