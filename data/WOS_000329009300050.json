First, the reference is wrapped according to the shape of the target. Second, we employ a new spatially variant edge-preserving smoothing filter to remove the facial identity and texture details of the wrapped reference, and obtain the illumination template. Finally, we relight the target with the template in CIELAB color space. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method for both grayscale and color faces taken from different databases, and the comparisons with previous works demonstrate a better relighting effect produced by our method.", "paper_title": "A New Face Relighting Method Based on Edge-Preserving Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000329009300050"}
