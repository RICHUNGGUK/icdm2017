The proposed scheme enables virtual CPUs to be dynamically performance-asymmetric based on their hosted workloads. To enhance user experience on consolidated desktops, our scheme provides interactive workloads with fast virtual CPUs, which have more computing power than those hosting background workloads in the same virtual machine. To this end, we devise a hypervisor extension that transparently classifies background tasks from potentially interactive workloads. In addition, we introduce a guest extension that manipulates the scheduling policy of an operating system in favor of our hypervisor-level scheme so that interactive performance can be further improved. Our evaluation shows that the proposed scheme significantly improves interactive performance of application launch, Web browsing, and video playback applications when CPU-intensive workloads highly disturb the interactive workloads.", "paper_title": "Virtual Asymmetric Multiprocessor for Interactive Performance of Consolidated Desktops", "paper_id": "WOS:000344456400005"}
