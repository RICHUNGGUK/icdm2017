The 2.5 kW, 7-level prototype of the constructed configuration proves the ability to act as an inverter under resistive and inductive loads and generates outputs with 2.1-11.5% of THD and 92.5% of peak efficiency. At last, a table of comparison with the closest topology is brought.", "paper_title": "MULTI-WINDING TRANSFORMER-BASED DIODE CLAMPING MULTILEVEL INVERTER, EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000324836400009"}
