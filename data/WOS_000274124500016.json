We analyze 3.75-round SAFER SK-64,(1) using 2(45) chosen plaintexts, 2(38) bytes memory and 2(42) half round computations. Furthermore, the new impossible differential attack on 3.75-round SAFER+/ 128 uses 2(78) chosen plaintexts, 2(75) half round computations and 2(68) bytes memory. And attack on 3.75-round SAFER++/128 uses 2(78) data, 2(66) time, and 2(62) memory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
