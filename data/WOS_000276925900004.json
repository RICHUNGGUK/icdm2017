PDM and CAD technologies, a semantics-based approach for collaborative aircraft tooling design is proposed. This approach combines heuristic reasoning with semantic web ontology to facilitate the knowledge representation and reuse, and solve challenging issues such as semantic transmission between aircraft components and related tooling, between aircraft tooling and inventories, and among users participating in a new aircraft product development process. A pilot software system has been developed and partially deployed in a large-scale aircraft manufacturing enterprise. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
