Fuzzy class preserving projections aim to preserve the relationship degree of each sample belonging to given classes. The weight between samples is determined by the fuzzy k-nearest neighbor classifier. The advantage of such assignment is that these membership values act as strength or confidence with which the current sample belongs to a particular class. Furthermore, Fuzzy Laplacianfaces which is the combination of principal component analysis (PCA) and fuzzy class preserving projections (FCPP) are used for facial expression recognition. Experimental results on Cohn-Kanade and JAFFE databases show that Fuzzy Laplacianfaces can distinguish confusing facial expressions efficiently, and it significantly outperforms other conventional methods like Laplacianfaces and Fisher faces.", "paper_title": "FACIAL EXPRESSION RECOGNITION USING FUZZY LAPLACIANFACES", "paper_id": "WOS:000277576500002"}
