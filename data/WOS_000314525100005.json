Most of people configured wireless networks using default configurations, as a result they may not achieve maximum network performance. Selection of frequency channel-pattern and physically placement of Access Points are main reasons for poor network performance. In this research we experimentally analyzed the performance of wireless networks consisting of IEEE 802.11b/g devices by using both overlapping and non-overlapping frequency channels patterns. We concluded that better throughput can be achieved by using non-overlapping frequency channels-patterns.", "paper_title": "Congestion Control in Multi Channel 802.11b and 802.11g Wireless Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000314525100005"}
