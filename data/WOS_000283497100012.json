A multibeam SAR system requires a set of secondary beams, implementing some additional features. To protect the SAR operation from possible jammers ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasure) capabilities can be implemented requiring an auxiliary beam which cover the portion of main pattern to be protected. A possible architecture of this secondary antenna system is here presented by using a set of radiating elements combined together to obtain the ECCM channel. To minimize the feeding network complexity and to maximize the system reliability, the ECCM antenna is a cluster of circular corrugated horns, eventually realized as a single-block unit.", "paper_title": "ECCM AUXILIARY ANTENNA SYSTEM FOR A MULTIBEAM SAR ARRAY", "paper_id": "WOS:000283497100012"}
