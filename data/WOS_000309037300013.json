However, there is little awareness that consumers may not be able to process all the information available because of human beings' limited information processing capacity. Online shoppers could be easily confused when facing rich information, particularly when the amount of information greatly exceeds their processing capacity. In contrast to previous research which has focused on the formatting of information or user interfaces to solve the information overload problem, this study explores a new solution based on the role of unconscious thought Integrating information processing theory and the unconscious thought theory, the current study examines the different roles of information quantity, information quality and thought mode in consumers' decision satisfaction, in the presence of rich information. Our results show that unconscious thought moderates the relationship between information quality and consumer satisfaction towards their decision making when shopping experience products online, and is thus worthy of special attention in the design of e-commerce websites. The study contributes to both unconscious thought theory and information processing theory by exploring the interaction effect of the quantity and quality of information with thought mode in affecting the quality of purchasing decisions.
