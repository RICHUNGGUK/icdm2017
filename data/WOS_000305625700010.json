In production testing, EVM tests incur significant cost due to the large number of symbols required to ensure test quality. In our approach, EVM is decomposed into its deterministic (due to static impairments: IQ mismatch, gain, AM-AM and AM-PM) and random (due to dynamic impairments: VCO phase noise, thermal noise) components. The static impairments are computed from the device under test (DUT) response to an optimized multitone test input. The dynamic impairments are computed using signal processing algorithms from the DUT test response to the same test input. The EVM of the RF system is then derived from the computed static and dynamic impairments, respectively. Experimental results show that significant reduction in test time is possible without compromising EVM test quality.", "paper_title": "Low Cost EVM Testing of Wireless RF SoC Front-Ends Using Multitones", "paper_id": "WOS:000305625700010"}
