In this paper, we present a computational model of this ability. The model provides a possible explanation of contradictory results from experimental psychology related to this ability, namely explanation of why some experiments have reproduced the so-called \"disorientation effect\" while others have failed to do so. Additionally, in contrast to other computational models of various aspects of spatial cognition, our model is integrated within an intelligent virtual agent. Thus, on a more general level, this paper also demonstrates that it is possible to use intelligent virtual agents as a powerful research tool in computational cognitive sciences.
