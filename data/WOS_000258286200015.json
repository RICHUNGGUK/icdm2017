Appropriate analytical equations, based on maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), are derived and confirmed via computer simulation. Furthermore, the performance of the estimate using the Crammer-Rao bound is analyzed for the case in question, thus further revealing the possibility and potential of target 3-D position estimation. Setting the determinant maximum of the information matrix as the criterion, the optimal receiver position and multi-receiver configuration are analytically determined in the SS-BSAR system. Simulation results also validate the correctness of the analytical calculation.", "paper_title": "The possibility of isolated target 3-D position estimation and optimal receiver position determination in SS-BSAR", "paper_id": "WOS:000258286200015"}
