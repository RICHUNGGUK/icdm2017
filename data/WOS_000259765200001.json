Applications include the Wiener index, the Szeged index, the hyper-Wiener index, the PI index, the weighted Wiener index, Wiener-type indices, and classes of chemical graphs such as trees, benzenoid graphs and phenylenes. A computation of the Wiener index of art arbitrary connected graph using its canonical metric representation is described. Algorithmic issues are also briefly mentioned as well as are the recently introduced CI index and related polynomials.", "paper_title": "A bird's eye view of the cut method and a survey of its applications in chemical graph theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000259765200001"}
