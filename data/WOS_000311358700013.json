MSTs, also known as scan forest, greatly reduce test data volume and test application time in system-on-a-chip testing. Previous studies on layout-aware scan tree synthesis only address 2-D layouts, so they cannot be directly applied to 3-D ICs. The proposed algorithm effectively optimizes both test compression rate and routing length under 3-D IC-induced constraints, and produces better results than all previous known methods.", "paper_title": "Layout-Aware Multiple Scan Tree Synthesis for 3-D SoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000311358700013"}
