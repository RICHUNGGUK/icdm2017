Drawing on 528 papers retrieved from the database, Web of Science, we employed trend, factor, and clustering analyses to demonstrate that the standardization and innovation research has continuously grown from publication of 13 papers in 1995 to 68 papers in 2008; the majority of these papers have been published in the six subject group domains of management, economics, environment, chemistry, computer science, and telecommunications. Technology innovation management specialty journals are the most central sources favorable for these themes. We also present an exploratory taxonomy that offers nine topical clusters to demonstrate the contextual structures of standardization and innovation. The implications of our results for ongoing consistent policy and future research into standardization and innovation are discussed.", "paper_title": "Research profiling for 'standardization and innovation'", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210200017"}
