The main goal is a characterization of two important classes, convex and bi-elastic neighbourhoods. Those two classes are equivalently characterized through closure conditions with respect to Jeffrey's rule of conditioning. Moreover, some other interpretations of the closure property are given, including a description of behaviour of conditional expectation under the lower and upper expectation operators. This description is useful for a better understanding of some models in the theory of choice under risk. Further, closure under Jeffrey's rule can serve as an extension rule for partially determined interval probabilities. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc.
