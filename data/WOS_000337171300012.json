To tackle this issue, we suggest a method for identifying technology opportunities that is customized to the existing technologies and technological capabilities of SMEs through two-stage patent analysis. An expert-based technological attribute-application table makes it possible to identify basic opportunities by multiple keyword matching. Also, non-traditional opportunities can be explored and identified by an iterative action-object analysis of patents. This two-stage patent analysis approach provides managers with a way of identifying specific technology opportunities in which their existing technologies can be utilized to the maximum extent, therefore helping them to develop technology strategies.", "paper_title": "Technology opportunity identification customized to the technological capability of SMEs through two-stage patent analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000337171300012"}
