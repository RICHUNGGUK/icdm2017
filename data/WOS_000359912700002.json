The main works discussed are Petit Mal (1989-1995), Sympathetic Sentience (1996-1997), Fugitive I (1996-1997), Traces (1998-1999), and Fugitive II (2001-2004)full documentation at (www.simonpenny.net/works). These works were motivated by a critical analysis of cognitivist computer science, which contrasted with notions of embodied experience arising from the arts. The works address questions of agency and interaction, informed by cybernetics and artificial life.", "paper_title": "Emergence, Agency, and Interaction-Notes from the Field", "paper_id": "WOS:000359912700002"}
