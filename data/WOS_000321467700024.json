The base station (BS) of the primary users (PUs) will admit secondary users (SUs) to access by pricing their interference power under the interference power constraint (IPC). We give the optimal price for BS to maximize its revenue and the optimal interference cancellation order to minimize the total transmit power of SUs. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed pricing scheme.", "paper_title": "Pricing in Cognitive Radio Networks with Interference Cancellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321467700024"}
