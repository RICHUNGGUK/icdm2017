Our solution provides a systematic methodology that offers a well-defined sequence of stages to obtain executable converters for entity resolution mapping, given the types of entity attributes that are exchanged at model interfaces and the mapping specifications. Our methodology uses Event-B as the formal specification language and Discrete Event System Specification as the model composition framework; utilizes refinement relations between Event-B machines for the specification, verification and generation of the data conversion steps between models and employs a code generator that inputs the Event-B machine definitions to generate converter code that connects two model ports.", "paper_title": "A Methodology for Resolution Mapping for Cross-Resolution Simulation using Event-B", "paper_id": "WOS:000365157000002"}
