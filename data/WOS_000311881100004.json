We show how the systematic use of this simple but robust mechanism makes it possible to produce a DNA-fuelled molecular machine for reasoning with dispositions which are essential ingredients of commonsense of an individual. A biochemical reaction on DNA strands is used to activate DNA tweezers for reasoning with dispositions taken from the commonsense-based knowledge base. The dispositions are basically propositions that are preponderantly but not necessarily always true. The concept of dispositionality is closely related to the notion of usuality which provides a computational framework for commonsense reasoning. As human perception is usually represented in a vague qualitative fashion, we consider fuzzy set as one tool of engineering and try to mimic human intelligence of reasoning based on perception. Since childhood, an individual perceives the world around him/her and accordingly makes several commonsense-based judgements which are essentially reasoning with dispositions.", "paper_title": "Reasoning with disposition using DNA tweezers", "paper_id": "WOS:000311881100004"}
