In addition, we translated the I/O automaton into a corresponding PVS specification, and conducted a verification of the safety properties of the protocol using the assertional proof technique and the PVS theorem prover.", "paper_title": "Proving safety properties of an aircraft landing protocol using I/O automata and the PVS theorem prover: A case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000240312100005"}
