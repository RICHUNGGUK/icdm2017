The use of patterns is essential to get KM in collaborative NPD processes. This paper presents the use of patterns adopted in the CE-TILE project to standardize information and knowledge in collaborative work. The different types of patterns and models established for the knowledge capture, formalization and configuration are also described.", "paper_title": "Use of patterns for Knowledge Management in the ceramic tile design chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500009"}
