In particular, we study the problem of minimizing the maximum eigenvalue of an affine combination of symmetric matrices. At each step of the algorithm a restricted master problem in the primal space, corresponding to the relaxed dual (original) problem, is formed. A query point is obtained as an approximate analytic center of a bounded set that contains the optimal solution of the dual problem. The original objective function is evaluated at the query point, and depending on its differentiability a column or a matrix is added to the restricted master problem. We discuss the issues of recovering feasibility after the restricted master problem is updated by a column or a matrix. The computational experience of implementing the algorithm on randomly generated problems are reported and the cpu time of the matrix generation algorithm is compared with that of the primal-dual interior point methods on dense and sparse problems using the software SDPT3. Our numerical results illustrate that the matrix generation algorithm outperforms primal-dual interior point methods on dense problems with no structure and also on a class of sparse problems.", "paper_title": "A matrix generation approach for eigenvalue optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000242463900007"}
