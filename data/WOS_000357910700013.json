And group consensus protocols for discrete-time and continuous-time multi-agent systems are proposed. By using the tools of the Lyapunov function, LaSalle's invariance principle and graph theory, group consensus/finite-time group consensus conditions are obtained. Finally, two simulation examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in the paper. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
