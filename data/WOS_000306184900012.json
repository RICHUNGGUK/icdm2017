The existing ranking methods either do not provide a total ordering or cannot be effectively applied to decision-making processes. In this paper, we first give five basic principles that interval number ranking must satisfy, and construct a quantitative ranking model of interval numbers based on the synthesis effects of each index. We then propose a new constructions method of synthesis effect function systematically. Third, we also develop a new fuzzy numbers ranking model based on numerical characteristics, combining with the interval representation theorem of fuzzy numbers, and analyze the performance and characteristics of this ranking method by a case-based example. The results indicate that this proposed ranking method has good operability and interpretability, which can integrate the decision consciousness into decision process effectively and serve as a guideline for constructing different fuzzy decision methods.", "paper_title": "A QUANTITY PROPERTY-BASED FUZZY NUMBER RANKING METHOD FOR DECISION MAKING WITH UNCERTAINTY", "paper_id": "WOS:000306184900012"}
