More precisely, this paper extends the integrated assessment model Ada-BaHaMa to a game theoretic framework where several world regions define non-cooperatively their energy and climate policies all the while being affected by climate change damages induced by their total greenhouse gas emissions. The paper provides also a numerical illustration for a setting with two players.", "paper_title": "Combining Adaptation and Mitigation: A Game Theoretic Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000290699800002"}
