High-performance hardware and software can provide such functionality, but the use of aggressive technologies and architectures challenges time predictability and reliability. The authors propose a new approach to obtain trustworthy worst-case execution time estimates for safety-critical applications running on high-performance faulty hardware by using both timing-analysis techniques and minor hardware modifications.", "paper_title": "TIMING VERIFICATION OF FAULT-TOLERANT CHIPS FOR SAFETY-CRITICAL APPLICATIONS IN HARSH ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000346634000003"}
