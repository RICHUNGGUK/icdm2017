[13] describe a simple method for the creation of elliptic curves of prime order with embedding degree 3, 4, or 6. Such curves are important for the realisation of pairing-based cryptosystems on ordinary (non-supersingular) elliptic curves. We provide an alternative derivation of their results, and extend them to allow for the generation of many more suitable curves.", "paper_title": "Generating more MNT elliptic curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000234602200004"}
