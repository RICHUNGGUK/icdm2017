Partial agonists for nAChRs are currently being developed as drugs for the treatment of neurological diseases for their relative safety originated from reduced excessive stimulation. In the current study, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations and binding energy calculations were performed to theoretically investigate the interactions between the partial agonists, 4-OH-DMXBA and tropisetron with alpha 7-nAChR. The results suggest that the partial agonists 4-OH-DMXBA and tropisetron bind with alpha 7-nAChR in a binding mode similar to that with AChBP. The non-conserved residues in the binding sites contribute to the orientation deviation of these partial agonists from their orientation in AChBP. Energy calculation and decomposition using MM-GB/SA suggests that the van der Waals term (Delta E-VDW) is the main driving force for the binding of the partial agonists to alpha 7-nAChR. The molecular dynamics simulations showed that the opening of the C-loop binding with the partial agonists is in-between the openings for the binding with the full agonist and in the apo state. This conformation difference for the C-loop sheds light on the partial agonism of nAChR.", "paper_title": "Partial activation of alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: insights from molecular dynamics simulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000314051200038"}
