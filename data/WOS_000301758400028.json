We consider two common weakly supervised settings where: (1) users are linked to photos, not to faces and (2) photos are not labeled but part of a user's album. The focus is on algorithms that scale up to an entire online social network. We extensively evaluate different graph-based strategies to label faces in both settings and consider dependencies. We achieve results on a par with a recent multi-person approach, but with 60 times less computation time on a set of 300K weakly labeled faces and 1.4 M faces in user albums. A subset of the faces can be labeled with a speed-up of over three orders of magnitude. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
