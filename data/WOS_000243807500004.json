To deal with this problem, different approaches can be found in the literature. Recently, a new linguistic rule representation model was presented to perform a genetic lateral tuning of membership functions. It is based on the linguistic 2-tuples representation that allows the lateral displacement of a label considering an unique parameter. This way to work involves a reduction of the search space that eases the derivation of optimal models and therefore, improves the mentioned trade-off. Based on the 2-tuples rule representation, this work proposes a new method to obtain linguistic fuzzy systems by means of an evolutionary learning of the data base a priori (number of labels and lateral displacements) and a simple rule generation method to quickly learn the associated rule base. Since this rule generation method is run from each data base definition generated by the evolutionary algorithm, its selection is an important aspect. In this work, we also propose two new ad hoc data-driven rule generation methods, analyzing the influence of them and other rule generation methods in the proposed learning approach. The developed algorithms will be tested considering two different real-world problems. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
