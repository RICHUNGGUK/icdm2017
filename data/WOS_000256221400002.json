When designing a biocompatible solvent for the extractive fermentation process, many issues, such as extractive efficiency, conversion, amount of solvent utilized and so on, have to be considered. An interactive multiple-goal design procedure is introduced to determine a trade-off result in order to satisfy such contradicted goals. Both approaches could be iterated to solve the interactive multiple-goal design problem in order to yield a trade-off result. However, the crisp optimization design is a tedious task that requires the designer to provide various pairs of the upper bounds for the design problem to obtain the corresponding solution. The fuzzy optimization approach is able to be trade-off several goals simultaneously and to yield the overall satisfactory grade for the product/process design problem.
