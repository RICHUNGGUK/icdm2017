In this paper, an online pruning strategy is proposed to participate in the learning process of two constructive networks, i.e. fuzzy ARTMAP (FAM) and fuzzy ARTMAP with dynamic decay adjustment (FAMDDA), and the resulting hybrid networks are called FAM/FAMDDA with temporary nodes (i.e. FAM-T and FAMDDA-T, respectively). FAM-T and FAMDDA-T possess a capability of reducing the network complexity online by removing unrepresentative neurons. The performances of FAM-T and FAMDDA-T are evaluated and compared with those of FAM and FAMDDA using a total of 13 benchmark data sets. To demonstrate the applicability of FAM-T and FAMDDA-T, a real fault detection and diagnosis task in a power plant is tested. The results from both benchmark studies and real-world application show that FAMDDA-T and FAM-T are able to yield satisfactory classification performances, with the advantage of having parsimonious network structures.", "paper_title": "An online pruning strategy for supervised ARTMAP-based neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000264550900009"}
