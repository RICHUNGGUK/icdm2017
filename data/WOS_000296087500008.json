However, existing photo management programs and products that manage such photos still require extensive user effort to facilitate the sharing and browsing of images. It is especially difficult for novice users to manage and share photos. In this paper, we develop a round-robin concept-driven user preference feedback mechanism for achieving direct photo sharing, instant display, and easy management using optimized user controls and user preference-driven classification. Compared with commercial photo management systems, our proposed solution provides new features: optimized user controls, direct sharing and instant display, and user preference feedback driven classification. These new features boost the round-robin concept-driven user preference feedback. This paper proposes a photo finder that automatically searches for photos in storage spaces or cameras. The proposed photo finder relies on user preference feedback to share photos by leveraging user preferences, and the round-robin connection transmits photos to the family's digital photo frame or web album by arbiter. The proposed method saves time and spares users the effort required for photo management. Moreover, this method does not merely direct photo sharing and simple photo management, but it also increases the satisfaction level of users viewing the photos.", "paper_title": "Direct Share: Photo Management System Based on Round-robin Concept-driven User Preference Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000296087500008"}
