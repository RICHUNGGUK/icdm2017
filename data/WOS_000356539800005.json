This happens for example with scanned photographs and for most JPEG images. These images have undergone various nonlinear contrast changes and also linear and nonlinear filters. To deal with remnant noise in such images, we introduce a general nonparametric intensity and frequency-dependent noise model. We demonstrate by simulated and experiments with real images that this model, which requires the estimation of more than 1000 parameters, performs an efficient noise estimation. The proposed noise model is a patch model. Its estimation can therefore be used as a preliminary step to any patch-based denoising method. Our noise estimation method introduces several new tools for performing this complex estimation. One of them is a new sparse patch distance function permitting to find noisy patches with similar underlying geometry. A validation of the noise model and of its estimation method is obtained by comparing its results to ground-truth noise curves for both raw and JPEG-encoded images, and by visual inspection of the denoising results of real images. A fair comparison with the state of the art is also performed.", "paper_title": "Nonparametric Multiscale Blind Estimation of Intensity-Frequency-Dependent Noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000356539800005"}
