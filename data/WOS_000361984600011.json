The tail-injection and direct-injection divide-by-3 ILFD circuits in a standard CMOS process are realized with a pair of cross-coupled nMOSFETs with a dual-resonance LC-resonator. The locking range enhancement techniques such as linear mixer and quality-factor degradation are used to design wide-locking range divide-by-3 ILFD. At the incident power of 0 dBm the locking range of the divide-by-3 ILFD is 4.6 GHz (43.3 %), from the incident frequency 8.3 to 12.9 GHz.", "paper_title": "Divide-by-3 injection-locked frequency dividers using dual-resonance resonator", "paper_id": "WOS:000361984600011"}
