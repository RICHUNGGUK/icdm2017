Heterogeneous graphs are increasingly used to represent complex relationships in schema less data, which are usually queried using query graphs. Existing graph query systems offer little help to users in easily choosing the exact labels of the edges and vertices in the query graph. VI IQ helps users easily specify their exact query intent by providing a visual interface that lets them graphically add various query graph components, backed by an edge suggestion mechanism that suggests edges relevant to the user's query intent. In this demo we present: 1) a detailed description of the various features and user-friendly graphical interface of VI IQ, 2) a brief description of the edge suggestion algorithm, and 3) a demonstration scenario that we intend to show the audience.", "paper_title": "VIIQ: Auto-Suggestion Enabled Visual Interface for Interactive Graph Query Formulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000386424800071"}
