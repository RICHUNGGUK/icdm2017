A regularized zero forcing precoder is employed at the BS to manage the inter-user interference within the cell. Using methods from random matrix theory, we derive a deterministic approximation for the achievable ergodic sum rate, taking into account the randomness from both fading and random user locations. The obtained approximation describes well the behavior of finite-sized systems and enables efficient optimization of the precoder matrix.", "paper_title": "On the Asymptotic Sum Rate of Downlink Cellular Systems With Random User Locations", "paper_id": "WOS:000377306800027"}
