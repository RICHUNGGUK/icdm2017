We propose a new image representation method for visual sensor networks based on compressive sensing (CS). CS is a new sampling method for sparse signals, which is able to compress the input data in the sampling process. Combining both signal sampling and data compression, CS is more capable of image representation for reducing the computation complexity in image/video encoder in visual sensor networks where computation resource is extremely limited. Since CS is more efficient for sparse signals, in our scheme, the input image is firstly decomposed into two components, i.e., dense and sparse components; then the dense component is encoded by the traditional approach OPEC or JPEG 2000) while the sparse component is encoded by a CS technique. In order to improve the rate distortion performance, we leverage the strong correlation between dense and sparse components by using a piecewise autoregressive model to construct a prediction of the sparse component from the corresponding dense component. Given the measurements and the prediction of the sparse component as initial guess, we use projection onto convex set (POCS) to reconstruct the sparse component. Our method considerably reduces the number of random measurements needed for CS reconstruction and the decoding computational complexity, compared to the existing CS methods. In addition, our experimental results show that our method may achieves up to 2 dB gain in PSNR over the existing CS based schemes, for the same number of measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
