These upper body motions can effectively solve the stability problem of feet spin for robot walk. We analyze the ground reactive torque, separate the yaw moment as the compensating object and discuss the effect of arms swinging on whole body locomotion. By taking the ZMP as the reference point, trunk spin motion and arms swinging motion are generated to improve the biped motion stability, based on compensating for the yaw moment. The methods are further compared from the energy consumption point of view. Simulated experimental results validate the performance and the feasibility of the proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Arm/trunk motion generation for humanoid robot", "paper_id": "WOS:000279689900013"}
