The result is a closed-form representation, on a prescribed compact set chosen a priori, of the feedback strategies and the value function that solves the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation. The closed-loop stability, L(2)-gain disturbance attenuation of the neural network saturated control feedback strategy, and uniform convergence results are proven. Finally, this approach is applied to the rotational/translational actuator (RTAC) nonlinear benchmark problem under actuator saturation, offering guaranteed stability and disturbance attenuation.", "paper_title": "Neurodynamic programming and zero-sum games for constrained control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000258182700008"}
