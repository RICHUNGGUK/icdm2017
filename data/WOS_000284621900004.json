Inspection of the 25 structures, namely the one closest to the respective centroid of each cluster, shows that the molecules are structurally more diverse as compared to a subset of 25 selected randomly. It is expected that such methods based on easily calculated descriptors may find applications in new drug discovery from the analysis of libraries of interesting lead compounds.", "paper_title": "Use of Mathematical Structural Invariants in Analyzing Combinatorial Libraries: A Case Study with Psoralen Derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000284621900004"}
