Unfortunately, it becomes more and more recognized by the industry that a cloud-computing platform could not cover all aspects of IT layers engaged in infrastructure, platform and application. In practice, end users' requests are nearly unlimited; while the services held by a cloud-computing platform is relatively limited, no matter in service category or in service capacity. In view of this challenge, an elastic cloud platform is investigated by recruited outside services that are absent from the cloud platform. Concretely, through dynamically hiring a qualified service on Internet to replace the absent service inside a cloud platform, an elastic cloud platform could nearly provide unlimited capabilities in an outsourcing service way, e.g., computing power, storage, application functions, etc. At last, the validity of the method is evaluated by a case study.", "paper_title": "An evaluation method of outsourcing services for developing an elastic cloud platform", "paper_id": "WOS:000313166000001"}
