Suppose a Boolean function g : {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1} cannot be computed on more thyan a fraction 1 - delta of inputs by any deterministic time T and space S algorithm, where delta <= 1/t for some t. Then for t-step walks w = (v(1),...,v(t)) in some explicit d-regular expander graph on 2(n) vertices, the function g'(w) def = (g( v1),..., g( vt)) cannot be computed on more than a fraction 1 - Omega(t delta) of inputs by any deterministic time approximate to T/d(t) - poly(n) and space approximate to S - O(t) algorithm. As an application, by iterating this construction, we get a deterministic linear-space \"worst-case to constant average-case\" hardness amplification reduction, as well as a family of logspace encodable/decodable error-correcting codes that can correct up to a constant fraction of errors. Logspace encodable/decodable codes (with linear-time encoding and decoding) were previously constructed by Spielman ( 1996). Our codes have weaker parameters (encoding length is polynomial, rather than linear), but have a conceptually simpler construction. The proof of our Direct Product lemma is inspired by Dinur's remarkable proof of the PCP theorem by gap amplification using expanders (Dinur 2006).", "paper_title": "HARDNESS AMPLIFICATION VIA SPACE-EFFICIENT DIRECT PRODUCTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000261329700002"}
