However, since many wireless mesh networks have user contributed devices as their nodes, to guarantee the cooperation of such selfish nodes is a highly challenging problem. In this paper, we study how to stimulate selfish nodes to cooperate in wireless mesh networks using network coding. We propose a simple, practical reputation system that rewards cooperative behavior in routing and packet forwarding and penalizes non-cooperative behavior. Simulation results verify that our reputation system is very efficient and that it effectively stimulates cooperation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
