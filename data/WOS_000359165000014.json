The activation functions considered are no longer required to be derivable. By constructing appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals and taking advantage of the free weighting matrix method, several sufficient and delay-dependent criteria are established to ensure the global mu-stability of the complex-valued neural networks, which can be easily checked by the Matlab Toolbox. Finally, three numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our theoretical results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
