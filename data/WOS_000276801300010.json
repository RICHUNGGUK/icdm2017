In [1], we presented a new privacy metric, delta-presence, that clearly links the quality of anonymization to the risk posed by inadequate anonymization. It was shown that existing anonymization techniques are inappropriate for situations where delta-presence is a good metric (specifically, where knowing an individual is in the database poses a privacy risk). This article addresses a practical problem with [1], extending to situations where the data anonymizer is not assumed to have complete world knowledge. The algorithms are evaluated in the context of a real-world scenario, demonstrating practical applicability of the approach.", "paper_title": "delta-Presence without Complete World Knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000276801300010"}
