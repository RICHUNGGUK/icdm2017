We assume that the undelayed part generates an analytic resolvent operator and transform it into an integral equation. Sufficient conditions for the existence of solutions are derived by means of the Sadovskii fixed point theorem combined with theories of analytic resolvent operators. An example is given to illustrate the theory. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
