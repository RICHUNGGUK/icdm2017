Specifically, we focus on analyzing various combinations of collaborative spectrum sensing and Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol abstractions. We decompose collaborative spectrum sensing into layers, parametrize each layer, classify existing solutions, and propose a new protocol called Truncated Time Division Multiple Access (TTDMA) that supports efficient distribution of sensing results in \"kappa out of N\" fusion rule. In case of multichannel MAC protocols, we evaluate two main approaches of control channel design with 1) dedicated and 2) hopping channel. We propose to augment these protocols with options of handling secondary user (SU) connections preempted by primary user (PU) by 1) connection buffering until PU departure and 2) connection switching to a vacant PU channel. By comparing and optimizing different design combinations, we show that 1) it is generally better to buffer preempted SU connections than to switch them to PU vacant channels and 2) TTDMA is a promising design option for collaborative spectrum sensing process when kappa does not change over time.", "paper_title": "Performance of Joint Spectrum Sensing and MAC Algorithms for Multichannel Opportunistic Spectrum Access Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000290668400008"}
