In this study, we utilise a novel approach to automatically recover the shape of hand outlines from a series of 2D training images. Automated landmark extraction is accomplished through the use of the self-organising model the growing neural gas (GNG) network, which is able to learn and preserve the topological relations of a given set of input patterns without requiring a priori knowledge of the structure of the input space. The GNG is compared to other self-organising networks such as Kohonen and Neural Gas (NG) maps and results are given for the training set of hand outlines, showing that the proposed method preserves accurate models.", "paper_title": "Growing neural gas (GNG): A soft competitive learning method for 2D hand modelling", "paper_id": "WOS:000238961900019"}
