Effective nesting packs the parts optimally and maximises the remnant on the substrate. This article describes how simulated annealing (SA) was made to operate effectively as the optimisation process. Key issues affecting the use of SA are described. The methods described were integrated into a software package and applied to the aerospace and steel industries. This method operated in real-time and produced quality nesting solutions.", "paper_title": "A method for optimising the nesting of multiple, highly complex shapes using a modified simulated annealing algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000263367600005"}
