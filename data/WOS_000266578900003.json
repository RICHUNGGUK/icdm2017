The proposed SVM based security assessment algorithm has a very small training time and space in comparison with the traditional machine learning methods such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) based algorithms. In addition, the proposed algorithm is faster than existing algorithms. One of the main points, to apply a machine learning method is feature selection. In this paper, a new Decision Tree (DT) based feature selection algorithm has been presented. The proposed SVM algorithm has been applied to New England 39-bus power system. The simulation results show the effectiveness and the stability of the proposed method for on-line static security assessment. The effectiveness of the proposed feature selection algorithm has been investigated, too. The proposed feature selection algorithm has been compared with different feature selection algorithms. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed feature algorithm.", "paper_title": "Application of multi-class support vector machines for power system on-line static security assessment using DT - based feature and data selection algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000266578900003"}
