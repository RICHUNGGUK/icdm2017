The present study assessed the drop reliability of four different component boards. The component boards were tested at elevated temperatures and also simulated via the finite element method. It has been found that temperature had a significant influence on the drop reliability of the component boards. Therefore, numerical experiments were designed to elucidate the temperature effects on the reliability. The simulation results provide convincing explanations for the three failure modes distinguished by the fracture morphologies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
