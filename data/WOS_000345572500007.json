Despite numerous methods having been proposed in tree modelling, it is still a non-trivial task and challenging. In this paper, we present a new variational computing approach for generating realistic trees in specific shapes. Instead of directly modelling trees from symbolic rules, we formulate the tree modelling as an optimization process, in which a variational cost function is iteratively minimized. This cost function measures the difference between the guidance shape and the target tree crown. In addition, to faithfully capture the branch structure of trees, several botanical factors, including the minimum total branches volume and spatial branches patterns, are considered in the optimization to guide the tree modelling process. We demonstrate that our approach is applicable to generate trees with different shapes, from interactive design and complex polygonal meshes.", "paper_title": "Variational Tree Synthesis", "paper_id": "WOS:000345572500007"}
