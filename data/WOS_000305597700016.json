The designed system is based on the Cleveland and Hungarian Heart Disease datasets. Since the datasets consist of many input attributes, decision tree (DT) was used to unravel the attributes that contribute towards the diagnosis. The output of the DT was converted into crisp if-then rules and then transformed into fuzzy rule base. PSO was employed to tune the fuzzy membership functions (MFs). Having applied the optimized MFs, the generated fuzzy expert system has yielded 93.27% classification accuracy. The major advantage of this approach is the ability to interpret the decisions made from the created fuzzy expert system, when compared with other approaches. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
