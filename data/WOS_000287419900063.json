The FMCDM approach allows decision makers (DMs) to evaluate alternatives using linguistic terms such as very high, high, slightly high, medium, slightly low, low, very low or none rather than precise numerical values, allows them to express their opinions independently, and also provides an algorithm to aggregate the assessments of alternatives. Three numerical examples are investigated using the FMCDM approach to illustrate its applications. It is shown that the FMCDM approach offers a flexible, practical and effective way of group decision making. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
