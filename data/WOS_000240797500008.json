In recent years, efficient network search algorithms have been developed for a noise-free case and for a limited function class. In general, the conventional algorithm has the high time complexity of O(2(2k) mn(k+1)) where m is the number of measurements, n is the number of nodes (genes), and k is the number of input parents. Here, we suggest a simple and new approach to Boolean networks, and provide a randomized network search algorithm with average time complexity O(mn(k+1)/(log m)((k-1))). We show the efficiency of our algorithm via computational experiments, and present optimal parameters. Additionally, we provide tests for yeast expression data.", "paper_title": "An efficient top-down search algorithm for learning Boolean networks of gene expression", "paper_id": "WOS:000240797500008"}
