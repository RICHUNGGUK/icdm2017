In this paper, we give crypt-analysis to Hwang et al.'s certificateless encryption scheme which is the first concrete certificateless encryption scheme that can be proved to be secure against \"malicious-but-passive\" key generation center (KGC) attack in the standard model. Their scheme is proved to be insecure even in a weaker security model called \"honest-but-curious\" KGC attack model. We then propose an improved scheme which is really secure against \"malicious-but-passive\" KGC attack in the standard model.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis and improvement of a certificateless encryption scheme in the standard model", "paper_id": "WOS:000329625400012"}
