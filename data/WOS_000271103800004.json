In effect. the modified equations for standard multi-symplectic methods and for space-time splitting methods satisfy a conformal multi-symplectic property, and the splitting schemes exactly preserve global symplecticity in a special case. It is also shown that the splitting schemes yield incorrect rates of energy/momentum dissipation, but this IS not the case for standard multi-symplectic schemes. These methods work best. for problems where the dissipation coefficients are small, and a forced-damped semi-linear wave equation is considered as an example Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of IMACS.", "paper_title": "Conformal multi-symplectic integration methods for forced-damped semi-linear wave equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000271103800004"}
