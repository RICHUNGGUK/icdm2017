The search can be accomplished with any searching scheme that the Search Engines wish to provide, as long as certain security constraints are met. However we propose specific algorithms that demonstrate an efficient way to search video data without sacrificing security effectiveness of the system. The search is completed without the End Users or Search Engines needing to purchase the premium content beforehand, and without the Content Providers needing to purchase the search technology. The business motivation of this technique is to assist End Users to purchase content best suiting their requirements-they are offered search results only, not actual content. The objective is to face the problem caused by the current segregation between content ownership and video processing technology ownership. To face this segregation, we present an architecture that guarantees security of Content Provider's data and Search Engine's technology and we also present two innovative algorithms that make real time video searching a feasible process. Particularly these algorithms (a) organize video content into a graph based hierarchical structure and (b) perform content guided, non interactive and real time search by exploiting the graph based video structures. The proposed algorithms are incorporated in the presented architecture under the given security constraints. Experimental results and comparisons with conventional techniques are presented to demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed algorithms.", "paper_title": "A secure framework exploiting content guided and automated algorithms for real time video searching", "paper_id": "WOS:000264487500005"}
