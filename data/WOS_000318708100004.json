The process inevitably results in mistakes contrary to the painter's original intention. This is a distinguishing factor between painting and photography, but this is the essence of the beauty of painting. The inadequacy of a human being to make a painting exactly as he pleases (as a photograph creates a direct representation of itself) is the starting point of creating a creative work. This paper explains the algorithm that reproduces human errors, as well as the stroke data collection method. Although the results of this research are mainly stylized renderings of modern oil paintings, they have unlimited scalability, in that they can play the role to perform a basic framework. These allow the experimentation with many painting styles through the modification of input data and error generation algorithms.", "paper_title": "Interactive painterly rendering with artistic error correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000318708100004"}
