Conventional CoMFA requires at least 3 orders of experimental data, such as IC50 and K-i, to obtain a good model, although practically there are many screening assays where biological activity is measured only by a rating scale. Hence, rating classification-oriented CoMFA coupled with ordinal logistic regression has been developed, and its predictive ability and 3D graphical analysis ability have been investigated. As a result, this novel CoMFA (Logistic CoMFA) has been found to be more robust than conventional CoMFAs in both predictive and 3D graphical analysis abilities. Furthermore, Logistic CoMFA is useful since it can provide the probability of each rank.", "paper_title": "Ordinal classification using comparative molecular field analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000252713700021"}
