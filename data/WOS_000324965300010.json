The structural similarities between two piperazine derivatives: PMS-601, showing a dual activity for anti-PAF and anti-HIV activity, and BMS-378806, known to inhibit HIV-1 gp120, motivated us to merge important structural features of the two compounds. Novel piperazine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated in vitro concerning their ability to inhibit HIV-1 replication in in vitro infected lymphocytes. We described an approach that combines molecular docking, molecular dynamics, MM-PBSA calculations and conformational analysis to rationally predict piperazine derivatives binding mode with HIV-1 gp120. We also inquired about the conformational adaptability of the molecules, upon complex formation, and its importance to their respective inhibitory activity. The analysis suggested that the impact of the flexibility of these molecules revealed to be more important, in the context of drug design, than it has generally been assumed. These new insights at the atomic level might be useful to design inhibitors with improved antiviral activity. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
