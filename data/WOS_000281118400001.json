The combined effects of population growth, climate change, and rural industrialization have led to greater demand for an increasingly scarce resource. Ensuring that communities have adequate access to water-an essential requirement for community health and prosperity-requires finegrained management policies based on real-time in situ data, both environmental and hydrological. To address this requirement at the state level, we have developed the South Carolina Digital Watershed, an end-to-end system for monitoring water resources. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of the core system components: (i) in situ sensing hardware, (ii) collection and uplink facilities, (iii) data streaming middleware, and (iv) back-end repository and presentation services. We conclude by discussing key organizational and technical challenges encountered during the development process.", "paper_title": "The South Carolina Digital Watershed: End-to-End Support for Real-Time Management of Water Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000281118400001"}
