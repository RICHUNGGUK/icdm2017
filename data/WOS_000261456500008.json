The well-known Perlin noise function is generated by interpolation of a pre-defined random number table. This table must be modified if user-defined constraints are to be satisfied, but modification can destroy the stability of the table. We integrate statistical tools for measuring the stability of a random number table with user constraints within an optimization procedure, so as to create a controlled random number table which nevertheless has a uniform random distribution, no periodicity, and a band-limited property.
