This novel system takes advantage of the improvements introduced by Alpha-Beta associative memories, an efficient, unconventional model of associative memory of recent creation. The results are demonstrated through experiments on a relatively small database with 1001 samples prepared by the authors. However, the approach is considered valid according to the tendency of the results obtained, in part, thanks to the performance exhibited by Alpha-Beta associative memories.", "paper_title": "A novel approach to automatic color matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400055"}
