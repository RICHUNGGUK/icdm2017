Dredged silt undergoing hydration and high-temperature sintering was made into a lightweight aggregate for concrete mixing. The workability and durability of the resulting concrete were examined. The LWAC made from dredged silt had high flowability, which implies good workability. Additionally, the LWAC also had good compressive, strength and anti-corrosion properties, high surface electrical resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity as well as low chloride penetration, all of which are indicators of good durability.", "paper_title": "Study on durability of densified high-performance lightweight aggregate concrete", "paper_id": "WOS:000252031100005"}
