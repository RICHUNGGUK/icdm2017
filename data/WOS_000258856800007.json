This procedure helps us to select design variables as well as suitable preassigned parameters for an ISM implementation. It also aids us in the convergence of our ISM algorithm. We investigated and solved a microstrip notch filter using this technique. This shows that tuning-aided sensitivity analysis guides the parameter selections and enhances the performance of ISM optimization.
