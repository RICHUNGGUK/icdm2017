In this paper we propose a new strategy to transfer deformable part models (DPMs) for object detection, using offline-trained auxiliary DPMs of similar categories as source models to improve the performance of the target object detector. A DPM presents an object by using a root filter and several part filters. We use these filters of the auxiliary DPMs as prior knowledge and adapt the filters to the target object. With a latent transfer learning method, appropriate local features are extracted for the transfer of part filters. Our experiments demonstrate that this strategy can lead to a detector superior to some state-of-the-art methods.", "paper_title": "Deformable Part-Based Model Transfer for Object Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000342784200047"}
