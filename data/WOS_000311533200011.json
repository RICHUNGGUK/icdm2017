Mathematical tools such as graphical models, scheduling techniques, operations research, and simulation have enabled engineers to create models that represent activities, resources, and the environment under which a project is taking place. Traditionally, most simulation paradigms use static or historical data to create computer interpretable representations of real engineering systems. The suitability of this approach for modeling construction operations, however, has always been a challenge since most construction projects are unique in nature as every project is different in design, specifications, methods, and standards. Due to the dynamic nature and complexity of most construction operations, there is a significant need for a methodology that combines the capabilities of traditional modeling of engineering systems and real time field data collection. This paper presents the requirements and applicability of a data-driven modeling framework capable of collecting and manipulating real time field data from construction equipment, creating dynamic 3D visualizations of ongoing engineering activities, and updating the contents of a discrete event simulation model representing the real engineering system. The developed framework can be adopted for use by project decision-makers for short-term project planning and control since the resulting simulation and visualization are completely based on the latest status of project entities.
