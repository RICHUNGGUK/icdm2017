Our bounds match Ajtai's simulation of randomized depth-d circuits by deterministic depth-(d + 2) circuits (Ann. Pure Appl. Logic; '83) and provide an example where randomization buys resources. To rule out deterministic circuits, we combine HAyenstad's switching lemma with an earlier depth-3 lower bound by the author (Computational Complexity 2009). To exhibit randomized circuits, we combine recent analyses by Amano (ICALP '09) and Brody and Verbin (FOCS '10) with derandomization. To make these circuits explicit, we construct a new, simple pseudorandom generator that fools tests for with error 1/n and seed length O(lg n), improving on the seed length of previous constructions.", "paper_title": "Randomness Buys Depth for Approximate Counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000340838000002"}
