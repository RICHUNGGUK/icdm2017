(2) Another image-region highly correlated with the to-be-restored image-region is identified through \"Long-Range Correlation\" with statistically designed search-ranges and match-criterion. (3) The center of the to-be-restored image-region is replaced using a proposed recovering approach. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed method's superior impulse-noise removal capability vis-a-vis other recent approaches.", "paper_title": "Image restoration based on Laplacian preprocessed long-range correlation", "paper_id": "WOS:000255742300005"}
