The performance experienced with a commercially available RFID system is compared with the theoretical performance derived from an analytical discrete framework. Also through experimentation, the effects of parameters including RF power, the number of reads, and tag density are assessed, and their performance trade-offs are characterized to suggest guidelines for potential field deployment.
