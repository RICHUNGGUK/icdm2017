Nevertheless, time and resources budgeted to testing are often underestimated with respect to the target quality goals. Test managers need engineering methods to perform appropriate choices in spending testing resources, so as to maximize the outcome. We present a method to dynamically allocate testing resources to software components minimizing the estimated number of residual defects and/or the estimated residual defect density. We discuss the application to a real-world critical system in the homeland security domain. We describe a support tool aimed at easing industrial technology transfer by hiding to practitioners the mathematical details of the method application.", "paper_title": "Dynamic test planning: a study in an industrial context", "paper_id": "WOS:000209673300011"}
