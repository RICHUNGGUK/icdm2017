Motion improvement of the hatch door is implemented by two kinds of passive designs. Firstly, a single-layer optimization model for trajectory modification is developed to find the optimum size of the key parts of the control mechanism. Secondly, a novel nested bi-level optimization model is presented for the design of the size tolerance limits of the selected parts. The design objective is minimization of the total extremum deviation of the motion trajectory of the objective point of the hatch door, where the extremum deviation is obtained by solution of the inner-level size optimization problem for the fixed size tolerance limits. The optimization models for motion control of the hatch door mechanism are solved using the response surface method. Numerical examples show that the precision of the real running trajectory of the objective point of the hatch door mechanism may be improved effectively by using the methods presented. A home-made multi-body dynamics solver (THUSOLVER) and the corresponding optimization software have been developed to implement the above tasks.", "paper_title": "Optimization of the motion control mechanism of the hatch door of airliner", "paper_id": "WOS:000355760000014"}
