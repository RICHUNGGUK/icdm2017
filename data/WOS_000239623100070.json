The advantage of the control approach is that no knowledge about the robot model is required. This property is very useful in practical situations, where the exact knowledge about the robot parameters is almost unattainable. The proposed approach has been experimentally tested on an Omnidirectional RoboCup Player available at the Robotics Lab of the University of Stuttgart.", "paper_title": "Velocity control of an omnidirectional RoboCup player with recurrent neural networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623100070"}
