The difference is that in DLs objects are described not only by attributes but also by binary relationships between objects. In this paper, we develop the first bisimulation-based method of concept learning in DLs for the following setting: given a knowledge base KB in a DL, a set of objects standing for positive examples and a set of objects standing for negative examples, learn a concept C in that DL such that the positive examples are instances of C w.r.t. KB, while the negative examples are not instances of C w.r.t. KB. We also prove soundness of our method and investigate its C-learnability.", "paper_title": "Bisimulation-Based Concept Learning in Description Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000343008800014"}
