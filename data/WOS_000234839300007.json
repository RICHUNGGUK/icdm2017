Furthermore, let (R-rs)(r).(s is an element of Z) be the natural bifiltration of the ring R and let (M-rs)(r,s is an element of Z) be the corresponding natural bifiltration of the R-module M = R/1 associated with the given set of generators introduced by Levin. The author shows an algorithm for constructing a characteristic set G = {g(1),....g(s)} of 1 with respect to a special type of reduction introduced by Levin, that allows one to find the Hilbert polynomial in two variables of the bifiltered and bigraded R-module R/1. This algorithm can be easily extended to the case of bifiltered R-submodules of free R-modules of finite rank p over R. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
