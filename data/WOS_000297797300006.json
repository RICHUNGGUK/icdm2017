Even if some of the shadows are compromised, the secret will not be revealed as long as the number of the compromised shadows is smaller than a pre-determined threshold. Moreover, there are some necessary details of concerns: the malicious tampering on shadows must be detectable; the shadows must be concealed in a camouflage image with adequate quality to reduce suspicion and possible attack; color image properties must be considered. In addition to these concerns, in this paper, an adaptable mechanism is further designed to balance the hiding quantity and the quality of camouflage image depending on different applications. This is an important and interesting aspect that has never been discussed in previous research.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Secret Sharing for Color Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300006"}
