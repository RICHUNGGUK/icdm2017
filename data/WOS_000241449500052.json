Existing branch predictor designs are all based on the behavior of applications on a GPP (general purpose processor). However, for an embedded system, such as smart phone, multimedia applications are the main workload. Therefore, in this paper, we perform detailed analysis on the branch behavior of multimedia applications. We believe that identifying important characteristics of the branch behavior of multimedia applications is important for designing a branch predictor for embedded processors.", "paper_title": "Branch behavior characterization for multimedia applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241449500052"}
