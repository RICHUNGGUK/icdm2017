Two types of targets are presented. For each type of target, we develop a corresponding optimum waveform designing method to optimize detection performance. Based on Chernoff-Stein lemma, we use relative entropy as the performance measure. We show that the optimum waveform designing method can obtain better detection performance than traditional orthogonal waveform designing method.", "paper_title": "Target models and waveform design for detection in MIMO radar", "paper_id": "WOS:000332596000021"}
