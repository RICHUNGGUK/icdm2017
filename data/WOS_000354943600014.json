Much less is known regarding their finite-length performance. We propose a scaling law to predict the error probability of finite-length spatially coupled code ensembles when transmission takes place over the binary erasure channel. We discuss how the parameters of the scaling law are connected to fundamental quantities appearing in the asymptotic analysis of these ensembles and we verify that the predictions of the scaling law fit well to the data derived from simulations over a wide range of parameters. The ultimate goal of this line of research is to develop analytic tools for the design of SC-LDPC codes under practical constraints.", "paper_title": "A Scaling Law to Predict the Finite-Length Performance of Spatially-Coupled LDPC Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000354943600014"}
