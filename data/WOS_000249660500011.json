In constructing such an animation, we should consider about many factors, such as the content of the utterance and the state of conversation, which necessitates a large amount of time and labor. To deal with this problem, this paper proposes a method, which generates the head-eye movements of the CG characters synchronized with the conversation. In this method, so as to generate a composite head-eye movement, the view line direction is divided into the head, eye and body rotations by sharing motion mechanism dynamically adjusted according to the view line direction. And letting the two modules generating the head and the eye movements share the same conversation state, head and eye movements synchronized with the conversation are generated. Finally, we apply the proposed method to the conversation scenes, and show that natural animation can be produced easily.", "paper_title": "Head-eye animation corresponding to a conversation for CG characters", "paper_id": "WOS:000249660500011"}
