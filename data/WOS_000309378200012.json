In this paper, we present a new logic-based language to specify commitment-based protocols, which is derived from ACTL*(c), a logic extending CTL* with modalities to represent and reason about social commitments and their actions. We present a reduction technique that formally transforms the problem of model checking ACTL*(c) to the problem of model checking GCTL* (an extension of CTL* with action formulae). We prove that the reduction technique is sound and we fully implement it on top of the CWB-NC model checker to automatically verify the NetBill protocol, a motivated and specified example in the proposed specification language. We also apply the proposed technique to check the compliance of another protocol: the Contract Net protocol with given properties and report and discuss the obtained results. We finally develop a new symbolic algorithm to perform model checking dedicated to the proposed logic. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
