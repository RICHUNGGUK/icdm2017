An artificial neural network ( ANN) based model is developed for prediction of depth of cut by considering the diameter of focusing nozzle along with the controllable process parameters such as water pressure, abrasive flow rate, jet traverse rate. ANN model combined with genetic algorithm (GA), i.e. neuro-genetic approach, is proposed to suggest the process parameters. Further, the merits of the proposed approach is shown by comparing the results obtained with the proposed approach to the results obtained with fuzzy-genetic approach [ P. S. Chakravarthy, N. Ramesh Babu, A hybrid approach for selection of optimal process parameters in abrasive water jet cutting, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part B: J. Eng. Manuf. 214 ( 2000) 781-791]. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is assessed by conducting the experiments with the suggested process parameters and comparing them with the desired results. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
