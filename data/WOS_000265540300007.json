They are widely used by search tools to classify new protein sequences into families based on domain architecture. However, the proliferation of known motifs and new proteomic sequence data poses a computational challenge for search, requiring days of CPU time to annotate an organism's proteome. It is highly desirable to speed up HMM search in large databases. We design PROSITE-like patterns and short profiles that are used as filters to rapidly eliminate protein-motif pairs for which a full profile HMM comparison does not yield a significant match. The design of the pattern-based filters is formulated as a multichoice knapsack problem. Profile-based filters with high sensitivity are extracted from a profile HMM based on their theoretical sensitivity and false positive rate. Experiments show that our profile-based filters achieve high sensitivity (near 100 percent) while keeping around 20x speedup with respect to the unfiltered search program. Pattern-based filters typically retain at least 90 percent of the sensitivity of the source HMM with 30-40x speedup. The profile-based filters have sensitivity comparable to the multistage filtering strategy HMMERHEAD [15] and are faster in most of our experiments.", "paper_title": "Designing Patterns and Profiles for Faster HMM Search", "paper_id": "WOS:000265540300007"}
