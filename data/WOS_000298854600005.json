The spectrum of values of v for which there exists a 1-rotational STS(v) under a cyclic, an abelian, or a dicyclic group, has been established in Phelps and Rosa (Discrete Math 33:57-66, 1981), Buratti (J Combin Des 9:215-226, 2001) and Mishima (Discrete Math 308:2617-2619, 2008), respectively. Nevertheless, the spectrum of values of v for which there exists a 1-rotational STS(v) under an arbitrary group has not been completely determined yet. This paper is a considerable step forward to the solution of this problem. In fact, we leave as uncertain cases only those for which we have v = (p (3)-p)n + 1 1 (mod 96) with p a prime, n not equivalent to 0 (mod 4), and the old part of (p(3) - p)n that is square-free and without prime factors congruent to 1 (mod 6).", "paper_title": "Some progress on the existence of 1-rotational Steiner triple systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000298854600005"}
