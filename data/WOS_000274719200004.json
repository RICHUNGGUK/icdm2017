While previous algorithms require user-assisted definition of complicated correspondences between the morphing objects, our algorithm defines the correspondence by overlapping the input polygons. Once the morphing of one object into another is defined, very little or no user interaction is necessary to achieve intuitive results. Our algorithm is suitable namely for growth-like morphing. We present the basic algorithm and its three variations. One of them is suitable mainly for convex polygons, the other two are for more complex polygons, such as curved or spiral polygonal forms.", "paper_title": "An intuitive polygon morphing", "paper_id": "WOS:000274719200004"}
