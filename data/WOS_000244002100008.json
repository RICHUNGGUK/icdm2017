Understanding and representing the complexity of multi-scale patterns in maps and spatial models are key research objectives. We describe the use of three types of correlation analyses: (1) a standard Pearson correlation coefficient, (2) a 'global' multi-scale correlation, and (3) local geographically weighted correlation. These methods were applied to topographic and vegetation indices in a small catchment in Honduras that is representative of the country's hillsides agroecosystem which suffers from severe environmental degradation due to land-use decisions that lead to deforestation, overgrazing, and unsustainable agricultural. If the geographical scale at which topography matters for land-use allocation call be determined, then integration of knowledge systems can be focused. Out preliminary results show that: (1) single-scale correlations do not adequately represent the relationship between NDVI and topographic indices; (2) peaks in the global multi-scale correlations in agricultural areas coincided with the median farm size, but there was no evidence of any community or larger-scale land-use planning or optimization; and (3) local multi-scale correlations varied considerably front the global results at all scales, and these variations have a strong spatial structure which may indicate local optimization of land use.", "paper_title": "Multi-scale correlations between topography and vegetation in a hillside catchment of Honduras", "paper_id": "WOS:000244002100008"}
