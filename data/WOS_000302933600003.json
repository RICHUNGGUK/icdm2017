This extension relies on two key techniques: the secondary reconstruction and the successive limiting procedure. These techniques are discussed in detail in the present paper. Numerical experiments shows that this limiting procedure is very effective in removing numerical oscillations in the vicinity of discontinuities. And furthermore this procedure is efficient, robust and accuracy preserving. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
