In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Routing Algorithm for priority Guarantee (called DRAG) in low duty-cycled sensor networks. Both schemes of dynamic forwarding decision making and priority-based schedule are used in DRAG to achieve priority guarantee in low duty-cycled sensor networks. We evaluate DRAG via extensive simulations and the results show that DRAG can achieve good performance in delivery ratio and network delay.", "paper_title": "DRAG: A Priority-Guaranteed Routing for Sensor Networks with Low Duty Cycles", "paper_id": "WOS:000297084200003"}
