However, one of their disadvantages, in contrast with the visual BCIs, is their lower performance that makes them not adequate in applications that require a high accuracy. To overcome this disadvantage, we employed a Bayesian approach in which the DL-BCI was modeled as a Binary phase shift keying receiver for which the accuracy can be estimated a priori as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio. The results showed the measured accuracy to match the predefined target accuracy, thus validating this model that made possible to estimate in advance the classification accuracy on a trial-by-trial basis. This constitutes a novel methodology in the design of fully auditory DL-BCIs that let us first, define the target accuracy for a specific application and second, classify when the signal-to-noise ratio guarantees that target accuracy.", "paper_title": "AN AUDITORY BRAIN-COMPUTER INTERFACE WITH ACCURACY PREDICTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000304095500004"}
