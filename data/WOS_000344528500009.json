These benefits come from die stacking and use of through-silicon vias (TSVs) fabricated for interconnections across dies. However, the use of TSVs has several negative impacts such as area and capacitance overhead. To predict the quality of 3-D ICs more accurately, TSV-aware 3-D wirelength distribution models considering the negative impacts were developed. In this paper, we apply an optimal buffer insertion algorithm to the TSV-aware 3-D wirelength distribution models and present various prediction results on wirelength, delay, and power consumption of 3-D ICs. We also apply the framework to 2-D and 3-D ICs built with various combinations of process and TSV technologies and predict the quality of today and future 3-D ICs.", "paper_title": "TSV-Aware Interconnect Distribution Models for Prediction of Delay and Power Consumption of 3-D Stacked ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000344528500009"}
