We employed analytical models of Optical Orthogonal Codes to evaluate the switching network resources, such as the number of optical codes carried on each wavelength. Moreover, we propose and analyze a few optical code and wavelength conversion switching architectures, in order to scale the number of codes and wavelength converters and obtain a minimum burst blocking probability. The results demonstrate that architectures comprising Sparse-Partial Optical Code Converters with Sparse-Partial Wavelength Converters provide better performance. The network resources utilization are improved with number of converters, hence reaching a better cost benefit.", "paper_title": "Evolution of hybrid WDM/OCDM technology in OBS networks with optical code and wavelength conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000313162500005"}
