As there are some complicated interactions among different stages in MMPs, a machining error propagation network (MEPN) is proposed and its complexity is discussed to analyze the correlation among different stages in MMPs. Based on these, a real-time quality-monitoring model based on process variation trajectory chart is proposed to monitor the key machining stages extracted by MEPN. Due to the complexity of the correlation in MEPN, it is important and necessary to explore the variation propagation mechanism in MEPN. As for this issue, a machining error propagation model of machining form feature nodes in MEPN is established with the neuron model, which is solved with back-propagation neural network. The mapping relationship among machining errors of quality attributes is described through this node model. Furthermore, a novel equipment synthetic failure probability exponent of machining status nodes in MEPN is established to synthesize equipment's parameters by using logistic regression to quantitatively analyze the potential-failure and forecast the equipment degradation trend. At last, the machining process of a connecting rod is used to verify the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Real-time quality monitoring and predicting model based on error propagation networks for multistage machining processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000336223900010"}
