The filtering is shift-invariant with respect to the angular variable. The backprojection does not include position-dependent weights through the Hilbert transform and the one-dimensional transformation between the fan- and parallel-beam coordinates. The strong symmetry of the filtered projections directly leads to an exact reconstruction for partial data. The use of the Hilbert transform avoids the approximation introduced by the nonuniform cutoff frequency required in the ramp filter-based FBP algorithm. Variance analysis indicates that the algorithm might lead to a better uniformity of resolution and noise in the reconstructed image. Numerical simulations are provided to evaluate the algorithm with noise-free and noisy projections. Our simulation results indicate that the algorithm does have better stability over the ramp-filter-based FBP and circular harmonic reconstruction algorithms. This may help improve the image quality for in place computed tomography scanners with single-row detectors.", "paper_title": "Hilbert transform based FBP algorithm for fan-beam CT full and partial scans", "paper_id": "WOS:000243914200005"}
