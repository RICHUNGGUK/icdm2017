The problem is formulated by a variational statement derived from the maximum a posterior probability (MAP) using 3D Optical Flow Constraint, containing both evolution surface and motion parameters. Therefore, the proposed method allows them to benefit from each other and perform motion segmentation and estimation simultaneously. All the formulation is under the assumption that environmental objects are rigid, and an iterative, PDE-driven level set method is adopted for energy minimization. Various experimental results show the validity of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "3D Video Based Segmentation and Motion Estimation with Active Surface Evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000314776600002"}
