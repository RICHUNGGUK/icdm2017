A two-level grid is employed to accommodate the non-uniform distribution of practical scene geometry. A bottom-to-top method is implemented to assign the triangles into the hierarchical grid without any iteration while a deferred scheme is introduced to efficiently update the data structure. To address the issue of load balancing, which greatly influences the performance in SIMD parallelism, a propagation scheme which utilizes a parallel scan and a segmented scan is presented, distributing workloads evenly across all concurrent threads. The proposed method supports both discrete collision detection (DCD) and continuous collision detection (CCD) with self-collision. Some typical benchmarks are tested to verify the effectiveness of our method. The results highlight our speedups over prior algorithms on different commodity GPUs.", "paper_title": "A Hierarchical Grid Based Framework for Fast Collision Detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000293524100009"}
