The systems varied in the number of options presented and the confirmation strategy used. The corpus also contains information about the users' cognitive abilities and detailed usability assessments of each dialogue system. The corpus, which was collected using a Wizard-of-Oz methodology, has been fully transcribed and annotated with dialogue acts and \"Information State Update\" (ISU) representations of dialogue context. Dialogue act and ISU annotations were performed semi-automatically. In addition to describing the corpus collection and annotation, we present a quantitative analysis of the interaction behaviour of older and younger users and discuss further applications of the corpus. We expect that the corpus will provide a key resource for modelling older people's interaction with spoken dialogue systems.", "paper_title": "The MATCH corpus: a corpus of older and younger users' interactions with spoken dialogue systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000279086100004"}
