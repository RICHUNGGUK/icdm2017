In this paper, we propose a novel method to obtain discriminative feature transformation based on output coding technique for speech recognition. The output coding transformation projects the speech features from their original space to a new one where each dimension of the features captures information to distinguish different phones. Using polynomial expansion, the short-time spectral features are first expanded to a high-dimensional space where the generalized linear discriminant sequence kernel is applied on the sequences of input feature vectors. Then, the output coding transformation formulated via a set of linear SVMs projects the sequences of high dimensional vectors into a tractable low-dimensional feature space where the resultant features are well-separated continuous output codes for the subsequent multi-class classification problem. Our experimental results on the TIMIT corpus show that the proposed features achieve 10.5% ASR error rate reduction over the conventional spectral features. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
