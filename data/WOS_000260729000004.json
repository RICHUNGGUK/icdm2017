This algorithm is a great help to the engineer who designs dams in calculating the area and the volume of the reservoir for dams with specific positions and geometric characteristics, for different water levels and over a ground relief with elevation contours which one evaluates, smoothes and draws using cubic splines. The advantages of the algorithm are significant not only for specific computer programs that refer to reservoirs, but also for computer programs relevant to hydraulic calculations of reservoirs and associated structures.
