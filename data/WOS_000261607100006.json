Although inter-domain provisioning has been well studied for packet/cell-switching networks, the wavelength dimension (along with wavelength conversion) poses many challenges in multi-domain DWDM settings. To address these concerns a detailed GMPLS-based hierarchical routing framework is proposed for multi-domain DWDM networks with wavelength conversion. This solution uses mesh topology abstraction schemes to hide domain-internal state. However related inter-domain routing loads can be significant here, growing by the square of the number of border nodes. To address these scalability limitations, improved inter-domain routing update strategies are also proposed and the associated performance of inter-domain lightpath RWA and signaling schemes studied.", "paper_title": "Routing scalability in multi-domain DWDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000261607100006"}
