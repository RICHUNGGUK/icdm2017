However this does not deal with the order of evaluation of arguments, which may have major consequences when there are side-effects. In this paper Cartesian effect categories are introduced for solving this issue, and they are compared with strong monads, Freyd-categories and Haskell's Arrows. Iris proved that a Cartesian effect category is a Freyd-category where the premonoidal structure is provided by a kind of binary product, called the sequential product. The universal property of the sequential product provides Cartesian effect categories with a powerful tool for constructions and proofs. To our knowledge, both effect categories and sequential products are new notions. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
