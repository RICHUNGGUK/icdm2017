In this paper, we consider situations where the input data are interval numbers. We develop some uncertain Bonferroni mean operators, and then combine them with the well-known ordered weighted averaging operator and Choquet integral respectively for aggregating uncertain information. We also given their applications to multi-criteria decision making under uncertainty, and finally, some possible extensions for further research are discussed.", "paper_title": "Uncertain Bonferroni Mean Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000285930800007"}
