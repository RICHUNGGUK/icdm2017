First the optimal solution of a rounded problem is presented as the approximate solution and its straightforward dynamic-programming (DP) algorithm Then the straightforward DP algorithm is converted into an FPTAS by exploiting combinatorial properties of the recursive function Findings - An FPTAS is designed for the SM-CELS problem with monotone cost functions, which is the strongest polynomial time approximation result. Research limitations/implications - The main limitation is that the supplier only manufactures without holding any products when the model is applied. Practical implications - The paper presents the best result for the SM-CELS problem in deterministic inventory theory Originality/value - The LP-rounding technique, an effective approach to design approximation algorithms for Nil-hard problems, is successfully applied to the SM-CELS problem in this paper", "paper_title": "An FPTAS for SM-CELS problem with monotone cost functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000272687500011"}
