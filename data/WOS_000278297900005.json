Design/methodology/approach - The study utilizes a social constructionist approach. The social constructionist meta-theory, which holds that contributions to knowledge can be made orally, frames it. Findings - The paper explicates how orality, or word-of-mouth transactions, conveys information; describes approaches for investigating orally-based information; and articulates the need for future information behavior investigations that focus on orality. Research limitations/implications - The research exploration focuses on face-to-face oral data. It calls for increased attention to orally-based information, and offers tentative suggestions for accomplishing this goal. Practical implications - The results provide insight that assist in understanding how orally-based information intersects with information behavior, knowledge management, information policy, cultural heritage, and professional development that involves orality. Originality/value - The paper builds a theoretical foundation for increased understanding of the meaning and functions of orally-based information.", "paper_title": "Orally-based information", "paper_id": "WOS:000278297900005"}
