This can be achieved by using powerful update formulas for the optimality criteria during the design construction. The derivation of such update formulas for evaluating the impact of changes to the levels of easy-to-change factors and hard-to-change factors in split-plot designs as well as the impact of a swap of points between blocks or whole plots in block designs or split-plot designs is described.
