The modulator makes use of low-distortion sigma-delta modulator architecture and Pseudo-Data-Weighted-Averaging technique to attain high linearity over a wide bandwidth. Power dissipation is minimized by optimizing the architecture and by a careful design of analog circuitry. In GSM mode, the modulator achieves 96/104 dB peak SNR/SFDR over 100 kHz bandwidth and dissipates 18 mW at a sampling frequency of 32 MHz. The modulator achieves 92/68 dB peak SFDR and 77/54 dB peak SNR over a 2 MHz/10 MHz bandwidth and dissipates 23/39 mW at a sampling frequency of 64 MHz/160 MHz in WCDMA/WLAN.", "paper_title": "A triple-mode sigma-delta modulator for multi-standard wireless radio receivers", "paper_id": "WOS:000237195100002"}
