The key observation is that the sparse coefficients that encode a given image with respect to an over-complete basis are the same that encode a blurred version of the image with respect to a modified basis. Following an \"analysis-by-synthesis\" approach, an explicit generative model is used to compute a sparse representation of the blurred image, and its coefficients are used to combine elements of the original basis to yield a restored image.", "paper_title": "Direct Sparse Deblurring", "paper_id": "WOS:000285974800001"}
