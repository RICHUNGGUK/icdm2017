In particular, a new methodology for subjective evaluation of the quality of 3-D objects is proposed and implemented. Two objective metrics derived from measures of surface roughness are then proposed and their efficiency to predict the perceptual impact of 3-D watermarking is assessed and compared with the state of the art. Results obtained show good correlations between the proposed objective metrics and subjective assessments by human observers.", "paper_title": "Watermarked 3-D mesh quality assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131900005"}
