Different chirp rates, i.e., slopes on the time-frequency (TF) plane, represent watermark messages such that each slope corresponds to a unique message. These watermark signals, i.e., linear chirps, are embedded and extracted using an existing watermarking algorithm. The extracted chirps are then postprocessed at the receiver using a line detection algorithm based on the Hough-Radon transform (HRT). The HRT is an optimal line-detection algorithm, which detects directional components that satisfy a parametric constraint equation in the image of a TF plane, even at discontinuities corresponding to bit errors. Simulation results show that HRT correctly detects the embedded watermark message after common signal processing operations for bit error rates up to 20%. The new watermark representation and the postprocessing stage based on HRT significantly improve the performance of the watermark detection process and can be combined with existing watermark embedding/extraction algorithms for increased robustness.", "paper_title": "A robust audio watermark representation based on linear chirps", "paper_id": "WOS:000241052400005"}
