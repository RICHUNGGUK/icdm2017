An error analysis is made between the numerical wavenumber and the exact wavenumber, and a refined choice strategy based on minimizing the numerical dispersion is proposed for choosing weight parameters. A full-coarsening multigrid-based preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB method is developed for solving the linear system stemming from the Helmholtz equation with PML by the finite difference scheme. The shifted-Laplacian is extended to precondition the 3D Helmholtz equation, and a spectral analysis is given. The discrete preconditioned system is solved by the Bi-CGSTAB method, with a multigrid method used to invert the preconditioner approximately. Full-coarsening multigrid is employed, and a new matrix-based prolongation operator is constructed accordingly. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of both the new 27-point finite difference scheme with refined parameters, and the preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB method with the 3D full-coarsening multigrid.
