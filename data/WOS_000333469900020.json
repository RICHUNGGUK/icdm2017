The proposed scheme has the advantage of using real-time road conditions to compute a better route and at the same time, the information source can be properly authenticated. To protect the privacy of the drivers, the query (destination) and the driver who issues the query are guaranteed to be unlinkable to any party including the trusted authority. We make use of the idea of anonymous credential to achieve this goal. In addition to authentication and privacy preserving, our scheme fulfills all other necessary security requirements. Using the real maps of New York and California, we conducted a simulation study on our scheme showing that it is effective in terms of processing delay and providing routes of much shorter traveling time.", "paper_title": "VSPN: VANET-Based Secure and Privacy-Preserving Navigation", "paper_id": "WOS:000333469900020"}
