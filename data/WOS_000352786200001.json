In this article, we consider the version where G is directed and all edge weights are positive. Some properties of the requested path are derived when G is an arbitrary digraph. In addition, if G is planar, an O(n(3))-time algorithm is proposed, where n is the number of vertices of G. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
