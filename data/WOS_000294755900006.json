The only available solution that can currently be used for buffering in the optical domain is using long fiber lines called fiber delay lines (FDLs), which have severe limitations. Moreover, the research on optical RAM presently being done is not expected to achieve a large capacity soon. However, the burstiness of Internet traffic causes high packet drop rates and low utilization in very small buffered OPS networks. We therefore propose a new node-based pacing algorithm for decreasing burstiness. We show that by applying some simple pacing at the edge or core backbone nodes, the performance of very small optical RAM buffered core OPS networks with variable-length packets can be notably increased.", "paper_title": "Node pacing for small optical RAM-buffered packet-switching networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000294755900006"}
