In order to reproduce full-color images from the Bayer-like W-RGB CFA, a demosaicing or a CFA interpolation process which estimates missing color channels of raw mosaiced images from CFA is an essential process for single sensor digital cameras having CFA. In the case of Bayer CFA, numerous demosaicing methods which have remarkable performance were already proposed. In order to take advantage of both remarkable performance of demosaicing method for Bayer CFA and the characteristic of high-sensitive Bayer-like W-RGB CFA, a new method of transforming Bayer-like W-RGB to Bayer pattern is required. Therefore, in this letter, we present a new method of transforming Bayer-like W-RGB pattern to Bayer pattern. The proposed method mainly uses the color difference assumption between different channels which can be applied to practical consumer digital cameras.", "paper_title": "Pattern Transformation Method for Digital Camera with Bayer-Like White-RGB Color Filter Array", "paper_id": "WOS:000364422600020"}
