And then, the developed robust tracking control scheme is applied to an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system. To handle the input saturation, a hyperbolic tangent function and a Nussbaum function are employed, and the dynamic surface method is applied to solve the problem of \"explosion of complexity\" in backstepping control. It is proved that the proposed control scheme can guarantee that all signals of the closed-loop system are bounded through the Lyapunov analysis. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme for uncertain MIMO nonlinear systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
