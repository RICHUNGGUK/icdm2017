Video synopsis is a technology for quick browsing of a video by compressing object trajectories. However, extracting and rearranging the detected object trajectories is one of the difficult issues in generating video synopsis. In this paper, a method is proposed which used for solving the optimization problem of trajectory combination in generating video synopses. The method utilizes the temporal combination ways of trajectories to deal with the optimization problem of motion trajectory combination under the idea of genetic algorithm (GA). Experiment results show that combination of the trajectories based on GA is better than simulated annealing both in information loss and time consumption. Besides,GA is easier to be manipulated by computers.", "paper_title": "Optimization method for trajectory combination in surveillance video synopsis based on genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000363041900012"}
