The first IM is designed through fuzzying structural fundamental period to account for the period shift effect due to stiffness degradation, whereas the second IM is developed to take into account higher mode contribution in high-rise buildings by employing a fuzzy combination of the first two or three modes for the lateral loading pattern in pushover analysis. A benchmark study of three example reinforced concrete frame structures shows that for moderate- to medium-period structures, both of the proposed IMs improve prediction accuracy in comparison with the existing IMs. For short-period structures, the FV inelastic spectral displacement is the best.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy-Valued Intensity Measures for Near-Fault Pulse-Like Ground Motions", "paper_id": "WOS:000325493400004"}
