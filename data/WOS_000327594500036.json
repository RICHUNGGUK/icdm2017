The capacity region of the MIMO interference channel with feedback is characterized within a constant number of bits, where this constant is independent of the channel matrices. Further, it is shown that the capacity region of the MIMO interference channel with feedback and its reciprocal interference channel are within a constant number of bits. Finally, the generalized degrees of freedom region for the MIMO interference channel with feedback is characterized.", "paper_title": "On the Capacity Region and the Generalized Degrees of Freedom Region for the MIMO Interference Channel With Feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000327594500036"}
