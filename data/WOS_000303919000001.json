Here a compound set means a set obtained by varying each argument of a function of several variables over a set associated with that argument, where all the sets are subsets of an appropriate algebraic structure so that the function is well defined. On the one hand, the entropy inequalities developed for partition-determined functions imply entropic analogues of general inequalities of Plunnecke-Ruzsa type. On the other hand, the cardinality inequalities developed for compound sets imply several inequalities for sumsets, including for instance a generalization of inequalities proved by Gyarmati, Matolcsi and Ruzsa (2010). We also provide partial progress towards a conjecture of Ruzsa (2007) for sumsets in nonabelian groups. All proofs are elementary and rely on properly developing certain information-theoretic inequalities. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
