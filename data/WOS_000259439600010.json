The complex of N-[4-methyl-3-(4-pyridin-3-yl-pyrimidin-2-ylamino)- phenyl]-benzamide (part of STI-571) and related 16 amino acid residues were found at B3LYP/6-31G (d, p) level to have hydrogen bonds and pi....pi stacking interaction, their binding energy via HAF optimization was -20.4 kcal mol(-1). The results derived from this study agreed well with the reported observation.", "paper_title": "ONIOM DFT/PM3 calculation on the interaction between STI-571 and abelson tyrosine kinase", "paper_id": "WOS:000259439600010"}
