We prove that an induced packing of k odd cycles in an n-vertex graph can be found (if it exists) in time 2(O(k3/2)) n(2+epsilon) (for any constant epsilon > 0) when the input graph is planar. We also show that deciding if a graph has an induced packing of two odd induced cycles is NP-complete. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
