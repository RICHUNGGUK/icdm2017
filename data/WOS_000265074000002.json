We precisely define three different semantics for executing networks of cells: maximal parallelism, locally-maximal parallelism, and minimal parallelism. The computational power of networks of cells with these three semantics is investigated by showing computational completeness for evolution-communication P systems where communication rules may be antiport, symport, or conditional uniport.", "paper_title": "Maximal, Locally-Maximal, and Minimal Parallelism in Networks of Cells", "paper_id": "WOS:000265074000002"}
