However, to date, this phenomenon remains understudied in the academic literature. In this paper, we examine six exploratory questions related to cross-listing: (1) what proportion of online auctions sellers engage in cross-listing, (2) how many simultaneous auctions do these sellers list, (3) how many of these auctions are successful, (4) are cross-listing sellers systematically different from those that do not cross-list, (5) how do closing prices differ between cross-listed and non cross-listed auctions, and (6) how does bidder participation vary between cross-listed and non cross-listed auctions? Using detailed data collected from 21,714 Apple iPod auctions on eBay, we provide answers to the above questions. Implications for practice and research are discussed.", "paper_title": "AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF CROSS-LISTING IN ONLINE AUCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000265556800010"}
