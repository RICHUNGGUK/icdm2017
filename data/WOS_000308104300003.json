However, the methods to edit avatars' behaviors in the 3D graphical environment remained to be a challenging research topic. Since the hand-crafted methods are time-consuming and inefficient, the automatic actions of the avatars are required. To achieve the autonomous behaviors of the avatars, artificial intelligence should be used in this research area. In this paper, we present a novel approach to construct a system of automatic avatars in the 3D graphical environments based on the machine learning techniques. Specific framework is created for controlling the behaviors of avatars, such as classifying the difference among the environments and using hierarchical structure to describe these actions. Because of the requirement of simulating the interactions between avatars and environments after the classification of the environment, Reinforcement Learning is used to compute the policy to control the avatar intelligently in the 3D environment for the solution of the problem of different situations. Thus, our approach has solved problems such as where the levels of the missions will be defined and how the learning algorithm will be used to control the avatars. In this paper, our method to achieve these goals will be presented. The main contributions of this paper are presenting a hierarchical structure to control avatars automatically, developing a method for avatars to recognize environment and presenting an approach for making the policy of avatars' actions intelligently.", "paper_title": "AUTONOMOUS BEHAVIORS OF GRAPHICAL AVATARS BASED ON MACHINE LEARNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000308104300003"}
