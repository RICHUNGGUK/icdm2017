As applications, we determine 1) the correlation distribution of the m-sequence {a lambda = Tr( gamma(lambda))} (lambda = 0, 1, ...) and the sequence {b(lambda) = Tr (f(gamma(lambda)))} (lambda = 0, 1, ...) over F-p where gamma is a primitive element of F-q and 2) the weight distributions of the linear codes over F, defined by f.", "paper_title": "Value distributions of exponential sums from perfect nonlinear functions and their applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100003"}
