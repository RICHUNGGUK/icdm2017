In this paper, we propose a network-based semi-supervised learning method inspired by the modularity greedy algorithm, which was originally applied for unsupervised learning. Changes have been made in the process of modularity maximization in a way to adapt the model to propagate labels throughout the network. Furthermore, a network reduction technique is introduced, as well as an extensive analysis of its impact on the network. Computer simulations are performed for artificial and real-world databases, providing a numerical quantitative basis for the performance of the proposed method. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
