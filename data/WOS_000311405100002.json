The result we consider here as an example is Turan's theorem, which deals with graphs G = ([n], E) such that no member of the restriction set R = (([n])(r)) induces a copy of K-r. Firstly, we examine what happens when this restriction set is replaced by R = {X is an element of (([n])(r)): X boolean AND [m] not equal empty set}. That is, we determine the maximal number of edges in an n-vertex such that no K-r hits a given vertex set. Secondly, we consider sparse random restriction sets. An r-uniform hypergraph R on vertex set [n] is called Turannical (respectively epsilon-Turannical), if for any graph G on [n] with more edges than the Turan number t(r)(n) (respectively (1+epsilon)t(r)(n)), no hyperedge of R induces a copy of K-r in G. We determine the thresholds for random r-uniform hypergraphs to be Turannical and to be epsilon-Turannical. Thirdly, we transfer this result to sparse random graphs, using techniques recently developed by Schacht [Extremal results for random discrete structures] to prove the Kohayakawa-Luczak-Rodl Conjecture on Turan's theorem in random graphs.
