The numerical algorithm is based on the concept of fluctuation distribution, applied on a space-time mesh of triangular prisms, for which second order accurate schemes already exist which are oscillation-free if the time-step satisfies a CFL-type constraint. This restriction is lifted here by combining the concept of a two-layer scheme with a representation of the solution which is allowed to be discontinuous-in-time. Numerical results are presented in two space dimensions, using unstructured meshes of space-time triangular prisms, for the scalar advection equation, Burgers' equation and the Euler equations of gas dynamics.
