The OTIS network (also referred to as two-level swapped network) is composed of n clones of an n-node original network constituting its clusters. It has received much attention due to its many favorable properties such as high degree of scalability, regularity, modularity, package-ability and high degree of algorithmic efficiency. Many properties of OTIS networks have been studied in the literature. In this work, we show that the OTIS networks have the pancyclicity property when the factor graph is Hamiltonian. More precisely, using a constructive method, we prove that if the factor graph G of an OTIS network contains cycles of length {3, 4, 5, l}, then all cycles of length {3, ... , l(2)}, can be embedded in the OTIS-G network.
