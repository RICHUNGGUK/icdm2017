Research has already been devoted to dimensioning Ethernet aggregation networks, taking user movement into account while neglecting the experienced network performance. This paper extends this design for resilient networks and aims at minimizing packet loss and packet reordering in the dimensioning and routing process. For deployment in an Ethernet network which supports Multiple Spanning Trees (MSTs), effective path aggregation methods are proposed for finding a minimal set of spanning trees and these are thoroughly evaluated for different scenarios. Moreover the spanning tree assignment problem with predefined backup conditions is studied.", "paper_title": "Optimizing routing schemes for fast moving users in MST-based networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239418900001"}
