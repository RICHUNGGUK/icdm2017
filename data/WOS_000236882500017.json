There are many solutions existing for IP traceback problem, such as packet marking and algebraic approach. Many of them are not efficient and work under some unreasonable assumptions. The \"Island Hopping Packet Marking (IHPM)\" algorithm, truly incorporating the combination of the best features of the edge/node sampling and the cut vertex, is able to counter those disputed assumptions and provides great performance to reconstruct attacking paths with fewer collected packets under multiple attacks. The assessing of IHPM performance on IXP425 network processor shows the practical feasibility in routers implementations. Such a technique can provide a key answer required for advancing the state-of-the-art in DDoS mitigation and defenses in a realistic environment.", "paper_title": "Developing and implementing IHPM on IXP 425 network processor platforms", "paper_id": "WOS:000236882500017"}
