The first approach avoids the common practice of using a high-dimensional joint state representation for articulated object tracking. Instead, we introduce a decentralized scheme and model the interpart interaction within an innovative Bayesian framework. Specifically, we estimate the interaction density by an efficient decomposed interpart interaction model. To handle severe self-occlusions, we further extend the first approach by modeling high-level interunit interaction and develop the second algorithm within a consistent hierarchical framework. Preliminary experimental results have demonstrated the superior performance of the proposed approaches on real-world videos in both robustness and speed compared with other articulated object tracking methods.", "paper_title": "Real-time decentralized articulated motion analysis and object tracking from videos", "paper_id": "WOS:000248192300019"}
