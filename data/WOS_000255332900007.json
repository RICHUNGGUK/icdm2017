In most of its practical formulations, the FJSP is known to be NP-hard [8][9], so exact solution methods are unfeasible for most problem instances and heuristic approaches must therefore be employed to find good solutions with reasonable search time. In this paper, two closely related approaches to the resolution of the flexible job shop scheduling production system are described. These approaches combine the Ant system optimisation meta-heuristic (AS) with local search methods, including tabu search. The efficiency of the developed method is compared with others.", "paper_title": "Ant systems & local search optimization for flexible job shop scheduling production", "paper_id": "WOS:000255332900007"}
