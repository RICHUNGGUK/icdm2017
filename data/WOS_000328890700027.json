We review most of the recently introduced relaxation methods, and we propose a new convex one based on a probabilistic approach, which has the advantages of being intuitive, flexible, and involving an algorithm without inner loops. We investigate in detail the connections between the solutions of the relaxed functionals with minimizers of the original one. Such connection is demonstrated only for a nonconvex relaxation which turns out to be quite robust to initialization. As a case of study, we illustrate our theoretical analysis with numerical experiments, namely, for the optical flow problem.", "paper_title": "High-Dimension Multilabel Problems: Convex or Nonconvex Relaxation?", "paper_id": "WOS:000328890700027"}
