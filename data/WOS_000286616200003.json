If, in addition, l is an isolated point of the space of line transversals to F, we say that F is a pinning of l. We show that any minimal pinning of a line by polytopes in R(3) such that no face of a polytope is coplanar with the line has size at most eight. If in addition the polytopes are pairwise disjoint, then it has size at most six.", "paper_title": "Lines Pinning Lines", "paper_id": "WOS:000286616200003"}
