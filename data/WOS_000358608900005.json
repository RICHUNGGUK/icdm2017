However, the problem of agent design or control is an open research field. Reinforcement learning approaches offer solutions that allow autonomous learning with minimal supervision. The Q-learning algorithm is a model-free reinforcement learning solution that has proven its usefulness in single-agent domains; however, it suffers from dimensionality curse when applied to multiagent systems. In this article, we discuss two approaches, namely TRQ-learning and distributed Q-learning, that overcome the limitations of Q-learning offering feasible solutions. We test these approaches in two separate domains. The first is the control of a hose by a team of robots. The second is the trash disposal problem. Computational results show the effectiveness of Q-learning solutions to multiagent systems' control.", "paper_title": "Training Multiagent Systems by Q-Learning: Approaches and Empirical Results", "paper_id": "WOS:000358608900005"}
