We model the effect of illumination as a perturbation on an ideal color texture and show that the spectra of the ambient light have a significant impact on the observed texture patterns in the individual color channels. Motivated by studies in human color constancy, we propose a correlation-based transformation that minimizes the effect of illumination variation in color texture analysis. Experimental results are included, which validate the performance of the proposed minvariance model in the analysis of color texture.", "paper_title": "Robust Color Texture Features Under Varying Illumination Conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000302096700005"}
