It is difficult and unstable to manually choose the nearest neighbors in high dimensional space. So how to automatically construct a graph is very important. In this paper, first, we give a L2-graph like L1-graph. L2-graph calculates the edge weights using the total samples, avoiding manually choosing the nearest neighbors; second, a L2-graph based feature extraction method is presented, called collaborative representation based projections (CRP). Like SPP, CRP aims to preserve the collaborative representation based reconstruction relationship of data. CRP utilizes a 12 norm graph to characterize the local compactness information. CRP maximizes the ratio between the total separability information and the local compactness information to seek the optimal projection matrix. CRP is much faster than SPP since CRP calculates the objective function with L2 norm while SPP calculate the objective function with L1 norm. Experimental results on FERET, AR, Yale face databases and the PolyU finger-knuckle-print database demonstrate that CRP works well in feature extraction and leads to a good recognition performance.
