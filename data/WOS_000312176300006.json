This natural ability, controlled by the human brain, is called eye-hand coordination. To understand this behavior it is necessary to study both eye and hand movements simultaneously. This paper proposes a novel approach to detect grasping movements by means of computer vision techniques. This solution fuses two viewpoints, one viewpoint which is obtained from an eye-tracker capturing the user's perspective and a second viewpoint which is captured by a wearable camera attached to a user's wrist. Utilizing information from these two viewpoints it is possible to characterize multiple hand movements in conjunction with eye-gaze movements through a Hidden-Markov Model framework. This paper shows that combining these two sources makes it possible to detect hand gestures using only the objects contained in the scene even without markers on the surface of the objects. In addition, it is possible to detect which is the desired object before the user can actually grasp said object. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
