A seminal result of Cleve (STOC '86) is that, in general, complete fairness is impossible to achieve in two-party computation. In light of this, various techniques for obtaining partial fairness have been suggested in the literature. We propose a definition of partial fairness within the standard real-/ideal-world paradigm. We also show broad feasibility results with respect to our definition: partial fairness is possible for any (randomized) functionality f:XxY -> Z (1)xZ (2) at least one of whose domains or ranges is polynomial in size. Our protocols are always private, and when one of the domains has polynomial size our protocols also achieve the usual notion of security with abort. We work in the standard communication model (in particular, we do not assume simultaneous channels) and, in contrast to some prior work, rely only on standard cryptographic assumptions (e.g., enhanced trapdoor permutations). We also show that, as far as general feasibility is concerned, our results are optimal. Specifically, there exist functions with super-polynomial domains and ranges for which it is impossible to achieve our definition.", "paper_title": "Partial Fairness in Secure Two-Party Computation", "paper_id": "WOS:000298810700002"}
