In this research, to advance both the hospital resource efficiency and the health care service level, a multilevel integrative approach to the planning problem is proposed on the basis of mathematical programming modeling and simulation analysis. It consists of three stages, namely the case mix planning phase, the master surgery scheduling phase and the operational performance evaluation phase. At the case mix planning phase, a hospital is assumed to choose the optimal patient mix and volume that can bring the maximum overall financial contribution under the given resource capacity. Then, in order to improve the patient service level potentially, the total expected bed shortage due to the variable length of stay of patients is minimized through reallocating the bed capacity and building balanced master surgery schedules at the master surgery scheduling phase. After that, the performance evaluation is carried out at the operational stage through simulation analysis, and a few effective operational policies are suggested and analyzed to enhance the trade-offs between resource efficiency and service level. The three stages are interacting and are combined in an iterative way to make sound decisions both on the patient case mix and on the resource allocation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
