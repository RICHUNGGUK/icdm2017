We established the optimizing fire allocation model of air defense missile, designed its multitarget fire distribution strategy and performed a simulation research. Simulation shows the execution speed of this algorithm is high, that the global optimal efficiency is super, and that the problem of multi-target fire coordination distribution is solved. Meanwhile, the universality of this algorithm is good, which has a certain reference value to the direction.", "paper_title": "THE MULTI-TARGET FIRE DISTRIBUTION STRATEGY RESEARCH OF THE ANTI-AIR FIRE BASED ON THE GENETIC ALGORITHM", "paper_id": "WOS:000302664400026"}
