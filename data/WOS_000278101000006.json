B. Lee, K. S. Pedersen, and D. Mumford, Int. J. Comput. Vis., 54 (2003), pp. 83-103], the authors study the distributions of 3 x 3 patches from optical images and from range images. In [G. Carlsson, T. Ishkanov, V. de Silva, and A. Zomorodian, Int. J. Comput. Vis., 76 (2008), pp. 1-12], the authors apply computational topological tools to the data set of optical patches studied by Lee, Pedersen, and Mumford and find geometric structures for high density subsets. One high density subset is called the primary circle and essentially consists of patches with a line separating a light and a dark region. In this paper, we apply the techniques of Carlsson et al. to range patches. By enlarging to 5x5 and 7x7 patches, we find core subsets that have the topology of the primary circle, suggesting a stronger connection between optical patches and range patches than was found by Lee, Pedersen, and Mumford.", "paper_title": "On the Nonlinear Statistics of Range Image Patches", "paper_id": "WOS:000278101000006"}
