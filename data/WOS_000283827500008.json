In facial shot matching part, a high-level face detector identifies facial frames/shots in a video clip. Matching faces with extended body regions gives the flexibility to discriminate the same person (e.g., an anchor man or a political leader) in different events or scenes. In activity subsequence matching part, a spatio-temporal sequence matching technique is employed to match video clips/segments that are similar in terms of activity. Lastly, the non-facial shots are matched using low-level MPEG-7 descriptors and dynamic-weighted feature similarity calculation. The proposed framework is tested on the query and reference dataset of CBCD task of TRECVID 2008. Our results are compared with the results of top-8 most successful techniques submitted to this task. Promising results are obtained in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.
