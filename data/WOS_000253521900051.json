Performances of the GINeN and the Kohonen network are investigated for tissue segmentation in ultrasound images. Feature extraction is carried out by using continuous wavelet transform. Pixel intensities at the same spatial location on 12 wavelet planes and on the original image are considered as features, leading to 13-dimensional feature vectors. The same training set is used for the training of the Kohonen network and the GINeN. This paper proposes the use of wavelet transform and genetic based incremental neural network together in order to increase the segmentation performance. It is observed that genetic based incremental neural network gives satisfactory segmentation performance for ultrasound images. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
