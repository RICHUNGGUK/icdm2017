The preamble specified in IEEE 802.15.6 WEAN is used to achieve an accurate timing and frequency estimation based on the differential correlation. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed joint estimation scheme can be effectively employed to get accurate STO and CFO estimate with less complexity.", "paper_title": "Simple Joint Symbol Timing and Carrier Frequency Offset Estimation for Wireless Body Area Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567000028"}
