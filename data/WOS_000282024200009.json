It is shown that the spectral amplitudes of the biphoton wave function become complex and gain frequency-and angle-dependent phase shifts in the structures with unequal lengths of domains. Effects of the spectrum broadening and the phase shifting are expressed in terms of the crystal non-linear transfer function. Spectrum of the first-order correlation function is found to be strictly dependent on the transfer function module, but insensitive to the phase shifts. Availability of the phase shifts makes the second-order temporal correlation function of the broadened as-generated biphoton field to be almost the same as in case of a single-domain crystal. At the same time, possibility of strong temporal biphoton compression appears further if an additional phase-compensating element is placed after the aperiodically poled crystal.", "paper_title": "BIPHOTON WAVE PACKETS GENERATED IN APERIODICALLY POLED CRYSTALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000282024200009"}
