Unfortunately coding efficiency of intra frame is very low relative to inter frame coding because of mismatch between current block and its predicted block. In this paper, new intra luma prediction algorithm which improves intra. coding efficiency is proposed. The proposed additional intra luma prediction mode uses collocated chroma pixels and weight values to estimate correct spatial pattern of coded block. From neighboring blocks, weight value between chroma and luma values is calculated and then the predicted luma. block is obtained by multiplying calculated weight value and collocated upsampled chroma block. ne proposed method is effective for complex or non-directional macroblocks and experimental results show that the efficiency of intra coding is increased up to 0.6 dB.", "paper_title": "New intra luma prediction mode in H.264/AVC using collocated weighted chroma pixel value", "paper_id": "WOS:000241489100031"}
