The CHESS-64 based on various controlled operations is designed for such applications. In this paper, however, we show that CHESS-64 doesn't have a high security level, more precisely, we present two related-key differential attacks on CHESS-64. The first attack requires about 2(44) data and 2(44) time complexities (recovering 20 bits of the master key) while the second attack needs about 2(39) data and 2(39) time complexities (recovering 6 bits of the master key). These works are the first known cryptanalytic results on CHESS-64 so far.", "paper_title": "Security Analysis of the Full-Round CHESS-64 Cipher Suitable for Pervasive Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000269281000004"}
