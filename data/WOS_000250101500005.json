The so- called super- twisting algorithm is utilized for generating the second- order sliding mode in the observer dynamical system. The frequency response of the observer dynamics is obtained and used as a characteristic of the observer. The analysis proposed is based on the describing function method and the concept of the equivalent gains of nonlinear functions of the super- twisting algorithm.", "paper_title": "Describing function analysis of second-order sliding mode observers", "paper_id": "WOS:000250101500005"}
