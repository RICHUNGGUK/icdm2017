Our approach is based on a resonance theory which assumes a small interaction between qubits and environments and which gives rigorous perturbation theory results, valid for all times. We obtain expressions for (i) characteristic time-scales for decoherence, relaxation, disentanglement, and for (ii) the evolution of observables; valid uniformly in time t >= 0. We introduce a classification of decoherence times based on clustering of the reduced density matrix elements, persisting on all time-scales. We examine characteristic dynamical properties such as creation, death and revival of entanglement. We discuss possible applications of our results for superconducting quantum computation and quantum measurement technologies.", "paper_title": "EVOLUTION OF ENTANGLEMENT OF TWO QUBITS INTERACTING THROUGH LOCAL AND COLLECTIVE ENVIRONMENTS", "paper_id": "WOS:000292172500003"}
