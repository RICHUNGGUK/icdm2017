These factors severely degrade the fusion quality of multi-focus images. In this paper, we present a novel multi-Scale weighted gradient-based fusion method to solve this problem. This method is based on a multi-scale structure-based focus measure that reflects the sharpness of edge and corner structures at multiple scales. This focus measure is derived based on an image structure saliency and introduced to determine the gradient weights in the proposed gradient-based fusion method for multi-focus images with a novel multi-scale approach. In particular, we focus on a two-scale scheme, i.e., a large scale and a small scale, to effectively solve the fusion problems raised by anisotropic blur and mis-registration. The large-scale structure-based focus measure is used first to attenuate the impacts of anisotropic blur and mis-registration on the focused region detection, and then the gradient weights near the boundaries of the focused regions are carefully determined by applying the small-scale focus measure. Experimental results clearly demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the conventional fusion methods in the presence of anisotropic blur and mis-registration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
