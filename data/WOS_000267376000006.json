Also the detecting method for change rate of address data to calculate address power is proposed. Then AAERCs can work as AERCs, no-AERCs, or IPS in one subfield according to calculating result of address power to get the lowest address power comparing with other methods. There is no change on prototype address circuit but only control timing of scan ICs and address data processing in software. The experiment results with a 50-in. HD dual-scan PDP shows that the address power of AAERCs can keep the lowest at any picture comparing with other address methods, and the maximum address power saved is 81 W. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
