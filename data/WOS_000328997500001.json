This paper introduces a designed method of airport runway FOD detection system based on WSN, analyzes function of various image acquisition sensors, and introduces FOD image analysis algorithm. Finally WSN data fusion technology is used to analyze the FOD image.", "paper_title": "Research and Design of an Airfield Runway FOD Detection System Based on WSN", "paper_id": "WOS:000328997500001"}
