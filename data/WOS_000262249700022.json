The results have been compared with that obtained from cone classification chart, hierarchical and K-mean clustering techniques. It was observed that variation in result with self-organizing map (SOM) and fuzzy clustering for isolating soil layers is marginal. These techniques are found to be efficient compared to hierarchical clustering technique. The results of K-mean clustering show that the identified soil strata are similar to that obtained from cone classification chart, SOM and fuzzy clustering. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
