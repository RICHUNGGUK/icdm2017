Since ID cameras consist of a linear sensor, a motion (usually perpendicular to the sensor orientation) is performed in order to acquire a full image. In this paper, we present a novel linear method to estimate the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of a ID camera using a planar object. As opposed to traditional calibration scheme based on 3D-2D correspondences of landmarks, our method uses homographies induced by the images of a planar object. The proposed algorithm is linear, simple and produces good results as shown by our experiments.", "paper_title": "Plane-Based Calibration for Linear Cameras", "paper_id": "WOS:000286360400002"}
