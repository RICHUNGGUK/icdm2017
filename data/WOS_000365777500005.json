Such algorithms often assume that accurate estimates are available, but such estimates are difficult to generate in practice. In this work, we first profile five real scientific workflows, collecting fine-grained information such as process I/O, runtime, memory usage, and CPU utilization. We then propose a method to automatically characterize workflow task requirements based on these profiles. Our method estimates task runtime, disk space, and peak memory consumption based on the size of the tasks' input data. It looks for correlations between the parameters of a dataset, and if no correlation is found, the dataset is divided into smaller subsets using a clustering technique. Task estimates are generated based on the ratio parameter/input data size if they are correlated, or based on the probability distribution function of the parameter. We then propose an online estimation process based on the MAPE-K loop, where task executions are monitored and estimates are updated as more information becomes available. Experimental results show that our online estimation process results in much more accurate predictions than an offline approach, where all task requirements are estimated prior to workflow execution.", "paper_title": "Online Task Resource Consumption Prediction for Scientific Workflows", "paper_id": "WOS:000365777500005"}
