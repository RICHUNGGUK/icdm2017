The recently developed Residual Strength method enables the design of economic, safe, and architecturally demanding structures by exploiting the advantages of steel, namely: excellent energy dissipation and ductility. The approach is compared to existing concepts such as Key Element method, Alternate Path procedure, and isolation of collapsed regions by segmentation. The new method comprises procedures, tables, and simple hand formulas for risk assessment, description of impact and blast loads, determination of nonlinear member behavior and their dynamic response. The tools are verified by blast and impact tests and comprehensive nonlinear dynamic simulations. The advantages and limitations of the Residual Strength method are highlighted in a case study on a high rise steel-composite building, which targets at the resistance against any kind of explosion and aircraft impact with ensuing fire.", "paper_title": "Design of High Rise Steel Buildings against Terrorist Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000302616900006"}
