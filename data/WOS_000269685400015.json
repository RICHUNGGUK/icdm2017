However, some computational redundancies still exist in Mielikainen's scheme. Hence, Pan et al. developed a scheme based upon. triangle projection to improve Mielikainen's scheme. In this paper, we introduce a scheme based upon triangle inequality to speed up the encoding time of the VQ algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed method can significantly decrease the computation time and maintain the same coding quality as the full-search VQ algorithm. Furthermore, the memory storage used in the proposed scheme is less than those in Mielikainen's and Pan et al.'s schemes.", "paper_title": "AN IMPROVED FULL-SEARCH SCHEME FOR THE VECTOR QUANTIZATION ALGORITHM BASED ON TRIANGLE INEQUALITY", "paper_id": "WOS:000269685400015"}
