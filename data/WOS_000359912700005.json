We present a chronology that documents the emergence and history of such visual art, contextualize ant- and ant-colony-inspired art within generative art practices, and consider how it relates to other ALife art. We survey many of the algorithms that artists have used in this genre, address some of their aims, and explore the relationships between ant- and ant-colony-inspired art and research on ant and ant colony behavior.", "paper_title": "Ant- and Ant-Colony-Inspired ALife Visual Art", "paper_id": "WOS:000359912700005"}
