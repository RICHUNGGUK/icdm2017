Using CPGs, a trajectory generator is designed consisting of a center-of-gravity (CoG) trajectory generator and a workspace trajectory modulation process. Entraining with feedback information, the CoG generator can generate adaptive CoG trajectories online and workspace trajectories can be modulated in real time based on the generated adaptive CoG trajectories. A motion engine maps trajectories from workspace to joint space. The proposed control strategy is able to generate adaptive joint control signals online to realize biped adaptive walking. The experimental results using a biped platform NAO confirm the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.", "paper_title": "Central Pattern Generator Inspired Control for Adaptive Walking of Biped Robots", "paper_id": "WOS:000323498000016"}
