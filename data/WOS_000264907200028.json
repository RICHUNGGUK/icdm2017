The auxiliary model is another elliptical distribution, the multivariate Student-t distribution. it has parameters that have a one-to-one relationship with those of the elliptical stable, making the proposed indirect approach particularly suitable. The finite sample behaviour of the estimators is analyzed using a comprehensive Monte Carlo study. An application to 27 emerging markets stock indexes concludes the paper. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
