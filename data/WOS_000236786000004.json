The sensor field is partitioned into subregions by using quadtree based addressing, and then a given number of sensors from each subregion are assigned to each task set by using a distributed algorithm. The number of nodes in a task set depends on the task specifications. Hence, the sensed data is retrieved from a sensor network in the level of detail specified by users, and a tradeoff mechanism between data resolution and query cost is provided. Experiments show that the dynamic task sets scheme systematically reduces the number of sensors involved in a query in the orders of magnitude in the expense of slight reduction in the event detection rate.
