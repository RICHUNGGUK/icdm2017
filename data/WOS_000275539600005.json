Given a history of packet transmissions and an excerpt of a possible packet payload, a payload attribution system (PAS) makes it feasible to identify the sources, destinations, and the times of appearance on a network of all the packets that contained the specified payload excerpt. A PAS, as one of the core components in a network forensics system, enables investigating cybercrimes on the Internet by, for example, tracing the spread of worms and viruses, identifying who has received a phishing e-mail in an enterprise, or discovering which insider allowed an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information. Due to the increasing volume of network traffic in today's networks, it is infeasible to effectively store and query all the actual packets for extended periods of time in order to allow analysis of network events for investigative purposes; therefore, we focus on extremely compressed digests of the packet activity. We propose several new methods for payload attribution, which utilize Rabin fingerprinting, shingling, and winnowing. Our best methods allow building practical payload attribution systems, which provide data reduction ratios greater than 100: 1 while supporting efficient queries with very low false positive rates. We demonstrate the properties of the proposed methods and specifically analyze their performance and practicality when used as modules of a network forensics system ForNet. Our experimental results outperform current state-of-the-art methods both in terms of false positives and data reduction ratio. Finally, these approaches directly allow the collected data to be stored and queried by an untrusted party without disclosing any payload information nor the contents of queries.", "paper_title": "New Payload Attribution Methods for Network Forensic Investigations", "paper_id": "WOS:000275539600005"}
