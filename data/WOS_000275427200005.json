Let R(epsilon)(f) and D(epsilon)(mu)(f) denote the randomized and mu-distributional communication complexities of f, respectively (epsilon a small constant). Yao's well-known minimax principle states that R(epsilon)(f) = max(mu) {D(epsilon)(mu)(f)}. Kushilevitz and Nisan (1997) ask whether this equality is approximately preserved if the maximum is taken over product distributions only, rather than all distributions mu. We give a strong negative answer to this question. Specifically, we prove the existence of a function f : {0, 1}(n) x {0, 1}(n) -> {0, 1} for which max(mu) (product) {D(epsilon)(mu) (f)} = Theta(1) but R(epsilon)(f) = Theta(n). We also obtain an exponential separation between the statistical query dimension and signrank, solving a problem previously posed by the author (2007).", "paper_title": "COMMUNICATION COMPLEXITY UNDER PRODUCT AND NONPRODUCT DISTRIBUTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000275427200005"}
