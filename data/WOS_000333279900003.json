Our technique streamlines previous procedures to compute prefix probabilities for probabilistic context-free grammars, probabilistic synchronous context-free grammars and probabilistic tree adjoining grammars. In addition, the methodology is general enough to be used for a wider range of problems involving, for example, several prefixes.", "paper_title": "Prefix probabilities for linear context-free rewriting systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000333279900003"}
