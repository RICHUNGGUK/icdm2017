In this paper we present a method to detect obstacle-free pathways in real-time using depth maps from a pair of stereo images. Depth maps are obtained by processing the disparity between left and right images from a stereo-vision system. The proposed technique assumes that depth of pixels in obstacle-free pathways should increase slightly and linearly from the bottom of the image to the top. The proposed real-time detection checks whether the depth of groups of image columns matches a linear model. Only pixels fulfilling the matching requirements are identified as obstacle-free pathways. Experimental results with real outdoor stereo images show that the method performance is promising.", "paper_title": "Obstacle-Free Pathway Detection by Means of Depth Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000290518600007"}
