Some studies have incorporated templates in an effort to bridge this gap, but most such approaches have proven ineffective because of inefficient template management. Because linked data can be presented in a structured format, we can assume that the data's internal statistics can be used to effectively influence template management. In this work, we explore the use of this influence for template creation, ranking, and scaling. Then, we demonstrate how our proposal for automatic linked data information retrieval can be used alongside familiar keyword-based information retrieval methods, and can also be incorporated alongside other techniques, such as ontology inclusion and sophisticated matching, in order to achieve increased levels of performance.", "paper_title": "Automatic Inclusion of Semantics over Keyword-Based Linked Data Retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000348141300004"}
