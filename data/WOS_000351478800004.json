Due to the subcarrier adjacency constraint inherent to SC-FDMA, its complexity becomes unmanageable. We propose a greedy heuristic algorithm for PF scheduling so as to deal with the complexity issue in this joint problem. It has been shown that its performance can reach up to 90% of its upper bound.", "paper_title": "Scheduling for Virtual MIMO in Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) System", "paper_id": "WOS:000351478800004"}
