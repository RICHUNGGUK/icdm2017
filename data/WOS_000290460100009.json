Coordination among networked agents is a critical issue which mainly includes two aspects: task allocation and load balancing; in traditional approach, the resources of agents are crucial to their abilities to get tasks, which is called talent-based allocation. However, in networked multiagent systems, the tasks may spend so much communication costs among agents that are sensitive to the agent localities; thus this paper presents a novel idea for task allocation and load balancing in networked multiagent systems, which takes into account both the talents and centralities of agents. This paper first investigates the comparison between talent-based task allocation and centrality-based one; then, it explores the load balancing of such two approaches in task allocation. The experiment results show that the centrality-based method can reduce the communication costs for single task more effectively than the talent-based one, but the talent-based method can generally obtain better load balancing performance for parallel tasks than the centrality-based one.
