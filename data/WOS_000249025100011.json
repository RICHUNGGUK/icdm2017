When the keystream is of length 2(98) words, the distinguisher has a detectable advantage. When the keystream length is around 2(120) the advantage is very close to 1. This shows certain weaknesses of Scream. In the process, the paper introduces new general ideas on how to improve the performance of linear distinguishing attacks on stream ciphers.", "paper_title": "A linear distinguishing attack on scream", "paper_id": "WOS:000249025100011"}
