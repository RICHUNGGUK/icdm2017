It is therefore important to develop computational tools incorporating appropriate constitutive theories that can capture their unconventional behaviour. One such theory is micropolar elasticity. This paper presents a linear strain control volume finite element formulation incorporating micropolar elasticity. Verification results from a micropolar element patch test as well as convergence results for a stress concentration problem are included. The element will be shown to pass the patch test and also exhibit accuracy that is at least equivalent to its finite element counterpart. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
