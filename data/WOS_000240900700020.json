In this work, we report the use of chemometric methods (SDA and SIMCA) able to select the most relevant variables (steric, electronic, and topological) responsible for this ability. The results obtained with the SDA and SIMCA methods agree perfectly with our previous model, in which we used other chemometric methods (PCA, HCA and KNN) and are also corroborated with experimental results from the literature. This is a strong indication of how reliable the selection of variables is.", "paper_title": "The use of classification methods for modeling the antioxidant activity of flavonoid compounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000240900700020"}
