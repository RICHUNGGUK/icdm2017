The development of AmI is a very complex task because this technology must often adapt to contextual information as well as unpredictable behaviours and environmental features. The architecture presented deals with AmI applications in order to cover the different components of these kinds of systems: environment, users, context and adaptation. This architecture is the first one that is able to cover all these features, which are needed in a full AmI system. The paper shows that AmISim is able to cover a complete AmI system and to provide a framework which can test scenarios that would be impossible to test in real environments or even with previous simulation approaches. Simulated and real elements coexist in AmISim for a robust testing, validation and verification of the AmI systems, which provide an easier and less costly deployment.", "paper_title": "Combining the real world with simulations for a robust testing of Ambient Intelligence services", "paper_id": "WOS:000345089400010"}
