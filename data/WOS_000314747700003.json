In this paper, we analyze how the environment could be a first class abstraction to support the building, the development and the management of Agreements in decentralized and open systems between autonomous agents. To this aim we analyze the synergies between the environment and the foundational dimensions of agreement technologies such as semantics, norms, organizations, argumentation & negotiation, trust.", "paper_title": "The role of the environment in agreement technologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000314747700003"}
