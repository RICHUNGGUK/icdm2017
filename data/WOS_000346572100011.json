Each core communicates with its dedicated 4KB SRAM block using face-to-face bond pads, which provide negligible data transfer delay between the core and the memory tiers. The maximum operating frequency is 277 MHz and the maximum memory bandwidth is 70.9 GB/s at 277 MHz. The peak measured memory bandwidth usage is 63.8 GB/s and the peak measured power is approximately 4 W based on eight parallel benchmarks.", "paper_title": "Design and Analysis of 3D-MAPS (3D Massively Parallel Processor with Stacked Memory)", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100011"}
