The moving mesh strategy is based on the approach proposed in Li et al. [Li R, Tang T, Zhang P. Moving mesh methods in multiple dimensions based on harmonic maps. J Comput Phys 2001;170:562-89] to separate the mesh-moving and PDE evolution at each time step. The Magneto-hydrodynamic equations are discretized by a finite-volume method in space, and the mesh-moving part is realized by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations to minimize a certain variation with the directional splitting monitor function. A conservative interpolation is used to redistribute the numerical solutions on the new meshes. Numerical results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.
