In this paper, we consider the design issue of sensor networks by placing a few powerful aggregate nodes into a dense sensor network such that the network lifetime is significantly prolonged when performing data gathering. Specifically, given K aggregate nodes and a dense sensor network consisting of n sensors with K < < n, the problem is to place the K aggregate nodes into the network such that the lifetime of the resulting network is maximized, subject to the distortion constraints that both the maximum transmission range of an aggregate node and the maximum transmission delay between an aggregate node and its covered sensor are met. This problem is a joint optimization problem of aggregate node placement and the communication structure, which is NP-hard. In this paper, we first give a non-linear programming solution for it. We then devise a novel heuristic algorithm. We finally conduct experiments by simulation to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of network lifetime. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms a commonly used uniform placement schema - equal distance placement schema significantly.
