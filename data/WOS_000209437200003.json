To give some idea of the enormity of the social graph underlying Facebook, it was recently announced that Facebook has 901 million users, and the social graph consists of many types beyond just users. Until recently, the Graph API provided data to applications in only a JSON format. In 2011, an effort was undertaken to provide the same data in a semantically-enriched, RDF format containing Linked Data URIs. This was achieved by implementing a flexible and robust translation of the JSON output to a Turtle output. This paper describes the associated design decisions, the resulting Linked Data for objects in the social graph, and known issues.", "paper_title": "Facebook Linked Data via the Graph API", "paper_id": "WOS:000209437200003"}
