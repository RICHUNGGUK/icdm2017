Features relevant to creativity and to stories are analyzed, and existing systems are. reviewed wider the light of that analysis. The extent to which they implement the key features proposed in recent models of computational creativity is discussed. Limitations, avenues of future research, and expected trends are outlined.", "paper_title": "Computational Approaches to Storytelling and Creativity", "paper_id": "WOS:000271397300005"}
