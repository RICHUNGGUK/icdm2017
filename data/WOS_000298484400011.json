In this paper, we focus on two centralized algorithms based on IEEE 802.16 standard to adopt effective monitor and control mechanism to do the scheduling and channel assignment in WiMAX mesh networks. The base station (BS) monitors the subscriber stations (SSs) and gathers their requests, and then controls the SSs under the direction of the centralized algorithm. The IEEE 802.16 standard proposes two kinds of scheduling algorithms in WiMAX mesh networks, centralized and distributed algorithms. The centralized solution is more convenient to monitor and control a WiMAX mesh network since the central node is the unique monitor and controller. This paper mainly introduces two schemes working in a centralized mode. They are working in a tree search active link selection (TSALS) fashion and a link search active link selection (LSALS) fashion. In these schemes, each node is equipped with a third generation (3G) mesh router, which owns two relay transceivers and can be tuned among multiple channels. The major goal of our solution is to reduce the length of scheduling under an interference-aware restriction. The feasibility and efficiency of our proposal are testified through extensive simulations. The result justifies that our algorithms provide much higher performance than the previous ones.
