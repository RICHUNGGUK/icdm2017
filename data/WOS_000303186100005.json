This system, which is based on a hybrid model and the genetic algorithm, is developed to improve the efficiency, to reduce the manufacturing errors, as well as to extend the useful life of rolls through uniform wear design. Generalized parametric equations are established for geometrical modeling, graphic plotting of oval-round passes, as well as calculation of the cross section area, contact area and the lengths of contact arcs along the cross section of round groove in the MATLAB programming environment. Moreover, these equations can also realize the parametric transformation between roll profile and mathematical models for the oval-round pass design and optimization. The genetic algorithm is employed for the optimal design of oval-round passes in this paper. The objective functions are formulated for minimization of power consumption in the rolling process, variances between ideal dimensions and design dimensions, as well as variances between the lengths of contact arcs. To reduce the complexity and computational burden of the system, some reliable empirical formulas for the calculations of contact area and contact arc length are applied. Finally, the proposed approach is applied to an oval-round pass design. Through simulation and comparison of results against experimental data acquired from literature, it is found that this system is reliable, effective and easier to use. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
