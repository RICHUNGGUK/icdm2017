The Vietoris-Rips complex is a combinatorial simplicial complex based on proximity of neighbors that serves as an easily-computed but high-dimensional approximation to the homotopy type of D. There is a natural \"shadow\" projection map from the Vietoris-Rips complex to E(n) that has as its image a more accurate n-dimensional approximation to the homotopy type of D. We demonstrate that this projection map is 1-connected for the planar case n = 2. That is, for planar domains, the Vietoris-Rips complex accurately captures connectivity and fundamental group data. This implies that the fundamental group of a Vietoris-Rips complex for a planar point set is a free group. We show that, in contrast, introducing even a small amount of uncertainty in proximity detection leads to \"quasi\"-Vietoris-Rips complexes with nearly arbitrary fundamental groups. This topological noise can be mitigated by examining a pair of quasi-Vietoris-Rips complexes and using ideas from persistent topology. Finally, we show that the projection map does not preserve higher-order topological data for planar sets, nor does it preserve fundamental group data for point sets in dimension larger than three.", "paper_title": "Vietoris-Rips Complexes of Planar Point Sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000277198900004"}
