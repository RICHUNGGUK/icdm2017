A user can select a character in a video clip and view the distribution of his/her emotions along the video timeline through a colour bar based interface. Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the efficiency of affective annotation. The results of these experiments indicate that affective annotation is effective in both improving the speed of locating a specific scene within a video clip and helping comprehend a video clip in a limited viewing time period. Based on the analysis of recorded operations of participants, the strategies employed by participants and the factors that might influence the utilization of affective annotation are also highlighted.
