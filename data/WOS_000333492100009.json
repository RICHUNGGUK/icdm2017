Here, we model a particular biological system hunting in the Etruscan shrew as a case study in biomimetic robot design. These shrews strike rapidly and accurately after gathering very limited sensory information from their whiskers; we attempt to mimic this performance by using model-based simultaneous discrimination and localisation of a 'prey' robot (i.e. by using strong priors to make sense of limited sensory data), building on our existing low-level models of attention and appetitive behaviour in small mammals. We report performance that is comparable, given the spatial and temporal scale differences, to shrew performance, and discuss what this study reveals about biomimetic robot design in general.
