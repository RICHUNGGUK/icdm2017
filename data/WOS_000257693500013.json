The proposed scheme is capable of achieving a close performance to the Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ in the context of both binary phase-shift keying (BPSK) modulation and 4 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), when communicating over dispersive Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, it attains a factor 3 and 4.38 lower computational complexity associated with the addition/subtraction operations compared to the Jacobian RBF DFE TEQ for BPSK and 4QAM, respectively. In addition, the complexity reduction factor associated with the multiplication/division/exp(center dot)/ln(center dot) operations is 1.14 and 2.53 for BPSK and 4QAM, respectively.", "paper_title": "Using a priori information to reduce the computational complexity of RBF-assisted turbo equalization", "paper_id": "WOS:000257693500013"}
