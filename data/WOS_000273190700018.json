Adaptive speed control with timing error prediction is promising to mitigate the timing margin variation, whereas it inherently has a critical risk of timing error occurrence when a circuit is slowed down. This paper presents how to evaluate the relation between timing error rate and power dissipation in self-adaptive circuits with timing error prediction. The discussion is experimentally validated using adders in subthreshold operation in a 90 not CMOS process. We show a trade-off between timing error rate and power dissipation, and reveal the dependency of the trade-off oil design parameters.", "paper_title": "Trade-Off Analysis between Timing Error Rate and Power Dissipation for Adaptive Speed Control with Timing Error Prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000273190700018"}
