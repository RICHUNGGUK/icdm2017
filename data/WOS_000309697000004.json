In recent studies of multimedia streaming, the features of mobile devices were not considered in solving the bandwidth restriction problem. This paper proposes a novel cloud multimedia streaming architecture for providing dynamic adjustable streaming services, we considers mobile device resources, multimedia codec characteristics and the current network environment and design the stream dispatcher with the adaptable codec approach to calculate the most suitable segment for mobile devices in time. Besides, dynamic adjustable multimedia streaming (DAMS) algorithm within mobile multimedia service is also schemed in this paper to deliver multimedia content over cloud network immediately, decrease the loading of content storage servers substantially and reduce power consumption of mobile devices effectively.
