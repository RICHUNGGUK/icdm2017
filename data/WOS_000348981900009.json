These complexes possess some aromatic character and promising hydrogen adsorption properties. In this study, we investigated the aromatic character of these compounds using aromaticity indices andmolecular orbital analysis. To determine the nature of interactions between hydrogen and the metallic center, variationperturbational decomposition of interaction energy was applied together with ETS- NOCVanalysis. The results obtained suggest that the aromatic character comes from three p orbitals located mainly on the C5H5- fragment. The high hydrogen adsorption energy (up to 6.5 kcal mol(-1)) results from two types of interaction. In C5H6Be2, adsorption is controlled by interactions between the empty metal orbital and the s orbital of the hydrogen molecule (Kubas interaction) together with corresponding backdonation interactions. Other C5H6M2 compounds adsorb H-2 due to Kubas interactions enhanced by H-2-pi interactions.", "paper_title": "s-Block metallabenzene: aromaticity and hydrogen adsorption", "paper_id": "WOS:000348981900009"}
