The system has one switch and four subsystems, which fits the need of advanced financial analysis. Using the system, we can obtain the following important information: ( 1) the most powerful explanatory variable, ( 2) the length of most representative sample period, and ( 3) the optimal updated model. In addition, with the non-uniform self-selective coder, the mean absolute errors have been decreased significantly. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V.
