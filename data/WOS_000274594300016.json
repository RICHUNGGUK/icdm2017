The new features are demographic profiles, account information, grant information, Henley segmentation, aggregated call-details, line information, service orders, bill and payment history. The basic idea of the three input window techniques is to make the position order of some monthly aggregated call-detail features from previous months in the combined feature set for testing be as the same one as for training phase. For evaluating these new features and window techniques, the two most common modelling techniques (decision trees and multilayer perceptron neural networks) and one of the most promising approaches (support vector machines) are selected as predictors. The experimental results show that the new features with the new window techniques are efficient for churn prediction in land-line telecommunication service fields. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
