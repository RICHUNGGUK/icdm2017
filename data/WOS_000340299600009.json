We begin by stating the objectives of the study and the type of activity observed, i.e. joint mediated writing. Then, we describe our procedure by (i) justifying our methodological choices, which are grounded in a psycho-ergonomic approach of ethnographical inspiration, (ii) detailing the setup of the study and (iii) describing the modes used to present the observables. Next, we present our analysis of a session, while revealing some intermediate results related to the properties of computer traces of interaction and their use in the course of the session. We end with a discussion of the results and limitations of the study followed by the conclusion, which opens up some pathways for designing 'tracing systems' capable of supporting joint mediated activities.", "paper_title": "Traces and activity: a case study of a joint writing process mediated by a digital environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000340299600009"}
