We call the proposed control chart the 'Probability of Class (PoC) chart' because the values of PoC, obtained from classification algorithms, are used as monitoring statistics. The control limits of PoC charts are established and adjusted by the bootstrap method. Experimental results with simulated and real data showed that PoC charts outperform Hotelling's T-2 control charts. Further, a simulation study revealed that a small proportion of out-of-control observations are sufficient for PoC charts to achieve the desired performance.", "paper_title": "Integration of classification algorithms and control chart techniques for monitoring multivariate processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000299727100009"}
