Mechatronics is a complex, highly technical and multidisciplinary field involving the design and manufacture of integrated products. Mechatronics course at the undergraduate level is rapidly increasing across the world. Most courses require student teams to design a product. The complexity of student projects can make administration of mechatronics courses extremely difficult. Students develop both practical and theoretical understanding of mechatronics while working on group projects. They also develop the interpersonal and communication skills needed to work in a multi-disciplinary field. This study describes a group project-based approach for enabling teams of students to complete mechatronics projects. A set of heuristic guidelines is also proposed. At the National Changhua University of Education in the Department of Industrial Education and Technology, this approach has yielded high student satisfaction and achievement.
