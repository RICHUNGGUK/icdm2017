As one kind of P2P overlay, DHT overlay also has the advantages of high reliability, high scalability and low cost. Because of these advantages, DHT has been proposed to form server farms such as DHT-based NoSQL databases, SIP server farms, IMS server farms, OpenFlow controller farms, etc. This paper presents DS2, a DHT-based substrate designed for the application server farms providing distributed services. DS2 facilitates the deployment of DHT-based distributed services in three aspects. First, DS2 offers a powerful data model to manage complex data. Second, DS2 provides application message routing function and workload migration function, which help application server farm to achieve load balance, failover and service continuity. Third, DS2 allows deploying application server farms across data centers. DS2 deploying across data centers is optimized to provide better performance and service continuity. We have implemented a DS2 prototype and used it in ZTE's P2P CSCFprototype and service routing prototype to enable IMS services and service routing services successfully.", "paper_title": "DS2: A DHT-based substrate for distributed services", "paper_id": "WOS:000327408000003"}
