Measured boundary parameterizations focus on lowering the distortion by setting the boundary free with the help of distance from a center vertex to all the boundary vertices. Hence these parameterizations strongly depend on the determination of the center vertex. In this paper, we introduce two methods to determine the center vertex automatically. Both of them can be used as necessary supplements to the existing measured boundary methods to minimize the common artifacts as a result of the obscure choice of the center vertex. In addition, we propose a simple and fast measured boundary parameterization method based on the Poisson's equation. Our new approach generates less conformal distortion than the fixed boundary methods. It also generates more regular domain boundaries than other measured boundary methods. Moreover, it offers a good tradeoff between computation costs and conformal distortion compared with the fast and robust angle based flattening (ABF++).", "paper_title": "Measured boundary parameterization based on Poisson's equation", "paper_id": "WOS:000275538000004"}
