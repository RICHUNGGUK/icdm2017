But this method can :not be very effective and precise in spatial alignment, due to a small number of moving objects in the scene, limited coverage of the trajectories and the short temporal duration of the trajectories. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a new sequence-to-sequence alignment method, combining the method proposed by Caspi et al. with a feature-based image registration method. In this paper, we made a comparison between our method and that of Caspi et al. Experimental results show that the presented method improves alignment precision both on X-axis orientation and on Y-axis orientation. The PSNR value is approximately improved by 13.5dB. At the same time, the time needed by Our-method will be slightly increased but can be ignored. When the results of the alignment are applied in space-time super-resolution reconstruction, the effect also proves the validity of our-method.", "paper_title": "An Improved Sequence-to-sequence Alignment Method Combined with Feature-based Image Registration Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000304633500012"}
