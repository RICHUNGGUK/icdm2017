The photonic bandgap and slow-wave effect of the BCMRC are evaluated. The compact configuration presents ultrawide stopband and improved slow-wave characteristics. Investigation of its scattering/ radiation level is also included. An ultrawide band lowpass filter, consisting of three BCMRCs connected in series, is designed and fabricated. The filter has the advantages of low insertion loss in the passband, sharp, high and wide rejection in the stopband and compact size. The experimental results show good agreements with simulation results.
