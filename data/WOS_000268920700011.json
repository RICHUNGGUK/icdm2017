Modern systems have to deal with large data volumes and the challenge is to process and search these data effectively. One of the aspects of efficiency is the ability to query those data with respect to their semantics. In this area an RDF data model and a SPARQL query language gained the highest popularity and are de facto standards. The problem is that most data in modern systems are stored in relational databases and have no formal and precisely expressed semantics, although operations on those data are fast and scalable. Traditionally, in this area relational data are transformed to a form expected by reasoning and querying systems (usually RDF based). In this work a method of query rewriting is presented that translates a query to an RDF data structure i.e. SPARQL query) to a SQL query executed by RDBMS. Transforming queries instead of data has many advantages and might lead to significant increase of data extraction efficiency.", "paper_title": "An efficient SQL-based querying method to RDF schemata", "paper_id": "WOS:000268920700011"}
