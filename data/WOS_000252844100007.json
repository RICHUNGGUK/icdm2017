In this setting of property-testing, the distance between functions is measured with respect to a fixed but unknown distribution D on the domain. The testing algorithms are given oracle access to random sampling from the domain according to this distribution D. This notion of distribution-free testing was previously defined, but no distribution-free property-testing algorithm was known for any (nontrivial) property. We present the first such distribution-free property-testing algorithms for two of the central problems in this field. The testers are obtained by extending some known results (from \"standard,\" uniform distribution, property-testing): (1) A distribution-free testing algorithm for low-degree multivariate polynomials with query complexity O(d(2) + d . epsilon(-1)), where d is the total degree of the polynomial. The same approach that is taken for the distribution-free testing of low-degree polynomials is shown to apply also to several other problems; (2) a distribution-free monotonicity testing algorithm for functions f : [n](d) -> A for low dimensions (e. g., when d is a constant) with query complexity similar to the one achieved in the uniform setting. On the negative side, we prove an exponential gap between the query complexity required for uniform and distribution-free monotonicity testing in the high-dimensional case.", "paper_title": "Distribution-free property-testing", "paper_id": "WOS:000252844100007"}
