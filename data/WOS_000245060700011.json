Analysis in this paper shows that Fresnel convolution kernel function performs well on edge enhancement when images are transformed into complex functions. Due to its mathematical complexity, the method is simplified into a linear convolution filter. The new edge detector is designed based on the simplified linear filter. Experimental results indicate that the new detector gives quantitative results equal to the Canny detector while it is more simple to be implemented. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
