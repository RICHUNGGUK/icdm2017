It implies that the lattice of hyperclones on a k-element set is isomorphic to the lattice of regular sets on a (2(k)-1)-element set. We introduce this concept formally and present a Galois connection Inv-rPol for which F = rPol Inv F for each regular set F. Finally, we present all maximal regular sets on a three-element set, determined by Tarasov.", "paper_title": "Regular Sets of Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000305440000011"}
