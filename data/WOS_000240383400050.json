In single-master/multi-slave mode, CAN master transmits control messages to each slave. If many slaves need small data from CAN master, CAN network spends a lot of time transmitting CAN overhead bits. So the transmission efficiency in CAN network goes down. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that increases the transmission efficiency by reorganizing the data mathematically.", "paper_title": "A data reorganization algorithm to improve transmission efficiency in CAN networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400050"}
