Most existing and proposed approaches use Performance Monitoring Counters (Hardware Monitoring Counters) for this task. In this paper we propose a complementary approach that employs the statistics of CPU utilization (workload) only. Hence, we model the workload and the power consumption of a multicore processor as random variables and exploit the monotonicity property of their distribution functions to establish a quantitative relationship between the random variables. We will show that for a single-core processor the relationship is best approximated by a quadratic function whereas for a dualcore processor, the relationship is best approximated by a linear function. We will demonstrate the plausibility of our approach by estimating the power consumption of both custom-made and standard benchmarks (namely, the SPEC power benchmark and the Apache benchmarking tool) for an Intel and AMD processors.", "paper_title": "A Stochastic Model for Estimating the Power Consumption of a Processor", "paper_id": "WOS:000352491300008"}
