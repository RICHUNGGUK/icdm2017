Later, in 2005, Fridrich et al. improved this method to minimize the distortion introduced by the embedding; a process called wet paper. However, as previously emphasized in the literature, this method can fail during the embedding step. Here we find sufficient and necessary conditions to guarantee a successful embedding, by studying the dual distance of a linear code. Since these results are essentially of combinatorial nature, they can be generalized to systematic codes, a large family containing all linear codes. We also compute the exact number of embedding solutions and point out the relationship between wet paper codes and orthogonal arrays.", "paper_title": "WET PAPER CODES AND THE DUAL DISTANCE IN STEGANOGRAPHY", "paper_id": "WOS:000307876400002"}
