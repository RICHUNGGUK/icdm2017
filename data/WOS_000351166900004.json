The microscopic level deals with the quality and cost of the part machining service networks, and aims to analyse them quantitatively. Assisted by computing intelligence, some candidates are chosen out of numerous combinations. Compound with other producer services and services productions, several product service networks come into being. The macroscopic level deals with these networks' time, stable and robust properties. Based on the corresponding evaluation indexes, these networks' topology properties are analysed. Then the product service relationships are studied globally. The method benefits product service networks' establishment and monitoring.", "paper_title": "Evaluating and optimising product service relationships from microscopic and macroscopic perspectives", "paper_id": "WOS:000351166900004"}
