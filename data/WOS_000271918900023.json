Due to the unlinkability property, the technique has been applied to untraceable electronic cash and anonymous electronic voting systems to protect the privacy of users. However, it does not meet the randomization property that is a prerequisite of modern blind signatures for reducing the threat of coercion or bribe against the security of anonymous electronic voting systems based on blind signatures. This manuscript presents a quite efficient randomization solution for Chaum's blind signatures. Compared with Chaum's scheme, the computation cost is only increased by 0.7% in the proposed randomized Chaum blind signature scheme.", "paper_title": "FAST RANDOMIZATION SCHEMES FOR CHAUM BLIND SIGNATURES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271918900023"}
