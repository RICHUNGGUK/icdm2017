The resource requirements for implementing a quantum walk as a program on a quantum computer are compared and found to be very similar for both discrete and continuous time walks. The role of the oracle, and how it changes if more prior information about the graph is available, is also discussed.", "paper_title": "Quantum walks on general graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000243318200005"}
