The proposed algorithm directly extracts edge information from raw sensor data for interpolation in both demosaicking and zooming to preserve edge features in its output. This allows the extracted information to be exploited consistently in both stages and also efficiently, as no separate extraction process is required Camera in different stages. The proposed algorithm can produce a zoomed Output full-color image as well as a zoomed Bayer color filter array image with outstanding performance as compared with conventional approaches which generally combine separate color demosaicking and digital zooming schemes.", "paper_title": "A low-complexity joint color demosaicking and zooming algorithm for digital camera", "paper_id": "WOS:000247489200001"}
