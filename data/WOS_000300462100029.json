The effects of the instability in the compressional regime and particle deficiency are suppressed by adopting a new smoothing kernel and its gradient corrections. The insensitivity to the compressional instability of the adopted method is confirmed by numerical tests. The method is validated and calibrated through a series of standard numerical tests and showed quantitative agreements. The method is extended to two-dimensional jet breakup problems and provided good comparison to the theoretical and experimental results. In particular, the numerical model exhibits the transition from the jetting to dripping when the Weber number is close to its theoretical critical value. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
