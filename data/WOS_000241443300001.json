This toolkit is the Data Toolkit. We demonstrate that it allows programmers to create web applications on a level of abstraction that is comparable with 'ordinary' functional style programs. By this we mean that programmers can develop data structures and functions in the usual way. From the data structures the Data Toolkit is able to generate forms that can be used in a web application. It does this by making use of advanced programming concepts such as generic programming. The programmer need not be aware of this.", "paper_title": "Generic editors for the World Wide Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241443300001"}
