We prove that finding a smallest convex polygon that encloses any of the given polygons is NP-hard, and give a PTAS for minimizing the perimeter of the convex enclosure. We also give efficient algorithms to find the smallest rectangle simultaneously enclosing a given pair of convex polygons.", "paper_title": "Scandinavian Thins on Top of Cake: New and Improved Algorithms for Stacking and Packing", "paper_id": "WOS:000334413600009"}
