By Lyapunov stability theory, a general method for function projective synchronization is proposed to make the states of two chaotic systems asymptotically synchronized up to a desired scaling function. Furthermore, based on function projective synchronization, a scheme for secure communication is investigated in theory. The corresponding numerical simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "A GENERAL METHOD FOR FUNCTION PROJECTIVE SYNCHRONIZATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000269395000013"}
