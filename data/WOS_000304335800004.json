In order to deal with the divergence of uncertain variables via uncertainty distributions, this paper aims at introducing the concept of cross-entropy for uncertain variables based on uncertain theory, as well as investigating some mathematical properties of this concept. Several practical examples are also provided to calculate uncertain cross-entropy. Furthermore, the minimum cross-entropy principle is proposed in this paper. Finally, a study of generalized cross-entropy for uncertain variables is carried out. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
