ANNs are first trained by the H. filtering algorithm and then some unimportant weights are removed based on the training. The results presented in the paper show that the proposed method provides better pruning results of the network without losing its generalization capacity. It also provides a robust training algorithm for given arbitrary network structures. The usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are demonstrated in developing an ANN model of a hysteretic structural system.", "paper_title": "H-infinity filtering in neural network training and pruning with application to system identification", "paper_id": "WOS:000243054300006"}
