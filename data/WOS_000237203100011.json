This paper proposes a new methodology for multi-agent system development based on Goal Net model. The methodology covers the whole life cycle of the agent system development, from requirement analysis, architecture design, detailed design to implementation. A Multi-Agent Development Environment (MADE) that facilitates the design and implementation of agent systems is presented. A case study on an agent-based e-learning system developed using the proposed methodology is illustrated in this paper.", "paper_title": "Goal-oriented methodology for agent system development", "paper_id": "WOS:000237203100011"}
