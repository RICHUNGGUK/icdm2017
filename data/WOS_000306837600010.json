Three kinds of adiabatic algorithms for this problem are shown, in which two of them provide a quadratic speedup over the other one. But when the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian and that of the final Hamiltonian have a zero overlap, the algorithms above all fail, in the sense of in finite time complexity. A corresponding revised method for this phenomenon through adding a driving Hamiltonian is also shown, from which a constant time complexity can be gained. But by a simple analysis, we find that the original time complexity for the adiabatic evolution is shifted to implement the driving Hamiltonian, which is supported by several early works in the literature.", "paper_title": "ON THE ADIABATIC EVOLUTION OF ONE-DIMENSIONAL PROJECTOR HAMILTONIANS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306837600010"}
