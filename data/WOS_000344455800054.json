They ease the construction of programs by using satisfiability solvers to automate tasks such as verification, debugging, synthesis, and non-deterministic execution. But reducing programming tasks to satisfiability problems involves translating programs to logical constraints, which is an engineering challenge even for domain-specific languages. We have previously shown that translation to constraints can be avoided if SDSLs are implemented by (traditional) embedding into a host language that is itself solver-aided. This paper describes how to implement a symbolic virtual machine (SVM) for such a host language. Our symbolic virtual machine is lightweight because it compiles to constraints only a small subset of the host's constructs, while allowing SDSL designers to use the entire language, including constructs for DSL embedding. This lightweight compilation employs a novel symbolic execution technique with two key properties: it produces compact encodings, and it enables concrete evaluation to strip away host constructs that are outside the subset compilable to constraints. Our symbolic virtual machine architecture is at the heart of ROSETTE, a solver-aided language that is host to several new SDSLs.", "paper_title": "A Lightweight Symbolic Virtual Machine for Solver-Aided Host Languages", "paper_id": "WOS:000344455800054"}
