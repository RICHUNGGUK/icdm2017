Currently, much research has been dedicated to developing automatic prediction tools. Most, however, focus on mono-locational proteins, i.e., they assume that proteins exist in only one location. It should be noted that many proteins bear multi-locational characteristics and carry out crucial functions in biological processes. This work aims to develop a general pattern classifier for predicting multiple subcellular locations of proteins. We use an ensemble classifier, called the min-max modular support vector machine (M(3)-SVM), to solve protein subcellular multi-localization problems; and, propose a module decomposition method based on gene ontology (GO) semantic information for M(3)-SVM. The amino acid composition with secondary structure and solvent accessibility information is adopted to represent features of protein sequences. We apply our method to two multi-locational protein data sets. The M(3)-SVMs show higher accuracy and efficiency than traditional SVMs using the same feature vectors. And the GO decomposition also helps to improve prediction accuracy. Moreover, our method has a much higher rate of accuracy than existing subcellular localization predictors in predicting protein multi-localization.", "paper_title": "PROTEIN SUBCELLULAR MULTI-LOCALIZATION PREDICTION USING A MIN-MAX MODULAR SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE", "paper_id": "WOS:000274914700003"}
