Moreover, noise and outliers may cause difficulties in obtaining appropriate clustering results from the FCM algorithm. The embedding of FCM into switching regressions, called the fuzzy c-regressions (FCRs), still has the same drawbacks as FCM. In this paper, we propose the alpha-cut implemented fuzzy clustering algorithms, referred to as FCM alpha, which allow the data points being able to completely belong to one cluster. The proposed FCMa algorithms can form a cluster core for each cluster, where data points inside a cluster core will have a membership value of I so that it can resolve the drawbacks of FCM. On the other hand, the fuzziness index m plays different roles for FCM and FCM alpha. We find that the clustering results obtained by FCM alpha are more robust to noise and outliers than FCM when a larger m is used. Moreover, the cluster cores generated by FCM alpha are workable for various data shape clusters, so that FCMa is very suitable for embedding into switching regressions. The embedding of FCMa into switching regressions is called FCR alpha. The proposed FCR alpha provides better results than FCR for environments with noise or outliers. Numerical examples show the robustness and the superiority of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Alpha-cut implemented fuzzy clustering algorithms and switching regressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000258763600001"}
