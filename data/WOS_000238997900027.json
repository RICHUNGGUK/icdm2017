Design/methodology/approach - The concept of system and its philosophical implications are examined in relation to ecology and environmentalism. Findings - That in human systems complexity is organised through forms of hierarchy, coevolution connected to the environment, emergency and information phenomena which transform disorder into order. Concludes that these traits have a deep impact on the system man - environment and offer opportunities for scientific research and social mobilisation to think and act in a broader context. Originality/value - Political near scientific thought as presented encourage a rethinking or concepts such as resposibility limit, diversity when the future of the earth is deemed to be threatened.", "paper_title": "Ecology, environmentalism and system theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900027"}
