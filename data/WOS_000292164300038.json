However, computational models generate so much information regarding protein behavior that large-scale analysis by traditional methods is almost impossible. The volume of data produced makes the transition from data to knowledge difficult and hinders biomedical advances. In this work, we present a novel visual analytics approach named WaveMap for exploring data generated by a protein flexibility model. WaveMap integrates wavelet analysis, visualizations, and interactions to facilitate the browsing, feature identification, and comparison of protein attributes represented by two-dimensional plots. We have implemented a fully working prototype of WaveMap and illustrate its usefulness through expert evaluation and an example scenario.", "paper_title": "WaveMap: Interactively Discovering Features From Protein Flexibility Matrices Using Wavelet-based Visual Analytics", "paper_id": "WOS:000292164300038"}
