The proposed method of DBN-based inference is preceded by steps of skin extraction and modelling, and motion tracking. Then we develop a gesture model for one- or two-hand gestures. They are used to define a cyclic gesture network for modeling continuous gesture stream. We have also developed a DP-based real-time decoding algorithm for continuous gesture recognition. In our experiments with 10 isolated gestures, we obtained a recognition rate upwards of 99.59% with cross validation. In the case of recognizing continuous stream of gestures, it recorded 84% with the precision of 80.77% for the spotted gestures. The proposed DBN-based hand gesture model and the design of a gesture network model are believed to have a strong potential for successful applications to other related problems such as sign language recognition although it is a bit more complicated requiring analysis of hand shapes.
