In this paper, we consider the index for connected graphs. In the first part, we describe a linear tune algorithm APT for computing the index of trees, and then characterize the trees maximizing the index among all trees of given order. In the second part, we present an algorithm which computes the index W(p)(G) for any given connected graph G on n vertices in time O(M(n)), where M(n) denotes the time necessary to multiply two n x n matrices of small integers (which is currently known to be O(n(2.376))).", "paper_title": "Algorithms and Extremal Problem on Wiener Polarity Index", "paper_id": "WOS:000266748900016"}
