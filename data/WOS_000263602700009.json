Enhancements of CHF in nano-fluids in the wide range of particle sizes and concentrations were compared with those in pure water. Also, the effects of the particle deposition on CHF enhancement were investigated. All experiments were performed at the atmospheric pressure condition. The results show that the measured boiling curves in nano-fluids were shifted to the right and CHF were significantly enhanced for different nano-particle sizes and concentrations. The CHF of nano-fluids was increased as the size of the nano-particles decreased. On the other hand, nano-particle concentration value showing the maximum CHF had a critical value. In each pool boiling experiment of nano-fluids, nano-particles were deposited on the heater surface. Assuming that this phenomenon caused the CHF enhancement, pool boiling experiments of pure water were carried out with these nano-particle deposited heaters. The results of these tests were similar to those of the test of the nano-fluids for the CHF enhancement. The main cause of CHF enhancement was found to be the change of the heater surface structure. In order to analyze boiling phenomena of pure water and Al(2)O(3) nano-fluids, boiling process was visualized by using a high speed camera.", "paper_title": "Wide Range Parametric Study for the Pool Boiling of Nano-fluids with a Circular Plate Heater", "paper_id": "WOS:000263602700009"}
