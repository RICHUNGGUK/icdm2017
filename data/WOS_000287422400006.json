A node in such a network bases its decision to interact (gossip) with another node on its partial view of the global system. Because of the size of these networks, analysis of gossip protocols is mostly done using simulations, but these tend to be expensive in computation time and memory consumption. We employ mean-field analysis techniques for the evaluation of gossip protocols. Nodes in the network are represented by small identical stochastic processes. Joining all nodes would result in an enormous stochastic process. If the number of nodes goes to infinity, however, mean-field analysis allows us to replace this intractably large stochastic process by a small deterministic process. This process approximates the behaviour of very large gossip networks, and can be evaluated using simple matrix-vector multiplications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
