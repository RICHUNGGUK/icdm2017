A key component of EXTENT is a Landmark recognition system called LandMarker. In this paper, we present the architecture of LandMarker. The content of a query photograph is analyzed and compared against a database of sample landmark images, to recognize any landmarks it contains. An algorithm is presented for comparing a query image with a sample image. Context information may be used to assist landmark recognition. Also, we show how LandMarker deals with scalability to allow recognition of a large number of landmarks. We have implemented a prototype of the system, and present empirical results on a large dataset.", "paper_title": "Scalable landmark recognition using EXTENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000255903800002"}
