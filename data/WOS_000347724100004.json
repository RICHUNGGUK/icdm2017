Relevant characteristics of the two approaches are described to identify the real necessities of undergraduate students to avoid deficiencies in static classrooms; these characteristics support significant learning environments where students of IT-related curricula are actively related to implementing their own public artifacts, passing through passive to active learning states. Thus, from our perspective the constructionist theory in combination with an ISD model can be useful in developing an embedded systems course for undergraduate education. This approach is supported by a software/hardware tool that was created to enhance the teaching-learning process through hands-on experimentation. Finally, the results of a comprehensive assessment of the course effectiveness are presented. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
