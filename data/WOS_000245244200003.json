By introducing a convolutive mixing model for the components, we show how the order of the filters in the model can be correctly detected using Bayesian model selection. We demonstrate a framework for deconvolving a subspace of independent components in electroencephalography (EEG). Initial results suggest that in some cases, convolutive mixing may be a more realistic model for EEG signals than the instantaneous ICA model.", "paper_title": "Model selection for convolutive ICA with an application to spatiotemporal analysis of EEG", "paper_id": "WOS:000245244200003"}
