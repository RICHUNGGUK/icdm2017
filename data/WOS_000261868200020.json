This article presents an electronic t-out-of-n lottery game based on Chinese Remainder Theorem on the Internet. It is proved that this new method can achieve the general requirements of common electronic lottery mechanisms. Specifically, it allows lottery players to simultaneously select t out of n numbers in a ticket without iterative selection. And, this functionality makes the new method possible to be applied in practice. The security of the novel scheme is based on the secure one-way hash function and the factorization problem in RSA cryptosystems. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
