At first, the model uses the unit with regular shape to make mesh generation of continuous structure, and adopts the finite element method to calculate the local strain energy density. Then it directly maps the mesh to the evolutionary environment of the cellular automata, and uses PID control theory and fully stressed design criterion to reconstruct local evolutionary rule of the cellular based on the strain energy. At last, it obtains the variation coefficients of the unit density through cellular evolution, thus getting a new design domain. The control parameters of the interaction rule and neighbourhood structure are also analysed. Furthermore, an optimal topology emergence example of the square plate dissipating heat is given. Finally, the characteristics of the proposed structure emergence model based on cellular automata are summarises.", "paper_title": "Research on structure emergence based on cellular automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000335497200004"}
