A set of stochastic variables are used to describe the sensor failure. 2) An event-triggered scheme, which has some advantages over some existing ones, is introduced to the networked control systems. Under the event-triggered scheme, the sensor data are transmitted only when the sampled measurements of the plant violate the specified event condition. Then, an event-based filter design model for T-S fuzzy systems is constructed by taking the effect of event-triggered scheme and the sensor faults into consideration. Sufficient conditions for the existence of the desired filter are established in terms of linear matrix inequalities and the explicit expression is given for the designed filter parameters. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the design method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
