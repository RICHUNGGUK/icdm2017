In this study, we propose an interactive virtual aquarium system that interacts with a smart device as a user interface. We developed a virtual aquarium graphic system and a remote interaction application of a smart device for building an interactive virtual aquarium system. We performed an experiment that demonstrates the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed system as an example of a new type of interactive application of a smart display, where a smart device serves as a remote user interface.", "paper_title": "Development of a virtual aquarium system interacting with a smart device", "paper_id": "WOS:000340600300012"}
