The technology is based upon the theory that inspired stabilized methods, namely, the variational multiscale theory. The salient features of the formulation are that it can be readily implemented in existing codes, it is a very economical procedure, and it yields very accurate local error estimates uniformly from the diffusive to the advective regime. In this work, the variational multiscale error estimator is applied to develop adaptive strategies for the advectiondiffusion-reaction equation. The performance of L1 and L2 local error norms combined with three strategies to adapt the mesh is investigated. Emphasis is placed on flows with sharp boundary and interior layers but also attention is given to diffusion-dominated flows. Computational results show that the method generates meshes with a smooth transition of the element size, which capture all the flow features.
