In this paper, we construct a so-called a-level fuzzy regression model based on the resolution identity theorem and apply RT method to this model. Fuzzy regression models with crisp input/fuzzy output and fuzzy input/fuzzy output are investigated to show the effectiveness of the proposed method. To compare its effectiveness with existing methods, we introduce a new performance measure. In addition, we propose a method to obtain a predicted output with respect to a specific target value and show that our model is more robust compared with other methods when the data contain some outliers.
