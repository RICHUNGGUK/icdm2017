In particular, we propose iterative methods for solving large problems in which a trust-region bound ||x|| <= Delta is imposed on the size of the solution, and in which the least value of linear combinations of ||Ax - b||(q)(2) and a regularisation term ||x||(2)(p) for various p and q = 1, 2 is sought. In each case, one or more \"secular\" equations are derived, and fast Newton-like solution procedures are suggested. The resulting algorithms are available as part of the GALAHAD optimization library.", "paper_title": "Trust-region and other regularisations of linear least-squares problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263890000003"}
