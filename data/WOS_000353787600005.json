A single-domain (or equivalently a Darcy-Brinkman) type of approach is followed to describe the momentum transport at Darcy scale where the fracture or cavity region and porous matrix region are well identified. The Darcy scale model is upscaled yielding a macroscopic momentum equation operating on the equivalent homogeneous medium. Numerical solution to the associated closure problem is proposed in order to compute the effective permeability. Numerical results on some model fractured and cavity media are discussed and compared to some analytical results.", "paper_title": "Investigation of the effective permeability of vuggy or fractured porous media from a Darcy-Brinkman approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000353787600005"}
