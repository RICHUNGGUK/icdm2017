The transient profile and the temporal accumulation of calcium signals have been suggested as the two main characteristics in which calcium cues encode messages to be forwarded to downstream pathways. We address the analytical quantification of calcium temporal-accumulation in a long, thin section of a nonexcitable cell by solving a boundary value problem. In these expressions we note that the cytosolic Ca2+ accumulation is independent of every intracellular calcium flux and depends on the Ca2+ exchange across the membrane, cytosolic calcium diffusion, geometry of the cell, extracellular calcium perturbation, and initial concentrations. In particular, we analyse the time-integrated response of cytosolic calcium due to i) a localised initial concentration of cytosolic calcium and ii) transient extracellular perturbation of calcium. In these scenarios, we conclude that i) the range of calcium progression is confined to the vicinity of the initial concentration, thereby creating calcium microdomains; and ii) we observe a low-pass filtering effect in the response driven by extracellular Ca2+ perturbations. Additionally, we note that our methodology can be used to analyse a broader range of stimuli and scenarios.", "paper_title": "Spatial Quantification of Cytosolic Ca2+ Accumulation in Nonexcitable Cells: An Analytical Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000337904000015"}
