CIFF is an extension of the IFF proof procedure for abductive logic programming, relaxing the original restrictions over variable quantification (allowedness conditions) and incorporating a constraint solver to deal with numerical constraints as in constraint logic programming. Finally, we describe the CIFF system, comparing it with state-of-the-art abductive systems and answer set solvers and showing how to use it to program some applications.", "paper_title": "The CIFF proof procedure for abductive logic programming with constraints: Theory, implementation and experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000271985400001"}
