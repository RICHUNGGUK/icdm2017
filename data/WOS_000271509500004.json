Computer, as one game player, monitors opponents' (human or other computers) strategies and then updates its own policy using RL methods. In this article, we first examine the suitability of applying the online RL in various computer games. Reinforcement learning application depends on both RL complexity and the game features. We then propose a multi-layer framework for implementing online RL in an RTS game. The framework significantly reduces RL computational complexity by decomposing the state space in a hierarchical manner. We implement an RTS gameTank Generaland perform a thorough test on the proposed framework. We consider three typical profiles of RTS game players and compare two basic RL techniques applied in the game. The results show the effectiveness of our proposed framework and shed light on relevant issues in using online RL in RTS games.", "paper_title": "EXPERIMENTS WITH ONLINE REINFORCEMENT LEARNING IN REAL-TIME STRATEGY GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000271509500004"}
