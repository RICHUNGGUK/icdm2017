We demonstrate that there are a finite, though exponential number of potential staircase least cost paths between a specified pair of origin-destination points. An upper bound for the number of entry/exit points of a rectilinear path between two points specified a priori in the presence of a congested region is obtained. Based oil this key finding, a memory-based probing algorithm is proposed for the problem and computational experience for various problem instances is reported. A special case where polynomial time solutions can be obtained has also been outlined. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
