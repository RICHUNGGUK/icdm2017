Quantified propositional formulas of linear inequalities with (k - 1) quantifier alternations are log-space complete in Sigma(P)(k) or Pi(P)(k) depending on the initial quantifier. We show that when we restrict ourselves to quantified conjunctions of linear inequalities, i.e., quantified linear systems, the complexity classes collapse to polynomial time. In other words, the presence of universal quantifiers does not alter the complexity of the linear programming problem, which is known to be in IF. Our result reinforces the importance of sentence formats from the perspective of computational complexity. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
