Spurred by this observation, it is necessary to select a limited number of independent paths as much as possible, so we fall back on end-to-end probes to estimate path correlation. This paper focuses on a new topic of correlation-aware multipath selection, with formal and systematic problem definition, modeling and solution. Based on well-designed multipath delay probing, a Grouping-based Multipath Selection (GMS) mechanism is developed to avoid shared bottleneck between topologically joint paths.", "paper_title": "Correlation-aware multipath selection to enhance path diversity in ubiquitous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000311714800006"}
