Though the use of EHR improves the storage and access to the information in it regarding the previous health records in papers, it entails the risk of having the same problems of huge size and of becoming inoperative and really difficult to handle, especially if the user is looking for a specific data item. Our proposal is based on the contextualization of the access, providing the user with the most important information for the assistance act in which he/she is involved. To do this, we define the set of possible contexts and consider different aspects of the pertinence of the documents to each context. We do it by using fuzzy logic and pay special attention to the efficiency, due to the huge size of the involved databases. Our proposal does not limit the access to the EHR, but establishes a prioritization based on the access needs, which provides the system with an additional advantage, easily enabling the use of new terminals and devices like tablet PCs and PDAs, which have great limitations in the interfaces.", "paper_title": "Contextualized Access to Electronical Health Records in Cardiology", "paper_id": "WOS:000303997700013"}
