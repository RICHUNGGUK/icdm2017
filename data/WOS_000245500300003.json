We for the first time discover the phenomenon of sharing contradiction, which results in the violation of 100% recovery guarantee. To completely eliminate the sharing contradiction, we introduce the so-called preference policy, which implies that one of two backup paths (BPs) for each connection is given priority over the other to recover the failed active path (AP). Based on this policy, we propose a backup-multiplexing scheme with 100% recovery guarantee. Further, we transform the problem of minimizing the total number of wavelength-links under the wavelength continuity constraint while recovering from any dual-link failure to integer linear programming (ILP) formulations. Additionally, we investigate three preference policies, i.e., the first backup path preference policy (FBPPP), the second backup path preference policy (SBPPP), and the optimal preference policy (OPP). The numerical results show that our proposed backup multiplexing scheme can reduce about 30% wavelength-link consumption, compared to dedicated protection. Also, the results show that the policy, which specifies that the shorter one of two backup paths is preferred, generally outperforms the policy, which specifies that the longer one of two backup paths is preferred. Furthermore, the results show that OPP has a better performance when two BPs for each connection are more comparable in their lengths.", "paper_title": "A novel backup multiplexing scheme for surviving double-link failures in mesh optical networks without wavelength conversion capability", "paper_id": "WOS:000245500300003"}
