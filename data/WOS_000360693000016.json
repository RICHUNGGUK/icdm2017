As such, an understanding of the lifecycle, characteristics, frequency and seasonality of these convective features is important for several sectors and studies in climate studies, agricultural and hydrological studies, and disaster management. This study explores the applicability of graph theory to creating a fully automated algorithm for identifying mesoscale convective systems and determining their precipitation characteristics from satellite datasets. Our results show that applying graph theory to this problem allows for the identification of features from infrared satellite data and the seamlessly identification in a precipitation rate satellite-based dataset, while innately handling the inherent complexity and non-linearity of mesoscale convective systems.", "paper_title": "Exploring a graph theory based algorithm for automated identification and characterization of large mesoscale convective systems in satellite datasets", "paper_id": "WOS:000360693000016"}
