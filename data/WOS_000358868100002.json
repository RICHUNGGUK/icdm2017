A smoothing approach for solving this non-smooth, non-Lipschitz and non-convex l(2)(2)-l(p)(p) optimization problem is developed, in which the smoothing parameter is treated as a decision variable and a majorization method is adopted to solve the smoothing problem. The convergence theorem shows that any accumulation point of the sequence generated by the proposed approach satisfies the first-order necessary optimality condition of the l(2)(2)-l(p)(p) problem. As an application, we use the proposed smoothing majorization method to solve the famous matrix completion problems. Numerical results indicate that our algorithm can solve the test problems efficiently.", "paper_title": "A smoothing majorization method for l(2)(2)-l(p)(p) matrix minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000358868100002"}
