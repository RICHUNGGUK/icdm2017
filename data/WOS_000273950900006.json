The results showed that firm size, profitability, and employee productivity of the US pharmaceutical companies had the nonlinearly and monotonically positive influences upon their patent citations. Therefore, if US pharmaceutical companies want to enhance their innovation performance, they should pay attention on their firm size, profitability, and employee productivity.", "paper_title": "Analyzing the nonlinear effects of firm size, profitability, and employee productivity on patent citations of the US pharmaceutical companies by using artificial neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000273950900006"}
