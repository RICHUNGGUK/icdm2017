The estimation framework involves the introduction of m-1 latent data points between every pair of observations. Sequential MCMC methods are then used to sample the posterior distribution of the latent data and the model parameters on-line. The method is applied to the estimation of parameters in a simple stochastic volatility model (SV) of the U.S. short-term interest rate. We also provide a simulation study to validate our method, using synthetic data generated by the SV model with parameters calibrated to match weekly observations of the U.S. short-term interest rate.", "paper_title": "Bayesian sequential inference for nonlinear multivariate diffusions", "paper_id": "WOS:000241260600001"}
