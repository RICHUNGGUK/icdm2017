In this paper, we studied the performance of SC-FDAAA in a distributed antenna network (DAN). To make it clear whether the performance of SC-FDAAA can benefit from the distributed nature of DAN or not, we made a comparison between DAN and the traditional cellular network, that is, central antenna network. The bit error rate distribution and the system capacity (both link capacity and cellular link capacity) are presented. It is shown that by using the SC-FDAAA, cellular link capacity is maximized by using single frequency reuse. In addition, the capacity of SC-FDAAA can also benefit from the distributed nature of DAN.
