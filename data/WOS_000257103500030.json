The aim of this research is to propose the \"Practicing, Reflecting and Revising with WATA system (P2R-WATA) Assessment Literacy Development Model\" for improving pre-service teacher assessment literacy. WATA system offers personalized learning resources and opportunities for pre-service teachers to assemble tests and administer them to students on-line. Furthermore, WATA system facilitates performance of test analysis and item analysis, and enables pre-service teachers to review statistical information from the test and item analyses to revise test items. Sixty pre-service teachers participated in this research. The research results indicate that pre-service teachers using P2R-WATA Assessment Literacy Development Model have better effectiveness in improving their assessment knowledge and assessment perspectives.
