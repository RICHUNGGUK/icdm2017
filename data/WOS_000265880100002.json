Using DNS rebinding, an attacker can circumvent organizational and personal firewalls, send spam email, and defraud pay-per-click advertisers. We evaluate the cost effectiveness of mounting DNS rebinding attacks, finding that an attacker requires less than $ 100 to hijack 100,000 IP addresses. We analyze defenses to DNS rebinding attacks, including improvements to the classic \"DNS pinning,\" and recommend changes to browser plug-ins, firewalls, and Web servers. Our defenses have been adopted by plug-in vendors and by a number of open-source firewall implementations.", "paper_title": "Protecting Browsers from DNS Rebinding Attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000265880100002"}
