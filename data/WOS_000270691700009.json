In long kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of these models we find quite robust 1/f-like noise in species diversity and population sizes, as well as power-law distributions for the lifetimes of individual species and the durations of quiet periods of relative evolutionary stasis. In one model, based on the Holling Type II functional response, adaptive foraging produces a metastable low-diversity phase and a stable high-diversity phase.", "paper_title": "COMPLEX BEHAVIOR IN SIMPLE MODELS OF BIOLOGICAL COEVOLUTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000270691700009"}
