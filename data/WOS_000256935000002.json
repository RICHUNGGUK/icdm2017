Resolution of spectroscopic images is focused on the recovery of the pure spectra and distribution maps of the image constituents from the sole raw spectroscopic measurement. In image resolution, constraints are generally limited to non-negativity and the spatial information is generally not used. Local rank analysis methods have been adapted to describe the local spatial complexity of an image, providing specific pixel information. This local rank information combined with reference spectral information allows the identification of absent compounds in pixels with low compound overlap. The introduction of this information in the resolution process under the form of constraints helps to increase the performance of the resolution method and to decrease the ambiguity linked to the final solutions.
