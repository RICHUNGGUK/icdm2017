Unlike existing models, our model can accommodate different numbers of hidden nodes without increasing the model complexity. Given any number of hidden nodes, only four constraints are needed to describe the interaction between stations and the AP with the consideration of both uplink and downlink traffic. Simulation evaluation shows that our model predicts network performance accurately over a wide range of network sizes and indicates the existence of a throughput starvation problem. To address this problem, based on our model, we formulate a bandwidth allocation problem to optimize the network throughput and fairness under some predefined requirements by systematically tuning the AP and stations contention windows. Simulation results show that the starvation problem is resolved with our approach, and the target throughput is met. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
