In order to support such interchange, an abstract ontology for argumentation is presented, which serves as an interlingua between various more concrete argumentation languages. In this article, we aim to give what is essentially a logical specification of the AIF ontology by mapping the ontology onto the logical ASPIC(+) framework for argumentation. We thus lay foundations for interrelating formal logic-based approaches to argumentation captured by the ASPIC(+) framework and the wider class of argumentation languages, including those that are more informal and user-orientated.", "paper_title": "On logical specifications of the Argument Interchange Format", "paper_id": "WOS:000325170500002"}
