We study the effectiveness of our techniques on the Intel XScale processor, which is based on the previously proposed \"on-demand register fetch read\" architectural feature. Furthermore, we show that our bypass-sensitive compilation technique is effective on various partial bypass configurations.", "paper_title": "Register file power reduction using bypass sensitive compiler", "paper_id": "WOS:000256156400015"}
