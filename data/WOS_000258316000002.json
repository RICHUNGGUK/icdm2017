The development of multiple objective heuristics was inspired by the need to quickly produce acceptable solutions. In this paper, we present a new multiple objective Pareto memetic algorithm called PMSMO. The PMSMO algorithm incorporates an enhanced fine-grained fitness assignment, a double level archiving process and a local search procedure to improve performance. The performance of PMSMO is benchmarked against state-of-the-art algorithms using 0-1 multi-dimensional multiple objective knapsack problem from the literature and an industrial scheduling problem from the aluminum industry.", "paper_title": "Pareto memetic algorithm for multiple objective optimization with an industrial application", "paper_id": "WOS:000258316000002"}
