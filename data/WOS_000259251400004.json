Whereas tableau-based algorithms usually yield worst-case optimal algorithms in the case of PSPACE-complete logics, it is often very hard to design optimal tableau-based algorithms for EXPTIME-complete DLs. In contrast. the automata-based approach is usually well-suited to prove EXPTIME upper-bounds, but its direct application will usually also yield an EXPTIME-algorithm for a PSPACE-complete logic since the (tree) automaton constructed fora given concept is usually exponentially large. In the present paper, we formulate conditions underwhich an on-the-fly construction of such an exponentially large automaton can be used to obtain a PSPACE-algorithm. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach by proving a new PSPACE upper-bound for satisfiability of concepts with respect to acyclic terminologies in the DL SI, which extends the basic DL ALC with transitive and inverse roles.
