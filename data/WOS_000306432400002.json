In this paper, the existence part of the Orlicz Minkowski problem for polytopes is demonstrated. Furthermore, we obtain a solution of the Orlicz Minkowski problem for general (not necessarily even) measures.", "paper_title": "On the Orlicz Minkowski Problem for Polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000306432400002"}
