Some state variables of the previous impact are used to suppress chaotic motion by negative feedback. The method is illustrated with an example of impact vibration model with clearance impacts. This method is validated by analysis and simulation of many dimension mapping equations of the system in Poincare section. The results show that the method can suppress chaotic motion effectually. Some researches are also done on the controlling effect corresponding to the feedback matrix G and the start point of the controlling. It is found out that the smaller the G is, the longer it takes to suppress chaos. An extremely small G will cause the system to converge to a fixed circle instead of a fixed point. The start point of the controlling makes no influence on control.", "paper_title": "Suppressing of chaotic state based on delay feedback", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400077"}
