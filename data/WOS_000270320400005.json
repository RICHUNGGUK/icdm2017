Computations have been carried out for different Hartmann numbers and at various time levels. The method is based on the local boundary integral equation with moving least squares (MLS) approximation. For the MLS, nodal points spread over the analyzed domain, are utilized to approximate the interior and boundary variables. A time stepping method is employed to deal with the time derivative. Finally, numerical results are presented to show the behaviour of velocity and induced magnetic field. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
