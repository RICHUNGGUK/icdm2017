In this paper, we focus on the design of exact regenerating codes at minimum bandwidth regenerating (MBR) points. For d = n - 1, a class of (n,k,d = n - 1) exact-MBR codes, termed as repair-by-transfer codes, have been developed in prior work to avoid arithmetic operations in node repairing process. The first result of this paper presents a new class of repair-by-transfer codes via congruent transformations. As compared with prior works, the advantages of proposed codes include: i) the minimum of field size is significantly reduced from ((n)(2)) to n; ii) the encoding complexity is decreased from n(4) to n(3). Our simulation results show that the proposed code achieves faster operations than the prior approach does under large n. The second result of this paper presents a new form of coding matrix for product-matrix exact-MBR codes. The proposed coding matrix includes the following advantages: i) the minimum of finite field size is reduced from n - k + d to n; ii) the fast Reed-Solomon erasure coding algorithms can be applied on the proposed exact-MBR codes to reduce the time complexities.", "paper_title": "Novel Repair-by-Transfer Codes and Systematic Exact-MBR Codes with Lower Complexities and Smaller Field Sizes", "paper_id": "WOS:000347015800018"}
