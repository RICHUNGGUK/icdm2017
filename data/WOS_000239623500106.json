In TOPN, a duration is attached to each object accounting for the minimal and maximal amount of time between which that the behavior of the object can be completed once fired. On the other hand, the problem of the state analysis of TOPN models is also addressed, which makes it possible to judge the model consistency at a given moment of time. In particular, a new way is investigated to represent and deal with the objects with temporal knowledge. Finally, the proposed TOPN is used to model and analyze a real decision making module in one cooperative multiple robot system to demonstrate its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "Timed hierarchical object-oriented Petri net-part I: Basic concepts and reachability analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623500106"}
