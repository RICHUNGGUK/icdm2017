In order to make SN P systems capable of representing and processing fuzzy and uncertain knowledge, we propose a new class of spiking neural P systems in this paper called weighted fuzzy spiking neural P systems (WFSNP systems). New elements, including fuzzy truth value, certain factor, weighted fuzzy logic, output weight, threshold, new firing rule, and two types of neurons, are added to the original definition of SN P systems. This allows WFSN P systems to adequately characterize the features of weighted fuzzy production rules in a fuzzy rule-based system. Furthermore, a weighted fuzzy backward reasoning algorithm, based on WFSN P systems, is developed, which can accomplish dynamic fuzzy reasoning of a rule-based system more flexibly and intelligently. In addition, we compare the proposed WFSN P systems with other knowledge representation methods, such as fuzzy production rule, conceptual graph, and Petri nets, to demonstrate the features and advantages of the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Weighted Fuzzy Spiking Neural P Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000317001400002"}
