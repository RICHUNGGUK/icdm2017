The reason for this shortcoming is the lack of a load balancing scheme. This article proposes a load balancing solution specifically tailored to the needs of content-based publish/subscribe systems that is distributed, dynamic, adaptive, transparent, and accommodates heterogeneity. The solution consists of three key contributions: a load balancing framework, a novel load estimation algorithm, and three offload strategies. A working prototype of our solution is built on an open-sourced content-based publish/subscribe system and evaluated on PlanetLab, a cluster testbed, and in simulations. Real-life experiment results show that the proposed load balancing solution is efficient with less than 0.2% overhead; effective in distributing and balancing load originating from a single server to all available servers in the network; and capable of preventing overloads to preserve system stability, availability, and quality of service.", "paper_title": "Load Balancing Content-Based Publish/Subscribe Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000285501400002"}
