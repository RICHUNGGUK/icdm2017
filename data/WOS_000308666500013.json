Our approach uses models to simulate the processes insurance companies employ when determining multi-period investment strategies over a given planning horizon. The approach utilizes an enhanced heuristic algorithm to determine optimal multi-period investment strategies. Simulation models take into account asset numbers, objective functions, and asset allocation frequency. Strategy performance is evaluated by applying three single-period investment strategies to the simulation models. Computational results not only verify the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm, but also demonstrate the effectiveness of frequent asset reallocation, and dispute the suitability of traditional top-down investment strategies in maximizing investment returns of with-profit insurance policies.
