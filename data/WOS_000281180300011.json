We develop two resource allocation algorithms considering the impact of wireless interference constraints using a weighted SINR conflict graph to quantify the interference among the various nodes: (1) interference aware routing using maximum concurrent flow optimization; and (2) rate adaptive joint subcarrier and power allocation algorithm under interference and QoS constraints. We exploit spatial reuse to allocate subcarriers in the network and show that an intelligent reuse of resources can improve throughput while mitigating interference. We provide a sub-optimal heuristic to solve the rate adaptive resource allocation problem. We demonstrate that aggressive spatial reuse and fine tuned-interference modeling garner advantages in terms of throughput, end-to-end delay and power distribution. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
