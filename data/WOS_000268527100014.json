The proposed SOS-based framework provides a number of innovations and improvements over the existing linear matrix inequality (LMI)-based approaches to Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy modeling and control. First, we propose a polynomial fuzzy modeling and control framework that is more general and effective than the well-known T-S fuzzy modeling and control. Secondly, we obtain stability and stabilizability conditions of the polynomial fuzzy systems based on polynomial Lyapunov functions that contain quadratic Lyapunov functions as a special case. Hence, the stability and stabilizability conditions presented in this paper are more general and relaxed than those of the existing LMI-based approaches to T-S fuzzy modeling and control. Moreover, the derived stability and stabilizability conditions are represented in terms of SOS and can be numerically (partially symbolically) solved via the recently developed SOSTOOLS. To illustrate the validity and applicability of the proposed approach, a number of analysis and design examples are provided. The first example shows that the SOS approach renders more relaxed stability results than those of both the LMI-based approaches and a polynomial system approach. The second example presents an extensive application of the SOS approach in comparison with a piecewise Lyapunov function approach. The last example is a design exercise that demonstrates the viability of the SOS-based approach to synthesizing a stabilizing controller.", "paper_title": "A Sum-of-Squares Approach to Modeling and Control of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems With Polynomial Fuzzy Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000268527100014"}
