This problem arises in the analysis of expression in model organisms, where it is desirable to leverage existing annotations for discovering novel transcripts. We present an algorithm for reference annotation based transcript assembly and show how it can be used to rapidly investigate novel transcripts revealed by RNA-Seq in comparison with a reference annotation.", "paper_title": "Identification of novel transcripts in annotated genomes using RNA-Seq", "paper_id": "WOS:000294067300001"}
