The population evolution mechanism of PIBSO is depicted. Each state in search space has a probability to be chosen. The rule of increasing the probabilities of states is established. Incremental factor is proposed to update probability of a state, and its value is determined by the fitness of the state. It lets the states with better fitness have higher probabilities. Usual roulette wheel selection is employed to select states. Population evolution is impelled by roulette wheel selection and state probability updating. The most distinctive feature of PIBSO is because roulette wheel selection and probability updating produce a trade-off between global and local search; when PIBSO is applied to solve the printed circuit board assembly optimization problem (PCBAOP), it performs superiorly over existing genetic algorithm and adaptive particle swarm optimization on length of tour and CPU running time, respectively. The reason for having such advantages is analyzed in detail. The success of PCBAOP application verifies the effectiveness and efficiency of PIBSO and shows that it is a good method for combinatorial optimization in engineering.", "paper_title": "Probability increment based swarm optimization for combinatorial optimization with application to printed circuit board assembly", "paper_id": "WOS:000346331800010"}
