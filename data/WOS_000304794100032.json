In this paper, we propose a novel wrinkle-aware registration method, which aligns not only the large-scale poses, but also high-resolution deformable details, in a unified framework. Using large-scale alignment enables us to solve a template-based energy minimization problem through pure Euclidean measurement. Fine-scale features are aligned by firstly computing crest lines for both the intermediately registered mesh and the target, and then evaluating the shape descriptors at the feature points, followed by a graph matching procedure to achieve a global optimization of the closest point matching. Experiments show that our method is effective and robust in preserving the quality of the source, while matching the fine-scale details of the target. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
