To support such a data collection pattern, a tree structure rooted at the sink is defined. Depending on various factors, including the WSN topology and the availability of resources, the energy consumption of nodes in different paths of the data collection tree may vary largely, thus affecting the overall network lifetime. This paper addresses the problem of lifetime maximization of WSNs based on data collection trees. Specifically, we propose a novel and efficient algorithm, called Randomized Switching for Maximizing Lifetime (RaSMaLai), that aims at extending the lifetime of WSNs through load balancing. Given an initial data collection tree, RaSMaLai randomly switches some sensor nodes from their original paths to other paths with lower load. We prove that, under appropriate settings of the operating parameters, RaSMaLai converges with a low time complexity. We further design a distributed version of our algorithm. Through an extensive performance evaluation study that includes simulation of large-scale scenarios and real experiments on a WSN testbed, we show that the proposed RaSMaLai algorithm and its distributed version achieve a longer network lifetime than the state-of-the-art solutions.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Randomized Switching for Maximizing Lifetime in Tree-Based Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000363254100003"}
