However, how to use such unlabeled information to make the predicted labels more reliable remains to be a key for any successful learning. In this paper, we propose a semi supervised learning framework via combination of semi-supervised clustering and semi-supervised classification. In our approach, the predicted labels are selected by both the constrained k-means and safe semi-supervised SVM (S4VMs) to improve the reliability of the predicted labels. Extensive evaluations on collection of benchmarks and real-world action recognition datasets show that the proposed technique outperforms the others. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
