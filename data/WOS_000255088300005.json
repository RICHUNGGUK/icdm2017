Traditionally, the design of such control systems is based on finite state machines. An alternative, more flexible approach is based on task-resource models. This paper describes an approach for the migration of supervisory machine control architectures towards this alternative approach. We propose a generic migration approach based on model transformations that includes normalisation of legacy architectures before their actual transformation. To this end, we identify a number of key concerns for supervisory machine control and a corresponding normalised design idiom. As such, our migration approach constitutes a series of model transformations, for which we define transformation rules. We illustrate the applicability of this model-driven approach by migrating (part of) the supervisory control architecture of an advanced manufacturing machine: a wafer scanner developed by ASML. This migration, towards a product-line architecture, includes a change in architectural paradigm from finite state machines to task-resource systems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.
