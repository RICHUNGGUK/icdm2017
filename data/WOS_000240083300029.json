The method firstly applies rough set of its information measurement ability to evaluate system parameters importance. Then, based on EM learning the unknown parameters of fuzzy member functions are estimated. Then a fuzzy neural classifier based on EM algorithm is generated. The research indicates that the proposed network possesses higher diagnosis precision and speed as well as excellent anti-interference abilities, and is an ideal pattern classifier. In the end, a practical application in transformer fault diagnosis shows the availability of the method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy neural classifier for transformer fault diagnosis based on EM learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000240083300029"}
