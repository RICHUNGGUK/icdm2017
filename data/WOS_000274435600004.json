We discuss two limitations of these solvers from this perspective and discuss techniques for dealing with them. We show empirically that the proposed techniques significantly improve state-of-the-art solvers.", "paper_title": "On Modern Clause-Learning Satisfiability Solvers", "paper_id": "WOS:000274435600004"}
