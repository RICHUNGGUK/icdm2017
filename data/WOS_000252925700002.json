This article extends the Path Inflation Control (PIC) policy recently proposed by us to provide differentiated services in IP/MPLS over WDM networks with traffic grooming. Three different algorithms are considered for provisioning differentiated services. The simulation results show that, with two of the three algorithms, the network cannot only provide differentiated services when the traffic load is high but also gives significantly lower blocking for the lower priority class traffic and for the overall traffic at low traffic loads.", "paper_title": "Providing differentiated services for multi-class traffic in IP/MPLS over WDM networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000252925700002"}
