Although computer supported collaborative learning has been widely adopted in many educational institutions over the last decade, there exist still drawbacks which limit their potential in collaborative learning activities. Among these limitations, we investigate information security requirements in on-line assessment, (e-assessment), which can be developed in collaborative learning contexts. Despite information security enhancements have been developed in recent years, to the best of our knowledge, integrated and holistic security models have not been completely carried out yet. Even when security advanced methodologies and technologies are deployed in learning management systems, too many types of vulnerabilities still remain opened and unsolved. Therefore, new models such as trustworthiness approaches can overcome these lacks and support e-assessment requirements for e-Learning. To this end, a holistic security model is designed, implemented and evaluated in a real context of e-Learning. Implications of this study are remarked for secure assessment in on-line collaborative learning through effective trustworthiness approaches.", "paper_title": "Security in online web learning assessment", "paper_id": "WOS:000361630900007"}
