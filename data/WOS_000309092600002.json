This paper introduces Globally-Synchronized Frames (GSF), a framework for providing guaranteed QoS in on-chip networks in terms of minimum bandwidth and maximum delay bound. The GSF framework can be easily integrated in a conventional virtual channel (VC) router without significantly increasing the hardware complexity. We exploit a fast on-chip barrier network to efficiently implement GSF. Performance guarantees are verified by analysis and simulation. According to our simulations, all concurrent flows receive their guaranteed minimum share of bandwidth in compliance with a given bandwidth allocation. The average throughput degradation of GSF on an 8 x 8 mesh network is within 10% compared to the conventional best-effort VC router. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
