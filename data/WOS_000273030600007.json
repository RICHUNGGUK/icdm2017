The comparator is intended to be used as a building block for a level-crossing AD converter: a type of AD converter where the sampling moments are triggered when an input signal crosses predetermined threshold levels. This type of system sets very high demands on the time measurement and the comparator to achieve the desired performance. The comparator design is based on several techniques to minimize the comparator propagation delay dispersion. The comparator has been implemented in a 0.35 mu m BiCMOS process. Measured results show good agreement with simulations. The slew rate related propagation delay dispersion is measured to 90 ps for an input frequency range from 3 to 10 MHz and amplitudes from 200 mV to 1.65 V. The comparator static power consumption is 9 mW.", "paper_title": "A low propagation delay dispersion comparator for a level-crossing AD converter", "paper_id": "WOS:000273030600007"}
