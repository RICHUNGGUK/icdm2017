On the lines of TSVR, we have proposed a novel regressor for the simultaneous learning of a function and its derivatives, termed as TSVR of a Function and its Derivatives. Results over several functions of more than one variable demonstrate its effectiveness over other existing approaches in terms of improving the estimation accuracy and reducing run time complexity.", "paper_title": "Twin support vector regression for the simultaneous learning of a function and its derivatives", "paper_id": "WOS:000209203900006"}
