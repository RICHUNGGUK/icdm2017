Based on the mechanism of nature immune system and characteristic of project scheduling, the encoding of solution, some operators (including crossover, mutation, deriving and death) and the function of affinity are given. Through a thorough computational study for a standard set of project instances in PSPLIB, the impact of the parameters on the performance of algorithm are analyzed. Experimental results show RCPSP-DCSA has a good performance and it can reach near-optimal solutions in reasonable time.", "paper_title": "A dynamic clonal selection algorithm for project optimization scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300103"}
