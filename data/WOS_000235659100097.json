The fetch-at-most-once behavior of peer-to-peer (P2P) client is responsible for such a non-Zipf distribution and we propose two mathematical models to describe this. The models are based on different probability assumptions, though both indicate flatter heads in object popularity distribution curves than Zipf would predict. Our models provide theoretic tools to analyze differences between P2P File-sharing system and Web systems.", "paper_title": "Modeling fetch-at-most-once behavior in peer-to-peer file-sharing systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000235659100097"}
