Assume that the elements of are coloured with p colours. A p-element subset of is heterochromatic if it contains exactly one element of each colour. The family has the heterochromatic (p,q)-property if in every heterochromatic p-element subset there are at least q elements that have a point in common. We show that, under the heterochromatic (p,q)-condition, some colour class can be pierced by a finite set whose size we estimate from above in terms of d,p, and q. This is a colourful version of the famous (p,q)-theorem. (We prove a colourful variant of the fractional Helly theorem along the way.) A fractional version of the same problem is when the (p,q)-condition holds for all but an alpha fraction of the p-tuples in . We show that, in the case that d=1, all but a beta fraction of the elements of can be pierced by p-q+1 points. Here beta depends on alpha and p,q, and beta -> 0 as alpha goes to zero.", "paper_title": "Colourful and Fractional (p,q)-theorems", "paper_id": "WOS:000335753000008"}
