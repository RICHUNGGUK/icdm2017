In this paper we propose a new optimization algorithm-organizational evolutionary algorithm (OEA) and apply it into the geometric constraint solving. In OEA the colony is composed of the organizations. Three organizational evolutionary operators-split operator, merging operator and coordinating operator can lead the colony to evolve. These three kinds of operators have different functions in the algorithm. Split operator limits the scale of the organization, and makes sure a part of organization come into next generation directly, which maintains the variety of the generation. Merging operator makes use of the leader's information fully and acts as a local searching function. Cooperating operator increases the degree of adaptability between the two organizations by the interactions. The experiment shows that OEA has good capability in the geometric constraint solving.", "paper_title": "The parametric design based on organizational evolutionary algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500110"}
