We will show first in this paper that this channel capacity decrement is caused by the antenna radiation pattern distortion, which owes to the so-called mutual coupling (MC) effect among the dense array elements. In order to overcome this channel capacity decrement flaw of ULA, a 4-element square antenna array (SAA) with space symmetric structure is proposed by re-arranging the antenna elements layout according to the idea of reducing the final radiation pattern distortion. Three-dimensional capacity matrix eigenvalue distribution and generalized condition number (GCN) are also developed in this paper to analyze the final capacity stability of 4-element compact MIMO systems. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that comparing with the traditional 4-element ULA. the new 4-element SAA with space symmetry is much less sensitive to the AoA of incident waves, and can maintain a more stable channel capacity.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL SQUARE ANTENNA ARRAY TO IMPROVE THE CAPACITY STABILITY OF 4-ELEMENT COMPACT MIMO SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296754900007"}
