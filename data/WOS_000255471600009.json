In this paper we build on previous work - in which we compared the so called random and coordinated ICIC policies - and analyze three packet scheduling methods. The performance measures of interest are the session blocking probabilities and the overall throughput. We find that the performance of the so-called Fifty-Fifty and What-It-Wants scheduling policies is somewhat improved by coordinated sub-carrier allocation, especially in poor signal-to-noise-and-interference situations and at medium traffic load values. The performance of the All-Or-Nothing scheduler is practically insensitive to the choice of the sub-carrier allocation policy. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
