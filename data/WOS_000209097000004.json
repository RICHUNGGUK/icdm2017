Finding the best API, fulfilling a set of user requirements, among the many described on the Web is a key step in order to develop an effective Web application; however, Web engineers have little support in solving this problem due to poor search mechanisms and to the heterogeneity of sources and descriptions. Semantic technologies and matching algorithms provide accurate methods to match user requirements against a set of descriptions. Nonetheless, semantic descriptions of APIs are not available in practice. In this paper, we propose a method to extract information on Web APIs published in several Web sources and create semantic descriptions that can be then fused to deliver comprehensive descriptions associated with APIs. During the extraction process, we take into account that collected information has different levels of accuracy, currency, and trustworthiness to state a confidence level of the results. The method is based on the evaluation of the quality of the involved sources, the extracted values, and the overall descriptions. The resulting semantic descriptions are then matched with expressive user requirements to address the API selection problem.", "paper_title": "QUALITY-DRIVEN EXTRACTION, FUSION AND MATCHMAKING OF SEMANTIC WEB API DESCRIPTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000209097000004"}
