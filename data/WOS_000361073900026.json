In the proposed method, neighboring piles are replaced by a single equivalent pile. This replacement process reduces the number of degrees of freedom as well as the required computer memory and calculation time. To validate the simplified method, the impedance and foundation input motion of a raft foundation and an embedded foundation supported by pile groups with rigid and pin-jointed conditions between the pile head and foundation are calculated using both a simplified method and a rigorous numerical method. The results show that the proposed simplified method for the impedance and foundation input motion analysis of a foundation with a large number of piles yields sufficient accuracy. The simplified method is also applied to estimate the dynamic response of an isolated structure with a foundation supported by 2203 cement-soil piles with consideration of the soil-structure interaction. The results show that the dynamic response of the structure can be precisely simulated using the simplified method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
