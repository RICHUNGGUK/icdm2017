One of the fundamental challenges in distributed reputation management is to understand vulnerabilities and develop mechanisms that can minimize the potential damages to a system by malicious nodes. In this paper, we identify three vulnerabilities that are detrimental to decentralized reputation management and propose TrustGuard-a safeguard framework for providing a highly dependable and yet efficient reputation system. First, we provide a dependable trust model and a set of formal methods to handle strategic malicious nodes that continuously change their behavior to gain unfair advantages in the system. Second, a transaction-based reputation system must cope with the vulnerability that malicious nodes may misuse the system by flooding feedbacks with fake transactions. Third, but not the least, we identify the importance of filtering out dishonest feedbacks when computing reputation-based trust of a node, including the feedbacks filed by malicious nodes through collusion. Our experiments show that, comparing with existing reputation systems, our framework is highly dependable and effective in countering malicious nodes regarding strategic oscillating behavior, flooding malevolent feedbacks with fake transactions, and dishonest feedbacks.
