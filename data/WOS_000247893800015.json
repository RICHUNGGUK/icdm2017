However, DVRIs generated by many volume visualization techniques can only partially satisfy users' demands. In this paper, we propose a framework for editing DVRIs, which can also be used for interactive transfer function ( TF) design. Our approach allows users to fuse multiple features in distinct DVRIs into a comprehensive one, to blend two DVRIs, and/or to delete features in a DVRI. We further present how these editing operations can generate smooth animations for focus + context visualization. Experimental results on some real volumetric data demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Interactive transfer function design based on editing direct volume rendered images", "paper_id": "WOS:000247893800015"}
