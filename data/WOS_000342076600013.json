However, the great diversity of various domain corpora and the lack of labeled training sets make this task very challenging for conventional methods that are based on text content. The hyperlink structure of Wikipedia article pages was found to contain recurring network motifs in this study, indicating the probability of a hyperlink being a hyponym hyperlink. Hence, a novel hyponym relation extraction approach based on the network motifs of Wikipedia hyperlinks was proposed. This approach automatically constructs motif-based features from the hyperlink structure of a domain; every hyperlink is mapped to a 13-dimensional feature vector based on the 13 types of three-node motifs. The approach extracts structural information from Wikipedia and heuristically creates a labeled training set. Classification models were determined from the training sets for hyponym relation extraction. Two experiments were conducted to validate our approach based on seven domain-specific datasets obtained from Wikipedia. The first experiment, which utilized manually labeled data, verified the effectiveness of the motif-based features. The second experiment, which utilized an automatically labeled training set of different domains, showed that the proposed approach performs better than the approach based on lexico-syntactic patterns and achieves comparable result to the approach based on textual features. Experimental results show the practicability and fairly good domain scalability of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Motif-Based Hyponym Relation Extraction from Wikipedia Hyperlinks", "paper_id": "WOS:000342076600013"}
