Developers are beginning to use Semantic Web technologies such as ontologies to expose the semantics of context models and Web services. However, different ontologies arise due to natural human diversity in modeling domains. It's therefore important to develop mappings between ontologies. This article describes a practical ontology-mapping process specified in the Unified Modeling Language, as well as its deployment.", "paper_title": "Understanding as we roam", "paper_id": "WOS:000244571200005"}
