The proposed approach can be used to replace the low impedance lambda/4 lines of the conventional BLC by an equivalent structure almost lambda/12 in length. The main advantage of the proposed BLC is that, it has approximately the same bandwidth as that of a conventional BLC. A prototype broadband coupler having fractional bandwidth >50% at 1.1 GHz and of size less than one third of a conventional three-section wideband BLC topology is realized. In addition, at least 20 dB suppression of up to fourth harmonics is achieved. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
