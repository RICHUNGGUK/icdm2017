Product demand (and consequently material flow) is defined as fuzzy numbers with different membership functions. The problem is modeled in fuzzy programming. Three models of expected value, chance-constrained programming and dependent-chance programming and two hybrid intelligent algorithms are then presented. At the end, efficiency of algorithms for solving fuzzy models of dynamic facilities layout is shown through some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "A new intelligent algorithm for dynamic facility layout problem in state of fuzzy constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000332955900018"}
