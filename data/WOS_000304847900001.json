A skyline query retrieves the skyline points that are not dominated by others in terms of static and dynamic attributes (i.e., the road distance). This paper addresses the issue of efficiently processing continuous skyline queries in road networks. Two novel and important distance-based skyline queries are presented, namely, the continuous d(epsilon)-skyline query (Cd-epsilon-SQ) and the continuous k nearest neighbor-skyline query (Cknn-SQ). A grid index is first designed to effectively manage the information of data objects and then two algorithms are proposed, the Cd-epsilon-SQ algorithm and the Cd-epsilon-SQ(+) algorithm, which are combined with the grid index to answer the Cd-epsilon-SQ. Similarly, the Cknn-SQ algorithm and the Cknn-SQ(+) algorithm are developed to efficiently process the Cknn-SQ. Extensive experiments using real road network datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and the efficiency of the proposed algorithms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
