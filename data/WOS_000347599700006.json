In a previous paper we have compared 5 such methods, two of which require the evaluation of the (m - 1)th root. We have used the basin of attraction idea to recommend the best optimal fourth order method. Here we suggest to improve on the best of those five, namely Zhou-Chen-Song method by showing how to choose the best weight function.
