The behavior of an RDECS is represented by that of control components (CCs) and the communication among them. A new formalism, called Reconfigurable Timed Net Condition/Event Systems (TNCES) (R-TNCES), is proposed for the optimal functional and temporal specification of RDECS, which is defined by a behavior module and a control module. The former is a union of various superposed TNCESs, where TNCES-based CC modules are basic units. The latter is a set of reconfiguration functions dealing with the automatic transformations of these TNCESs in response to errors or user requirements by enabling or disabling CC modules, changing condition signals and/or event signals among them, and also treating the state feasibility before and after reconfigurations. To control the verification complexity of R-TNCES, a layer-by-layer verification method is developed, where the similarities of different TNCESs in the behavior module are considered. The contribution of this original paper is applied to a benchmark production system.", "paper_title": "R-TNCES: A Novel Formalism for Reconfigurable Discrete Event Control Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000323496700002"}
