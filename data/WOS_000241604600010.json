The proposed pipelined ADC shows a good figure-of-merit (FoM). It adopts a power efficient amplifier sharing technique, a symmetrical gate-bootstrapping technique with modified timing for the bottom-sampling switch of a wideband sample-and-hold (S/H) circuit, a proposed stable high-swing bias circuit for a wide-swing gain-boosting telescopic amplifier. The measured differential and integral nonlinearities of the prototype in a 0.25-mu m CMOS technology show less than 0.4 least significant bit (LSB) and 0.85 LSB respectively at full sampling rate. The ADC exhibits higher than 9 effective number of bits (ENOB) for input frequencies up to about 60 MHz, which is the fourfold Nyquist rate (fs/2), at 30 MSPS. The ADC consumes 60 mW from a 3-V supply and occupies about 1.36 mm(2).", "paper_title": "Design of an ADC for subsampling video applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241604600010"}
