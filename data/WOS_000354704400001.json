Geometric integrators are numerical methods which preserve some of the mathematical or physical properties of the system they are approximating. In the case of the Lotka-Volterra equations, which are a Poisson system, a good geometric integrator should also be a Poisson integrator. There is however another important property of solutions of the Lotka-Volterra equations: they are non-negative, since they represent population densities. We study in this paper the conditions under which two Poisson integrators for the Lotka-Volterra equations lead to positive approximate solutions.", "paper_title": "On the positivity of Poisson integrators for the Lotka-Volterra equations", "paper_id": "WOS:000354704400001"}
