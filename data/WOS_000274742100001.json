In neurology and pharmacokinetics, the systemic paradigm was already well accepted, whereas other areas of bio-medicine were more or less accepting the reductionism paradigm where systems were studied through the analysis of its isolated sub-systems. The genome project showed that it is not possible to explain the diversity of life only with combinations of genes, which resulted in a new science called systems biology. Mathematical modelling, as one of the principal tools of control engineering, is now becoming a necessary tool in the analysis of biological systems. Interdisciplinary research has the already showed significant advantages over single-disciplinary research; however, the communication barrier between scientists of different backgrounds is still a major problem. Therefore, mathematical modelling is not as widely used in life sciences as would be expected with the potential benefits to the area.", "paper_title": "Modelling in systems biology, neurology and pharmacy", "paper_id": "WOS:000274742100001"}
