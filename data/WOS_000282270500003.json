The algorithm which is based on the Q(lambda) approach expedites the learning process by taking advantage of human intelligence and expertise. The algorithm denoted as CQ(lambda) provides the robot with self awareness to adaptively switch its collaboration level from autonomous (self performing, the robot decides which actions to take, according to its learning function) to semi-autonomous (a human advisor guides the robot and the robot combines this knowledge into its learning function). This awareness is represented by a self test of its learning performance. The approach of variable autonomy is demonstrated and evaluated using a fixed-arm robot for finding the optimal shaking policy to empty the contents of a plastic bag. A comparison between the CQ(lambda) and the traditional Q(lambda)-reinforcement learning algorithm, resulted in faster convergence for the CQ(lambda) collaborative reinforcement learning algorithm.", "paper_title": "A Human-Robot Collaborative Reinforcement Learning Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000282270500003"}
