It can be transformed conveniently into a single-track-output structure according to the definition and properties of the literal operation. A ternary resonant tunneling JK flip-flop is created based on the RTD literal circuit and the module-3 operation, and the JK flip-flop also has two optional types of output structure. The design of the ternary RTD JK flip-flop is verified by simulation. The RTD literal circuit is the key design component for achieving various types of multi-valued logic (MVL) flip-flops. It can be converted into ternary D and JK flip-flops, and the ternary JK flip-flop can also be converted simply and conveniently into ternary D and ternary T flip-flops when the input signals satisfy certain logical relationships. All these types of flip-flops can be realized using the traditional Karnaugh maps combined with the literal and module-3 operations. This approach offers a novel design method for MVL resonant tunneling flip-flop circuits.", "paper_title": "A novel ternary JK flip-flop using the resonant tunneling diode literal circuit", "paper_id": "WOS:000312185500009"}
