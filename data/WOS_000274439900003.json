Internet when moving from one access Point to another However, due to the link switching delay and to Mobile IP handover operations, packets designated to mobile nodes can be delayed or lost during the handover period Moreover, every time I new attach Point is confirmed, the mobile node, its home agent and its corresponding node must be authenticated mutually This paper presents a now control function Called Extended Handover Control Function (E-HCF) ill order to Improve handover performance and authentication ill the context of Mobile IPv6 over wireless networks With an analytical model and some OPNET simulations, we show in this Paper that our solution allows provision of low latency, low packet loss and mutual authentication to the standard handover of Mobile IPv6 Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd", "paper_title": "Improving Mobile IPv6 handover and authentication in wireless network with E-HCF", "paper_id": "WOS:000274439900003"}
