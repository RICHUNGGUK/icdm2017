The proposal contains seven concrete hash functions, each with a different digest length. We present a practical collision attack on each of these seven EnRUPT variants. The time complexity of our attack varies from 2(36) to 2(40) round computations, depending on the EnRUPT variant, and the memory requirements are negligible. We demonstrate that our attack is practical by giving an actual collision example for EnRUPT-256.", "paper_title": "Practical Collisions for EnRUPT", "paper_id": "WOS:000286005400001"}
