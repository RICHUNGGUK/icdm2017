In modeling the nonlinear system, this fact is more crucial. In this paper, a new hybrid method is proposed to cluster the data located in the linear parts on the nonlinear systems. The proposed method can partition the input-output data in two groups: data located in the linear parts and data in the extrema. It is shown that the first group of data is suitable to be clustered by Fuzzy C-Regression Model (FCRM) clustering algorithm and the second group by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). Then, based on the above findings, a new hybrid clustering algorithm is proposed. Finally, the proposed approach is tested and validated by several numerical examples of nonlinear functions.
