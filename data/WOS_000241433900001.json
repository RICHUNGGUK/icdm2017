A critical problem in passage retrieval is to extract coherent relevant passages accurately from a document, which we refer to as passage extraction. While much work has been done on passage retrieval, the passage extraction problem has not been seriously studied. Most existing work tends to rely on presegmenting documents into fixed-length passages which are unlikely optimal because the length of a relevant passage is presumably highly sensitive to both the query and document. In this article, we present a new method for accurately detecting coherent relevant passages of variable lengths using hidden Markov models (HMMs). The HMM-based method naturally captures the topical boundaries between passages relevant and nonrelevant to the query. Pseudo-feedback mechanisms can be naturally incorporated into such an HMM-based framework to improve parameter estimation. We show that with appropriate parameter estimation, the HMM method outperforms a number of strong baseline methods on two datasets. We further show how the HMM method can be applied on top of any basic passage extraction method to improve passage boundaries.", "paper_title": "Extraction of coherent relevant passages using hidden Markov models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241433900001"}
