Exact numbers are rare and we propose a new method to process this numerical information from the point of view of indiscernibility. Each numerical value comprises a set of points, which cannot be distinguished from the numerical value itself. This set of points can be thought of as a cloud around a center point. This has led us to define in this paper, the concept of numerical cloud. Numerical clouds are not intended as a substitute for fuzzy numbers or interval calculations. Numerical clouds provide a quality control of calculations, and can also be used as a solution to problems involving truncation.", "paper_title": "Numerical Clouds - A Treatment for Indiscernibility", "paper_id": "WOS:000326065100002"}
