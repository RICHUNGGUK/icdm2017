An optimum web opening configuration is suggested based on the results of parametric studies. A FE analysis is further employed to determine the performance of the optimised beam in comparison to the conventional widely used cellular type beam. It is found that the optimised beam overperforms in terms of load carrying capacities, deformations, and stress intensities. Barriers to the implementation of the topology optimisation technique to the routine design of beam web are highlighted. (C) 2015 The Authors.
