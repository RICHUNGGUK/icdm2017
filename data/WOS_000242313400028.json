In this paper, we show how an attack introduced by Walter can be improved and used against the unified formulae of Brier, Dechene and Joye when it relies on a standard field arithmetic implementation, both in affine and projective coordinates. We also describe how the field arithmetic might be implemented to obtain more uniform operations that avoid this type of attack.", "paper_title": "Unified point addition formulae and side-channel attacks", "paper_id": "WOS:000242313400028"}
