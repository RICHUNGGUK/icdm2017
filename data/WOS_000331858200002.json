A common goal of running parallel applications implemented under such models is to guarantee bounded response times while maximizing system utilization. Unfortunately, little previous work has been done that can provide such performance guarantees. In this paper, this problem is addressed by applying soft real-time scheduling analysis techniques. Analysis and conditions are presented for guaranteeing bounded response times for parallel applications under global EDF multiprocessor scheduling.
