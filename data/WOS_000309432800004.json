In this paper, we consider the problem of navigating multiple vehicles through an unknown static environment with limited sensing and communication capabilities available. We propose a decentralized, cooperative, reactive, model predictive control based collision avoidance scheme that plans short range paths in the currently sensed part of the environment, and show that it is able to prevent collisions from occurring. An auxiliary controller is employed to follow previously planned paths whenever the main path planning system fails to update the path. Simulations and real-world testing in various scenarios confirm the methods validity. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
