In this note, a model for partially drained radial consolidation under cyclic loading is proposed. This is achieved through the application of radial consolidation theory and the internal generation of excess pore pressure predicted by an undrained cyclic model. This study demonstrates theoretically the ability of vertical drains to prevent excess pore pressure accumulating to a critical value under cyclic loading.
