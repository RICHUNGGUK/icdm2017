The presented implementation ensures strictly conservative treatment of sink and source terms which is enforced even for geometric discretization of the internal coordinate. The validation of our implementation which covers wide range of computational and experimental problems enables us to proceed into three-dimensional applications as, turbulent flows in a pipe and through a static mixer. The aim of this paper is to highlight the influence of different formulations of the novel theoretical breakage and coalescence models on the equilibrium distribution of population, and to propose an implementation strategy for three-dimensional one-way coupled CFD-PBE model.
