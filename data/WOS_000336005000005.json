Equipped with pebbles, they go beyond the class of recognizable formal power series: they capture weighted first-order logic enriched with a quantitative version of transitive closure. In contrast to previous work, this calculus allows for unrestricted use of existential and universal quantifications over positions of the input word. We actually consider both two-way and one-way pebble weighted automata. The latter class constrains the head of the automaton to walk left-to-right, resetting it each time a pebble is dropped. Such automata have already been considered in the Boolean setting, in the context of data words. Our main result states that two-way pebble weighted automata, one-way pebble weighted automata, and our weighted logic are expressively equivalent. We also give new logical characterizations of standard recognizable series.", "paper_title": "Pebble Weighted Automata and Weighted Logics", "paper_id": "WOS:000336005000005"}
