Neurophysiological signals and especially electroencephalogram (EEG) are the forms of brain electrical activity which can be easily captured and utilized for BCI/BMI applications. Those signals are unfortunately usually very highly contaminated by external noise caused by the presence of different devices in the environment creating electromagnetic interference. In this paper, we first decompose each of the recorded channels, in multichannel EEG recording environment, into intrinsic mode functions (IMF) which are a result of empirical mode decomposition (EMD) extended to multichannel analysis. We present novel and interesting results on human mental and cognitive states estimation based on analysis of the above-mentioned stimuli-related IMF components. The IMF components are further clustered for their spectral similarity in order to identify only those carrying responses to present stimuli to the subjects. The resulting targets only reconstruction allows us to identify when and to which stimuli intelligent application user is tuning at a time.", "paper_title": "EMD APPROACH TO MULTICHANNEL EEG DATA - THE AMPLITUDE AND PHASE COMPONENTS CLUSTERING ANALYSIS", "paper_id": "WOS:000274916500015"}
