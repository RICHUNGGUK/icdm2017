The proper hybrid of the two algorithms (ACO-BP) may accelerate the evolving speed of neural networks and improve the forecasting precision of the well-trained networks. ACO-BP scheme adopts ACO to search the optimal combination of weights in the solution space, and then uses BP algorithm to obtain the accurate optimal solution quickly. The ACO-BP and BP algorithms were applied to the problems of function approaching and modeling quantitative structure-activity relationships Herbicides. Experiment results show that the proposed ACO-BP scheme is more efficient and effective than BP algorithm. Furthermore, ACO-BP reliably performs well when the number of hidden nodes varies.", "paper_title": "Evolving neural networks using the hybrid of ant colony optimization and BP algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000105"}
