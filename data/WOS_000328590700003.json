The only hurdle of this structure is the need of motion estimation in distant reference frames. To maintain high coding efficiency, a large search range for motion estimation can improve the coding efficiency in distant reference pictures. Computational complexity will thus be increased dramatically. In this paper, a fast motion estimation scheme for a low-delay hierarchical P-frame structure is proposed. The proposed scheme adopts a motion vector composition strategy to expedite the motion estimation process for distant reference frames in the hierarchical P structure. In addition, a motion vector composition algorithm is tailor-made with the proposed hierarchical P coding scheme to further improve the coding efficiency. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme can deliver a remarkable complexity savings and coding efficiency improvement on coding a frame in low temporal layers of the hierarchical P structure.
