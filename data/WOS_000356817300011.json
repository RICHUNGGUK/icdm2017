Based on the node delivery capacity distribution, we construct a novel routing mechanism called efficient weighted routing (EWR) strategy to enhance network traffic capacity and transportation efficiency. Compared with the shortest path routing and the efficient routing strategies, the EWR achieves the highest traffic capacity. After investigating average path length, network diameter, maximum efficient betweenness, average efficient betweenness, average travel time and average traffic load under extensive simulations, it indicates that the EWR appears to be a very effective routing method. The idea of this routing mechanism gives us a good insight into network science research. The practical use of this work is prospective in some real complex systems such as the Internet.", "paper_title": "Efficient packet transportation on complex networks with nonuniform node capacity distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000356817300011"}
