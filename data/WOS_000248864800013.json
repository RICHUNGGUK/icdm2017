The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) uses backward error correction, where the destination explicitly returns feedback to the source. Forward error correction (FEC) can also be used for transport; here the source includes enough redundancy in the encoding symbols to allow the destination to decode the message. In this paper, we compare the performance of two transport schemes, TCP and LT, a scheme based on rateless FEC codes, in a wireless ad hoc network when topology-transparent scheduling is used for channel access. These schedules are derived from cover-free families, a type of combinatorial design. They provide a mechanism to guarantee collision-free communication between any two nodes provided that each of the N nodes of the network has at most a specified number D of active (transmitting) neighbours. We find that LT outperforms TCP in more strenuous network conditions.", "paper_title": "Transport schemes for topology-transparent scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000248864800013"}
