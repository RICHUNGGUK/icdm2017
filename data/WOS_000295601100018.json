Firstly, we synthesized active sonar returns from a 3D highlight model of underwater targets using the ray tracing algorithm. Then, we applied a multiaspect target classification scheme based on a hidden Markov model to classify them. For feature extraction from the synthesized sonar signals, a matching pursuit algorithm was used. The experimental results depending on the number of observations and signal-to-noise ratios are presented with our discussions.", "paper_title": "HMM-Based Underwater Target Classification with Synthesized Active Sonar Signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000295601100018"}
