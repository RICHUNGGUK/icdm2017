Kinematic data collected by a motion capture system was used as the input and ACL strain during the movement time period was the output. Case studies were conducted to simulate ACL strain during jump landing, running and sidestep cutting activities. The simulation results were analysed and compared with previous findings in literature. The results show that the simulation is a useful tool in understanding ACL injury mechanisms related to sports activities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
