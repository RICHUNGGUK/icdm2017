When, for example, we use clustering to classify a set of objects, it generally ignores any uncertainty included in objects. This is because uncertainty is difficult to deal with and model. It is desirable, however, to handle individual objects as is so that we may classify objects more precisely. In this paper, we propose new clustering algorithms that handle objects having uncertainty by introducing penalty vectors. We show the theoretical relationship between our proposal and conventional algorithms verifying the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms through numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy c-Means with Quadratic Penalty-Vector Regularization Using Kullback-Leibler Information for Uncertain Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000370190600008"}
