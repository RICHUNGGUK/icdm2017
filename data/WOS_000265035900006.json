The embedding theory is the differential algebra of Ritt and Kolchin. We describe an algorithm, named Rosenfeld-Grobner, which computes a representation for the radical p of the differential ideal generated by any such system Sigma. The computed representation constitutes a normal simplifier for the equivalence relation modulo p (it permits to test membership in p). It permits also to compute Taylor expansions of solutions of Sigma. The algorithm is implemented within a package (the package (diffalg) is available in MAPLE standard library since MAPLE VR5) in MAPLE.", "paper_title": "Computing representations for radicals of finitely generated differential ideals", "paper_id": "WOS:000265035900006"}
