The pseudo excitation method (PEM) is extended to handle the random analysis of time-dependent vehicle-bridge systems, for which the statistical characteristics of dynamic responses are computed. A vehicle-bridge interaction element is adopted to reduce the computational effort. in the numerical examples, the proposed method is justified by comparing with Monte Carlo simulation results. Also, a method to estimate maximum responses is suggested. Examples include a train moving across both simply supported and three-span continuous bridges and some observed phenomena are discussed.
