The indigenously developed algorithm uses the CFD software: Fluent for the hydrodynamic analysis and employs a genetic algorithm (GA) for optimization. For a prescribed inlet velocity and outlet pressure, pressure recovery coefficient C(p)* (the objective function) is estimated computationally for various design options. The CFD software and the GA have been combined in a monolithic platform for a fully automated operation using some special control commands. Based on the developed algorithm, an extensive exercise has been made to optimize the diffuser shape. Different methodologies have been adopted to create a large number of design options. Interestingly, not much difference has been noted in the optimum C(p)* values obtained through different approaches. However, in all the approaches, a better design has been obtained through a proper selection of the number of design variables. Finally, the effect of diffuser length on the optimum shape has also been studied.
