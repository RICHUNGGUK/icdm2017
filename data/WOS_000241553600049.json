This paper, for the early detection of gastric cancer, proposes the analysis system of an endoscopic image of the stomach, which detects the abnormal region by using the change of color in the image and by providing the surface tissue information to the detector. While advanced inflammation and cancer may be easily detected, early inflammation and cancer are difficult to detect and requires more attention to be detected. This paper, at first, converts the endoscopic image to the image of the IHb(Index of Hemoglobin) model and removes noises incurred by illumination and, automatically detects the regions suspected as cancer and provides the related information to the detector, or provides the surface tissue information for the regions appointed by the detector. This paper does not intend to provide the final diagnosis of the detected abnormal regions as gastric cancer, but it intends to provide a supplementary mean to reduce the load and mistaken diagnosis of the detector, by automatically detecting the abnormal regions not easily detected by the human eye and this provides additional information for the diagnosis. The experiments using practical endoscopic images for performance evaluation showed that the proposed system is effective in the analysis of endoscopic image of the stomach.", "paper_title": "Analysis system of endoscopic image of early gastric cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000241553600049"}
