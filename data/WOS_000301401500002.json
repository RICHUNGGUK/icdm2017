One approach for identification with lightweight tags is that each tag performs pseudo-random function with his unique embedded key. In this case, a reader (or a back-end server) needs to perform a brute-force search for each tag-reader interaction, whose cost gets larger when the number of tags increases. In this paper, we suggest a simple and efficient identification technique that reduces readers computation to O(root N log N) without increasing communication cost. Our technique is based on the well-known \"meet-in-the-middle\" strategy used in the past to attack symmetric ciphers.", "paper_title": "Reducing RFID Reader Load with the Meet-in-the-Middle Strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000301401500002"}
