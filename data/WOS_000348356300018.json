Regardless, the number of illegal file sharing using BitTorrent continues to grow and most of file sharers and downloader are unconcerned legal action to transfer copywrite-protected files. However, it is difficult to gather enough probative evidence to prosecute illegal file sharers in criminal court and/or sued for damages in civil court. Further, there is a lack of research on investigation techniques to reveal illegal BitTorrent sharers. This is because the role of the server in BitTorrent networks has been changed compared to servers in conventional P2P networks. As a result, it is difficult to apply previous investigation processes for investigation of conventional P2P networks to the investigation of suspected illegal file sharing using BitTorrent. This paper proposes a methodology for the investigation of illegal file sharers using BitTorrent networks through the use of a P2P digital investigation process.", "paper_title": "Methodology and implementation for tracking the file sharers using BitTorrent", "paper_id": "WOS:000348356300018"}
