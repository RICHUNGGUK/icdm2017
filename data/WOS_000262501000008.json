Reputation bootstrapping - that is, assessing the reputations of newly deployed Web services (newcomers) - is a major issue in service-oriented environments because historical information often isn't present regarding newcomer behaviors. The authors examine different techniques for fairly and accurately bootstrapping newcomers' reputations in a service-oriented environment. They also present experimental results that evaluate the proposed techniques.", "paper_title": "Reputation Bootstrapping for Trust Establishment among Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000262501000008"}
