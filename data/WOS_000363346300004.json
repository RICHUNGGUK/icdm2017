Alternatives to many security protocols originally employing traditional mathematical cryptography involve novel hardware security primitives, such as Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In this paper, we first introduce a novel hybrid memristor-CMOS XOR/XNOR logic circuit that offers several advantages such as combinational circuit behavior, simpler operation and lower hardware overhead than existing solutions. Then, we use this XOR circuit as a component to design a hybrid memristor-CMOS PUF circuit and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive simulations of environmental and process variation effects. The proposed PUF circuit has substantially lesser hardware overhead than previously proposed memristor-based PUF circuits, while being resistant against machine learning based modelling attacks. The proposed PUF can be conveniently used in many security applications and protocols based on hardware-intrinsic security. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
