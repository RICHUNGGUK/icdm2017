Much stress is placed on transparent boundary conditions which allow the solutions to be computed in subdomains. A self similar finite element method is proposed and tested. It can be used for numerically computing the spectrum of the Laplace operator with Neumann boundary conditions, as well as the eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are normalized by means of a perturbation method and the spectral decomposition of a compactly supported function is carried out. Finally, a numerical method for the wave equation is addressed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
