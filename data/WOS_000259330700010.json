Based on the model, the matching performance of Bhattacharyya coefficient is analyzed and evaluated. The numerical critical conditions of biased matching and mistaken matching for Bhattacharyya coefficient are given. According to the model analysis, a modified version of Bhattacharyya coefficient is proposed, which improves the matching performance relative to the original one. The numerical analysis based on the new model and visual experiments both demonstrate the superior performance of the modified Bhattacharyya coefficient. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
