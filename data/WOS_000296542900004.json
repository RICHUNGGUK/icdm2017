For heterogeneous multi-core systems, the statistical characteristics of execution times on different cores play a critical role in the resource allocation, and the differences between the actual execution time and the estimated execution time may significantly affect the performance of resource allocation and cause system to be less robust. In this paper, we present an evaluation method to study the impacts of inaccurate execution time information to the performance of resource allocation. We propose a systematic way to measure the robustness degradation of the system and evaluate how inaccurate probability parameters may affect the performance of resource allocations. Furthermore, we compare the performance of three widely used greedy heuristics when using the inaccurate information with simulations. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
