The reachable region and the hovering region are introduced to find a feasibility criterion of hovering positions, then followed by a new optimal sliding-model control law (OSMC), which has a dynamic sliding surface generated by a nominal LQR, and can achieve the optimal performance under disturbed circumstances. A dynamic model with 1-order gravity and transition matrix of differential orbital elements (DOE) are used to approximate the orbital relative motion. Numerical simulation illustrates the feasibility of the scheme and that the proposed control law has better robustness and precision with less fuel cost than the usual sliding-mode control (SMC) and the traditional OSMC in previous works. J2 perturbation and an external disturbance (signal loss by sensor or data link fault) are considered in the simulation.", "paper_title": "OPTIMAL SLIDING-MODE CONTROL FOR FINITE-THRUST SPACECRAFT HOVERING AROUND ELLIPTICAL ORBITAL TARGET", "paper_id": "WOS:000290601100027"}
