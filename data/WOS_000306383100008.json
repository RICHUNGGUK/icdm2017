The product information is first captured by a function-parameter (FP) matrix, which defines the dependency relationships between functions and parameters. In addition, two types of parameters are classified: shared and protected. The shared parameters are the parameters to be known by the suppliers for collaborative design, while the protected parameters are assumed to be the confidential product information. Given the FP matrix with shared and protected parameters, a three-phase clustering method is proposed to form product modules that intentionally group and isolate protected parameters. Based on a matrix-based modular structure, a formulation is proposed to estimate the leakage risk of protected parameters due to the disclosure of shared parameters to suppliers. At the end, the relief valve system is used to examine the proposed modularization and measurement methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
