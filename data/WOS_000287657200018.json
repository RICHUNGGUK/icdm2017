We define the rate loss L-1 = R-1 - R-X vertical bar Y,R- S (D-1), L-2 = R-2 - R-Y vertical bar X,R- S (D-2) and L-0 = R-1 + R-2 - R-X,R-Y vertical bar S(D-1, D-2). For general real-valued stationary memoryless sources and mean squared error distortion measure, we show that the rate loss can be bounded by L-i <= K-i + 1,i = 1, 2, and L-0 <= 1, where K-1 = R-X,R-Y vertical bar(S)(D-1, D-2) - R-Y vertical bar S(D-1) - R-X vertical bar Y,R-S(D-1) and K-2 = R-X,R-Y vertical bar(S)(D-1, D-2) - R-X vertical bar S(D-1) - R-Y vertical bar X,R-S(D-2). When the sources and side information have a jointly Gaussian distribution, we give upper bounds of K-1 and K-2 by a function of conditional correlation coefficient rho(XY vertical bar S). For a special case when there is no side information, our result tightens Feng's rate loss bounds. Using our upper bounds of the rate loss, we give good approximations of the achievable region.", "paper_title": "On the Rate Loss of Multiple Sources Codes in the Wyner-Ziv Setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000287657200018"}
