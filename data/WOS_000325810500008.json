It is, therefore, proposed that AHP could be extended by applying fuzzy logic to adequately incorporate the different relationships that may exist among the criteria. It is shown that the conventional and consistent fuzzy approaches could actually lead to different choices and an explanation is provided. Finally, two different application scenarios are illustrated on the web service selection problem.", "paper_title": "COMBINING BOOLEAN CONSISTENT FUZZY LOGIC AND AHP ILLUSTRATED ON THE WEB SERVICE SELECTION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000325810500008"}
