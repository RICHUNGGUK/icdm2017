The vertex (resp. edge) forwarding index of G is the maximum number of paths in R passing through any vertex (resp. edge) in G. Choudum and Sunitha [S.A. Choudum, V Sunitha, Augmented cubes, Networks 40 (2002) 71-84] proposed a variant of the hypercube Q(n), called the augmented cube AQ(n) and presented a minimal routing algorithm. This paper determines the vertex and the edge forwarding indices of AQ(n) as 2(n)/9 + (-1)(n+1)/9 + n2(n)/3 - 2(n) + 1 and 2(n-1), respectively, which shows that the above algorithm is optimal in view of maximizing the network capacity.
