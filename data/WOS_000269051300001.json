The computational model supports declarative programming with lazy and possibly higher-order functions, predicates, and the cooperation of different constraint domains equipped with their respective solvers, relying on a so-called constraint functional logic programming (CFLP) scheme. The implementation has been developed on top of the CFLP system FOY, supporting the cooperation of the three domains H, R, and FD, which supply equality and disequality constraints over symbolic terms, arithmetic constraints over the real numbers, and finite domain constraints over the integers, respectively. The computational model has been proved sound and complete w.r.t. the declarative semantics provided by the CFLP scheme, while the implemented system has been tested with a set of benchmarks and shown to behave quite efficiently in comparison to the closest related approach we are aware of.", "paper_title": "On the cooperation of the constraint domains H, R, and FD in CFLP", "paper_id": "WOS:000269051300001"}
