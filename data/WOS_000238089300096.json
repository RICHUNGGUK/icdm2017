An end-to-end combination scheme including both limiting of sending window size and delayed ACK mechanism to improve TCP throughput over multihops wireless networks is evaluated. The simulation results show the combination scheme has better goodput and loss performance than traditional TCP.", "paper_title": "A combination scheme to improve TCP throughput over multihops wireless mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300096"}
