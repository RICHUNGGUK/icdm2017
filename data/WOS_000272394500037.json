In this letter, we show that, unfortunately any key sharing scheme with this initiation phase is intrinsically insecure in the sense that the collusion of some users enables them to derive master private keys and hence, generating any user's secret key.", "paper_title": "Security Vulnerability of ID-Based Key Sharing Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000272394500037"}
