Covering arrays are used to generate software test suites to cover all t-sets of component interactions. Recursive constructions for covering arrays of strengths 3 and 4 are developed, generalizing many \"Roux-type\" constructions. A numerical comparison with current construction techniques is given through existence tables for covering arrays.", "paper_title": "Roux-type constructions for covering arrays of strengths three and four", "paper_id": "WOS:000240316900003"}
