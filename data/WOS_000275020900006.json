The authors propose fully deterministic shared-memory multiprocessing that not only enhances debugging by offering repeatability by default, but also improves the quality of testing and the deployment of production code. They show that determinism can be provided with little performance cost on future hardware", "paper_title": "DMP: DETERMINISTIC SHARED-MEMORY MULTIPROCESSING", "paper_id": "WOS:000275020900006"}
