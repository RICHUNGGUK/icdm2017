This novel approach is efficacious in low-speed operations where power consumption and longevity are the pivotal concerns instead of performance. The schematic and layout of a 4-bit carry look ahead adder (CLA) has been implemented to show the workability of the proposed logic. The effect of temperature and process parameter variations on subthreshold adiabatic logic-based 4-bit CLA has also been addressed separately. Postlayout simulations show that subthreshold adiabatic units can save significant energy compared with a logically equivalent static CMOS implementation. Results are validated through extensive simulations in 22-nm CMOS technology using CADENCE SPICE Spectra.", "paper_title": "Implementation of Subthreshold Adiabatic Logic for Ultralow-Power Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000365206300003"}
