Classical lattice Boltzmann methods for this problem, e.g. the colour gradient method or the free energy approach, call only be applied when density and viscosity ratios are small. Moreover, they use additional fields defined oil the whole domain to describe the different phases and model phase separation by special interactions at each node. In contrast, our approach Simulates the flow using a single field and separates the fluid phases by a free moving interface. The scheme is based oil the lattice Boltzmann method and uses the level set method to compute the evolution of the interface. To couple the fluid phases, we develop new boundary conditions which realise the macroscopic jump conditions at the interface and incorporate surface tension in the lattice Boltzmann framework. Various Simulations are presented to validate the numerical scheme, e.g. two-phase channel flows, the Young-Laplace law for a bubble and viscous fingering in a Hele-Shaw cell. The results show that the method is feasible over a wide range of density and viscosity differences. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
