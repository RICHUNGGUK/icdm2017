This new variant of partial halting is especially investigated for several variants of P systems using membrane rules with permitting contexts and working in different transition modes, especially for minimal parallelism. Both partial halting and minimal parallelism are based on an arbitrary set of subsets from the set of rules assigned to the membranes.", "paper_title": "Partial Halting and Minimal Parallelism Based on Arbitrary Rule Partitions", "paper_id": "WOS:000265239200003"}
