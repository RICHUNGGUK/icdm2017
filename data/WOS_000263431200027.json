In this article, we provide a novel version that employs the modulus operator to embed the secret share into a host image. The simulator shows that the modulus operator is useful for decreasing shadow image distortion. Using Rabin's signature cryptosystem, participants can detect if a cheater exists in the cooperation. in particular, the new mechanism permits involved members to restore a lossless secret image and to reconstruct a distortion-free host image.
