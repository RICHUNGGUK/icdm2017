Deriving and fulfilling of the assembly precedence relations (APRs) are the essential points in assembly sequences reasoning. In this paper, focusing on APRs reasoning, ASP, and optimizing, a hierarchical ASP approach is proposed and its key technologies are studied systematically. APR inferring and the optimal sequences searching algorithms are designed and realized in an integrated software prototype system. The system can find out the geometric APRs correctly and completely based on the assembly CAD model. Combined with the process APRs, the geometric and engineering feasible assembly sequences can be inferred out automatically. Furthermore, an algorithm is designed by which optimal assembly sequences can be calculated out from the immense geometric and engineering feasible assembly sequences. The case study demonstrates that the approach and its algorithms may provide significant assistance in finding the optimal ASP and improving product assembling. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
