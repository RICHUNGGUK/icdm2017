The presented algorithm for this problem works in O(Wn(omega))(1) time, where omega is the matrix multiplication exponent, and W is the highest edge weight in the graph. As a consequence of this result we obtain (O) over tilde (Wn(omega)) time algorithms for computing: minimum weight bipartite vertex cover, single source shortest paths and minimum weight vertex disjoint s-t paths. All of the presented algorithms are randomized and with small probability can return suboptimal solutions. (c) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
