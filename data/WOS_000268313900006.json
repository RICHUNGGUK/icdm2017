The Virtual Assistant is an artificial agent that simulates a human assistant shown in TV programs and prompts users to provide feedback by asking questions. This framework ensures that sufficient information is provided in the captured content while users interact in a natural and enjoyable way with the agent. We developed a prototype agent based on a chatbot-like approach and applied it to a daily cooking scene. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of the Virtual Assistant framework, as it allows a person to provide feedback easily with few interruptions and elicits a variety of useful information.", "paper_title": "Virtual assistant: enhancing content acquisition by eliciting information from humans", "paper_id": "WOS:000268313900006"}
