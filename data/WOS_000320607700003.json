First, the method is extended by the application of time reversal symmetry operator. This extension allows efficient calculations of the twofold degeneracy present in the multiband k . p model and other interior eigenvalues. Second, the preconditioner for the indefinite matrix which comes from the discretization of the eight band k . p Hamiltonian is presented. The construction of this preconditioner is based on physical considerations about energy band structure in the k . p model. On the basis of two real examples, it is shown that the preconditioner can significantly shorten the time needed to calculate the interior eigenvalues, despite the fact that the memory usage of the preconditioner and Hamiltionian is comparable. Finally, some technical details for implementing the eight band k . p Hamiltonian and the eigensolver are provided. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
