They will have to react to both user and environmental events, and this may require modifying their structure to handle the changing situations. In a number of domains including industrial environments, this modification of the system structure will need to take place in real time. This is a hard problem that will require novel and paradigmatic solutions involving cross-domain knowledge to build a middleware for enabling real-time interaction between nodes allowing time-bounded reconfiguration. For supporting real-time, this middleware must be vertically architected in a modular way from the network and operating system levels up to the application software and the real-time policies for achieving time-bounded behavior. This paper presents a middleware that addresses these characteristics supporting timely reconfiguration in distributed real-time systems based on services. Experimental results are shown to validate the middleware in an actual small-scale video prototype.", "paper_title": "iLAND: An Enhanced Middleware for Real-Time Reconfiguration of Service Oriented Distributed Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000312839600024"}
