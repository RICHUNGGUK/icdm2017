The system-on-glass (SOG) development provides enormous challenges to the developers, usually verifying the SOG by transistor-level simulation. IR-drop modeling is needed to reduce the uniformity degradation in the CLED image quality. This paper presents a full panel Simulation technique for OLED driver and pixels that is integrated on a glass using the mixed-signals circuit design and the proposed process shows excellent capabilities relating to the capacity and the speed.
