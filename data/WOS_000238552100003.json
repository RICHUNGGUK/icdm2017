I contrast this paradigm with other approaches to constructing such systems, and I review the theoretical commitments associated with a cognitive architecture. I illustrate these ideas using a particular architecture-ICARUS-by examining its claims about memories, about the representation and organization of knowledge, and about the performance and learning mechanisms that affect memory structures. I also consider the high-level programming language that embodies these commitments, drawing examples from the domain of in-city driving. In closing, I consider ICARUS's relation to other cognitive architectures and discuss some open issues that deserve increased attention.", "paper_title": "Cognitive architectures and general intelligent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238552100003"}
