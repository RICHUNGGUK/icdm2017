This paper presents a novel game-like advertising system called GameSense, which is driven by the compelling contents of online images. The contextually relevant ads (i.e., product logos) are embedded at appropriate positions within the online games, which are created on the basis of online images. The ads are selected based on multimodal relevance, i.e. text relevance, user relevance and visual content similarity. The game is able to provide viewers rich experience and thus promotes the embedded ads to provide more effective advertising. GameSense represents one of the first attempts toward effective online mashup applications which connect a photo-sharing site with an advertising agency. The effectiveness of GameSense is evaluated over a large-scale real world image set.", "paper_title": "GameSense: game-like in-image advertising", "paper_id": "WOS:000277643600008"}
