We assessed the value of age, triage score, and disposition data from ED electronic records for predicting influenza-related hospitalizations. Materials and Methods From June 2006 to January 2011, weekly counts of pneumonia and influenza (P&I) hospitalizations from five Montreal hospitals were modeled using negative binomial regression. Over lead times of 0-5 weeks, we assessed the predictive ability of weekly counts of 1) total ED visits, 2) ED visits with influenza-like illness (ILI), and 3) ED visits with ILI stratified by age, triage score, or disposition. Models were adjusted for secular trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation. Model fit was assessed using Akaike information criterion, and predictive accuracy using the mean absolute scaled error (MASE). Results Predictive accuracy for P&I hospitalizations during non-pandemic years was improved when models included visits from patients >= 65 years old and visits resulting in admission/transfer/death (MASE of 0.64, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.54-0.80) compared to overall ILI visits (0.89, 95% CI 0.69-1.10). During the H1N1 pandemic year, including visits from patients <18 years old, visits with high priority triage scores, or visits resulting in admission/transfer/death resulted in the best model fit. Discussion Age and disposition data improved model fit and moderately reduced the prediction error for P&I hospitalizations; triage score improved model fit only during the pandemic year. Conclusion Incorporation of age and severity measures available in ED records can improve ILI surveillance algorithms.", "paper_title": "Using age, triage score, and disposition data from emergency department electronic records to improve Influenza-like illness surveillance", "paper_id": "WOS:000356717100023"}
