The approach evolves the traditional dataflow visualization system, based on processes communicating via shared memory or sockets, into an environment in which visualization Web services can be linked in a pipeline using the subscription and notification services available in Globus Toolkit 4. A specific aim of our design is to support collaborative visualization, allowing a geographically distributed research team to work collaboratively on visual analysis of data. A key feature of the system is the use of a formal description of the visualization pipeline, using the skML language first developed in the gViz e-Science project. This description is shared by all collaborators in a session. In co-operation with the e-Viz project, we generate user interfaces for the visualization services automatically from the skML description. The new system is called notification-service-based collaborative visualization. A simple prototype has been built and is used to illustrate the concepts.
