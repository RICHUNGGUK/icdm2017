In this regard, a new schematic of an isolated hybrid energy system combining Wind Turbine (WT), Fuel Cell (FC) and Ultra Capacitor (UC) using nonlinear detailed models has been presented. In this system, the WT is used as the main power generation source. Fuel cell and Ultra Capacitor are introduced as a backup energy source and buffer storage to supply the load demand for all various operating conditions. In the proposed system, in order to use the grid's capability to its best, the second order sliding (SOSMC) mode strategy is employed to extract the maximum power from wind in the below the rated wind speed. In this part, to validate the performance and capabilities of the proposed MPPT strategy, a comparison with the classical ATF controller was performed using Matlab/Simulink. Moreover, to demonstrate the effectiveness of IFPSO algorithm, optimal droop frequency controller using IFPSO algorithm is compared with conventional and improved droop controllers. According to the simulation results, applying proposed method, the frequency deviation of the isolated power grid in dynamical state declines significantly.", "paper_title": "A new frequency control approach for isolated WT/FC/UC power system using improved fuzzy PSO & maximum power point tracking of the WT system", "paper_id": "WOS:000343424500034"}
