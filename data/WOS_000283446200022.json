In particular, we consider nodes placed according to a shot-noise Cox process (SNCP), which allows to model the clustering behavior usually recognized in large-scale systems. For this class of networks, we propose novel scheduling and routing schemes that approach previously computed upper bounds to the per-flow throughput as the number of nodes tends to infinity.", "paper_title": "Capacity Scaling of Wireless Networks With Inhomogeneous Node Density: Lower Bounds", "paper_id": "WOS:000283446200022"}
