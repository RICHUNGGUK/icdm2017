The severe intersymbol interference caused by the UWB channel was formulated as a pattern classification problem in the SVM-based equaliser, which operates in two main modes: training and detection. We also applied the least squares support vector classifiers (LS-SVCs) to reduce the training complexity and sparse LS-SVCs to reduce the detection complexity, with little performance loss compared to SVCs. Simulation results confirm the outperformance of the proposed equalisers over the conventional rake receiver with the same order of complexity for detection, especially when no channel information is known at the receiver. Also, the SVM-based equalisers in the line-of-sight scenario provide a performance close to the case with additive white Gaussian noise only.
