The aim of this research was to identify the challenges in terms of demand that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) face when deploying broadband. The study was conducted using a mail survey on a total of 172 household consumers from the London borough of Hillingdon. The survey was based upon the Theory of Planned Behaviour, the Decomposed Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Model of Adoption of Technology in the Household. This research indicates that broadband adoption in the household is driven by relative advantages such as faster access, utility outcomes, such as the uses of broadband for work purposes, and hedonic outcomes such as to use of broadband for entertainment. The main factors for non-adopters were high costs and lack of needs. The eventual adoption of broadband by consumers is not only an industry concern, but a government aim as well. Therefore this research should offer a substantial contribution to all interested stakeholders including ISPs and government.", "paper_title": "Investigating factors influencing adoption of broadband in the household", "paper_id": "WOS:000239443300004"}
