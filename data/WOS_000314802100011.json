(2010) [30,33] recently developed the Eulerian multi-size moment model (EMSM) which tackles the modeling and numerical simulation of polydisperse multiphase flows. Using a high order moment method in a compact interval, they suggested to reconstruct the number density function (NDF) by entropy maximization, which leads to a unique and realizable NDF, potentially in several size intervals, thus leading to an hybrid method between Multifluid and high order. This reconstruction is used to simulate the evaporation process, by an evaluation of the flux of droplet disappearance at zero size, the fluxes of droplets between size intervals, and an accurate description of the size shift induced by evaporation Massot et al. (2010) [15]. Although this method demonstrated its potential for evaporating polydisperse flows, two issues remain to be addressed. First, the EMSM only considers one velocity for all droplets, thus decoupling size from velocity, which is too restrictive for distributions with a large size spectrum. In most applications size-conditioned dynamics have to be accounted for. Second, the possibility to have separated dynamics for each size can lead to quasi-monodisperse distributions, which corresponds to a hard limiting case for the EM algorithm. So the behavior of the algorithm needs to be investigated, in order to reproduce the entire moment space with a reasonable accuracy. The aim of this paper is thus twofold. The EM and its related algorithm are enhanced by using a more accurate integration method in order to handle NDF close to the frontier of the moment space associated with an adaptive number of parameters to reconstruct the NDF accurately and efficiently, as well as tabulated initial guess to optimize the computational time. Then, a new model called CSVM (coupled size-velocity moments model) is introduced. Size-velocity correlations are addressed either in the evaporation and drag processes, or in the convective transport. To reach this goal, a velocity reconstruction for each size is suggested, using only one additional moment per dimension, and which can be directly applied to several size intervals. Thus, this method is a direct generalization of EMSM. To handle the convective transport, a flux splitting scheme is proposed, based on the underlying kinetic description of the disperse phase. Comparing to existing approaches, a main novelty of the CSVM is that our kinetic approach ensures built-in realizability conditions, no additional corrections of the moments being needed at each time step. The full strategy is first evaluated in 0D and 1D cases, which either demonstrates the ability to reproduce both evaporation, drag force and convection with size-velocity correlations, or the possible extension to several size intervals. Finally, the method is applied on 2D cases with only one section, showing the ability of the CSVM and its related algorithms to capture the main physics of polydisperse evaporating sprays with a minimal number of moments.
