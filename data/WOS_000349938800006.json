Existing models and tools for quantifying airport performance require significant detailed data, substantial airport modelling effort and do not readily produce the information relevant to decision makers. Therefore, a fast and simple simulation model is needed that provides insight into the key performance indicators of an airport for different strategies across different futures. In this paper, a simple simulation model is developed, and different scenarios with increasing traffic and changing traffic distribution are simulated with a general simulation platform called ProModel, which can provide output data for airport capacity evaluation and a bottleneck checking. Case study shows that the model can be easily executed and proved to be feasible to quickly generate interest results for decision makers.", "paper_title": "A simple process simulation model for strategic planning on the airside of an airport: a case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000349938800006"}
