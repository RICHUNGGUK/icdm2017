The use of abstract actions enables robots to employ small action libraries, which reduces the search space for decision making. When executing the actions, however, the robot must tailor the abstract actions to the specific task and situation context at hand. In this article we propose a novel robot action execution system that learns success and performance models for possible specializations of abstract actions. At execution time, the robot uses these models to optimize the execution of abstract actions to the respective task contexts. The robot can so use abstract actions for efficient reasoning, without compromising the performance of action execution. We show the impact of our action execution model in three robotic domains and on two kinds of action execution problems: ( 1) the instantiation of free action parameters to optimize the expected performance of action sequences; ( 2) the automatic introduction of additional subgoals to make action sequences more reliable.", "paper_title": "Refining the execution of abstract actions with learned action models", "paper_id": "WOS:000257321400001"}
