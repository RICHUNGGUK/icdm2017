These aspects are represented by the three languages K-1 = {a(n)b(n)c(n) | n >= 1}, K-2 = {a(n)b(m)c(n)d(m) | m, n >= 1} and K-3 = {ww | w epsilon {a, b}(+)}, respectively. These languages are of interest, when modeling natural languages. In the present paper, we give parallel communicating grammar systems (PC grammar systems) that generate the languages K-1, K-2 and K-3 but use less or less-powerful components than those used by systems published so far.
