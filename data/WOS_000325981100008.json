When the interference is known causally, we characterize the minimum distortion incurred in estimating the desired signal. In the noncausal case, we present a general achievable scheme for discrete memoryless systems and novel lower bounds on the distortion for the binary and Gaussian settings. Our Gaussian setting coincides with that of assisted interference suppression introduced by Grover and Sahai. Our lower bound for this setting is based on the relation recently established by Verdu between divergence and minimum mean squared error. We illustrate with a few examples that this lower bound can improve on those previously developed. Our bounds also allow us to characterize the optimal distortion in several interesting regimes. Moreover, we show that causal and noncausal estimation are not equivalent for this problem. Finally, we consider the case where the desired signal is also available at the helper. We develop new lower bounds for this setting that improve on those previously developed, and characterize the optimal distortion up to a constant multiplicative factor for some regimes of interest.", "paper_title": "Estimation With a Helper Who Knows the Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981100008"}
