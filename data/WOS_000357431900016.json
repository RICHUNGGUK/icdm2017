The package offers functions that are simple enough for users with little experience with statistical programming, but has more advanced features which are suitable for a large number of more complex applications. In this paper, we introduce and motivate discreteRV, describe its functionality, and provide reproducible examples illustrating its use.", "paper_title": "Manipulation of Discrete Random Variables with discreteRV", "paper_id": "WOS:000357431900016"}
