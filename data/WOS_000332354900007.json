We utilized Elastic Network Model (ENM) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to study their conformational dynamics. These dynamics were interpreted by their intrinsic modes that played key roles in the flexibility of karyopherins, which further affected the binding affinities. The findings included that it was the karyopherin's versatile conformations composed of the same superhelices of HEAT repeats that produced different degrees of functional flexibilities. We presented evidence that these coarse-grained methods could help to elucidate the biological function behind the structures of the two karyopherins. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
