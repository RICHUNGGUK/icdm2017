This concept is a generalized concept of quasi-coincidence of a fuzzy point within a fuzzy set. By using this new idea, we consider the interval valued (epsilon, epsilon Vq)-fuzzy sub-hypernear-rings (hyperideals) of a hypernear-ring, and hence, a generalization of a fuzzy sub-near-ring (ideal) is given. Some related properties of fuzzy hypernear-rings are described. Finally, we consider the concept of implication-based interval valued fuzzy sub-hypernear-rings (hyperideals) in a hypernear-ring, in particular, the implication operators in Lukasiewicz system of continuous-valued logic are discussed.
