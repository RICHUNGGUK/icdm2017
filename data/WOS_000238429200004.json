Such a strategy has many advantages: however, it works only when it is possible for the heterogeneous data sources to share a common semantic model. For collaborating systems that cannot assume a prior knowledge of heterogeneity among them, a different strategy is needed. This paper, discussing a hybrid integration strategy and its applications to the architecture-engineering-construction industry, is focused oil the development of a framework of semantic mappings so that high-level applications can use the mappings for data retrieval and processing. Based oil a case Study of integrating schedule and cost information, a prototype is developed to demonstrate the use of the framework. as well as to test the framework. Limitations and future studies are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Framework to support the representations of semantic mappings for a hybrid integration strategy", "paper_id": "WOS:000238429200004"}
