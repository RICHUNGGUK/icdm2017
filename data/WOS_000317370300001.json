However, the operation is far from being interactive due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we proposed a real-time B-spline Free-Form Deformation of polygonal objects via GPU acceleration. Various time-consuming evaluations are designed and performed by means of highly parallel processing on GPGPU, such as evaluations of points of B-spline volume, calculations of control points of Bezier surfaces, tessellations of trimmed Bezier surfaces, evaluations of normals of tessellated triangles, etc. The adoption of vertex buffer object for rendering the tessellated trimmed Bezier surfaces greatly saves data I/O throughput. Experimental results show that the proposed GPU algorithm gains more than 200 times acceleration than its CPU counterpart. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
