These media objects should interact with users in a way that is not disturbing for them. To address this issue, this work presents a design and automation strategy for augmenting the world around us with personalized ambient media services that behave in a considerate manner. That is, ambient services are capable of adjusting its obtrusiveness level (i.e., the extent to which each service intrudes the user's mind) by using the appropriate media objects for each user's situation.", "paper_title": "Automating unobtrusive personalized services in ambient media environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000338120700008"}
