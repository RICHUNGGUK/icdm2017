First, by considering each pixel-pair and its context, a sequence consisting of pairs of difference values is computed. Then, a two-dimensional difference-histogram is generated by counting the frequency of the resulting difference-pairs. Finally, reversible data embedding is implemented according to a specifically designed DPM. Here, the DPM is an injective mapping defined on difference-pairs. It is a natural extension of expansion embedding and shifting techniques used in current histogram-based RDH methods. By the proposed approach, compared with the conventional one-dimensional difference-histogram and one-dimensional prediction-error-histogram-based RDH methods, the image redundancy can be better exploited and an improved embedding performance is achieved. Moreover, a pixel-pair-selection strategy is also adopted to priorly use the pixel-pairs located in smooth image regions to embed data. This can further enhance the embedding performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms some state-of-the-art RDH works.", "paper_title": "A Novel Reversible Data Hiding Scheme Based on Two-Dimensional Difference-Histogram Modification", "paper_id": "WOS:000320866600002"}
