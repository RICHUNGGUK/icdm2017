The algorithm utilizes pre-computed prioritized route candidates that reflect statistical information such as traffic distribution characteristics to attain better load balancing. The route priority is periodically distributed over a network and RWA for each path connection demand is processed in a distributed manner. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the algorithm matches the performance of a centralized RWA algorithm that uses all the necessary information on a network. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
