We consider an implicit surface description which has many well known properties, such as being well suited to perform collision detection. We describe a method to smooth a triangle mesh by constructing an implicit convolution-based surface. Both the convolution kernel and the implicitization of the mesh are linearized. We employ the straight skeleton to linearize the latter. The resulting implicit function is globally C-2 continuous, even for non-surface points, and can be explicitly analytically evaluated. This allows the function to be used in simulation systems requiring C-2 continuity, for which we give an example from industrial simulation, in contrast to methods which only locally smooth the surface itself.
