As is the case in any civil war, there were many groups in conflict. Among several leaders in the Mexican Revolution, it is worth mentioning Porfirio Diaz, Francisco I. Madero and Venustiano Carranza. They represent three main groups which used characteristic cryptographic methods. In this paper, we describe some of the methods used by these groups during the Mexican Revolution.", "paper_title": "Cryptographic Methods During the Mexican Revolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000265292400010"}
