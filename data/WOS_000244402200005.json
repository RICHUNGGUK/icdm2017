In recent work, we have shown how shape analysis can be performed using an abstract interpretation based on three-valued first-order logic. In that work, concrete stores are finite two-valued logical structures, and the sets of stores that can possibly arise during execution are represented (conservatively) using a certain family of finite three-valued logical structures. In this article, we show how three-valued structures that arise in shape analysis can be characterized using formulas in first-order logic with transitive closure. We also define a nonstandard (\"supervaluational\") semantics for three-valued first-order logic that is more precise than a conventional three-valued semantics, and demonstrate that the supervaluational semantics can be implemented using existing theorem provers.", "paper_title": "Logical characterizations of heap abstractions", "paper_id": "WOS:000244402200005"}
