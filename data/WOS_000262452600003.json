Under the fast advancement of digital equipments, color images have become a common medium in many applications. A color image can be represented in different color systems, for instance, RGB and YUV color systems. The proposed method modifies the blue value of the color pixel in order to imply the secret data because the blue value is an insensitive color to human eyes. Furthermore, the number of secret bits that can be embedded into a cover pixel is dynamic so the proposed method tries to embed the secret data as many as possible. The proposed method can be applied to both RGB and YUV color systems. However, for anti-stegoanalysis reason, the RGB color system is suitable for the proposed high capacity data embedding method with lower image distortion. The experimental results show that the proposed method is superior to other methods we compared in terms of embedding capacity and visual quality.", "paper_title": "A Large Payload Data Embedding Technique for Color Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000262452600003"}
