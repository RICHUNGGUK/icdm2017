However, while the global low-level features are widely utilized in current systems, region-based features have received little attention. In this paper, a novel attention-driven transductive framework based on a hierarchical graph representation is proposed for region-based image retrieval (RBIR). This approach can be characterized by two key properties: (1) Since the issue about region significance is the key problem in region-based retrieval, a visual attention model is chosen here to measure the regions' significance. (2) A hierarchical graph representation which combines region-level with image-level similarities is utilized for the manifold-ranking method. A novel propagation energy function is defined which takes both low-level visual features and regional significance into consideration. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach shows the satisfactory retrieval performance compared to the global-based and the block-based manifold-ranking methods.", "paper_title": "Combining attention model with hierarchical graph representation for region-based image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000258395000014"}
