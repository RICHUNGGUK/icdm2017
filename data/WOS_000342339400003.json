Given a database and a result table -the output of some known or unknown query on -the goal of QRE is to reverse-engineer a query such that the output of query on database (denoted by ) is equal to (i.e., ). The QRE problem has useful applications in database usability, data analysis, and data security. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach, TALOS for Tree-based classifier with At Least One Semantics, that is based on a novel dynamic data classification formulation and extend the approach to efficiently support the three key dimensions of the QRE problem: whether the input query is known/unknown, supporting different query fragments, and supporting multiple database versions.", "paper_title": "Query reverse engineering", "paper_id": "WOS:000342339400003"}
