Those systems are composed of a heterogeneous set of sensors to observe the environment. In centralised systems the observed data will be conveyed to the control room to process the data. Human operators are supposed to give a semantic interpretation of the observed data. They are searching for suspicious or unwanted behaviour. The increase of surveillance sensors in the military domain requires a huge amount of human operators which is far beyond available resources. Automated systems are needed to give a context sensitive semantic interpretation of the observed kinematic data. As a proof of concept two automatic surveillance projects will be discussed in this paper. The first project is about a centralised system based on the AIS-Automated Identification System which will be used to monitor ship movements automatically. The second project is about a decentralised system composed of a network of cameras installed at a military area. There is a need for a surveillance system along the coast of Europe. There is an increase of illegal drugs transport from the open sea, intrusion of boat refuges, illegal fishing, pollution of the sea by illegal chemical and oil pollution by ships. An automated sensor system is needed to detect illegal intruders and suspicious ship movements. Vessels fitted with AIS transceivers and transponders can be tracked by AIS base stations located along coast lines or, when out of range of terrestrial networks, through a growing number of satellites that are fitted with special AIS receivers. AIS data include a unique identifier of a vessel and kinematic data such as its position, course and speed. The proposed system enables identification, and tracking of vessels and to detect unwanted or illegal behaviour of ship movements. If ships violate traffic rules, enter forbidden areas or approach a critical infrastructure an alert will be generated automatically in the control room. Human operators start an emergency procedure. The second project is about a network of cameras installed at a military area. The area is monitored by multiple cameras with non-overlapping field of views monitored by human operators. We developed an automated surveillance system. At the entrance gate the identity of visitors will be checked by a face recognition system. In case of intruders, unwanted behaviour, trouble makers the emotional state of the visitor will be assessed by an analysis of facial expressions using the Active Appearance model. If unwanted behaviour is detected an alert is send the control room. Also license place of cars will be recognized using a system based on Neocognitron Neural Networks. Moving objects as persons and vehicles will be detected, localized and tracked. Kinematic parameters are extracted and a semantic interpretation of their behaviour is automatically generated using a rule based system and Bayesian networks. Cars violating the traffic rules or passing speed limits or entering forbidden areas or stopping/parking at forbidden places will be detected. A prototype of a system has been developed which is able to monitor the area 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.", "paper_title": "SURVEILLANCE ANGELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000333141100002"}
