The aim of these schemes, working together with time and frequency domain packet scheduling, is to achieve reuse of 1 at sector level in a tri-sectorized base station scenario. Inter-sector interference is strong at the frontier between sectors, and a tight coordination scheme needs be applied. To support this coordination scheme, the users' location information is then essential to determine if a user is prone to suffer strong inter-sector interference. The performance of these resource allocation algorithms is compared with schemes based on fractional frequency reuse, where reuse of 1 at cell level is assumed.
