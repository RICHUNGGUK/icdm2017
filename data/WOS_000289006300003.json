In this paper, we show that the combination of features can be reflected algorithmically, and we develop modular decision procedures for heterogeneous modal logics. The modularity is achieved by formalising the underlying state-based systems as multi-sorted coalgebras and associating both a logical and algorithmic description with a number of basic building blocks. Our main result is that logics arising as combinations of these building blocks can be decided in polynomial space provided this is also the case for the components. By instantiating the general framework to concrete cases, we obtain PSPACE decision procedures for a wide variety of structurally different logics, describing, for example, Segala systems and games with uncertain information.", "paper_title": "Modular algorithms for heterogeneous modal logics via multi-sorted coalgebra", "paper_id": "WOS:000289006300003"}
