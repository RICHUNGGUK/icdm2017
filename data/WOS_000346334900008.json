Given the difficulties with isolating cause and effect in field experiments, and the inadequacy of discrete event simulations (DESs) for the purpose of evaluating crew leaders' experience and performance, a novel experimental approach was sought that would provide the benefits of DES but would nevertheless allow observation of the behavioral aspects. A hybrid virtual construction site (VCS) system was devised and implemented, in which construction crew leaders were immersed in a virtual reality (VR) automated virtual environment where they worked in a DES-controlled site, with and without a prototype system, which was the object of the research. The VCS proved its efficacy by allowing the researchers to observe, record, and analyze the decision-making behavior of human subjects in a controlled environment, with high accuracy and in relatively very short times.
