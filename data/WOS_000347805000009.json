We show that transmissible information is preserved under universal composability, which constitutes the prevalent cryptographic notion of a secure implementation. This result enables us to lift quantitative bounds of transmissible information from simple ideal functionalities of cryptographic tasks to actual cryptographic systems. We furthermore prove a connection between transmissible information in the unconditional setting and channel capacity, based on the weak converse of Shannon's coding theorem. This connection enables us to compute an upper bound on the transmissible information for a restricted class of protocols, using existing techniques from quantitative information flow.", "paper_title": "Quantifying information flow in cryptographic systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000347805000009"}
