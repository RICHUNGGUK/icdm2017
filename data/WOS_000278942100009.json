Issues of tracking moving objects in wireless video sensor networks are studied, and the effectiveness of adopting a mobile sink is evaluated. This paper applies a power-rate-distortion analysis framework, which provides a theoretical fundamental to quantify various properties of wireless video sensor networks. The performance of wireless video sensor networks is evaluated with a mobile sink versus a static sink, under different cluster sizes and number of sensors. Comparisons of network lifetime, tracking error, video distortion, are also covered in this paper. In addition, this paper also evaluates the performance of solar-powered video sensors under an unequal layered clustering topology.", "paper_title": "On Prolonging the Lifetime for Wireless Video Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278942100009"}
