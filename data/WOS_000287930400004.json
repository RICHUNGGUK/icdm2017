There are some customers on a line that will be served by a single vehicle. Each customer is associated with a release time and a service time. The objective is to schedule the vehicle to minimize the makespan. For the tour version, where the makespan means the time when the vehicle has served all customers and returned back to its initial location, we present a 3/2-approximation algorithm. For the path version, where the makespan is defined as the time by which the last customer has been served completely, we present a 5/3-approximation algorithm. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
