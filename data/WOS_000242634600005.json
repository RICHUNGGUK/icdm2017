Five related performance measures are derived from conditional statistics, including the long-term high-priority and low-priority packet loss probabilities, and the three short-term measures - the average length of a critical period, the average length of a non-critical period, and the conditional high-priority packet loss probability during a critical period. The overall complexity of computing these performance measures is of the order O(K(2)m(1)(3)m(2)(3)sigma(3)), where m(1), m(2) are the numbers of phases of the underlying Markovian structures for the high-priority and the low-priority packet arrival processes respectively and a is the number of phases of the phase-type server.
