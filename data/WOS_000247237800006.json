The proposed transmitter minimizes both chip area and power consumption by constructing pre-emphasis symbols directly from the current symbol, eliminating the need for complex FIR filters and digital-to-analog converters. The differential output current obtained from a class AB pre-amplifier and the push-pull operation of both the current-symbol and pre-emphasis drivers minimizes the electromagnetic interference exerted by channels to neighboring devices. The use of latches at both the multiplexer and pre-amplifier minimizes the effect of power fluctuation and ground bouncing on the output current of the transmitter. The proposed transmitter has been implemented in both UMC-0.13 mu m 1.2 V and TSMC-0.18 mu m 1.8V CMOS technologies and analyzed using SpectreRF from Cadence Design Systems with BSIM3.3v device models. The effectiveness of the proposed transmitter architecture is validated from the simulation results of both designs.", "paper_title": "An area-power efficient CMOS 4-PAM class AB current-mode pre-emphasis serial link transmitter", "paper_id": "WOS:000247237800006"}
