It is then necessary to provide protection to the creatorship of each participating creator. In this paper, we propose a framework for providing the creatorship protection of multiple creators involved in creating the object-based digital movie. The proposed framework makes use of digital watermarking techniques and cryptographic protocols to achieve the creatorship protection purpose. Object-based movie may consist of several audio and video objects, which may be created by different creators. The proposed framework embeds different watermarks in different video/audio objects in such a way that each creator can show the joint-creatorship of the movie; as well as each creator can prove his/her creatorship of video/audio object he/she created.", "paper_title": "A novel framework for multiple creatorship protection of digital movies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421000001"}
