We consider the computational efficiency of detecting four such spatio-temporal patterns, namely flock, leadership, convergence, and encounter, as defined by Laube et al., Finding REMO-detecting relative motion patterns in geospatial lifelines, 201-214, (2004). These patterns are large enough subgroups of the moving point objects that exhibit similar movement in the sense of direction, heading for the same location, and/or proximity. By the use of techniques from computational geometry, including approximation algorithms, we improve the running time bounds of existing algorithms to detect these patterns.", "paper_title": "Efficient detection of patterns in 2D trajectories of moving points", "paper_id": "WOS:000246354100002"}
