The original version uses fixed population size but a method for gradually reducing population size is proposed in this paper. It improves the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm and can be applied to any variant of a Differential Evolution algorithm. The proposed modification is tested on commonly used benchmark problems for unconstrained optimization and compared with other optimization methods such as Evolutionary Algorithms and Evolution Strategies.", "paper_title": "Population size reduction for the differential evolution algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000260181900004"}
