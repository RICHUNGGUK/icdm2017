A variable strength keeper that is optimally programmed based on the die leakage, enables 10% faster performance, 35% reduction in delay variation, and 5 X reduction in the number of robustness failing dies, compared to conventional designs. A new leakage current sensor design is also presented that can detect leakage variation and generate the keeper control signals for the PCD technique. Results based on measured leakage data show 1.9-10.2 X higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and reduced sensitivity to supply and p-n skew variations compared to prior leakage sensor designs.", "paper_title": "A process variation compensating technique with an on-die leakage current sensor for nanometer scale dynamic circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000239405100010"}
