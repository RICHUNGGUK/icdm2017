Finally we note that we may dispense with the probabilistic underpinnings of the product of experts and derive the same algorithm as a minimisation of mean squared error between the prototypes and the data. This leads us to suggest a new algorithm which incorporates local and global information in the clustering. Both ot the new algorithms achieve better results than the standard Self-Organizing Map.", "paper_title": "TOPOLOGICAL MAPPINGS OF VIDEO AND AUDIO DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000262598900004"}
