The number of equilibrium points can be obtained by our results, and we also find that the values of connection weights of CNNs have an influence on the number of equilibrium points for a cell. A design procedure of parameters of cellular neural networks is given. Finally, some numerical simulations are presented to support the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis.
