The TopOpt app solves the 2D minimum compliance problem with interactive control of load and support positions as well as volume fraction. Thus, it is possible to change the problem settings on the fly and watch the design evolve to a new optimum in real time. The use of an interactive app makes it extremely simple to learn and understand the influence of load-directions, support conditions and volume fraction. The topology optimization kernel is written in C# and the graphical user interface is developed using the game engine Unity3D. The underlying code is inspired by the publicly available 88 and 99 line Matlab codes for topology optimization but does not utilize any low-level linear algebra routines such as BLAS or LAPACK. The TopOpt App can be downloaded on iOS devices from the Apple App Store, at Google Play for the Android platform, and a web-version can be run from www.topopt.dtu.dk.", "paper_title": "Interactive topology optimization on hand-held devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000312878800001"}
