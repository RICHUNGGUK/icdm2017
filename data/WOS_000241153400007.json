In this stage, product concept generation and selection plays a crucial role. This paper presents a product concept generation and selection (PCGS) approach, which was proposed to assist product designers in generating and selecting design alternatives during the product conceptualization stage. In the PCGS, general sorting was adapted for initial requirements acquisition and platform definition; while a fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithm was integrated with a design alternatives generation strategy for clustering design options and selecting preferred product concepts. The PCGS deliberates and embeds a psychology-originated method, i.e., sorting technique, to widen domain coverage and improve the effectiveness in initial platform formation. Furthermore, it successfully improves the FCM algorithm in such a way that more accurate clustering results can be obtained. A case study on a wood golf club design was used for illustrating the proposed approach. The results were promising and revealed the potential of the PCGS method. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
