Common examples of camera tampering are turning the camera lens to point to a different direction (i.e., camera motion) and covering the lens by opaque objects or with paint (i.e., camera occlusion). Moreover, various abnormalities such as screen shaking, fogging, defocus, color cast, and screen flickering can strongly deteriorate the performance of a video surveillance system. This study proposes an automated method for rapidly detecting camera tampering and various abnormalities for a video surveillance system. The proposed method is based on the analyses of brightness, edge details, histogram distribution, and high-frequency information, making it computationally efficient. The proposed system runs at a frame rate of 20-30 frames/s, meeting the requirement of real-time operation. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method with an average of 4.4% of missed events compared to existing works. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
