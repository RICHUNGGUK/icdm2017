In this paper we evaluate how both paradigms (which have also been referred to as optical bypass and non-bypass, respectively) perform in optical backbone networks from a power consumption point of view, and whether the general agreement of circuit switching being more power-efficient holds. We consider artificially generated topologies of various sizes, mesh degrees and - not yet previously explored in this context - transport linerates. We cross-validate our findings with a number of realistic topologies. Our results show that circuit switching is preferable when the average node-to-node demands are higher than half the transport linerates. However, packet switching can become preferable when the traffic demands are lower than half the transport linerate. We find that an increase in the network node count does not consistently increase the energy savings of circuit switching over packet switching, but the savings are heavily influenced by the mesh degree and (to a minor extent) by the average link length. Our results are consistent for uniform traffic demands and realistic traffic demands. A key take-away message for other research on power saving solutions in backbone networks is that the ratio between the average demand and the demand bitrate has considerable effect on the overall efficiency, and should be taken into account.
