For process design under uncertainty. a large number of simulations is needed for an accurate convergence of the moments of the output distributions, which renders such stochastic analysis computationally intensive. This paper discusses the application of a basic distributed computing approach to reduce the computation time of a composite materials manufacturing process simulation under uncertainty. Specifically. several load-balancing methods are explored and analyzed to determine the best strategies given heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous networks. especially when the individual task times cannot be predicted.
