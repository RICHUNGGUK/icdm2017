We obtained the classes of numerical methods,. which are second, fourth and six-order. For a specific choice of the parameters involved in a non-polynomial spline, truncation errors are given. A new approach convergence analysis of the presented methods are discussed. Three test examples are considered in our references. By considering the maximum absolute errors in the solution at grid points and tabulated in tables for different choices of step size, we conclude that our presented methods produce accurate results in comparison with those obtained by existing methods.", "paper_title": "Convergence Analysis of Spline Solution of Certain Two-Point Boundary Value Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000273459300004"}
