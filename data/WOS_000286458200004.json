Functions in these classes have the form zf'(z)/f (z) < p phi(z) and 1 + zf ''(z)/f'(z) < p phi(z) respectively, where phi is a convex function with phi(0) = 1. It is shown that the first of these operators maps starlike functions into convex functions, while the convex mappings are shown to be closed under the second integral operator.
