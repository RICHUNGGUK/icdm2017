Scalable video has several advantages over a nonscalable approach, but a large scale deployment is far from trivial and a lot of open questions remain. To resolve these, we developed a complete video delivery chain for scalable wavelet-based video. This includes a video server, a negotiation framework, a video scaling infrastructure and two scalable video clients, one pure software client and one real-time, hardware accelerated client. This paper describes the complete chain and identifies and quantifies the impact of using scalable video in every link of this chain.", "paper_title": "Scalable, wavelet-based video: From server to hardware-accelerated client", "paper_id": "WOS:000250447400015"}
