Although we can benefit from different protocols separately, our research shows that if there exists a proper model, most of the seemingly different protocols can be classified to a same framework. Since technology is a kind of human behavior, we can set up the P2P lookup general model referring to some outcomes of cognitive psychology. In this paper, we firstly study the lookup model in cognitive psychology, then introduce the model into P2P search strategy, at last we give an improved Chord arithmetic based on the binary tree.", "paper_title": "An improved P2P lookup protocol model", "paper_id": "WOS:000277283300008"}
