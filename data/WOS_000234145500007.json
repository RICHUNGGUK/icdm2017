A new statistical measure, based on the implicative intensity defined by Gras for quasi-implications, is defined to assess the significance of R-rules on a data set. We show how to organize R-rules in a new combinatorial structure, the directed hierarchy, which is inspired by the classical hierarchical classification. An incremental algorithm is developed to find the most significant R-rule \"amalgamation\". An illustration is presented on a real data set stemming from a recent survey of the French Public Education Mathematical Teacher Society on the level in mathematics of pupils in the final year of secondary education and the perception of this subject.", "paper_title": "Discovering R-rules with a directed hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000234145500007"}
