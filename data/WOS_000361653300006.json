In this paper, we propose the interference-controlled D2D routing designs underlaying cellular networks, i.e. sharing/reusing the cellular spectrum, to support multi-hop D2D transmissions and thus enhancing the flexibility of CPS. The unique feature and challenge for this task include threefolds. First, the huge density of device nodes in future cellular networks yields huge amount of information to process. Second, as device nodes in cellular networks do not maintain the routing table, the route selection via low-complexity knowledge-extraction approach over huge amount of information needs to be performed by the base station (BS). Third, the interference generated by reusing cellular spectrum needs to be thoroughly controlled. To address these issues, we in this work consider two D2D networking scenarios that allow D2D users to share the uplink and downlink spectrum of cellular networks, respectively. Our objective for routing is hop-count minimization such that the delay and power consumptions can be decreased. In particular, we propose a maximum rate towards destination (MR-D) routing algorithm for the scenario sharing uplink spectrum and a MR-D advanced (MR-DA) routing algorithm for the scenario sharing downlink spectrum, respectively. Both algorithms have low computational complexity and thus meaningful for practical systems. Furthermore, our routing designs can avoid the violation of tolerable interferences to cellular users as well as to fulfil the rate requirement of D2D services. Also conducted are abundant simulation evaluations to demonstrate the advantages of our proposed schemes as compared to the baseline schemes including the farthest neighbour routing and closest to destination routing scheme.", "paper_title": "Interference-controlled D2D routing aided by knowledge extraction at cellular infrastructure towards ubiquitous CPS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361653300006"}
