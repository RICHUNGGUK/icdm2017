In such environments, the deployment may not be adequately controlled, and nodes may have to communicate with a single destination node. For nodes to alert the destination on critical data that has been sensed, in addition to the harsh communication environment, contention resulting from both the deployment and network density must be appropriately overcome. In this paper, we create theoretical models for the behavior of Timeout-MAC (T-MAC) protocol, and evaluate five possible solutions, each designed to be easy to implement on a device by simply tuning T-MAC parameters, so as to overcome these environment-specific issues and effectively alert the destination to critical data. Our results indicate that slight changes to the behavior of the network can improve the awareness of the destination to critical regions in the environment, and that these changes have different levels of effectiveness at different network densities.", "paper_title": "Differentiated service strategies for ad-hoc wireless sensor networks in harsh communication environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000305059500007"}
