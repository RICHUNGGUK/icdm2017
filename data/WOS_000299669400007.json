We propose a new packet scheduling scheme called Least Attained Recent Service (LARS) that schedules packets by giving higher priority to packets of flows with less transferred traffic over a limited period. LARS is tunable and it can pace flows in opposite directions even if operating only on one side of the link, so it is particularly suitable for deployment in a wireless access point or an ADSL box. It has similar advantages to LAS, but it avoids long connection lock-outs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
