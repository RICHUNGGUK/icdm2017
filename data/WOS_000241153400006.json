A major phenomenon of implementation of open-door policy in China is the move of Hong Kong-based manufacturers' production lines to China, crossing the border to take advantages of lower production costs, lower wages and lower rental costs. The finished products are then transshipped to Hong Kong, an efficient logistics hub well-equipped with reliable transportation facility, for exporting. We present a preemptive goal programming model for multi-objective cross-border logistics problem, in which three objectives are optimized hierarchically. We also describe a framework for incorporating decision-makers' opinions for determination of goal priorities and target values. A set of Hong Kong data have been used to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model. Results demonstrate the decision-makers can find the flexibility and robustness of the proposed model by adjusting the goal priorities with respect to the importance of each objective.
