In this algorithm, we separate the raw electroencephalographic (EEC) signals into several independent components using ICA; then choose a best independent component for feature extraction and classification. To demonstrate the validity of our algorithm, we apply it to an data set from an EEC-based cursor control experiment implemented in Wadsworth Center. The data analysis results show that both ICA preprocessing and semi-supervised learning can improve prediction accuracy significantly.", "paper_title": "ICA based semi-supervised learning algorithm for BCI systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300027"}
