In particular, combined information of different image modalities makes segmentation significantly more robust. Indeed, fundamental tasks in image processing are highly interdependent. A variational approach is presented, which combines the detection of corresponding edges, an edge preserving denoising, and the morphological registration via a nonrigid deformation for a pair of images with structural correspondence. The morphology of an image function is split into a singular part consisting of the edge set and a regular part represented by the field of normals on the ensemble of level sets. A Mumford- Shah type free discontinuity problem is applied to treat the singular morphology and the matching of corresponding edges under the deformation. The matching of the regular morphology is quantified by a second contribution, which compares deformed normals and normals at deformed positions. Finally, a nonlinear elastic energy controls the deformation itself and ensures smoothness and injectivity. A multiscale approach that is based on a phase field approximation leads to an effective and efficient algorithm. Numerical experiments underline the robustness of the presented approach and show applications on medical images.", "paper_title": "Multiscale joint segmentation and registration of image morphology", "paper_id": "WOS:000250087900010"}
