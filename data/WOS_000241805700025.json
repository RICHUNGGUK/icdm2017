Links are allowed to be simultaneously active if no node can simultaneously transmit and receive, no node can transmit to or receive from more than one node at a time, and a given signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR) is exceeded at each receiver when transmitters use optimally chosen transmit powers. We show that a) the general problem is at least as hard as the MAX-SIR-MATCHING problem, which is easier to describe and b) when the demands have a superincreasing property the problem is tractable.", "paper_title": "Wireless link scheduling with power control and SINR constraints", "paper_id": "WOS:000241805700025"}
