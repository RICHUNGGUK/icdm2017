Near-fault ground motions contain two impulsive characters. These impulsive characters are the directivity effect perpendicular to fault and the flint step parallel to fault. The structural models were simulated under bidirectional earthquake records superimposed with impulsive motions to examine the response of active control under near-fault effects. Also, the structures were analyzed only under the effect of bidirectional impulsive pulses. The control signals were obtained by Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) type controllers and the parameters of the controllers were obtained by using a numerical algorithm depending on time domain analyses. Time delay effect was also considered for active control system. Different cases of orientation of active tendons were examined and the results of the single-story structure were compared with another control strategy using frequency domain responses in the optimization process. As a conclusion, the control concept is significantly effective on reducing maximum responses in translational and rotational directions and obtaining a steady-state response.", "paper_title": "Active Tendon Control of Torsionally Irregular Structures under Near-Fault Ground Motion Excitation", "paper_id": "WOS:000323825100007"}
