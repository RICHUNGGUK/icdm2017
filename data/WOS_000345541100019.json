These applications require resource efficient error correction hardware to detect and correct errors introduced by the communication channel. This paper presents an innovative flexible architecture for error correction using Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes. The proposed partially-parallel decoder architecture utilizes a novel code construction technique based on multi-level Hierarchical Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) matrix. The proposed architecture is resource efficient, provides scalable throughput and requires substantially less power compared to other decoders reported to date. The proposed decoder has been implemented on a Xilinx FPGA suitable for WiMAX application and achieves a throughput of 548 Mbps. Performance evaluation of the decoder has been carried out by transmitting JPEG images over a wireless noisy channel and comparing the quality of the reconstructed images with those from other similar decoders.
