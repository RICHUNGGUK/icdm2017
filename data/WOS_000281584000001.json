All the tests under consideration are based on the empirical copula, which is a nonparametric rank-based estimator of the true unknown copula. The principles of the tests are recalled and their implementation in the copula R package is briefly described. Their use in the construction of a copula model from data is thoroughly illustrated on real insurance and financial data.", "paper_title": "Modeling Multivariate Distributions with Continuous Margins Using the copula R Package", "paper_id": "WOS:000281584000001"}
