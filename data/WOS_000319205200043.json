This article proposed a new combination of Chaos Optimization Algorithm (COA) with Affine Scaling Search (AFS) to be used as a Hybrid COA and AFS algorithm (Chaos AFS) for solving SOLP. The potential of COA as an emerging optimization algorithm to improve efficiency and effectiveness of AFS is investigated. Chaos AFS method is so-called numerical search algorithm that searches through the domain of decision variables of SOLP to obtain final feasible solution. An initial solution point, obtained from COA, will be used as starting solution point in AFS algorithm to improve the performance of AFS algorithm. The result shows that Hybrid COA and AFS for solving SOLP problems significantly improves the results of objective value compared to pure AFS and reduces the number of iteration steps compared to simplex and pure AFS.
