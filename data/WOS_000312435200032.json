Specifically, the stochastic jump system under consideration involves control and state multiplicative noise and partly unknown transition probabilities (TPs). The receding horizon formulation adopts an. on-line optimization paradigm that utilizes open loop optimized control move plus linear feedback control and is solved as a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem. The mean square stability, control performance and constraint satisfaction properties are guaranteed, where the terminal-weighting matrix is determined off-line and the control move is calculated on-line. A numerical example is given to show the validity of the developed approach.", "paper_title": "RECEDING HORIZON CONTROL FOR CONSTRAINED JUMP BILINEAR SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000312435200032"}
