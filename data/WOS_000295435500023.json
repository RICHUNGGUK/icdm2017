A(n, A) = [1, root A] x [1, root A] with A is an element of [1, n]. We focus on multicast sessions in which each ad hoc node as a user chooses randomly d ad hoc nodes as its destinations. Specifically, when d = 1 (or d = n - 1), a multicast session is essentially a unicast (or broadcast) session. We study the asymptotic multicast throughput for such a hybrid wireless network according to different cases in terms of m is an element of [1, n] and d is an element of [1, n], as n -> infinity. To be specific, we design two types of multicast schemes, called hybrid scheme and BS-based scheme, respectively. For the hybrid scheme, there are two alternative routing backbones: sparse backbones and dense backbones. Particularly, according to different regimes of the node density lambda = n/A we derive the thresholds in terms of m and d. Depending on these thresholds, we determine which scheme is preferred for the better performance of network throughput. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
