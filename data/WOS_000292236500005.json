However, we can often achieve a better clustering solution if only parts of the clustering results available are combined. In this paper, we generalize the selective clustering ensemble algorithm proposed by Azimi and Fern and a novel clustering ensemble method, SELective Spectral Clustering Ensemble (SELSCE), is proposed. The component clusterings of the ensemble system are generated by spectral clustering (SC) capable of engendering diverse committees. The random scaling parameter, Nystrom approximation are used to perturb SC for producing the components of the ensemble system. After the generation of component clusterings, the bagging technique, usually applied in supervised learning, is used to assess the component clustering. We randomly pick part of the available clusterings to get a consensus result and then compute normalized mutual information (NMI) or adjusted rand index (ARI) between the consensus result and the component clusterings. Finally, the components are ranked by aggregating multiple NMI or ARI values. The experimental results on UCI dataset and images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a better result than the traditional clustering ensemble methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
