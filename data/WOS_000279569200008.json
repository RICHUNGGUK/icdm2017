A novel adaptive algorithm for splitting the system Into implicit and explicit sets is developed The method is validated using several canonical laminar and turbulent flows Load balance for the new scheme is achieved by a dual-constraint, domain decomposition algorithm. The scalability and computational efficiency of the method is investigated, and memory savings compared with a fully implicit method is demonstrated A notable reduction of computational costs compared to both fully implicit and fully explicit schemes is observed.
