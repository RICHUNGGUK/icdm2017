Therefore, how to effectively integrate internal and external knowledge and provide correct knowledge to the right users in a timely fashion have become key success factors in business operation. This study attempts to develop a demand-driven knowledge acquisition method to enhance the integrity of domain ontology. Based on the demand of the user request, the developed method can dynamically discover the insufficient knowledge concepts in the domain ontology, acquire such knowledge concepts from knowledge documents available on the Internet, and integrate the acquired knowledge concepts into the domain ontology to make it more correct and complete, thus enhancing its reuse value. This objective can be achieved by performing the following tasks: (i) design of a demand-driven knowledge acquisition process to enhance domain ontology integrity, (ii) development of techniques related to demand-driven knowledge acquisition to enhance domain ontology integrity, and (iii) implementation of a demand-driven knowledge acquisition mechanism to enhance domain ontology integrity. Developing techniques associated with demand-driven knowledge acquisition involves demand preprocessing, knowledge retrieval and searching, ontology construction, and ontology integration.
