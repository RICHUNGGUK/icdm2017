Incorporating physiological spatiotemporal priors through probabilistic integration of dynamic EP models, we have previously developed a Bayesian approach to transmural electrophysiological imaging (TEPI) using body-surface electrocardiograms. In this study, we generalize TEPI to using electrical signals collected from heart surfaces, and we test its feasibility on two pre-clinical swine models provided through the STACOM 2011 EP simulation Challenge. Since this new application of TEPI does not require whole-body imaging, there may be more immediate potential in EP laboratories where it could utilize catheter mapping data and produce transmural information for therapy guidance. Another focus of this study is to investigate the consistency among three modalities in delineating scar after myocardial infarction: TEPI, electroanatomical voltage mapping (EAVM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Our preliminary data demonstrate that, compared to the low-voltage scar area in EAVM, the 3-D electrical scar volume detected by TEPI is more consistent with anatomical scar volume delineated in MRI. Furthermore, TEPI could complement anatomical imaging by providing EP functional features related to both scar and healthy tissue.", "paper_title": "Transmural Imaging of Ventricular Action Potentials and Post-Infarction Scars in Swine Hearts", "paper_id": "WOS:000318474700010"}
