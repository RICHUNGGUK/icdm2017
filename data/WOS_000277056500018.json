Our basic idea is to prevent a primary block with many free pages from being erased in a merge operation. The preserved primary blocks are further reused as replacement blocks. In such a way, the space utilization and the number of erase counts for each block in NAND flash can be enhanced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ a reuse-aware strategy in FTL for improving the space utilization and endurance of NAND flash. We conduct experiments on a set of traces that collected from real workload in daily life. The experimental results show that our technique has significant improvement on space utilization, block lifetime and wear-leveling compared with the previous work.", "paper_title": "RNFTL: A Reuse-Aware NAND Flash Translation Layer for Flash Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000277056500018"}
