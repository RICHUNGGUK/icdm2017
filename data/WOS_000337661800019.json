More specifically, we redefine the intrinsic graph and penalty graph to model the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability of data points, where the intrinsic graph characterizes the similarity information of the same-class points and the penalty graph characterizes the variance information of the not-same-class points. Using the two graphs, the within-class scatter and the between-class scatter are computed, and then a concise feature extraction criterion is raised via minimizing the difference between them. Experimental results on the Wine data set, ORL, FERET and AR face databases show the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
