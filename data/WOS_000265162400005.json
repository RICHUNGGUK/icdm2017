We examine the bursty nature of handoff call drops by means of conditional statistics with respect to alternating block and non-block periods. Five related performance measures are derived from conditional statistics, including the long-term new call block and handoff call drop probabilities, and the three short-term measures of average length of a block period and a non-block period, as well as the conditional handoff call drop probability during a block period. These performance measures greatly assist the priority reservation handoff mechanism in determining a proper threshold guard channel in the cell. Furthermore, we derive the handoff call drop probability from the short-term performance measures of average length of a block period and a non-block period, as well as the conditional handoff call drop probability during a block period. The results presented in this paper can provide guidelines for designing adaptive algorithms to adjust the threshold in the guard channel reservation handoff scheme. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
