Colon capsule endoscopy is a safe and minimally invasive examination procedure, in which the images of the intestine are obtained via digital cameras on board of a small capsule ingested by a patient. The video sequence is then analyzed for the presence of polyps. We propose an algorithm that relieves the labor of a human operator analyzing the frames in the video sequence. The algorithm acts as a binary classifier, which labels the frame as either containing polyps or not, based on the geometrical analysis and the texture content of the frame. We assume that the polyps are characterized as protrusions that are mostly round in shape. Thus, a best fit ball radius is used as a decision parameter of the classifier. We present a statistical performance evaluation of our approach on a data set containing over 18 900 frames from the endoscopic video sequences of five adult patients. The algorithm achieves 47% sensitivity per frame and 81% sensitivity per polyp at a specificity level of 90%. On average, with a video sequence length of 3747 frames, only 367 false positive frames need to be inspected by an operator.", "paper_title": "Automated Polyp Detection in Colon Capsule Endoscopy", "paper_id": "WOS:000339042300008"}
