Consequently, ensuring qualified approximate results with economical network consumption becomes one of the most important goals in such scenarios. In this paper, we study how to monitor aggregate queries continuously over distributed environments efficiently by disposing numerous filters at remote sites, in order to transmit only a small part of incoming data to the query site and therefore save the network resource significantly. We also show how to adjust the parameters of a filter continuously when the incoming data distribution at the corresponding remote site changes. Analysis and extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing work. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
