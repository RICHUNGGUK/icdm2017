Ant metaheuristics are characterized by learning and adaptation capabilities against dynamic environment changes and uncertainties. As an important division of swarm agent intelligence, it distinguishes itself from centralized management schemes due to its features of robustness and scalability. We have successfully applied ant metaheuristics to the network service configuration process, which is simply redefined as: the managed elements represented as graphic nodes, and ants traverse by selecting nodes with the minimum cost constraints until the eligible network elements are located along near-optimal paths-the located elements are those needed for the configuration or activation of a particular product and service. Although the configuration process is non-transparent to end users, the negotiated SLAs between users and providers affect the overall process. This proposed self-organized learning and adaptation scheme using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is evaluated by simulation in Java. A performance comparison is also made with a class of Genetic Algorithm known as PBIL. Finally, the simulation results show the scalability and robustness capability of autonomous ant-like agents able to adapt to dynamic networks.", "paper_title": "Self-configuration of network services with biologically inspired learning and adaptation", "paper_id": "WOS:000245437900007"}
