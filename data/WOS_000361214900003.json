The goal is to establish an objective relation between their expressive gestural patterns and the music structure of two selected excerpts, by Mozart and Brahms. We present a method to represent, segment and analyse the patterns of recurrence on motion data during musical performances. Physical gestures were extracted during clarinet performances and analysed based on gestural features, comparing different musicians, musical passages and experimental conditions. The gestural aspects of the performances were related to the music structure and its expressive content. Results indicate recurrent sequences of clarinet gestures in regions of the excerpts that were shown to be related to key musical moments.", "paper_title": "Motion Analysis of Clarinet Performers", "paper_id": "WOS:000361214900003"}
