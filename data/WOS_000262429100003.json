Because cancer cells continue to grow and divide with no order, they never differentiate into the specific tissue, and thus, they are functionally different from normal cells. However, there are some genes that help to prevent cells' malignant behavior, and therefore, are referred to as tumor suppressor genes. Here, we have investigated the structural and functional relationships of p53, oncogene and interleukin 2 (IL2) proteins using the resonant recognition model (RRM), a physico-mathematical approach based on digital signal processing methods. In addition, using the RRM concepts, we have designed the peptide analoges that would exhibit tumor-suppression-like activity and be used in anticancer vaccine development.", "paper_title": "Investigating the Interaction Between Oncogene and Tumor Suppressor Protein", "paper_id": "WOS:000262429100003"}
