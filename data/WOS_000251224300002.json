Recent progress included a demonstration of a 320 Gbit/s (32-user x 10 Gbit/s) all-optical passive optical network testbed based on the SPECTS O-CDMA technology and a theoretical prediction of the spectral efficiency at 100% and above. In particular, InP-based integrated photonics allows implementation of SPECTS O-CDMA transmitters and receivers monolithically integrated on a chip. The integrated InP chip technology not only allows robust and compact configurations for practical and low-cost O-CDMA network deployments but also offers code reconfigurations at rapid rates for secure communication applications.
