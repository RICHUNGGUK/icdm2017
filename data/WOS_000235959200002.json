A major challenge to the realization of this vision is the lack of automated means of acquiring domain ontologies necessary for marking up the Web services. In this paper, we propose the DeepMiner system which learns domain ontologies from the source Web sites. Given a set of sources in a domain of interest, DeepMiner first learns a base ontology from their query interfaces. It then grows the current ontology by probing the sources and discovering additional concepts and instances from the data pages retrieved from the sources. We have evaluated DeepMiner in several real-world domains. Preliminary results indicate that DeepMiner discovers concepts and instances with high accuracy.", "paper_title": "Bootstrapping domain ontology for semantic web services from source web sites", "paper_id": "WOS:000235959200002"}
