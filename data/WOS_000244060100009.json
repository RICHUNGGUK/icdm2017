In some applications, it is preferable to extract only one desired source signal instead of all source signals, and this can be achieved by a one-unit ICA technique. ICA with reference (ICA-R) is a one-unit ICA algorithm capable of extracting an expected signal by using prior information. However, a drawback of ICA-R is that it is computationally expensive. In this paper, a fast one-unit ICA-R algorithm is derived. The reduction of the computational complexity for the ICA-R algorithm is achieved through (1) pre-whitening the observed signals: and (2) normalizing the weight vector. Computer simulations were performed on synthesized signals, a speech signal, and electrocardiograms (ECG). Results of these analyses demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.
