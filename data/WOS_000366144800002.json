Three public libraries that have adopted BiblioCommons' OPAC system Edmonton Public Library, Seattle Public Library, and Christchurch City Libraries were selected for the study. In the OPAC of each of these libraries, fifty queries were searched using tags as well as keyword and subject as access point. The results of the study showed that a large number of items in public libraries are still not being tagged, while for those items that have been tagged, the tags were mostly made up of one or two words and were subject related. In terms of effectiveness, the precision level of a tag search was found acceptable and somewhat comparable to the precision levels of keyword and subject searches, but of the three access points, tags retrieved the fewest number of items.", "paper_title": "Characteristics and Effectiveness of Tags in Public Library Online Public Access Catalogues", "paper_id": "WOS:000366144800002"}
