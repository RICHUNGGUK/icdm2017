Finally, a new grid resource management model based on mobile agent is proposed, meanwhile, an architectural model based on mobile agent for acquisition of grid information and an optimal algorithm for resource access are also put forward.", "paper_title": "Grid resource management based on mobile agent", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624300023"}
