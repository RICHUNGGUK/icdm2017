In this paper, we focus on the evaluation of CIC protocols belonging to two families, namely, the F-E family and FLazy-E family. We present both theoretical and experimental evaluation of the protocols belonging to these two families. The results of our experimental evaluation not only confirm the theoretical comparison but also reveals the fine differences between these protocols. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
