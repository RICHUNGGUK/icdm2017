The strategy of the kernel grid and block design is shown and the multiword decoding operation is described using tridimensional blocks. The performance (speedup) of the proposed parallel algorithm is slightly better than the performance found in the literature when this is relatively good, and shows a great improvement in those cases with previously reported moderate or bad performance.", "paper_title": "Tridimensional block multiword LDPC decoding on GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000296635800005"}
