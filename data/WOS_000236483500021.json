Induced matchings are well-studied combinatorial objects and a lot of consideration has been given to finding maximum induced matchings, which is an NP-complete problem. Specifically, finding maximum induced matchings in regular graphs is well-known to be NP-complete. A couple of papers lately showed a couple of simple greedy algorithm that approximate a maximum induced matching with a factor of d - 1/2 and d - 1 (different papers - different factors), where d is the degree of regularity. We show here a simple algorithm with an 0.75d + 0.15 approximation factor. The algorithm is simple - the analysis is not.", "paper_title": "Tighter approximations for maximum induced matchings in regular graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000236483500021"}
