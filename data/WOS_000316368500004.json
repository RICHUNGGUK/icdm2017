Recent research has shown that using mobile nodes to collect and carry data in WSNs has many advantages over static multi-hop routing. In this paper, we focus on the problem of data collection in WSNs with the minimum mobile nodes. A mobile node can pick up the data cached in a sensor node via one-hop wireless communications when it passes by a point that R meters away from this stationary sensor node. Since the storage capability of sensor node is limited, each mobile node must visit the sensor nodes, that assigned to it, every t seconds to avoid the overflow of sensor data. In order to reduce the cost of mobile nodes, we try to minimize the number of mobile nodes. But, we find that the problem of minimizing the number of mobile nodes required by periodical data collection in WSNs is NP hard. So, we propose a path planning algorithm to reduce the number of mobile nodes as much as possible. Our simulation results show that our approach can notably reduce the number of required mobile nodes as much as 55%.", "paper_title": "Data Collection in Wireless Sensor Networks by Utilizing Multiple Mobile Nodes", "paper_id": "WOS:000316368500004"}
