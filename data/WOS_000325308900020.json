Two-dimensional principal component analysis based on L1-norm (2DPCA-L1) is a recently developed technique for robust dimensionality reduction in the image domain. The basis vectors of 2DPCA-L1, however, are still dense. It is beneficial to perform a sparse modelling for the image analysis. In this paper, we propose a new dimensionality reduction method, referred to as 2DPCA-L1 with sparsity (2DPCAL1-S), which effectively combines the robustness of 2DPCA-L1 and the sparsity-inducing lasso regularization. It is a sparse variant of 2DPCA-L1 for unsupervised learning. We elaborately design an iterative algorithm to compute the basis vectors of 2DPCAL1-S. The experiments on image data sets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
