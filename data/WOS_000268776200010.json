Providing a reliable transmission, and reducing the retransmission cost and the energy consumption are critical importance for wireless ad hoc networks. MERP considers some important lower-layer factors, such as the power strength, transfer rate, and the interference, to construct an energy efficient and reliable route. Moreover, stations applying MERP can adjust the routing path according to the variation of the channel condition. Simulation results also show that MERP can efficiently reduce the retransmission cost so that stations' energy can be efficiently used.", "paper_title": "A Multi-Rate Supported Energy-Efficient Routing Protocol for Wireless Ad Hoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000268776200010"}
