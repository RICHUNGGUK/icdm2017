Different conventional delay stages for the multiloop ring oscillators have been reviewed and analyzed in this work. By using push-pull inverter as the secondary input in its delay cell, the proposed oscillator demonstrates a frequency improvement of up to 17% when compared with conventional designs. The fabricated oscillator is measured to cover a frequency range of 6.24-7.04 GHz. Operating in 1.8-V power supply, the oscillator manifests itself a phase noise of -107.7 dBc/Hz@10 MHz offset from a center frequency of 6.25 GHz. The proposed oscillator consumes a current of 40-51 mA from the 1.8-V supply and occupies an area of 440 mu m x 430 mu m.", "paper_title": "A 7-GHz multiloop ring oscillator in 0.18-mu m CMOS technology", "paper_id": "WOS:000257440000002"}
