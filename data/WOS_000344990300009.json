Unfortunately, the cost to provide trustworthy and tight Worst-Case Execution Time (WCET) estimates in the presence of caches is high with current practice WCET analysis tools, because they need detailed knowledge of program's cache accesses to provide tight WCET estimates. The advent of Probabilistic timing analysis (PTA) opens the door to economically viable timing analysis in the presence of caches, but it imposes new requirements on hardware design. At cache level, so far only fully associative random-replacement caches have been proven to fulfill the needs of PTA, but their energy, delay, and area cost are unaffordable for CRTES. In this paper, we propose the first PTA-compliant cache design based on set-associative and direct-mapped arrangements, as those are the most common arrangements. In particular, we propose a novel parametric random placement policy suitable for PTA that is proven to have low hardware complexity and energy consumption while providing comparable performance to that of conventional modulo placement.", "paper_title": "Efficient Cache Designs for Probabilistically Analysable Real-Time Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000344990300009"}
