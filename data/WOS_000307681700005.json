The environment is created so that musical content can be located in a comprehensive space in which the world coordinates are related to music genres. To this end, the songs in a database are analyzed, and a description of their spectral content is obtained. These descriptions are then projected onto six vectors, previously determined, that represent six main genres defining a global space with six dimensions. These projected representations are useful to create a multidimensional world in which the relations, orientation, and motion will be readily intelligible to users.", "paper_title": "A Multidimensional Environment for the Exploration of Musical Content", "paper_id": "WOS:000307681700005"}
