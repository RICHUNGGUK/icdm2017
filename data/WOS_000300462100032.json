These domain integral equations describe the acoustic wave propagation in some chosen inhomogeneous background, whereas the influence of the scattering object is viewed as a superposition of contrast sources. A stretching procedure of the inhomogeneous background to a homogeneous one leads to a domain integral equation in a stretched space, where the Green function has the same simple functionality as the one of the non-stretched homogeneous background. This leads to improved efficiency in the computation of the scattering problem at hand. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.
