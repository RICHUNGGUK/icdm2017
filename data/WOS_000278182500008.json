The algorithm automatically computes spatial relationships between components of the target object, builds correspondences between source and target, and finally transfers deformation of the source onto the target while preserving cohesion between the target's components. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach on various complex models.", "paper_title": "Deformation Transfer to Multi-Component Objects", "paper_id": "WOS:000278182500008"}
