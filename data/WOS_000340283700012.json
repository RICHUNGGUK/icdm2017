CILogon relies on federated authentication (Security Assertion Markup Language (OASIS, Burlington, MA (USA)) and OpenID) for determining user identities when issuing certificates. Federated authentication enables users to obtain certificates using existing identities (university, Google, etc.). Federated authentication also enables CILogon to serve a national-scale user community without requiring a large network of registration authorities performing manual user identification. CILogon supports multiple levels of assurance and custom interfaces for specific user communities. In this article, we introduce the CILogon service and describe experiences and lessons learned from the first 3years of operation. (c) 2014 The Authors.
