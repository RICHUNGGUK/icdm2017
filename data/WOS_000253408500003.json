A discussion follows on the design and implementation of a ubiquitous programming framework, which is based on high-level policy description language. A context-based access control manager(CACM) was implemented for context-aware access control, while an adaptation engine was integrated for context adaptation in dynamically changing environments. A simulator was also implemented for conducting experiments with this framework for ubiquitous applications.", "paper_title": "A programming environment for ubiquitous computing environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000253408500003"}
