Users' perception of the level of quality plays a key role in making a VoIP service to succeed or to fail. This paper demonstrates the influence of technical parameters (such as the audio codec, type of data network, and handovers during the call), device characteristics (such as the platform, manufacturer, model, and operating system), and application aspects (such as the software version and configuration) on the subjective quality of a commercial VoIP service. The relative influence of all these parameters is determined and a decision tree combines these results in order to assess the subjective quality. Combining a large number of objective parameters in a decision tree to determine the user's subjective evaluation of the quality of a VoIP call is a novel and complex procedure. The subjective quality, in turn, has an influence on the duration of the call, and as a result an influence on the usage behavior of the service. The users' assessment of the service quality is not evaluated by merely taking a snapshot of the perceived quality at one moment in time but rather by analyzing the perceived quality over a longer period of time during service usage, which has not been done up to now. Analyzing the VoIP service using a regression analysis over a period of 120 days showed that the perceived quality decreases slightly when the user utilizes the service more often and gets more familiar with it.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the quality of experience of a commercial voice-over-IP service", "paper_id": "WOS:000358214100025"}
