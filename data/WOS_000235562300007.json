We construct a procedure that can be implemented as part of an MIP solver. It is based on analyzing the partial tree resulting from running the algorithm for a short period of time and predicting the shape of the whole tree. The procedure is tested on instances from the literature. This work was inspired by the practical applicability of such a result.", "paper_title": "Early estimates of the size of branch-and-bound trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000235562300007"}
