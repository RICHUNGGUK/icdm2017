By abstracting away from the concrete lattice-valued relations and the operations on them, such as composition and converse, the notion of lattice-valued relation algebra is introduced, LRA for short. The reduct of an LRA is a lattice implication algebra. Such an algebra generalizes Boolean relation algebras by general distributive lattices and can provide a fundamental algebraic theory for establishing lattice-valued first-order logic. Some important results are generalized from the classical case. The notion of cylindric filter is introduced and the generated cylindric filters are characterized.", "paper_title": "On the algebraic structure of binary lattice-valued fuzzy relations", "paper_id": "WOS:000314754000007"}
