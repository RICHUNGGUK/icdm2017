These schemes are widely used and standardised, the most well known being McGrew and Viega's Galois/Counter Mode (GCM). In this paper we identify some properties of hash functions based on polynomial evaluation that arise from the underlying algebraic structure. As a result we are able to describe a general forgery attack, of which Saarinen's cycling attack from FSE 2012 is a special case. Our attack removes the requirement for long messages and applies regardless of the field in which the hash function is evaluated. Furthermore we provide a common description of all published attacks against GCM, by showing that the existing attacks are the result of these algebraic properties of the polynomial-based hash function. We also greatly expand the number of known weak GCM keys and show that almost every subset of the keyspace is a weak key class. Finally, we demonstrate that these algebraic properties and the corresponding attacks are highly relevant to GCM/, a variant of GCM designed to increase the efficiency in software.", "paper_title": "On Weak Keys and Forgery Attacks Against Polynomial-Based MAC Schemes", "paper_id": "WOS:000361820500002"}
