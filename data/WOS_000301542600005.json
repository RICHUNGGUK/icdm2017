The stored data (virtual courses, e-learning log file, demographic and academic data of students, admissions/registration info, and so on) can be useful for machine learning algorithms. In this article, we cite the most current articles that use machine learning techniques for educational proposes and we present a case study for predicting students' marks. Students' key demographic characteristics and their marks in a small number of written assignments can constitute the training set for a regression method in order to predict the student's performance. Finally, a prototype version of software support tool for tutors has been constructed.", "paper_title": "Use of machine learning techniques for educational proposes: a decision support system for forecasting students' grades", "paper_id": "WOS:000301542600005"}
