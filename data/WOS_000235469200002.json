This expansion employs a set of modified Chebyshev polynomials with the Bessel functions of the first kind as its expansion coefficients. As a result, the previous requirement of operator splitting in the time domain is removed, and the convergence property of the AWP scheme is significantly improved. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
