Drawing from the motivational theory and using data collected from a survey of 176 organizations, the paper develops and tests four hypotheses. The result shows that eco-efficiency and eco-effectiveness motives influence the adoption of (a) technologies that improve the energy efficiency of IT infrastructure and that reduce IT related emissions (b) information systems to reduce travel and travel related emissions and (c) policy and practices that cultivate product stewardship focusing on the IT lifecycle from procurement to end of life. The findings show that while a sense of corporate environmental responsibility predicts Green IT policies and IT for Green technologies, cost cutting and energy conservation are main reasons for undertaking Green IT investments. Pressure from market forces will emerge as relevant motive as early adopters demonstrate favorable outcome out of their green practices.", "paper_title": "ORGANIZATIONAL GREEN MOTIVATIONS FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY: EMPIRICAL STUDY", "paper_id": "WOS:000303784700010"}
