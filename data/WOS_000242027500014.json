Inspired by his work, numerical models have been developed to carry out the decomposition of gray scale images. In this paper, we propose a decomposition algorithm for color images. We introduce a generalization of Meyer's G norm to RGB vectorial color images, and use Chromaticity and Brightness color model with total variation minimization. We illustrate our approach with numerical examples. (C) 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "Color image decomposition and restoration", "paper_id": "WOS:000242027500014"}
