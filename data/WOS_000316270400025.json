The implementation of functional genomics methods that allow the simultaneous measurement of transcription (TR) and degradation (DR) rates for thousands of mRNAs is a huge improvement in this field. One of the best established methods for mRNA stability determination is genomic run-on (GRO). It allows the measurement of DR, TR and mRNA levels during cell dynamic responses. Here, we offer a software package that provides improved algorithms for determination of mRNA stability during dynamic GRO experiments.
