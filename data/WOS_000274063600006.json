We present an integrated visualization and analysis framework that supports user-guided data clustering to aid exploration of these new complex data sets. The interplay of data visualization and clustering-based data classification leads to improved visualization and enables a more detailed analysis than previously possible. We discuss 1) the integration of data clustering and visualization into one framework, 2) the application of data clustering to 3D gene expression data, 3) the evaluation of the number of clusters k in the context of 3D gene expression clustering, and 4) the improvement of overall analysis quality via dedicated postprocessing of clustering results based on visualization. We discuss the use of this framework to objectively define spatial pattern boundaries and temporal profiles of genes and to analyze how mRNA patterns are controlled by their regulatory transcription factors.", "paper_title": "Integrating Data Clustering and Visualization for the Analysis of 3D Gene Expression Data", "paper_id": "WOS:000274063600006"}
