The proposed technique initially reduces the number of multiplications per input sample and additions per input sample by 83% in comparison with individual implementation of each standard's filter while designing a root-raised-cosine finite-impulse response filter for multistandard DUC for three different standards. In the next step, a 2-bit binary common subexpression (BCS)-based BCS elimination algorithm has been proposed to design an efficient constant multiplier, which is the basic element of any filter. This technique has succeeded in reducing the area and power usage by 41% and 38%, respectively, along with 36% improvement in operating frequency over a 3-bit BCS-based technique reported earlier, and can be considered more appropriate for designing the multistandard DUC.", "paper_title": "An Efficient VLSI Architecture of a Reconfigurable Pulse-Shaping FIR Interpolation Filter for Multistandard DUC", "paper_id": "WOS:000355218000015"}
