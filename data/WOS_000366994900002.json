The new aspects of cooperation between the production industry and metrology laboratories enable a development capacity providing an information highway and expertise exchange by accommodating rising demand of services. This paper proposes a novel approach to develop a global network on two different continents that will moreover be a model for the industry without any limits of location, time difference or facility. Due to the high cost of special infrastructure, equipment and expertise for production of complex components, this study also proposes a strategic approach to develop a remotely controlled high precision metrology system with high accuracy as well as with the smallest measurement uncertainties for the micro- and nanotechnologies and intelligent integrated management system applicable in advanced manufacturing industry. This will provide a roadmap for the industrial applications as well as in educational organizations with the developed and integrated low-cost telepresence and teleoperation system.", "paper_title": "A Model of Global Cooperation to Enable Intelligent Metrology Applications by Means of an Integrated Teleoperation System", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994900002"}
