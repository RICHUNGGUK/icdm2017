The method is easily implemented. It does not require solving the Poisson equation and does not involve the complex treatments of derivative terms. The interface capturing equation is recovered without any additional terms as compared to other methods [M.R. Swift, W.R. Osborn, J.M. Yeomans, Lattice Boltzmann simulation of liquid-gas and binary fluid systems, Phys. Rev. E 54 (1996) 5041-5052; T. Inamuro, T. Ogata, S. Tajima, N. Konishi, A lattice Boltzmann method for incompressible two-phase flows with large density differences, J. Comput. Phys. 198 (2004) 628-644; T. Lee, C.-L. Lin, A stable discretization of the lattice Boltzmann equation for simulation of incompressible two-phase flows at high density ratio, J. Comput. Phys. 206 (2005) 16-47]. Besides, it requires less discrete velocities. As a result, its efficiency could be greatly improved, especially in 3D applications. It is validated by several cases: a bubble in a stationary flow and the capillary wave. The numerical surface tension obtained from the Laplace law and the interface profile agrees very well with the respective analytical solution. The method is further verified by its application to capillary wave and the bubble rising under buoyancy with comparison to other methods. All the numerical experiments show that the present approach can be used to model multiphase flows with large density ratios. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
