The goal of this paper is to perform a comparative analysis of the assumptions used in a transmission system which still has quantizers using restrained bit allocation in the long time and in a transmission system for which all quantizers end up using heavy bit allocation. Then, based on the validity of the assumptions derived, we will be able to predict the performance of each system in a real problem. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
