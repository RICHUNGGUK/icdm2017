This method applies submatrices of the code adjacent matrix, and its complexity is in the order of L-3(L is the number of states in the state diagram of the code). The derived BER bound is especially important for applications with low signal-to-noise power ratio values, such as in the cases with high interference power, in satellite communications, and in multihop wireless networks.", "paper_title": "A Novel Method to Derive Transfer Function and Tight BER Bound of Convolutional Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000356700300007"}
