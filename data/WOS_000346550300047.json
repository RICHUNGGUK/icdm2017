The model employs weighted linear regression for feature selection and uses boosting algorithm for ensemble learning. Unlike most previous algorithms, which need to build a collection of binary classifiers independently, the method constructs only one strong classifier once and for all classes via minimizing the total error in a forward stagewise manner. In this work, a novel weak learner framework called composite stump is proposed to improve convergence speed and share features. With these optimization techniques, the classification problem is solved by a simple but effective classifier. Experiments show that the new method outperforms the previous approaches on a number of data sets. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
