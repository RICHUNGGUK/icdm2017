Numerous bridging efforts attempt to ameliorate the resulting vendor lock-in for customers. However, as the number of providers continues to grow, the drawback of this approach becomes apparent: the need to maintain adapter implementations. The Open Cloud Computing Interface builds on the fundamentals of modern Web-based services to define a standardized interface for cloud environments while enabling service providers to differentiate their service offerings at the same time.", "paper_title": "Toward an Open Cloud Standard", "paper_id": "WOS:000305545200004"}
