We call it Scalable DNF, S-DNF, and it targets the scenario with multiple communication flows through a single common relay. The idea of the scheme is to combine packets at the relay in order to save transmissions. To ensure decodability at the end-nodes, a priori information about the content of the combined packets must be available. This is gathered during the initial transmissions to the relay. The trade-off between decodability and number of necessary transmissions is analysed and simulations show, that S-ONE is able to provide a better trade-off than traditional schemes at high SNR.
