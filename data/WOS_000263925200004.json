The method determines not only a proper number of hidden neurons but also the particular shape of the activation function for each node. Here, the projection pursuit technique was applied in association with the optimization of the solvability condition, giving rise to a more efficient and accurate computational learning algorithm. As each activation function of a hidden neuron is defined according to the peculiarities of each approximation problem, better rates of convergence are achieved, guiding to parsimonious neural network architectures. The proposed constructive learning algorithm was successfully applied to identify a MIMO bioprocess, providing a multivariable model that was able to describe the complex process dynamics, even in long-range horizon predictions. The resulting identification model was considered as part of a model-based predictive control strategy, producing high-quality performance in closed-loop experiments. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
