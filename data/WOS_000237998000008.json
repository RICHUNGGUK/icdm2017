Concentric structure has the gradient porosity, which could mimic the microstructures in native bone. The mathematical foundation behind the concentric structure model was described in detail and a special software to construct the unique structures was developed. The constructed model is based on a unified mathematical model and possesses structural extensionality, which could facilitate the further optimization. The artificial bone model with certain porosity and different concentric fiber structures could be constructed and visualized in the special software. By incorporating the concentric fiber structures into the calcium phosphate cement (CPC) matrix, the fiber-reinforced CPC composite artificial bone with controlled fiber structure and desired porosity could be fabricated.
