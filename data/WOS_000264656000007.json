In this work, we present a new planning algorithm, called Yoyo, for solving planning problems in fully observable nondeterministic domains. Ybyo combines an HTN-based mechanism for constraining its search and a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD) representation for reasoning about sets of states and state transitions. We provide correctness theorems for Ybyo, and an experimental comparison of it with MBP and ND-SHOP2, the two previously-best algorithms for planning in nondeterministic domains. in our experiments, Yoyo could easily deal with problem sizes that neither MBP nor ND-SHOP2 could scale up to, and could solve problems about 100 to 1000 times faster than MBP and ND-SHOP2.
