Also, as the number of sensors in an IoT environment increases significantly, sensor filtering becomes more important. Many sensor filtering techniques have been researched. However most of them do not consider real-time searching and efficiency of mobile networks. In this paper, we suggest a path prediction approach for effective sensor filtering in Sensor Registry System (SRS). SRS is a sensor platform to register and manage sensor information for sensor filtering. We also propose a method for learning and predicting user paths based on the Collective Behavior Pattern. To improve prediction accuracy, we consider a time feature to measure weights and predict a path. We implement the method and the implementation and its evaluation confirm the improvement of time and accuracy for processing sensor information.", "paper_title": "Path Prediction Method for Effective Sensor Filtering in Sensor Registry System", "paper_id": "WOS:000359214900001"}
