In this paper we ask which cartesian closed full subcategories exist in qCONT, the category of all quasicontinuous domains and Scott-continuous functions. The surprising, and perhaps disappointing, answer turns out to be that all such subcategories consist entirely of continuous domains. In other words, there are no new cartesian closed full subcategories in qCONT beyond those already known to exist in CONT. To prove this, we reduce the notion of meet-continuity for dcpos to one which only involves well-ordered chains. This allows us to characterise meet-continuity by \"forbidden substructures\". We then show that each forbidden substructure has a non-quasicontinuous function space. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.
