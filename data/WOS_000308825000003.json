It is not easy to control the relative humidity, but it is possible to obtain the measure of the relative humidity as a consequence of the control of the temperature in a bird incubator. In this article, (1) the mathematical model for the control of temperature in the bird incubator is presented, (2) a functional network to approximate the relative humidity behavior in the bird incubator is proposed, (3) a control for the temperature in the bird incubator is proposed, the error of the proportional control applied to the mathematical model of the temperature of the bird incubator is assured to be uniformly stable, (4) the comparison results of four classic control laws for the control of the temperature considering the proposed mathematical model of the temperature and the functional network to approximate the relative humidity behavior in the bird incubator are presented.", "paper_title": "Modeling of the relative humidity via functional networks and control of the temperature via classic controls for a bird incubator", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000003"}
