This paper first considers the human uncertainty in making decisions, and employs uncertain variable to describe the choice. Utility function is also employed in the paper, and expected utility is introduced as a criterion to rank the choices. At last, in order to illustrate the uncertain decision making method, a portfolio selection problem is considered.", "paper_title": "UNCERTAIN DECISION MAKING AND ITS APPLICATION TO PORTFOLIO SELECTION PROBLEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000332729900005"}
