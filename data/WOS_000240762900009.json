To demonstrate its usefulness pragmatically, the model is applied to the design problem of development of the micro/nano injection molding machine. Based on the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) technique, this model translates the customer needs to engineering characteristics. An Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used to prioritize customer requirements while a Linear Programing (LP) optimization method is used to determine the feasible solution of the design variables within limited resources. Also, a program with a tailor-made graphical user interface (GUI) using MATLAB library and Microsoft Component Object Model (COM) technology is implemented to guide the design engineers to employ the proposed methodology for decision making.", "paper_title": "Application of function deployment model in decision making for new product development", "paper_id": "WOS:000240762900009"}
