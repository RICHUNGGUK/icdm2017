Based on the notion of nonlinear elastic deformations from one shape to another, a suitable linearization of geometric shape variations is introduced. Once such a linearization is available, a principal component analysis can be investigated. This requires the definition of a covariance metric-an inner product on linearized shape variations. The resulting covariance operator robustly captures strongly nonlinear geometric variations in a physically meaningful way and allows to extract the dominant modes of shape variation. The underlying elasticity concept represents an alternative to Riemannian shape statistics. In this paper we compare a standard L (2)-type covariance metric with a metric based on the Hessian of the nonlinear elastic energy. Furthermore, we explore the dependence of the principal component analysis on the type of the underlying nonlinear elasticity. For the built-in pairwise elastic registration, a relaxed model formulation is employed which allows for a non-exact matching. Shape contours are approximated by single well phase fields, which enables an extension of the method to a covariance analysis of image morphologies. The model is implemented with multilinear finite elements embedded in a multi-scale approach. The characteristics of the approach are demonstrated on a number of illustrative and real world examples in 2D and 3D.", "paper_title": "An Elasticity-Based Covariance Analysis of Shapes", "paper_id": "WOS:000287929400003"}
