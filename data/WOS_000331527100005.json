Specifically, we are interested in the effective capacity of members of some class of graphs, the number of states distinguishable by a Turing machine that uses the labeled graph itself in place of the usual linear tape. We show that the effective capacity is related to the information-theoretic capacity which we introduce in the paper. It equals the information-theoretic capacity of the graph up to constant factors for trees, random graphs with polynomial edge probabilities, and bounded-degree graphs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
