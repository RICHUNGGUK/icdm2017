Humanitarian organizations dedicate an immeasurable amount of time, effort, and money to find and remove as many of these mines as possible. Unfortunately, landmines can be made out of common materials which make the correct detection of them very difficult. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of combining certain statistical techniques with a neural network to improve detection. The detection method must not only detect the majority of landmines in the ground, it must also filter out as many of the false alarms as possible. This is the true challenge to developing landmine detection algorithms. Our approach combines a Back-Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) with statistical techniques and compares the performance of mine detection against the performance of the energy detector and the delta-technique. Our results show that the combination of the delta-technique and the S-statistics with a neural network improves the performance.", "paper_title": "A back-propagation neural network landmine detector using the delta-technique and S-statistic", "paper_id": "WOS:000235318300003"}
