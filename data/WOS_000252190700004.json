If G has a tree t-spanner but not a tree (t-1)-spanner, then G is said to have max-stretch of t. In this paper, we study the Max-Stretch Reduction Problem: for an unweighted graph G=(V,E), find a set of edges not in E originally whose insertion into G can decrease the max-stretch of G. Our results are as follows: (i) For a ring graph, we give a linear-time algorithm which inserts k edges improving the max-stretch optimally. (ii) For a grid graph, we give a nearly optimal max-stretch reduction algorithm which preserves the structure of the grid. (iii) In the general case, we show that it is NP-hard to decide, for a given graph G and its spanning tree of max-stretch t, whether or not one-edge insertion can decrease the max-stretch to t-1. (iv) Finally, we show that the max-stretch of an arbitrary graph on n vertices can be reduced to s'>= 2 by inserting O(n/s') edges, which can be determined in linear time, and observe that this number of edges is optimal up to a constant.", "paper_title": "Max-stretch reduction for tree spanners", "paper_id": "WOS:000252190700004"}
