Missing outcomes frequently occur in longitudinal research even in well controlled situations. As a powerful alternative to the traditional expectation maximization based algorithm employing single imputation, we consider a Bayesian analysis of the MtLMM to account for the uncertainties of model parameters and missing outcomes through multiple imputation. An inverse Bayes formulas sampler coupled with Metropolis-within-Gibbs scheme is used to effectively draw the posterior distributions of latent data and model parameters. The techniques for multiple imputation of missing values, estimation of random effects, prediction of future responses, and diagnostics of potential outliers are investigated as well. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a simulation study and an application to AIDS/HIV data.", "paper_title": "Bayesian analysis of multivariate t linear mixed models with missing responses at random", "paper_id": "WOS:000371315300013"}
