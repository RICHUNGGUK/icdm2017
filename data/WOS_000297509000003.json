To aggregate the intuitionistic fuzzy information, a lot of aggregation techniques have been developed, especially, the ones which reflect the correlations of the aggregated arguments are the hot research topics, among which Bonferroni mean (BM) is an important aggregation technique. However, the classical BM ignores some aggregation information and the weight vector of the aggregated arguments. In this paper, we introduce the generalized weighted BM and the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy weighted BM, both of which focus on the group opinion. Paying more attention to the individual opinions, we further define the generalized weighted Bonferroni geometric mean and the generalized intuitionistic fuzzy weighted Bonferroni geometric mean. Various families of the existing operators can be obtained when the parameters of the developed aggregation techniques are assigned different values. Finally, we propose an approach to multicriteria decision making on the basis of the proposed aggregation techniques and an example is also given to illustrate our results.
