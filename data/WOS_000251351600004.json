A few number of researchers considered this problem and proposed linear-programming-based methods and fuzzy least-squares methods to deal with the outliers problem. In this paper, we develop a new model along with a linear-programming-based approach for computation of fuzzy regression models. The problem of outliers is modeled with this approach. Two examples are illustrated to compare the performance of proposed approach with those given in literature. Results from numerical examples show that our approach gives good solutions.", "paper_title": "An LP-based approach to outliers detection in fuzzy regression analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000251351600004"}
