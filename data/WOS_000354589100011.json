In this paper, we provide an analytical framework for the performance evaluation of the interaction of multiple operators who cooperate and apply an opportunistic spectrum renting scheme. Based on our investigation, we provide a flexible and simple cooperation scheme when more than two operators are involved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
