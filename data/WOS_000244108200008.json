The mathematical formulation of model is an extension of (4,4) Pade approximant for moving bottom boundary. The mathematical formulations are derived based on a higher-order perturbation analysis using the expanded form of velocity components. A sixth-order multi-step finite difference method is applied for spatial discretization and a sixth-order Runge-Kutta method is applied for temporal discretization of the higher-order depth-integrated governing equations and boundary conditions. The present model is validated using available three-dimensional experimental data and a good agreement is obtained. Moreover, the present higher-order model is compared with fully potential three-dimensional models as well as Boussinesq-type multi-layer models in several cases and the differences are discussed. The high accuracy of the present numerical model in considering the nonlinearity effects and frequency dispersion of waves is proven particularly for waves generated in intermediate and deeper water area.
