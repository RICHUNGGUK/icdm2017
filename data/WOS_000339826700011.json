OpenCL is vendor independent and hence not specialized for any particular compute device. To develop efficient OpenCL applications for the particular platform, we still need a more profound understanding of architecture features on the OpenCL model and computing devices. For this purpose, we design and implement an OpenCL micro-benchmark suite for GPUs and CPUs. In this paper, we introduce the implementations of our OpenCL micro benchmarks, and present the measuring results of hardware and software features like performance of mathematical operations, bus bandwidths, memory architectures, branch synchronizations and scalability, etc., on two multi-core CPUs, i.e. AMD Athlon II X2 250 and Intel Pentium Dual-Core E5400, and two different GPUs, i.e. NVIDIA GeForce GTX 460se and AMD Radeon HD 6850. We also compared the measuring results with existing benchmarks to demonstrate the reasonableness and correctness of our benchmark suite.", "paper_title": "An OpenCL micro-benchmark suite for GPUs and CPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000339826700011"}
