The proposed algorithm can recognize upstairs and downstairs with 95.64% average accuracy for different sensor locations, i.e. located on the subject's waist belt, in the trousers pocket, and in the shirt pocket. Even for the mixed data from all sensor locations, the average recognition accuracy can reach 94.84%. Experimental results have successfully validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Discrimination between Upstairs and Downstairs Based on Accelerometer", "paper_id": "WOS:000292480800008"}
