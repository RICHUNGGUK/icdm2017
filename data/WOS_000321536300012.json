The proposed BSWS includes camera models of a dynamic calibration and blind spot detection (BSD) algorithms for the daytime and nighttime. Under daytime conditions, the proposed system presents the Horizontal Edge and Shadow Composite Region (HESCR) method to extract the searching region and to acquire the shadow location of the targeted vehicles. Additionally, to detect vehicles at nighttime road scenes, the proposed system extracts bright objects and recognizes the paired headlights of the targeted vehicles for the BSD. The BSWS is implemented on a DSP-based embedded platform. The results of the BSWS are obtained by conducting practical experiments on our camera-assisted car on a highway in Taiwan under both nighttime and daytime conditions. Experimental results show that the proposed BSWS is feasible for vehicle detection and collision warning in various daytime and nighttime road environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
