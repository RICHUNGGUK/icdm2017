Many, geometry based and semantic oriented approaches for 3D mesh segmentation has been presented. However, only a few algorithms based on Markov Random Field (MRF) has been presented for 3D object segmentation. In this letter, we present a definition of mesh segmentation according to the labeling problem. Inspired by the capability of MRF combining the geometric information and the topology information of a 3D mesh, we propose a novel 3D mesh segmentation model based on MRF and Graph Cuts. Experimental results show that our MRF-based schema achieves an effective segmentation.", "paper_title": "3D Mesh Segmentation Based on Markov Random Fields and Graph Cuts", "paper_id": "WOS:000300471900050"}
