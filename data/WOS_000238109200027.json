A partial model (semivaluation) corresponding to this branch and verifying A is extended to a total model for -A using arithmetical comprehension. This contradicts soundness, if A is derivable with cut. Hence T is a cut free proof of A. The same argument works for Herbrand Theorem. We discuss algorithms of obtaining cut free proofs corresponding to this schema and quite different from complete search through all possible proofs.", "paper_title": "Unwinding a non-effective cut elimination proof", "paper_id": "WOS:000238109200027"}
