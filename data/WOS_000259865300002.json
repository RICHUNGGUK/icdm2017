However, the formal integration of training simulators into the medical curriculum is still lacking. Especially, the lack of a reasonable level of realism supposedly hinders the widespread use of this technology. Therefore, we try to tackle this situation with a reference surgical simulator of the highest possible fidelity for procedural training. This overview describes all elements that have been combined into our training system as well as first results of simulator validation. Our framework allows the rehearsal of several aspects of hysteroscopy-for instance, correct fluid management, handling of excessive bleeding, appropriate removal of intrauterine tumors, or the use of the surgical instrument.", "paper_title": "Virtual reality based simulation of hysteroscopic interventions", "paper_id": "WOS:000259865300002"}
