Canonical correlation analysis is a multivariate statistical technique which extracts and quantifies correlated behaviour between two sets of vector variables. Firstly, we perform non-rigid image registration of 93 sets of 3D MR images to build sets of surfaces and correspondences for subcortical structures in the brain. Canonical correlation analysis is then used to extract and quantify correlated behaviour in the shapes of each pair of surfaces. The results show that correlations are strongest between neighbouring structures and reveal symmetry in the correlation strengths for the left and right sides of the brain.", "paper_title": "Canonical correlation analysis of sub-cortical brain structures using non-rigid registration", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200009"}
