Five features in hierarchical order are used to classify structurally the phenols. From these features, the first three mark the group or column, while the last two mark the row or period in the table. Those phenols in the same group and period are suggested to have maximum similarity in properties. Furthermore, those with only the same group will present moderate similarity. The Mediterranean endemic seagrass Posidonia oceanica is constituted by cells rich in phenolic compounds. In this report, we related the phenolic components of this phanerogam to compounds of the table whose bioactivity and antioxidant properties have been previously published.", "paper_title": "Classification of Phenolic Compounds by Chemical Structural Indicators and Its Relation to Antioxidant Properties of Posidonia Oceanica (L.)
