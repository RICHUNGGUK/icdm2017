We also investigate some graded properties of these graded convex fuzzy sets and present the relations between these graded convex fuzzy sets and their topological properties and give several conditions for a fuzzy set to be a graded convex fuzzy set. Finally, we generalize the notion of global maximizer and prove an important property of graded convex fuzzy sets. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
