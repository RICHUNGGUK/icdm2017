This feature is fully exploited to simplify the development of a software platform in a robotic experimental setup for ILC. The software platform has a hierarchical structure that has two levels associated with the two phases of ILC. The low level software is rooted in a digital-si anal-processor card and the high level software is hosted in the PC. This structure makes the experimental setup match the unique requirements of ILC. Moreover, a graphical-user-interface is built for real-time monitoring the results of ILC and for easy human-interaction with the software platform. The experimental setup is verified with a view of learning control in real-time and has served as a general test-bed for ILC laws. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
