Censoring is allowed only at the change-stress point in the final stage. A general log-location-scale lifetime distribution with mean life which is a linear function of stress, along with a cumulative exposure model, is considered as the working model. Under this model, the determination of the optimal choice of for both Weibull and lognormal distributions are addressed using the variance-optimality criterion. Numerical results show that for a general log-location-scale distributions, the optimal k-step-stress ALT model with unequal duration steps reduces just to a 2-level step-stress ALT model.", "paper_title": "Planning step-stress test plans under Type-I censoring for the log-location-scale case", "paper_id": "WOS:000324730900004"}
