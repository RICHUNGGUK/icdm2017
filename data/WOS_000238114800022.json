This set of traffic control strategy is primarily based on a single-server scheduling algorithm called Smoothed Round Robin (SRR). SRR possesses a number of advantages which are very attractive to the implementation of input buffered switch. SRR is on order O(1) which requires minimal computational complexity. Secondly, SRR gives good delay bounds and fairness performance for each session. Thirdly, SRR can decompose a sequence into fixed size groups. In this way, by maintaining a SRR scheduler in each output port, scheduling can be performed in a distributed manner which largely reduces the complexity of the algorithm.", "paper_title": "A distributed QoS scheduler for smoothing output traffic of input buffered switches", "paper_id": "WOS:000238114800022"}
