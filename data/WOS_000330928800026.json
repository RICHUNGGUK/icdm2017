Choosing an AR picture book to introduce its artistic work, this study aimed to explore how children and parents read the book through a series of analyses of behavioral patterns and cognitive attainment. A total of 33 child-parent pairs voluntarily participated in this study. Based on the indicators of the child-parent reading behaviors generated through content analysis, four behavioral patterns of AR picture book reading were identified: parent as dominator, child as dominator, communicative child-parent pair, and low communicative child-parent pair. The relationships between the child-parent reading behaviors and the children's cognitive attainment were further identified. Specifically, the child-parent behaviors of \"parent as dominator\" and \"low communicative child-parent pair\" were likely associated with simple description of the appearance of the artistic work by the children (low-level cognitive attainment). Conversely, the \"child as dominator\" and \"communicative child-parent pair\" behaviors resulted in the children explaining the artistic work they had seen or using their imagination to describe the content of the book (high-level cognitive attainment).
