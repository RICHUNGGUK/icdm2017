A brief review of descriptive Efremovic spaces as well descriptive intersection and union provides a foundation for the study of descriptive admissible covers. Descriptively near sets in admissible covers contain sequences of points with members having similar descriptions. The motivation for this approach stems from the need to consider fine-grained neighbourhoods of points in admissible covers that facilitate highly accurate measures of nearness of tiny parts of sets of objects of interest. A practical application of local admissible covers is given in terms of micropalaeontology and the detection of minute similarities and differences in microfossils, useful in the study of climate change, mineral and fossil fuel exploration.", "paper_title": "Nearness of Sets in Local Admissible Covers.
