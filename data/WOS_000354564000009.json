However, the amount of biomedical data is growing too fast to abstract hidden information. At the same time, with the development of data storage diversification, scientists prefer to have data fusion based on heterogeneous data sources as opposed to a single data source, and ultimately to achieve knowledge and discovery across heterogeneous databases. Our study focuses on extending the application of latent semantic analysis methodologies into the area of biomedical research. Our purpose is to develop a model for discovering potential relationships between medicines and diseases based on biomedical latent semantic analysis. This model could be used in constructing link maps for biomedical entities, and provide a theoretical basis and practical support for biomedical scientists in their study of the disease-medicine relationship. In detail, we discuss the study of the integration of the latent semantic analysis model and data fusion methodologies. Our result fusion solution combines scientific literature repositories and a biomedical database based on context and the ABC model, and is supervised by a semi-supervised learning algorithm and data fusion algorithms. The expectation is that fused data could represent multilevel potential relationships between biological entities and related emotional relationship expression. The model is validated by experience and proven to be feasible and effective.", "paper_title": "The potential relationship discovery model based on result fusion for biomedical medicine research", "paper_id": "WOS:000354564000009"}
