First, this paper focuses on the huge amounts, dynamic, and heterogeneous nature of services in IoT and presents the architecture of cross-layer services platform based on semantics to extend the service source from the common services in registries to the self-organization services in ubiquitous environment, which mainly contains the service management, demand computing, service discovery, and service selection. Then, some of the key foundational models and algorithms are presented, such as IoT service ontology model, semantic-based IoT service description language OWL-S-iot, and service management strategy both in registry mode and self-organization by subcluster. Many large-scale, ubiquitous, and heterogeneous services could be integrated in this platform. It could provide multilevel semantic supports for services to meet the common understanding and interoperability.", "paper_title": "Fractal Cross-Layer Service with Integration and Interaction in Internet of Things", "paper_id": "WOS:000332978300001"}
