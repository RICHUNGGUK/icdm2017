A systematic procedure is proposed to solve this problem. The fuzzy controller can be linearized by the use of classical describing function firstly. By doing so, it is feasible to treat the stability problem of a fuzzy control system as linear one. In order to consider the robustness of a fuzzy vehicle control system, parameter space method and Kharitonov approach are then employed for plotting the stability boundaries. Furthermore, the effect of transport delay is also addressed. More information of limit cycles can be obtained by this approach. This work shows that the limit cycles caused by a static fuzzy controller can be easily suppressed if the system parameters are chosen carefully.", "paper_title": "Describing function analysis of uncertain fuzzy vehicle control systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000301578900016"}
