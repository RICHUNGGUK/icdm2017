The buyers belong to an entity that is operationally more cost efficient than the vendor. We compare vendor-managed inventory (VMI) with integrated production and inventory decision-making to the traditional decentralized setting in which the vendor and the buyers make independent decisions. Specifically for the two-buyer problem, we characterize the optimal solution under VMI which is more cost efficient than literature. For the general multiple-buyer problem, we develop a heuristic to approach decisions under both settings. One surprising finding is that under VMI, the production decision does not involve all operational information of the vendor or the buyers. Numerical results suggest that VMI and just-in-time production are substitutes in improving the efficiency of the distribution network. VMI can be more critical for companies with rigid capacity, seasonally low demand, or complex distribution networks.", "paper_title": "A One-Vendor Multiple-Buyer Production-Distribution System: The Value of Vendor Managed Inventory", "paper_id": "WOS:000371046100002"}
