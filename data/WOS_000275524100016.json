However, research in this area has seldom considered setup times. We introduce a new scheduling model in which job deterioration and learning, and setup times are considered simultaneously. In the proposed model, the actual processing time of a job is defined as a function of the setup and processing times of the jobs already processed and the job's own scheduled position in a sequence. In addition, the setup times are assumed to be proportional to the actual processing times of the already scheduled jobs. We derive polynomial-time optimal solutions for some single-machine problems with or without the presence of certain conditions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
