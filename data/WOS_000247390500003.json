Our system is characterized by the following features: 1) it handles user profiles for personalizing the job search over the Internet; 2) it is based on the Intelligent Agent Technology; and 3) it uses XML for guaranteeing a light, versatile, and standard mechanism for information representation, storing, and exchange. This paper discusses the basic features of the proposed system, presents the results of an experimental study we have carried out for evaluating its performance, and makes a comparison between the proposed system and other e-recruitment systems already presented in the past.", "paper_title": "An XML-based multiagent system for supporting online recruitment services", "paper_id": "WOS:000247390500003"}
