A new approach proposed restructures the Adaptive Decimation algorithm, to a form using only a few simple arithmetic operations, which can be implemented with simple logical circuits. The encoder is practically free from complex numerical computation. Hardware implementation of the proposed algorithm was realized in FPGA. The architecture of the encoder is simple and suitable for applications in the development of low cost non-processor based portable device real time application.", "paper_title": "VLSI Implementation of Computation Efficient Color Image Compression Scheme Based on Adaptive Decimation for Portable Device Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000276185000004"}
