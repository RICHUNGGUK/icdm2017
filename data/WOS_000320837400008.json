In this work, a speech translation statistical system that adds additional other-than-voice information in a voice translation system is presented. The additional information serves as a base for the log-linear combination of several statistical models. We describe the theoretical framework of the problem, summarize the overall architecture of the system, and show how the system is enhanced with the additional information. Our real prototype implements a real-time speech translation system from Spanish to English that is adapted to specific teaching-related environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
