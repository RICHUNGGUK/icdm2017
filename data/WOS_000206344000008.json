Especially in combination with mobile devices these mechanisms are of high value and are used to increase usability tremendously. In this paper, we present common architecture principles of context-aware systems and derive a layered conceptual design framework to explain the different elements common to most context-aware architectures. Based on these design principles, we introduce various existing context-aware systems focusing on context-aware middleware and frameworks, which case the development of context-aware applications. We discuss various approaches and analyse important aspects in context-aware Computing on the basis, of the presented systems.", "paper_title": "A survey on context-aware systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000206344000008"}
