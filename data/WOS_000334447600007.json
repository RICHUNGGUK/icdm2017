Recently, a Kernelized version of Naive-Bayes Nearest-Neighbor (KNBNN) approach has been proposed to combine Nearest-Neighbor-based approaches with other bag-of-feature (BoF) based kernels. However, similar to an orderless BoF image representation, the KNBNN ignores global geometric correspondence. In this paper, our contributions are threefolded. First, we present a technique to exploit the global geometric correspondence in a kernelized NBNN classifier framework. We divide an image into increasingly fine sub-regions like the spatial pyramid matching (SPM) approach; Second, we introduce a pyramid nearest-neighbor kernel by measuring the local similarity in each pyramid window. Third, for better calibrating the outputs of each window, we fit a sigmoid function to add posterior probability to its SVM outputs, and then weight these outputs of all windows. The sigmoid parameters and weight values are learned in a class-dependent and window-dependent manner. By doing so, we learn a class-specific geometric correspondence. Finally, the proposed approach is evaluated on two public datasets: Scene-15 and Caltech-101. We reach 85.2 % recognition rate on Scene-15 and 73.3 % on Caltech-101 only using single descriptor. The experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms existing techniques.", "paper_title": "Kernelized pyramid nearest-neighbor search for object categorization", "paper_id": "WOS:000334447600007"}
