The outage probability function is derived in closed form, and the data rate of each user is also given. We have also presented asymptotic analysis in terms of data rate for MF when the number of users and the number of antennas grow without bounds. The expressions of these analytical results are rather simple and are thus convenient for overall performance evaluation. The simulation results show that the analysis are very accurate.", "paper_title": "Performance Analysis in the High SNR Region for MF in the Downlink of Massive MIMO Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200042"}
