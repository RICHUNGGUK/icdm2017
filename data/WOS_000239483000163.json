By using radial basis function neural networks, these uncertainties can be compensated effectively. This new neural control can resolve the two problems for overhead crane control: 1) decrease steady-state error of normal PD control. 2) guarantee stability via neural compensation. By Lyapunov method and input-to-state stability technique, we prove that these robust controllers with neural compensators are stable. Real-time experiments are presented to show the applicability of the approach presented in this paper.", "paper_title": "PD control of overhead crane systems with neural compensation", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000163"}
