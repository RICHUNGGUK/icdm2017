Design/methodology/approach - The SMS involves scheduling tasks to be performed by a satellite, where new task requests can arrive non-deterministically (i.e. at any time) and must be scheduled in real-time. This paper investigates algorithmic approaches for determining an optimal or near-optimal sequence of tasks, allocated to a satellite payload over time, with dynamic tasking considerations. Findings - Simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient when utilized in actual cases. Originality/value - This paper shows how to adopt the GA search approach to generate an SMS within allowable computation time.", "paper_title": "Satellite mission scheduling based on genetic algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000281928100005"}
