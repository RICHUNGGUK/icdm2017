The eigenvalues are either the smallest or those closest to some specified target, which may be in the interior of the spectrum. The underlying algorithm combines the Jacobi-Davidson method with efficient multilevel incomplete LU (ILU) preconditioning. Key features are modest memory requirements and robust convergence to accurate solutions. Parameters needed for incomplete LU preconditioning are automatically computed and may be updated at run time depending on the convergence pattern. The software is easy to use by non-experts and its top level routines are written in FORTRAN 77. Its potentialities are demonstrated on a few applications taken from computational physics.", "paper_title": "JADAMILU: a software code for computing selected eigenvalues of large sparse symmetric matrices", "paper_id": "WOS:000251481500005"}
