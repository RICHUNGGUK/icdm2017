We explain in detail the working of the quantum carrier for different communication tasks, including quantum key distribution, classical secret and quantum state sharing among a set of n players according to general threshold schemes. The security of the protocol is discussed and it is shown that only the legitimate subsets can retrieve the secret messages, the collaboration of all the parties is needed for the continuous running of the protocol and maintaining the carrier.", "paper_title": "SECURE QUANTUM CARRIERS FOR QUANTUM STATE SHARING", "paper_id": "WOS:000304611000007"}
