This method has great value in drug design. After decades of development, scoring functions nowadays typically can identify the true binding mode, but the prediction of binding affinity still remains a major problem. Here we present CScore, a data-driven scoring function using a modified Cerebellar Model Articulation Controller (CMAC) learning architecture, for accurate binding affinity prediction. The performance of CScore in terms of correlation between predicted and experimental binding affinities is benchmarked under different validation approaches. CScore achieves a prediction with R = 0.7668 and RMSE = 1.4540 when tested on an independent dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this result outperforms other scoring functions tested on the same dataset. The performance of CScore varies on different clusters under the leave-cluster-out validation approach, but still achieves competitive result. Lastly, the target-specified CScore achieves an even better result with R = 0.8237 and RMSE = 1.0872, trained on a much smaller but more relevant dataset for each target. The large dataset of protein-ligand complexes structural information and advances of machine learning techniques enable the data-driven approach in binding affinity prediction. CScore is capable of accurate binding affinity prediction. It is also shown that CScore will perform better if sufficient and relevant data is presented. As there is growth of publicly available structural data, further improvement of this scoring scheme can be expected.", "paper_title": "CSCORE: A SIMPLE YET EFFECTIVE SCORING FUNCTION FOR PROTEIN-LIGAND BINDING AFFINITY PREDICTION USING MODIFIED CMAC LEARNING ARCHITECTURE", "paper_id": "WOS:000299290400002"}
