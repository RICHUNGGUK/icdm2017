But in some practical applications, the determination of membership functions associated with vague concepts is difficult or impossible. This paper builds a reputation computing model based on fuzzy relation and provides a new reputation evaluation approach among vague concepts. The definition of reputation degree computing is given according trust passing and trust combination. The experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reputation comparison among different sellers and various index assessment among products of one seller.", "paper_title": "A Reputation Evaluation Approach Based on Fuzzy Relation", "paper_id": "WOS:000297797300002"}
