Examples of these applications include security and public safety. The Quality of Experience (QoE) concept for video content used for entertainment differs significantly from the QoE of surveillance video used for recognition tasks. This is because, in the latter case, the subjective satisfaction of the user depends on achieving a given functionality. Recognizing the growing importance of video in delivering a range of public safety services, we focused on developing critical quality thresholds in license plate recognition tasks based on videos streamed in constrained networking conditions. Since the number of surveillance cameras is still growing it is obvious that automatic systems will be used to do the tasks. Therefore, the presented research includes also analysis of automatic recognition algorithms.", "paper_title": "Quality assessment for a visual and automatic license plate recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000329243600003"}
