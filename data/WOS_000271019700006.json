In this work, we show an alternative scheme for the quadratic-Gaussian case, which merges source and channel coding. This scheme achieves the optimal performance by applying a modulo-lattice modulation to the analog source. Thus, it saves the complexity of quantization and channel decoding, and remains with the task of \"shaping\" only. Furthermore, for high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the scheme approaches the optimal performance using an SNR-independent encoder, thus it proves for this special case the feasibility of universal joint source-channel coding.", "paper_title": "Joint Wyner-Ziv/Dirty-Paper Coding by Modulo-Lattice Modulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700006"}
