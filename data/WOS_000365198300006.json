The PEPA language allows the compositional description of complex systems consisting of different kinds of processes. The capacity planning addition allows modellers to automatically search for the populations of processes that allows for an optimal trade-off between the performance of the system and the cost of acquiring or operating the components of the system under the modeller's control.", "paper_title": "A Case Study in Capacity Planning for PEPA Models with the PEPA Eclipse Plug-in", "paper_id": "WOS:000365198300006"}
