In order to better understand agricultural drought and make proper decisions, it is necessary to extract drought information out of related data (e.g., remotely sensed data) and discover knowledge from the extracted information. This paper explores advantages of Web services in providing on-demand agricultural drought analysis and facilitating the perception process in agricultural drought management. Four Web services, drawROI, getVCIStats, getDroughtPercentageByStates, and getDroughtTimeSeries, are presented in details in this paper. These Web services demonstrate improved support to drought analysis and decision-making for the general public and illustrate the potential of Web services in automating geospatial knowledge discovery and dissemination in the Big Data era.", "paper_title": "Delivery of agricultural drought information via web services", "paper_id": "WOS:000360693000006"}
