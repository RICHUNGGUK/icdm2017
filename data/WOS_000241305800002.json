We propose modified versions of LZ77 and LZ78 codes for sources with countably infinite alphabets. Then, we show that for any source mu with E-mu[log X-1] < infinity, both codes are asymptotically optimum, i.e. the code length per input symbol approaches its entropy rate with probability one. Further, we show that we can modify LZ77 and LZ78 codes so that both are asymptotically optimal for a family of ergodic sources satisfying Kieffer's condition.", "paper_title": "Asymptotical optimality of two variations of Lempel-Ziv codes for sources with countably infinite alphabet", "paper_id": "WOS:000241305800002"}
