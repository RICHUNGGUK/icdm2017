Those algorithms have no internal regret in the sense that, on the set of stages where the decision maker chose his action according to a given law, the average payoff could not have been improved in average by using any other fixed law. They are based on a generalization of calibration, no longer defined in terms of a Voronoi diagram but instead of a Laguerre diagram (a more general concept). This allows us to bound, for the first time in this general framework, the expected average internal, as well as the usual external, regret at stage n by O(n(-1/3)), which is known to be optimal.", "paper_title": "Internal Regret with Partial Monitoring: Calibration-Based Optimal Algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000293757200004"}
