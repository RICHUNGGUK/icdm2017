Fuzzy theory applied together with PID helps control the buffer queue within the target. This article provides the literature and theoretical background of network congestion problems, active queue management methods, automatic control systems, and fuzzy controllers. Following the discussion of the proposed FPID method and the experimental design, a simulation test is conducted and analyzed in comparison to the existing popular active queue management methods. The results prove the superiority of the proposed method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
