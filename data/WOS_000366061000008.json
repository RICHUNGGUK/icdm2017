Because of the affection of various factors, certain band of HJ-1A hyperspectral remote sensing data is severe loss or distortion, which brings great difficulties for subsequent quantitative processing. A novel adaptive window matching algorithm, which can adjust intelligently size of matching window according to different local feature information of the image, is proposed for HJ-1A satellite hyperspectral data recovery in this paper. The results show that the adaptive matching algorithm has a more superior performance than other algorithms in image quality index, column mean curve, and image correlation coefficient.", "paper_title": "Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Data Recovery Via Adaptive Window Matching Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000366061000008"}
