We present an abstract formulation of the problem and identify the major issues that must be addressed in order to solve this problem. We present and prove the correctness of algorithms that address these issues, and thereby obtain a design for an open real-time environment.", "paper_title": "Resource-Sharing Servers for Open Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000268823700002"}
