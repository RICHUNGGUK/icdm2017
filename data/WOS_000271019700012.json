The optimum second-order transmission rate with a constant error constraint is obtained by using the information spectrum method. We apply this result to the discrete memoryless case, the discrete memoryless case with a cost constraint, the additive Markovian case, and the Gaussian channel case with an energy constraint. We also clarify that the Gallager bound does not give the optimum evaluation in the second-order coding rate.", "paper_title": "Information Spectrum Approach to Second-Order Coding Rate in Channel Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000271019700012"}
