It is important for improving the AFIS's performance to estimate the ridge distance correctly. The paper discusses the representative fingerprint ridge distance estimation algorithms and the performance of these algorithms. The most common fingerprint ridge distance estimation algorithm is based on block-level and estimates the ridge distance by calculating the number of cycle pattern in the block fingerprint image. The traditional Fourier transform spectral analysis method has been also applied to estimate the fingerprint ridge distance. The next kind of method is based on the statistical window. Another novel fingerprint ridge distance estimation method is based on the region-level which regards the region with the consistent orientation as the statistical region. One new method obtains the fingerprint ridge distance from the continuous Fourier spectrum. After discussing the dominant algorithm thought, the paper analyzes the performance of each algorithm.", "paper_title": "Fingerprint ridge distance estimation: Algorithms and the performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000235768300040"}
