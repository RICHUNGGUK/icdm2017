But, this problem has not been considered for the case of interval censoring. In this article, we discuss the estimation of a regression model with current status data when the failure times follow the BS distribution. We estimate the parameters by the method of maximum likelihood, and derive the asymptotic distribution of these estimators. The performance of these estimators is then assessed through Monte Carlo simulations for different sample sizes under two types of monitoring. Finally, an analysis of real data is used to illustrate the proposed method. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
