Information from a protein-ligand complex is utilized to substitute a fragment of the ligand with another fragment from a database of synthetically accessible scaffolds. A GRID-based interaction profile of the receptor and geometrical descriptions of a ligand scaffold are used to obtain new scaffolds with different structural features and are able to replace the original scaffold in the protein-ligand complex. An enrichment study was successfully performed verifying the ability of SHOP to find known active CDK2 scaffolds in a database. Additionally, SHOP was used for suggesting new inhibitors of p38 MAP kinase. Four p38 complexes were used to perform six scaffold searches. Several new scaffolds were suggested, and the resulting compounds were successfully docked into the query proteins.", "paper_title": "SHOP: Receptor-Based Scaffold HOPping by GRID-Based Similarity Searches", "paper_id": "WOS:000264533400014"}
