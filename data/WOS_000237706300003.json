By following the current developments by Guermond and Shen, the possibilities of obtaining accurate pressure and reducing boundary-layer effect for the pressure are analysed. The present study mainly reports the numerical solutions of an unsteady Navier-Stokes problem based on the so-called consistent splitting scheme (J Comput. Phys. 2003; 192:262-276). At the same time the Dirichlet boundary value conditions are considered. The accuracy of the method is carefully examined against the exact solution for an unsteady flow physics problem in a simply connected domain. The effectiveness is illustrated viz. several computations of 2D double lid-driven cavity problems.
