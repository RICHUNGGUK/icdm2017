CAIMAN is accessed through a user-friendly website where researchers can upload their images and the results are returned by email. CAIMAN does not intend to replace more sophisticated software solutions such as ImageJ, Matlab, or commercial packages, but it will provide a first stop where any researcher can upload images and can obtain quantitative results without having to do any programming at all.
