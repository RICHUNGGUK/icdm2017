In this paper we identify eight key issues to be considered for an effective and practical reuse-based RE process. The issues are the result of the research on the subject and the experience of the authors in defining and applying a reuse based RE method. Analysis of some of the most popular current CARE (Computer Aided Requirements Engineering) tools has revealed a lack of automated support for these features and, to fill this gap, a practical technical solution is provided. The key issues have been validated in the context of a real case study.", "paper_title": "Eight key issues for an effective reuse-based requirements process", "paper_id": "WOS:000264124400002"}
