In this paper, we propose a Domain Administration of RBAC Model, DARBAC, which defines an administrative domain for each administrative role. The administrative role can execute administrative operations on the users, roles, objects and child administrative roles within its administrative domain. Then we use pi-calculus to formalize the elements of DARBAC model and their interactions. Although pi-calculus has been successfully used in many security areas such as protocol analysis and information flow analysis, as we have known, our approach is the first attempt to use pi-calculus to formalize RBAC and its administrative model.", "paper_title": "Using pi-calculus to formalize domain administration of RBAC", "paper_id": "WOS:000237227700026"}
