Incomplete observation of the state space is a desirable feature in such a framework, but it quickly leads to undecidable verification problems. In this paper, we prove that uniform incomplete observation (where all players have the same observation) preserves decidability of the model checking problem, even for very expressive logics such as ATL(sc).", "paper_title": "ATL(sc) with partial observation", "paper_id": "WOS:000367344400004"}
