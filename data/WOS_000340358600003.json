However, many dictionary learning models exploit only the discriminative information in either the representation coefficients or the representation residual, which limits their performance. In this paper we present a novel dictionary learning method based on the Fisher discrimination criterion. A structured dictionary, whose atoms have correspondences to the subject class labels, is learned, with which not only the representation residual can be used to distinguish different classes, but also the representation coefficients have small within-class scatter and big between-class scatter. The classification scheme associated with the proposed Fisher discrimination dictionary learning (FDDL) model is consequently presented by exploiting the discriminative information in both the representation residual and the representation coefficients. The proposed FDDL model is extensively evaluated on various image datasets, and it shows superior performance to many state-of-the-art dictionary learning methods in a variety of classification tasks.", "paper_title": "Sparse Representation Based Fisher Discrimination Dictionary Learning for Image Classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000340358600003"}
