Most systems make various assumptions about the dependencies between state variables, and especially about how these dependencies change as a result of actions. Building on a general framework by Bacchus, Halpern and Levesque for reasoning about degrees of belief in the situation calculus, and a recent extension to it for continuous probability distributions, in this paper we illustrate location estimation in the presence of a rich theory of actions using examples. The formalism also allows specifications with incomplete knowledge and strict uncertainty, as a result of which the agent's initial beliefs need not be characterized by a unique probability distribution. Finally, we show that while actions might affect prior distributions in nonstandard ways, suitable posterior beliefs are nonetheless entailed as a side-effect of the overall specification.
