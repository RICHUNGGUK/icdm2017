When these assumptions are unreasonable, the tracker may fail. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel online sample based framework, inspired by the fact that the corresponding local parts of objects in sequential frames are always similar in the local color and texture features and spatial features relative to the centers of objects. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed approach works robustly under difficult and complex conditions. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
