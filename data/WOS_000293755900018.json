The approach considers the statistical distributions of gate length and silicon thickness and their corresponding statistical correlations due to process variations. In this method, a back-gate voltage is used as the optimization knob. With the help of particle swarm optimization (PSO), the back-gate voltages that maximize the yield of the SRAM array against read, write, and access time failures are found. It will be shown that, with this method, a very high yield is achieved.", "paper_title": "Statistical Design Optimization of FinFET SRAM Using Back-Gate Voltage", "paper_id": "WOS:000293755900018"}
