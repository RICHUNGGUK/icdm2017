It aims at producing a group average from these Euclidean similarity transformations followed by bi-linear approximation of this group average for graphical inspection. An extension that allows for anisotropic scaling (i.e. different scaling of different dimensions) is proposed. This method is illustrated using two real data sets from sensory analysis.
