Grammars are used to provide a structure to guide the application of transformations. Agile parsing is a technique in which grammars are adapted on a transformation by transformation basis to simplify transformation tasks. This paper gives an overview of agile parsing techniques, and how they may be applied to Web Applications. We give examples from several transformations that have been used in the Web application domain.", "paper_title": "Agile parsing to transform Web applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241630000011"}
