They also enable to define anti-extensive filtering procedures for such images. In order to extend this image processing approach to any (grey-level or multivalued) images, both the notion of component-tree, and its associated filtering framework, have to be generalised. In this article we deal with the generalisation of the component-tree structure. We define a new data structure, the component-graph, which extends the notion of component-tree to images taking their values in any (partially or totally) ordered set. The component-graphs are declined in three variants, of increasing richness and size, whose structural properties are studied.", "paper_title": "Component-Trees and Multivalued Images: Structural Properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000333339000003"}
