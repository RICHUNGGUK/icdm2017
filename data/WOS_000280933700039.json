To solve the occlusion problem, we have developed a combined tracking system based on optical flow and adaptive filters. The critical point of the system is the coupling between optical flow and predictive algorithms. This coupling is governed by parameters such as tolerance, the absolute value of the difference between the value of velocity calculated by the optical flow and the estimated value. In this paper, we propose the use of a fuzzy control system to solve this coupling problem between the different velocities. This technique will provide great robustness to the tracking algorithm.
