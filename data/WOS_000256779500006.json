The uncitedness factor (UF) is defined as the fraction of the articles that received no citations. It is intuitively clear that IF should be a decreasing function of UF. This is confirmed by the results in [VAN LEEUWEN & MOED, 2005] but all the given examples show a typical shape, seldom seen in informetrics: a horizontal S-shape (first convex then concave). Adopting a simple model for the publication-citation relation, we prove this horizontal S-shape in this paper, showing that such a general functional relationship can be generally explained.", "paper_title": "The mathematical relation between the impact factor and the uncitedness factor", "paper_id": "WOS:000256779500006"}
