An obvious drawback of previous decision models is their lack in considering the supply chain network. This article proposes a new global S&OP planning framework to integrate four supply chain stages of demand, purchasing, production and transportation with different planning strategies. Model applicability is tested by a real life case. Several simulation scenarios are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model and heuristics. This study adopts the integrated method as a decision support tool, thereby enhancing coordination between financial and physical activities.", "paper_title": "Advanced sales and operations planning framework in a company supply chain", "paper_id": "WOS:000301920600003"}
