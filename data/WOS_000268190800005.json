From market perspective, such objects are favored as pareto-optimal choices, as each of such objects has at least one competitive edge against all other objects, or not dominated. In other words, non-skyline objects have room for pareto-optimal improvements for more favorable positioning in the market. The goal of this paper is, for such non-skyline objects, to identify the cost-minimal pareto-optimal improvement strategy. More specifically, we abstract this problem as a mixed integer programming problem and develop a novel algorithm for efficiently identifying the optimal solution. In addition, the problem can be reversed to identify, for a skyline product, top-k threats that can be competitors after pareto-optimal improvements with the k lowest costs. Through extensive experiments using synthetic and real-life datasets, we show that our proposed framework is both efficient and scalable.", "paper_title": "Ranking strategies and threats: a cost-based pareto optimization approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000268190800005"}
