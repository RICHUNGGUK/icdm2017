The proposed process can be plugged into various software development processes and service-oriented methodologies due to its explicitly defined inputs and outputs. To this aim, the proposed SAP is integrated with the service-oriented modeling and application (SOMA) methodology in a two-layered structure to create a novel methodology, named self-adaptive service-oriented architecture methodology (SASOAM), which provides a semi-automatic self-aware method by the composition of architectural tactics. Moreover, the maintenance activity of SOMA is improved using architectural and adaptive patterns, which results in controlling the software architecture quality. The improvement in the maintainability of SOMA is demonstrated by an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) based evaluation method. Furthermore, the proposed method is applied to a case study to represent the feasibility and practicality of SASOAM.", "paper_title": "Towards a self-adaptive service-oriented methodology based on extended SOMA", "paper_id": "WOS:000350792100004"}
