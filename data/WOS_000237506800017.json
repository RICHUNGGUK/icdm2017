We analyze the properties of constitutive norms, in particular their lack of reflexivity, and the trade-off between constitutive and regulative norms in the design of normative systems. As methodology we use the metaphor of describing social entities as agents and of attributing them mental attitudes. In this agent metaphor, regulative norms expressing obligations and permissions are modelled as goals of social entities, and constitutive norms expressing \"counts-as\" relations are their beliefs.", "paper_title": "Constitutive norms in the design of normative multiagent systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000237506800017"}
