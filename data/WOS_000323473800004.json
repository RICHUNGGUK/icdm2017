With the proper construction of subspaces based on the knowledge of the boundary deformation, we can use the Lagrange multiplier technique to impose coupling constraints at the boundary without overconstraining. In our deformation algorithm, the number of constraint equations to couple two neighboring domains is not related to the number of the nodes on the boundary but is the same as the number of the selected boundary deformation modes. The crack artifact is not present in our simulation result, and the domain decomposition with loops can be easily handled. Experimental results show that the single-core implementation of our algorithm can achieve real-time performance in simulating deformable objects with around quarter million tetrahedral elements.", "paper_title": "Boundary-Aware Multidomain Subspace Deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000323473800004"}
