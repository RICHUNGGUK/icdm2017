This paper proposes and implements a UDP-based state-sharing mechanism of SIP transaction stateful proxy. Based on heavy stress testing, experimental reliability figure is shown. By mathematical analysis and derivation, we proved the proposed relationship equation of T-out and reliability R. Experiments showed that the results of the theoretical analysis can reflect the real performance of the system, and that the theoretical and practical T-out breakpoint value is consistent.", "paper_title": "A UDP-based state-sharing mechanism of SIP transaction stateful proxy", "paper_id": "WOS:000240084000039"}
