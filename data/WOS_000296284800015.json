We show a reduction from fine approximation of simple stochastic games to coarse approximation of a polynomial sized game, which can be viewed as an evidence showing the hardness to approximate the value of simple stochastic games. We also present a randomized algorithm that runs in (O) over tilde(root|V(R)|!) time, where |V(R)| is the number of RANDOM vertices and (O) over tilde ignores polynomial terms. This algorithm is the fastest known algorithm when |V(R)| = omega(log n) and |V(R)| = o(root min|V(min)|, |V(max)|) and it works for general (non-stopping) simple stochastic games.", "paper_title": "Another Sub-exponential Algorithm for the Simple Stochastic Game", "paper_id": "WOS:000296284800015"}
