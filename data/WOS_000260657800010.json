In fact, the implementation of efficient and accurate new numerical techniques to solve the PBE is necessary. The direct quadrature method of moments, known as DQMOM, is a moment-based method that uses an optimal adaptive quadrature closure and came into view as a promising choice for this implementation. In the present work, DQMOM was implemented in two CFD packages: the commercial ANSYS CFX, through FORTRAN subroutines, and the open-source OpenFOAM, by directly coding the PBE solution. Transient zero-dimensional and steady one-dimensional simulations were performed in order to explore the PBE solution accuracy using several interpolation schemes. Simulation cases with dominant breakage, dominant aggregation and invariant solution (equivalent breakage and aggregation) were simulated and validated against an analytical solution. The solution of the population balance equation was then coupled to the two-fluid model, considering that all particles classes share the same velocity field. Momentum exchange terms were evaluated using the local instantaneous Sauter mean diameter of the size distribution function. The two-dimensional tests were performed in a backward facing step geometry where the vortex zones traps the particles and provides high rates of breakage and aggregation. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
