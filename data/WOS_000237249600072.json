Existing methods loose the correlations among attributes by transforming the different attributes independently, or cannot guarantee the minimum abstraction level required by legal policies. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving transformation framework for distance-based mining operations based on the concept of privacy-preserving MicroClusters that satisfy a privacy constraint as well as a significance constraint. Our framework well extends the robustness of the state-of-the-art k-anonymity model by introducing a privacy constraint (minimum radius) while keeping its effectiveness by a significance constraint (minimum number of corresponding data records). The privacy-preserving MicroClusters are made public for data mining purposes, but the original data records are kept private. We present efficient methods for generating and maintaining privacy-preserving MicroClusters and show that data mining operations such as clustering can easily be adapted to the public data represented by MicroClusters instead of the private data records. The experiment demonstrates that the proposed methods achieve accurate clusterings results while preserving the privacy.", "paper_title": "On robust and effective K-anonymity in large databases", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600072"}
