However, privacy concerns are still among the key challenges that keep hampering DaaS composition. Indeed, services may follow different, conflicting privacy specifications with respect to the data they use and provide. In this paper, we propose an approach for the privacy-aware composition of DaaS services. Our approach allows us to specify privacy requirements and policies and verify the compatibility of services involved in a composition. We propose an adaptation protocol that makes it possible to reconcile the privacy specifications of services when incompatibilities arise in a composition. We validate the applicability of our proposal through a set of experiments.", "paper_title": "How to Enhance Privacy Within DaaS Service Composition?", "paper_id": "WOS:000321641800010"}
