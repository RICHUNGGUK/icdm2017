To do this the technique carries out a training that takes into account knowledge of previous system misunderstandings. The correction is transparent for the user as he is not aware of some mistakes made by the speech recogniser and thus interaction with the system can proceed more naturally. Experiments have been carried out using two spoken dialogue systems previously developed in our lab: Saplen and Viajero, which employ prompt-dependent and prompt-independent language models for speech recognition. The results obtained from 10,000 simulated dialogues show that the technique improves the performance of the two systems for both kinds of language modelling, especially for the prompt-independent language model. Using this type of model the Saplen system increases sentence understanding by 19.54%, task completion by 26.25%, word accuracy by 7.53%, and implicit recovery of speech recognition errors by 20.3%, whereas for the Viajero system these figures increase by 14.93%, 18.06%, 6.98% and 15.63%, respectively.
