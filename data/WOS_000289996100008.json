We propose a massively parallel, sort-based construction algorithm and show that the two-level grid is one of the structures that is fastest to construct on modern graphics processors. The structure handles non-uniform primitive distributions more robustly than the uniform grid and its traversal performance is comparable to those of other high quality acceleration structures used for dynamic scenes. We propose a cost model to determine the grid resolution and improve SIMD utilization during ray-triangle intersection by employing a hybrid packetization strategy. The build times and ray traversal acceleration provide overall rendering performance superior to previous approaches for real time rendering of animated scenes on GPUs.", "paper_title": "Two-Level Grids for Ray Tracing on GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000289996100008"}
