This paper presents a design tool for synthesis of optimal grid structures, using a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm to vary rod directions over the surface in response to two or more load cases. A process of grid homogenization allows the tool to be rapidly applied to any grid structure consisting of a repeating unit cell, including quadrilateral, triangular and double layer grids. Two case studies are presented to illustrate the successful execution of the optimization procedure.", "paper_title": "Multi-objective optimization of free-form grid structures", "paper_id": "WOS:000272178500017"}
