In this paper, we considered the problem of secret image sharing with the weighted threshold access structure, which means different participants can have different status and significance. With this approach, each shadow image has one weight, and the secret image can be reconstructed losslessly if, and only if, the sum of all of the shadow images' weights is no less than the given weight threshold. In our scheme, we constructed the weighted threshold access structure of shadow images using the weighted threshold secret sharing scheme. Then, we used the quantization operation to embed the secret image's information into a host image to generate shadow images with different weights. In the retrieving procedure, a set of shadow images that satisfied the weighted threshold was utilized to restore the distortion-free secret image. Our experimental results confirmed that the proposed scheme was feasible, and both the visual quality of the shadow images and the embedding capacity of the host images were satisfactory.
