We describe Compact Normal Forms, an API that allows programmers to explicitly place immutable heap objects into regions, which can both be accessed like ordinary data as well as efficiently transmitted over the network. The process of placing objects into compact regions (essentially a copy) is faster than any serializer and can be amortized over a series of functional updates to the data structure in question. We implement this scheme in the Glasgow Haskell Compiler and show that even with the space expansion attendant with memory-oriented data structure representations, we achieve between x2 and x4 speedups on fast local networks with sufficiently large data structures.", "paper_title": "Efficient Communication and Collection with Compact Normal Forms", "paper_id": "WOS:000367255800032"}
