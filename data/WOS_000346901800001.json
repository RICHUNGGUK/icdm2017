In the proposed algorithm, the interval-valued weights are first constructed by synergy of the ReliefF algorithm and the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method, and then they are transformed into a constraint condition associating with each weight variable in the weighted clustering objective function. In the sequence, the weighted clustering objective function is solved by combining the Lagrange multiplier method with the gradient-based iteration computation. In the whole process of algorithm iteration, a compulsion strategy with human-computer cooperation is adopted to ensure each weight variable satisfies interval constraint itself. Three well-known data set are used to perform profound experiments. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed algorithm has better clustering performance than other the weighted fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm.
