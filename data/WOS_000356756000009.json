Trimble SketchUp (formerly Google SketchUp and hereinafter simply SketchUp) can be used by educators as a comprehensive geological teaching tool to model the complex processes, stages of formation, and key features of a volcanic region. This study outlines the constraints and considerations which must be taken into account when developing a virtual geological representation, the procedure of creating a model of the observed geology using SketchUp, and the methods through which educators can convey the embedded information at various academic levels. In developing a geological model, an understanding of the physical processes within the formation and degradation of geological features is integral. This understanding requires field observations, measurements and supportive analysis. A hypothetical model (informed and constrained by geological information) is then formulated and visualized using the 3D SketchUp environment. By using the framework of SketchUp, a full spectrum interactive geologically accurate model of the formation can be visualized and interacted with via geospatial layers, enabling an understanding of intrusive, eruptive, and erosional processes.
