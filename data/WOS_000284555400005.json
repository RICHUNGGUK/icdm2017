Let d(i) be the degree of vertex v(i) for i = 1, 2,..., n. In [1], Vukicevic et al. defined a new topological index, named \"geometric-arithmetic index\" of a graph G, denoted by CA(G) and is defined by GA(G) = Sigma(vivj is an element of E(G)) 2 root d(i) d(j) / d(i) + d(j) In this paper we obtain the lower and upper bounds on GA(G) of a connected graph and characterize graphs for which these bounds are best possible. Moreover, we give Nordhaus-Gaddum-type results for GA(G) of the graph and its complement, and characterize extremal graphs.", "paper_title": "On Geometric-Arithmetic Index of Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000284555400005"}
