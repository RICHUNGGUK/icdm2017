In a strong designated verifier signature scheme, no third party can even verify the validity of a designated verifier signature, since the designated verifier's private key is required in the verifying phase. Firstly, this paper proposes the model of identity-based strong designated verifier signature scheme based on bilinear pairings by combining identity-based cryptosystem with the designated verifier signature scheme, and then, provides one concrete strong identity-based designated verifier signature scheme, which has short size of signature, low communication and computational cost. We provide security proofs for our scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
