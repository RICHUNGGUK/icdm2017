However, it is not enough to limit the gradient of the size function to generate a mesh that correctly preserves the prescribed element size. To address this issue, in this work we define a criterion to assess when an element reproduces a size field. Then, using this criterion, we develop a novel technique to modify the initial size function by solving a non-linear equation. The new size function ensures that the elements will preserve the original size function. Moreover, an approximated method is developed to improve the computational cost of solving the non-linear equation. We use these techniques in two applications. First, we show that we can reduce the number of iterations to converge an adaptive process. Second, we show that quadrilateral and hexahedral meshing algorithms benefit from the new size function since it is not needed to perform a refining process to capture the initial size function.
