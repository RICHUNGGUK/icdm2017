The existence and uniqueness of periodic solutions of the neural networks are investigated by using Gaines and Mawhin's continuation theorem of coincidence degree theory in the paper. Moreover, criterions on asymptotic stability and exponential stability of periodic solutions of the neural networks are obtained by using matrix function inequality, and algorithms for the criterions on the neural networks are provided. Some of the results in the paper generalize and improve the results in the existing references. In the end, an illustrate example is given to verify our results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
