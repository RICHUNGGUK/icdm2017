Most of the current approaches identify the meaningful results of a given keyword query based on the semantics of lowest common ancestor (LCA) and its variants. However, given the fact that LCA candidates are usually numerous and of low relevance to the users' information need, how to effectively and efficiently identify the most relevant results from a large number of LCA candidates is still a challenging and unresolved issue. In this article, we introduce a novel semantics of relevant results based on mutual information between the query keywords. Then, we introduce a novel approach for identifying the relevant answers of a given query by adopting skyline semantics. We also recommend three different ranking criteria for selecting the top-k relevant results of the query. Efficient algorithms are proposed which rely on some provable properties of the dominance relationship between result candidates to rapidly identify the top-k dominant results. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate our approach and the results show that the proposed approach has a good performance compared with other existing approaches in different data sets and evaluation metrics.", "paper_title": "Top-k answers for XML keyword queries", "paper_id": "WOS:000307722700002"}
