The ability to pre-account for unknown operating environments is an important task for the controller to be robust. In contrast, biological controllers are model free and are based on simple working principles. Due to natural biological principles these controllers are adaptive and more robust than their conventional counterparts. In this paper, a behaviour-based controller has been developed, inspired by the concept of spinal fields found in frogs and rats. The performance of the controller has been verified on a Khepera robot platform.", "paper_title": "Bio-inspired behaviour-based control", "paper_id": "WOS:000260683800005"}
