The filter comprises stepped impedance resonators that are interconnected to each other at strategic points on the resonator for optimal 3 dB roll-off and high rejection over a wide stop-band. The fabricated third-order filter exhibits a steep 3 dB roll-off and rejection exceeding 50 dB over the frequency range 2.70-6.19 GHz. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
