The basic idea behind EOSAT is to generalize the evolutionary probability distribution in the Bose-Einstein-EO (BE-EO) algorithm, competing with other popular algorithms such as simulated annealing and WALKSAT. Experimental results on the hard MAXSAT instances from SATLIB show that the modified algorithms are superior to the original BE-EO algorithm.", "paper_title": "Modified extremal optimization for the hard maximum satisfiability problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000292309400007"}
