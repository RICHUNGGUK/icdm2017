Empirical studies identify improvements in decision processes and outcomes with the use of such knowledge-based systems. This research suggests that though a KBS is primarily developed to help users in their decision-making activities, as an unintentional consequence, it may induce them to implicitly learn more about a problem. Implicit learning occurs when a person learns unconsciously or unintentionally, without being explicitly instructed or tutored. To test these ideas, a laboratory-based experiment was conducted with a KBS that could provide support for data modeling activities. Results indicated support for implicit learning because subjects who interacted with the KBS exhibited better knowledge on data modeling concepts than those who did not interact with the KBS. Two versions of the KBS were tested, one with a restrictive interface and the other with a guidance interface, and both versions of the interface supported implicit learning. Implications for future research on the design and development of KBSs are proposed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
