The global calculus, which originates from a Web service description language (W3C WS-CDL), describes an interaction scenario from a vantage viewpoint; the end-point calculus, an applied typed p-calculus, precisely identifies a local behavior of each participant. We explore a theory of end-point projection, by which we can map a global description to its end-point counterparts preserving types and dynamics. Three principles of well-structured description and the type structures play a fundamental role in the theory.", "paper_title": "Structured Communication-Centered Programming for Web Services", "paper_id": "WOS:000305977300002"}
