It is a new aggregation operator that uses the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted average (IFWA) and the induced intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (I-IFOWA) operator in the same formulation. We study some of its main properties and we have seen that it has a lot of particular cases such as the 1FWA and the intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging (IFOWA) operator. We also study its applicability in a decision-making problem concerning strategic selection of investments. We see that depending on the particular type of I-IFOWAWA operator used, the results may lead to different decisions.", "paper_title": "Induced intuitionistic fuzzy ordered weighted averaging - weighted average operator and its application to business decision-making", "paper_id": "WOS:000340077000023"}
