In this paper, we investigate the synthesis of Petri nets which use special connections between transitions and places. Along these a/sync connections tokens can be transferred instantaneously between transitions executed in a single step. We show that for Place/Transition nets with a/sync connections the synthesis problem can be treated within the general approach based on regions of step transition systems. We also show that the problem is decidable for finite transition systems, and outline a suitable construction algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
