Rev. A 88 (2013) 010101 and investigate the flow of information induced in a Coulomb crystal in presence of thermal noise. For several temperatures we calculate the non-Markovian character of Ramsey interferometry of a single 1/2 spin with the motional degrees of freedom of the whole chain. These results give a more realistic picture of the interplay between temperature, non-Markovianity and criticality.", "paper_title": "Effect of temperature on non-Markovian dynamics in Coulomb crystals", "paper_id": "WOS:000337807900007"}
