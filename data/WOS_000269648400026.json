The proposed method estimates the correlation between two areas, which respectively correspond to a missing area and its neighboring area, from known parts within the target image and realizes reconstruction of the missing texture. In order to obtain this correlation, the kernel CCA is applied to each cluster containing the same kind of textures, and the optimal result is selected for the target missing area. Specifically, a new approach monitoring errors caused in the above kernel CCA-based reconstruction process enables selection of the optimal result. This approach provides a solution to the problem in traditional methods of not being able to perform adaptive reconstruction of the target textures due to missing intensities. Consequently, all of the missing textures are successfully estimated by the optimal cluster's correlation, which provides accurate reconstruction of the same kinds of textures. In addition, the proposed method can obtain the correlation more accurately than our previous works, and more successful reconstruction performance can be expected. Experimental results show impressive improvement of the proposed reconstruction technique over previously reported reconstruction techniques.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Missing Texture Reconstruction Method Based on Kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis with a New Clustering Scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000269648400026"}
