Its cardinality is denoted by beta(G). We show that a simple Eulerian digraph with n vertices and m arcs has beta(G) >= m(2)/2n(2) + m/2n, and this bound is optimal for infinitely many m, n. Using this result we prove that a simple Eulerian digraph contains a cycle of length at most 6n(2)/m, and has an Eulerian subgraph with minimum degree at least m(2)/24n(3). Both estimates are tight up to a constant factor. Finally, motivated by a conjecture of Bollobas and Scott, we also show how to find long cycles in Eulerian digraphs.", "paper_title": "Large Feedback Arc Sets, High Minimum Degree Subgraphs, and Long Cycles in Eulerian Digraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000325645400003"}
