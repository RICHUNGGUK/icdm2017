We have been focusing on the construction of a \"NEST Competitive Intelligence'' methodology that blends bibliometric and text mining methods to explore key technological system components, current R&D emphases, and key players for a particular NEST. This paper emphasizes the semantic TRIZ approach as a useful tool to process \"Term Clumping'' results to retrieve \"problem & solution (P&S)'' patterns, and apply them to technology roadmapping. We attempt to extend our approach into NEST Competitive Intelligence studies by using both inductive and purposive bibliometric approaches. Finally, an empirical study for dye-sensitized solar cells is used to demonstrate these analyses.", "paper_title": "How to combine term clumping and technology roadmapping for newly emerging science & technology competitive intelligence: \"problem & solution'' pattern based semantic TRIZ tool and case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000343609900028"}
