These techniques are generally heavily based on efficient incremental calculation schemes aimed at avoiding unnecessary computations. In a very recent and extensive experimental evaluation, Low Resolution Pruning turned out to be in most cases the best performing approach. In this paper we propose a computational analysis of several incremental techniques specifically designed to enhance the efficiency of LRP. In addition, we propose a novel LRP algorithm aimed at minimizing the theoretical number of operations by adaptively exploiting different incremental approaches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal by means of experimental evaluation on a large dataset. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
