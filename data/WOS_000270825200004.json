In the context of supervised sequential learning, the Viterbi algorithm plays a fundamental role, by allowing the evaluation of the best (most probable) sequence of labels with a time complexity linear in the number of time events, and quadratic in the number of labels. In this paper we propose CarpeDiem, a novel algorithm allowing the evaluation of the best possible sequence of labels with a sub-quadratic time complexity. 1 We provide theoretical grounding together with solid empirical results supporting two chief facts. CarpeDiem always finds the optimal solution requiring, in most cases, only a small fraction of the time taken by the Viterbi algorithm; meantime, CarpeDiem is never asymptotically worse than the Viterbi algorithm, thus confirming it as a sound replacement.", "paper_title": "CarpeDiem: Optimizing the Viterbi Algorithm and Applications to Supervised Sequential Learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000270825200004"}
