The proposed modulator can convert a wide range of frequency, 500 MHz to 2.6 GHz, into an IF as low as 20 MHz by using under-sampling. Design issues in excess loop delay, linearity, and high frequency operation are discussed and some circuit solutions are proposed for a continuous-time modulator. Simulation and experimental results obtained using CMOS 0.13 mu m IBM technology are presented and discussed. Total power consumption is 37.2 mW when the voltage supply is 1.2 V.
