We introduce the notion of a priori selection of partner hosts to reduce the likelihood of disconnection during such interactions. An application may specify the times when and the physical locations where it requires interactions with peer applications on partner hosts. A knowledge base of the physical motion profiles of various hosts maintained on each mobile host is used to select partner hosts that are co- located with the reference host at the required time and are least likely to disconnect. In this paper, we present a formal model for such knowledge management, along with an algorithm used to determine suitable partner hosts. We also provide details of our implementation of partner selection, which has been used in the context of a service- oriented computing middleware for MANETs, developed previously by our group. Finally, we present simulation results of our approach.", "paper_title": "Knowledge-driven interactions across mobile ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000250860400007"}
