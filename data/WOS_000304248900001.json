Such systems may find application in surveillance and telepresence systems that require a large field of view and high resolution at selected locations. Although image registration has been studied in more conventional applications, the problem of registering panoramic and conventional video has not previously been addressed, and this problem presents unique challenges due to (i) the extreme differences in resolution between the sensors (more than a 16: 1 linear resolution ratio in our application), and (ii) the resolution inhomogeneity of panoramic images. The main contributions of this article are as follows. First, we introduce our foveated panoramic sensor design. Second, we show how a coarse registration can be computed from the raw images using parametric template matching techniques. Third, we propose two refinement methods allowing automatic and near real-time registration between the two image streams. The first registration method is based on matching extracted interest points using a closed form method. The second registration method is featureless and based on minimizing the intensity discrepancy allowing the direct recovery of both the geometric and the photometric transforms. Fourth, a comparison between the two registration methods is carried out, which shows that the featureless method is superior in accuracy. Registration examples using the developed methods are presented.", "paper_title": "Image Registration for Foveated Panoramic Sensing", "paper_id": "WOS:000304248900001"}
