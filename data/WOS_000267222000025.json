Frequency hopping sequences are needed in frequency hopping code-division multiple-access (FH-CDMA) systems. In this paper, four algebraic and a combinatorial constructions of optimal sets of frequency hopping sequences with new parameters are presented, and a number of bounds on sets of frequency hopping sequences are described.", "paper_title": "Sets of Frequency Hopping Sequences: Bounds and Optimal Constructions", "paper_id": "WOS:000267222000025"}
