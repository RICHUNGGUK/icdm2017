It is found that compared with the more Popular fifth-order polynomial fit of the interface values, a piecewise quadratic reconstruction of the solution with more accurate slope and curvature, especially those computed by compact difference schemes, is much less dissipative. Therefore, further given in the paper is a general framework to make a piecewise quadratic reconstruction free Of numerical oscillations around the shocks. The improved accuracy and robustness of the resulting Godunov-type schemes for simulation of vortex-dominated flows are demonstrated with the numerical results of several carefully selected cases, including vortex convection and shock-vortex interaction.
