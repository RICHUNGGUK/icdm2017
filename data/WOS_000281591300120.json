Probability reasoning is a method to deal with uncertain or incomplete information, and Bayesian network is a tool that brings it into the real world application. A novel approach for constructing the Bayesian network structure on the basis of a bond graph model is proposed. Specification of prior and conditional probability distributions (CPDs) for the Bayesian network can be completed by expert knowledge and learning from historical data. The resulting Bayesian network is then applied for diagnosing faulty components from physical systems. The performance of the proposed fault diagnosis scheme based on bond graph derived Bayesian network is demonstrated through simulation studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
