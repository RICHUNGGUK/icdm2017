Previous models for bone remodelling calculations have been based on the state of stress, strain or energy density of the bone tissue as the stimulus for remodelling. We believe that there is experimental support for an additional pathway where an increase in the amount of the cells directly involved in bone removal, the osteoclasts, is caused by fluid pressure, flow velocity or other parameters related to fluid flow at the bone-soft tissue interface, resulting in bone resorption.", "paper_title": "Fluid-induced osteolysis: modelling and experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000288951800001"}
