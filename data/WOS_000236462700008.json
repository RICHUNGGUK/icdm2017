Simple specific polyphonic reduction algorithms, such as note-stealing, may lose or interrupt important musical information. Therefore, we present a phrase-stealing algorithm that drops the perceptually least important notes and preserves the most important phrases. Tests show that listeners reacted positively to this solution.", "paper_title": "MIDI to SP-MIDI transcoding using phrase stealing", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462700008"}
