Virtualization technology makes it easy to move running application across physical machines. In this paper, we present an approach that uses virtualization technology to allocate data center resources dynamically based on application demands and support green computing by optimizing the number of servers actively used. We abstract this as a variant of the relaxed on-line bin packing problem and develop a practical, efficient algorithm that works well in a real system. We adjust the resources available to each VM both within and across physical servers. Extensive simulation and experiment results demonstrate that our system achieves good performance compared to the existing work.", "paper_title": "Adaptive Resource Provisioning for the Cloud Using Online Bin Packing", "paper_id": "WOS:000343887700002"}
