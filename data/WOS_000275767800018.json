In this paper, we propose an innovative approach to measure the correlation for variables when the data are in the form of intervals Such the correlation coefficient interval will be called the fuzzy correlation coefficient Finally two empirical studies are given to compare the traditional correlation coefficient and the fuzzy correlation coefficient measurement in the perception measurement", "paper_title": "AN INNOVATIVE APPROACH ON FUZZY CORRELATION COEFFICIENT WITH INTERVAL DATA", "paper_id": "WOS:000275767800018"}
