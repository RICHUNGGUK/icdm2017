The problem is known to be PSPACE-complete for k >= 3, and polynomial solvable for k <= 2 (Gopalan et al., 2009) [6]. We show that CONNkSAT for k >= 3 is solvable in time O((2 - epsilon(k))(n)) for some constant epsilon(k) > 0, where epsilon(k) depends only on k, but not on n. This result is considered to be interesting due to the following fact shown by Calabro [5]: QBF-3-SAT, which is a typical PSPACE-complete problem, is not solvable in time O((2 - epsilon)(n)) for any constant epsilon > 0, provided that the SAT problem (with no restriction to the clause length) is not solvable in time O((2 - epsilon)(n)) for any constant epsilon > 0.
