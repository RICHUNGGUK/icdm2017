Most existing schemes however assume either the pre-setup for shared secrets between communication entities or the use of public-key infrastructure. These requirements limit the use of the schemes. In this paper, we describe new techniques for protecting the privacy and security of communication entities at wireless link-layer level. Our techniques have a number of crucial advantages. They mitigate the requirement of a key setup or a public-key infrastructure. They provide not only the link-layer privacy, but also the required security properties, including key compromise impersonation resilience, impersonation resistance and forward secrecy. They are simple and relatively fast. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
