Unfortunately, not all the clustering solutions in the ensemble contribute to the final result. In this paper, we focus on the clustering solution selection strategy in the cluster ensemble, and propose to view clustering solutions as features such that suitable feature selection techniques can be used to perform clustering solution selection. Furthermore, a hybrid clustering solution selection strategy (HCSS) is designed based on a proposed weighting function, which combines several feature selection techniques for the refinement of clustering solutions in the ensemble. Finally, a new measure is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of clustering solution selection strategies. The experimental results on both UCI machine learning datasets and cancer gene expression profiles demonstrate that HCSS works well on most of the datasets, obtains more desirable final results, and outperforms most of the state-of-the-art clustering solution selection strategies.
