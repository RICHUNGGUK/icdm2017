MR imaging was acquired on a whole body 1.5T scanner with a gradient echo fat suppressed sequence using an extremity coil. The method was based on the Ray Casting technique which relies on the decomposition of the MR images into multiple surface layers to localize the boundaries of the bones and several partial segmentation objects being automatically merged to obtain the final complete segmentation of the bones. Validation analyses were performed on 161 MR images from knee osteoarthritis patients, comparing the developed fully automated to a validated semi-automated segmentation method, using the average surface distance (ASD), volume correlation coefficient, and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). For both femur and tibia, respectively, data showed excellent bone surface ASD (0.50 +/- A 0.12 mm; 0.37 +/- A 0.09 mm), average oriented distance between bone surfaces within the cartilage domain (0.02 +/- A 0.07 mm; -0.05 +/- A 0.10 mm), and bone volume DSC (0.94 +/- A 0.05; 0.92 +/- A 0.07). This newly developed fully automated bone segmentation method will enable large scale studies to be conducted within shorter time durations, as well as increase stability in the reading of pathological bone.", "paper_title": "A fully automated human knee 3D MRI bone segmentation using the ray casting technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000297550600008"}
