We first transfer fuzzy time series data to the fuzzy logic group, assign weights to each period, and then use the proposed adaptive fuzzy time series model for forecasting in which an enrollment forecasting values is applied to obtain the smallest forecasting error. Finally, an illustrated example for forecasting Taiwan's tourism demand is used to verify the effectiveness of proposed model and confirmed the potential benefits of the proposed approach with a very small forecasting error MAPE and RMSE.
