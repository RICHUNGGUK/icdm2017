The sensitivity of the load versus displacement curves, obtained by reverse shear tests of rectangular and notched specimens, to the kinematic law parameters are studied following a forward analysis, based on finite element simulations. Afterwards, an inverse analysis methodology using a gradient-based Levenberg-Marquardt method is established, by evaluating the relative difference between numerical and experimental results of the shear test, i.e. the load evolution in function of the displacements of the grips. The use of a notched specimen is proposed in order to allow an easy and suitable numerical representation of the boundary conditions of the shear experimental test. This methodology has proven to be appropriate for determining the parameters of the kinematic hardening law.", "paper_title": "On the identification of kinematic hardening with reverse shear test", "paper_id": "WOS:000360859000002"}
