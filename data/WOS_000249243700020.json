In this paper, we investigate the problem synchronization of chen system based on passivity technique for Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) underwater communication in order to minimize interference (MAI) caused by the multiple access by using Chen system for spreading sequence, assure the transmitter-receiver synchronization and secure the transmission information. The numerical result presented show that system is quickly and perfectly synchronized with the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Synchronization of chen system based on passivity technique for CDMA underwater communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000249243700020"}
