Specifically, we prove that a set R subset of N-k is accepted (respectively, generated) by a restricted system if and only if R is a semilinear set. We also show that \"slight\" extensions of the models will allow them to accept (respectively, generate) non-semilinear sets. In fact, for these extensions, the emptiness problem is undecidable.", "paper_title": "On symport/antiport P systems and semilinear sets", "paper_id": "WOS:000235807300018"}
