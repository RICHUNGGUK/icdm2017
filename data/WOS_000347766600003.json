Unlike generalized Faure sequences, this construction is extensible in the dimension and lends itself well to high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we consider a weighted space of functions for which this construction is particularly well suited and we use it to prove tractability in that space. This space of functions is a special case of one in which we have \"finite-order weights\", which were studied recently by several authors. We compare our findings with these previously obtained results and provide numerical results to illustrate the practical potential of our approach. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
