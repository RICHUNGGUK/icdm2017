Both infinite and finite queue capacity scenarios are considered, including partial rejection and complete rejection policies for the latter. Using discretization, this system is approximately described by a multi-regime Markov fluid queue for which numerical algorithms are available. The computational complexity of the proposed method is linear in the number of regimes used for discretization. We provide numerical examples to validate the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
