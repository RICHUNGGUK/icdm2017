This problem was introduced to find functional motifs in biological networks. We present a branch-and-bound algorithm named RANGI for finding and enumerating list-colored graph motifs. As our experimental results show, RANGI's pruning methods and heuristics make it quite fast in practice compared to the algorithms presented in the literature. We also present a parallel version of RANGI that achieves acceptable scalability.", "paper_title": "RANGI: A Fast List-Colored Graph Motif Finding Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000323504100023"}
