The quantum CD encodes, prepares, and initializes the broad content or key frames conveying the movie script. The quantum player uses the simple motion operations to manipulate the contents of the key frames in order to interpolate the missing viewing frames required to effectively depict the shots and scenes of the movie. The movie reader combines the projective measurement technique and the ancilla-driven quantum computation to retrieve the classical movie sequence comprising of both the key and viewing frames for each shot. At appropriate frame transition rates, this sequence creates the impression of continuity in order to depict the various movements and actions in the movie. Two well-thought-out examples demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework. Concatenated, these components together facilitate the proposed framework for quantum movie representation and production, thus, opening the door towards manipulating quantum circuits aimed at applications for information representation and processing.", "paper_title": "A FRAMEWORK FOR REPRESENTING AND PRODUCING MOVIES ON QUANTUM COMPUTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000296624600009"}
