This method combines three-dimensional (3D) models of each vertebra obtained from CT scans with in vivo movement data collected using high-speed biplane radiography. A novel computer algorithm that automatically traces a path around the bony boundary that defines the neural foramen at every frame of X-ray data is described. After identifying the neural foramen boundary, the cross-sectional area is calculated. The technique is demonstrated using data collected from a patient with cervical radiculopathy who is tested before and after conservative treatment. The technique presented here can be applied when 3D, dynamic, functional movements are performed. Neural foramen cross-sectional area can be quantified at specific angles of intervertebral rotation, allowing for matched comparisons between two trials or two test sessions. The present technique is ideal for longitudinal studies involving subjects who receive conservative or surgical treatments that may affect spine motion.", "paper_title": "Automated measurement of neural foramen cross-sectional area during in vivo functional movement", "paper_id": "WOS:000315719300005"}
