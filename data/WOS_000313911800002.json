Although these architectures have significant performance and energy potential, application designers face many device-specific challenges when choosing an appropriate accelerator or when customizing an algorithm for an accelerator. To help address this problem, in this article we thoroughly evaluate convolution, one of the most common operations in digital-signal processing, on multicores, graphics-processing units, and field-programmable gate arrays. Whereas many previous application studies evaluate a specific usage of an application, this article assists designers with design space exploration for numerous use cases by analyzing effects of different input sizes, different algorithms, and different devices, while also determining Pareto-optimal trade-offs between performance and energy.", "paper_title": "A Performance and Energy Comparison of Convolution on GPUs, FPGAs, and Multicore Processors", "paper_id": "WOS:000313911800002"}
