To address this drawback, different meta-modeling approaches have been proposed in the literature. This study represents an adaptive meta-modeling framework to solve a high dimensional design problem by coupling a hydrodynamic model, a multi objective genetic algorithm and artificial neural network as the surrogate model. The proposed dynamic learning approach includes special space filling techniques and control strategies to periodically update surrogate model and keep the fidelity level of solutions as the optimization progresses. An experimental application on flood management based on a case study in Iran was carried out in order to test the efficiency of the proposed approach. Results showed the approach provides a 74% time saving while maintaining the quality of solutions when compared with those of the original simulation model indicating the viability of the approach.
