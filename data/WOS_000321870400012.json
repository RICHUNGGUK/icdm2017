Both cognitive radio and femtocell have the potential ability for high energy efficiency. However, most of previous works are focused on interference avoidance to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) by power control and spectrum sharing in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks with femtocells, and the energy efficiency aspect is largely ignored. In this paper, we study the energy efficiency aspect of power allocation and interference management in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks with femtocells. Particularly, due to sharing the same spectrum resource for cross-tier cognitive radio networks with femtocells, there is a cross-tier interference between fetmocells and macrocell. In this case, we introduce an interference price to measure the effect of interference. Then we formulate the problem of power allocation and interference management for energy-efficient transmissions in heterogeneous cognitive radio networks with femtocells as a Stackelberg game. And we use the backward induction method to solve the optimal power allocation and price determination. An iteration algorithm based on price updating is proposed to obtain the Stackelberg equilibrium solution. Simulation results are illustrated to demonstrate the Stackelberg equilibrium by the proposed iteration algorithm, and energy efficiency can be improved significantly in the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Interference Management and Power Allocation for Energy-Efficient Cognitive Femtocell Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000321870400012"}
