It is implemented with CG and BiCGStab algorithms and an excellent result has been obtained. Extensive experimental results on large-scale power grid circuits show that the present method is over 200 times faster than SPICE3 and around 10-20 times faster than ICCG method in transient simulations. Furthermore, the presented algorithm saves the memory usage over 95% of SPICE3 and 75% of ICCG method, respectively while the accuracy is not compromised.", "paper_title": "POWER GRIDS ANALYSIS IN COMPRESSED KRYLOV-SUBSPACE METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648200006"}
