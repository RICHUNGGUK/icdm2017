We apply the contraction mapping principle and Krasnoselskii's fixed point theorem to obtain some new existence and uniqueness results. Two examples are given to illustrate the main results.", "paper_title": "ON THE EXISTENCE AND UNIQUENESS OF SOLUTION OF A NONLINEAR FRACTIONAL DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000315699900015"}
