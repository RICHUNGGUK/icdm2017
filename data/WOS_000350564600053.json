Similarly, there are few triggered behaviors, such as usage or bandwidths cap for individual users, that are available. By looking at sources of traffic, based on Domain Name System (DNS) cues for content of particular web addresses or source Autonomous System (AS) of the traffic, network operators could create new and interesting rules for their network. Net Assay is a Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-based, network-wide monitoring and reaction framework. By integrating information from Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) and the Domain Name System, Net Assay is able to integrate formerly disparate sources of control information, and use it to provide better monitoring, more useful triggered events, and security benefits for network operators.", "paper_title": "NetAssay: Providing New Monitoring Primitives for Network Operators", "paper_id": "WOS:000350564600053"}
