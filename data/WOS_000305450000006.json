The governing equations of the Jeffrey-six constant fluid were simplified by using the assumptions of long wave length and low Reynolds number approximation. The simplified form of equations were solved using the perturbation, homotopy analysis and finite difference methods. The comparison of the three solutions are shown graphically. The variation of pressure rise and frictional forces with the different parameters were also examined numerically. Results are presented at the end of the article.
