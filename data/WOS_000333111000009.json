We describe here how to accelerate inexpensive ARM-based computing nodes with high-end GPGPUs hosted on x86_64 machines using the GVirtuS general-purpose virtualization service. We draw the vision of a possible next generation computing clusters characterized by highly heterogeneous parallelism heading to a lower electric power demanding, less heat producing and more environmental friendliness. Preliminary but promising performance data suggest that this solution could be considered as part of the foundations of the next generation of high performance cloud computing components.", "paper_title": "Virtualizing high-end GPGPUs on ARM clusters for the next generation of high performance cloud computing", "paper_id": "WOS:000333111000009"}
