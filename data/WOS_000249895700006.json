Current initiatives worldwide are seeking to secure a culture of cooperation looking for better performance of this traditionally fragmented industry. The focus has to be on the need to manage the interface between the different project applications as well as the need to improve information flow through seamless integration of electronic data. In this paper a multi-level platform that integrates cooperative production and distributed design in AEC industry is proposed in order to go beyond the identified problems.
