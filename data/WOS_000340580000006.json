The shape of the control field is obtained by using the Lyapunov control method, and the controlled state is found to approach the target state monotonically. We also explore the possibility of replacing the continuous control field with a train of discreet rectangular pulses, which is much easier to implement experimentally. The discretized control field is found to be still able to drive the initial state to the target state with very small errors, which suggests that the Lyapunov based control is still effective under practical limitations.", "paper_title": "GENERATION OF QUANTUM CORRELATION IN QUANTUM DOTS BY LYAPUNOV CONTROL METHODS", "paper_id": "WOS:000340580000006"}
