The energetically favorable inclusion structures were identified. The AM1 results show that alpha-cyclodextrin complexes with mono-halogen benzoic acid acids (where the halogen is chlorine, bromide, iodine) as guest compounds are more stable in the \"head first\" position than in the \"tail-first\" position for meta and para isomers while ortho mono-halogen benzoic acids complexes with alpha-cyclodextrin are more stable in \"tail-first\" position. The calculated structures were found to be in good agreement with those obtained from crystalographic databases.", "paper_title": "Structures of inclusion complexes of halogenbenzoic acids and alpha-cyclodextrin based on AM1 calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000240900700007"}
