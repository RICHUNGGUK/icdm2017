The algorithm produces an appreciate description of cluster contours and then extracts cluster centers information by iteratively performing classification procedure. An adaptive Kernel function is designed to find a desired width parameter for diverse dispersions. Experimental results indicate that the designed Kernel can capture multi-relational features well and STPSVC is of fine performance.", "paper_title": "Self-Adaptive Two-phase Support Vector Clustering for multi-relational data mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000237249600027"}
