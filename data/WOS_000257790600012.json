The proposed technique derives the test vectors from the expressions of the inner product (IP) variables without any requirement of the ATPG tool. This low-complexity testing method requires (2m+1) test vectors for detecting single stuck-at faults in the AND part and multiple stuck-at faults in the EXOR part of the multiplier circuits. The test vectors are independent of the multiplier's structure, as proposed in [11], but are dependent on m. For the multiplier circuits, the test set is found to be smaller in size than the ATPG-generated test set. The test set provides 100 percent single stuck-at fault coverage.", "paper_title": "Derivation of reduced test vectors for bit-parallel multipliers over GF(2(m))", "paper_id": "WOS:000257790600012"}
