A two-phase neighborhood search (TNS) algorithm is proposed to minimize objectives of two agents simultaneously under the given upper bounds. TNS is constructed through the combination of multiple variable neighborhood mechanisms and a new perturbation strategy for new current solution. A new replacement principle is also applied to decide if the current solution can be updated. TNS is tested on a number of instances and compared with the existing methods. The computational results show the promising advantage of TNS on the considered problem. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
