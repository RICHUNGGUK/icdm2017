This content can be split into various categories and usually content semantically related is placed in the same area. In this paper, a software technique is presented that allows the viewers of web sites to build their own personalized portals, using specific areas of their preferred sites. This technique saves users' time and reduces the cost of browsing the web by minimizing the volume of data that has to be downloaded. It is based on an algorithm, which fragments a web page in discrete fragments using the page's internal structure. Users utilize a web interface to define which parts of selected web pages they desire to appear in their personalized portal. No additional software needs to be installed on the users' personal computers, since this technique is designed to function centrally as a data source for a Web Server. In addition, usage of this technique reduces user perceived latency during browsing sessions, since less data must be transferred to users' personal computers. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
