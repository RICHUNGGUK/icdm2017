Specifically, we look into the closure properties of PZK languages under monotone boolean formula composition. This gives rise to new protocol techniques. We show that interactive PZK for random self-reducible (RSR) (and for co-RSR) languages is closed under monotone boolean formula composition. Namely, we present PZK proofs for monotone boolean formulae whose atoms are statements about membership in a PZK language which is RSR (or whose complement is RSR). We also discuss extensions, recent applications, and generalizations of the techniques.", "paper_title": "ON MONOTONE FORMULA COMPOSITION OF PERFECT ZERO-KNOWLEDGE LANGUAGES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261891600003"}
