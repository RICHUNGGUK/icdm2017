Each individual tree is then mapped using dynamic programming. The links among the mappings of different trees are provided via propagating the essential mapping information along multiple fanout branches. While this approach may achieve optimality within each tree, the overall result is compromised from the very first treatment of fanouts. In this article, we propose a new scheme that greatly improves technology mapping. Instead of a forest of trees, we partition the circuit into a set of maximal super-gates (MSGs). These are used to transform the original circuit into trees. We then apply the dynamic programming technique to the trees and allow duplication of gates in the mapping of each individual MSG. Experimental results on ISCAS'85 benchmarks show that our approach delivers an average of 20.6% reduction in delay with only a 9.5% increase on area.", "paper_title": "Performance-driven technology mapping with MSG partition and selective gate duplication", "paper_id": "WOS:000243147500008"}
