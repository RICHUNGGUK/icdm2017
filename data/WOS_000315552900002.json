First, the number of different control sequences that drive the higher order Boolean control network from the initial state to the destination state while avoiding undesirable set is provided. Then, the definition of global controllability of higher order Boolean control network is given. Third, by using the classical theory of nonnegative matrices, the necessary and sufficient condition for the global controllability of higher order Boolean control network with avoiding set is presented. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for k fixed-time global controllability of the system is also obtained. At last, an example is given to illustrate the main results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
