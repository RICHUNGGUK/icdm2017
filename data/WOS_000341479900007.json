Due to the vulnerabilities of communication channels, especially the wireless networks, communication is not perfect in practice and will be threatened by kinds of attacks, among which jamming attack is deemed as the primary one. In this paper, we consider jamming attack in the wireless communication of a smart microgrid. Firstly, the DRM performance degradation induced by jamming attack is fully studied and explicitly presented, by considering both packet loss ratio and load estimation error. Then, a modified regret matching based anti-jamming algorithm is proposed to enhance the quality of communication, and the performance of DRM. Finally, numerical results are presented to illustrate the impacts of unreliable communication on DRM, as well as the performance of the proposed anti-jamming algorithm. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
