Motivated by the topological analysis of high-dimensional digital image data, we consider such subdivisions defined by generalizations of quad- and oct-trees to n dimensions. Assuming the subdivision is balanced, we show that mapping each vertex to the center of the corresponding n-cube gives a geometric realization of the dual complex in a\"e (n) .", "paper_title": "Dual Complexes of Cubical Subdivisions of R-n", "paper_id": "WOS:000299057200010"}
