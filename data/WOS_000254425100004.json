The approach is broken into two steps. First, an optimal filter bank is designed in the theoretical sense, based on Vaidyanathan's coding gain criterion in the SubBand Coding ( SBC) system. Then, the above filter bank is optimized based on the criterion of Peak Signal- to- Noise Ratio ( PSNR) in the JPEG2000 image compression system, resulting in a BWFB in practical application sense. With the approach, a series of BWFBs for a specific class of applications related to image compression, such as gray- level images, can be quickly designed. Here, new 7/ 5 BWFBs are presented based on the above approach for image compression applications. Experiments show that the 7/ 5 BWFBs not only have excellent compression performance, but also easy computation and are more suitable for VLSI hardware implementations. They perform equally well with respect to 7/ 5 filters in the JPEG2000 standard.", "paper_title": "An optimization algorithm for biorthogonal wavelet filter banks design", "paper_id": "WOS:000254425100004"}
