The asymptotic quantum Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound states that there exist q-ary quantum codes of sufficiently long block length N having fixed rate R with distance at least N H-q2(-1) ((1 - R)/2), where H-q2 is the q(2)-ary entropy function. For q < 7, only random quantum codes are known to asymptotically attain the quantum GV bound. However, random codes have little structure. In this paper, we generalize the classical result of Thommesen to the quantum case, thereby demonstrating the existence of concatenated quantum codes that can asymptotically attain the quantum GV bound. The outer codes are quantum generalized Reed-Solomon codes, and the inner codes are random independently chosen stabilizer codes, where the rates of the inner and outer codes lie in a specified feasible region.", "paper_title": "Concatenated Quantum Codes Can Attain the Quantum Gilbert-Varshamov Bound", "paper_id": "WOS:000341980300004"}
