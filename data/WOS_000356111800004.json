It leads to degeneration of neurons and decline of cognitive functions. The most aggregative and toxic form of beta-amyloid is A beta(1-42) but in experiments, the shorter forms able to form aggregates are also used. The early stages of amyloid formation are of special interest due to the influence of this peptide on progression of AD. Here, we employed nine helices of undecapeptide A beta(13-23) and studied progress of amyloid formation using 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation and implicit membrane environment. The small beta-sheets emerged very early during simulation as separated two-strand structures and a presence of the membrane facilitated this process. Later, the larger beta-sheets were formed. However, the ninth helix which did not form paired structure stayed unchanged till the end of MD simulation. Paired helix-helix interactions seemed to be a driving force of beta-sheet formation at early stages of amyloid formation. Contrary, the specific interactions between alpha-helix and beta-sheet can be very stable and be stabilized by the membrane. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
