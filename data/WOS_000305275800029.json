We developed an effective co-evolutionary genetic algorithm (CGA) for the minimization of fuzzy makespan. In CGA, the chromosome of a novel representation consists of ordered operation list and machine assignment string, a new crossover operator and a modified tournament selection are proposed, and the population of job sequencing and the population of machine assignment independently evolve and cooperate for converging to the best solutions of the problem. CGA is finally applied and compared with other algorithms. Computational results show that CGA outperforms those algorithms compared. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.
