The ability of cell division allows us to obtain an exponential amount of cells in linear time and to design cellular solutions to computationally hard problems in polynomial time. In this work we present an efficient solution to the tripartite matching problem by a family of such devices. This solution leads to an interesting open problem whether tissue P systems with cell division and communication rules of length 2 can solve NP-complete problems. An answer to this open problem will provide a borderline between efficiency and non-efficiency in terms of the lengths of communication rules.", "paper_title": "A Tissue P Systems Based Uniform Solution to Tripartite Matching Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000291711200004"}
