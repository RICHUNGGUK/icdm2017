The policies are learned over an extensive generic image processing operator library. One of the principal weaknesses of the method lies with the large size of such libraries, which can make the machine learning process intractable. We demonstrate how evolutionary algorithms can be used to reduce the size of the operator library, thereby speeding Lip policy learning while still keeping human experts out of the development loop. Experiments in a challenging domain of forestry image interpretation exhibited a 95% reduction in the execution time, while maintaining the image interpretation quality of the full library.", "paper_title": "HSMM: Heuristic search with meta-models for image interpretation", "paper_id": "WOS:000256265200008"}
