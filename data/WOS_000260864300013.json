A two-phase scheduling methodology is proposed to optimize the ECC arithmetic over both GF(p) and GF(2(m)). Based on the methodology, a parallel and scalable ECC architecture is also proposed. Our dual-field ECC architecture supports arbitrary elliptic curves and arbitrary finite fields with different field sizes. The optimization to a variety of applications with different area/throughput requirements can be achieved rapidly and efficiently. Using 0.13-mu m CMOS technology, a 160-bit ECC processor core is implemented, which can perform elliptic-curve scalar multiplication in 340 mu s over GF(p) and 155 mu s over GF(2(m)), respectively. The comparison of speed and area overhead among different ECC designs justifies the cost-effectiveness of the proposed ECC architecture with its design methodology.", "paper_title": "Elixir: High-Throughput Cost-Effective Dual-Field Processors and the Design Framework for Elliptic Curve Cryptography", "paper_id": "WOS:000260864300013"}
