Specifically, we compute class conditional LICA, where separate endmembers are extracted from each class dataset. We find that this fusion approach improves systematically the recognition accuracy in face recognition applications. We report experimental results using seven state-of-the-art linear feature extraction algorithms on four public face databases using Extreme Learning Machines (ELMS) for the classification building algorithm.
