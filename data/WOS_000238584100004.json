Voices and sounds as conversations and onomatopoeias play an interesting role in her story world. Structures of expression in conversation in her two books are visualized by wavelet multiresolution analysis. In this study, the visualization of Duke is compared with that of Rakka-suru Yugata. As a result, the author's peculiarity and literary genre differences are extracted.", "paper_title": "Visualization of the sympathy interaction between articles and the reader", "paper_id": "WOS:000238584100004"}
