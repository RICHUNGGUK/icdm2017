We argue that poses are important for understanding human actions and the strength of the pose representation affects the overall performance of the action recognition system. Based on this idea, we present a new view-independent representation for human poses. Assuming that the data is initially provided in the form of volumetric data, the volume of the human body is first divided into a sequence of horizontal layers, and then the intersections of the body segments with each layer are coded with enclosing circles. The circular features in all layers (i) the number of circles, (ii) the area of the outer circle, and (iii) the area of the inner circle are then used to generate a pose descriptor. The pose descriptors of all frames in an action sequence are further combined to generate corresponding motion descriptors. Action recognition is then performed with a simple nearest neighbor classifier. Experiments performed on the benchmark IXMAS multi-view dataset demonstrate that the performance of our method is comparable to the other methods in the literature. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
