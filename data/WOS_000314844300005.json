It is seen that a time series analysis of the microarray samples is first performed to determine the filtering properties of the hidden layer of the neural classifier with FIR-ELM for feature identification. The linear separability of the data patterns in the microarray datasets is then studied. For improving the robustness of the neural classifier against noise and errors, a frequency domain gene feature selection algorithm is also proposed. It is shown in the simulation results that the FIR-ELM algorithm has an excellent performance for the classification of bioinformatics data in comparison with many existing classification algorithms.", "paper_title": "Classification of bioinformatics dataset using finite impulse response extreme learning machine for cancer diagnosis", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300005"}
