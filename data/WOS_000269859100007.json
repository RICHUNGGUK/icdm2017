We study the degree of the minimal polynomials of these algebraic numbers. Geometrically, this degree counts the critical points attained by a linear functional on a fixed rank locus in a linear space of symmetric matrices. We determine this degree using methods from complex algebraic geometry, such as projective duality, determinantal varieties, and their Chern classes.", "paper_title": "The algebraic degree of semidefinite programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000269859100007"}
