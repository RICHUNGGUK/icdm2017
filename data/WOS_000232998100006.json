These two highly combinatorial. problems have a number of applications in information transmission in telecommunications, and in particular in the construction of convolutional self-orthogonal codes. Our tabu algorithm obtains remarkable results and finds many Difference Triangle Sets with smaller spans than those obtained so far. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
