These concepts represent a new evolutionary stage in the development of cognitive radio and cognitive networks, where wireless communication progresses from an individual, device-centric approach toward group and team behavior. This creates the potential for more effective and more robust communication solutions when deemed necessary. The key elements of effective cognitive network teamwork are introduced in this article. These include group formation, distributed co-ordination, goal and role identification, accountability, and reward mechanisms for the outcomes of team behavior. The value of the group as a whole can be increased rather than individual gain for only a single device. Focusing on an early experimental cognitive network teamwork testbed designed by CTVR, this article outlines the potential of developing cognitive networks that can work as a team. Potential applications and market opportunities for this technology also are described.", "paper_title": "Teamwork and collaboration in cognitive wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000248828800005"}
