The 2DX code solves linearized fluid equations in a 2D cross-section of the plasma, with toroidal mode number resolving the third dimension. Geometry capabilities include both closed and open field lines, allowing solution of X-point problems as well as a variety of other toroidal and cylindrical systems. The code generates a pair of sparse matrices forming a generalized eigenvalue problem which is then solved using a standard sparse eigensolver package. Use of a specialized equation parser permits a high degree of flexibility in both equations and coordinate systems. Both analytic and full geometry benchmark cases are presented.
