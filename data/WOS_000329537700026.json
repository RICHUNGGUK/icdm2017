Modified discontinuous deformation analysis (DDA) is used here to analyze the failure mechanisms and stability of the blocky seawall structure. The backfilling soil is properly integrated into the DDA model, by means of the proposed soil discretization approach, and with an accurate interface shear strength model that the authors presented. According to the simulation results by the modified DDA, the existing seawall is generally in good state. Nevertheless, routine inspection and early restoration are recommended to avoid progressive failures of the seawall. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
