To this end, we develop propositional proof systems under different measures of promises (i. e., different Lambda) as extensions of resolution. This is done by augmenting resolution with axioms that, roughly, can eliminate sets of truth assignments defined by Boolean circuits. We then investigate the complexity of such systems, obtaining an exponential separation in the average case between resolution under different size promises: (1) Resolution has polynomial-size refutations for all unsatisfiable 3CNF formulas when the promise is epsilon.2(n), for any constant 0 < epsilon < 1. (2) There are no subexponential size resolution refutations for random 3CNF formulas, when the promise is 2(delta n), for any constant 0 < delta < 1 (and the number of clauses is O(n(3/2-epsilon)), for 0 < epsilon < 1/2).", "paper_title": "Complexity of Propositional Proofs Under a Promise", "paper_id": "WOS:000277925300004"}
