Basic topological properties of semialgebraic sets like boundedness, closedness, compactness, as well as the continuity of semialgebraic functions are shown to be complete in these new classes. All attempts to classify the complexity of these problems in terms of the previously studied complexity classes have failed. We also obtain completeness results in the Turing model for the corresponding discrete problems. In this setting, it turns out that infinitesimal and generic quantifiers can be eliminated, so that the relevant complexity classes can be described in terms of the usual quantifiers only.", "paper_title": "Exotic Quantifiers, Complexity Classes, and Complete Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000264479700001"}
