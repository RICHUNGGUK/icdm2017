By integrating the ability of wavelet on multi-scale analysis and that of ICA on extracting independent components for non-Gaussian process variables, the multivariate statistical monitoring techniques can obtain improved performance. Contrastive tests have been carried out on the famous benchmark chemical plant among ICA-like and PCA-like methods, which reveals that multi-scale ICA approach has lower missed detection rate of faults.", "paper_title": "Improvement on multivariate statistical process monitoring using multi-scale ICA", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300047"}
