Most of the ISO standards that define models for software quality, IT service management or information security management provide their recommendations, guidelines, requirements or good practices under a process approach. Due to this approach, there are a large number of relations between these models as well as many common elements. From the study of these relations, this paper presents MIN-ITs, a new framework that supports the integration of different ISO standards related to IT management.", "paper_title": "MIN-ITs: A Framework for Integration of IT Management Standards in Mature Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000343726500003"}
