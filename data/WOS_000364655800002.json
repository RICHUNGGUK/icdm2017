We examine the fundamental position of the finite languages and their complements in the hierarchy. We show that for every finite language L one has that L, (L) over bar is an element of REn for some n <= p . (m - left perpendicular log(2) p right perpendicular + 1) + 1 where m is the length of the longest word in L, c is the cardinality of L, and p = min{c, 2(m-1)}. If L is an element of REn, then (L) over bar is an element of REs for some s = O(n + m). We also prove that for every n, there is a finite language L-n with m = O(n log(2) n) such that L-n is not an element of REn but L-n, (L) over bar (n) is an element of REs for some s = O(n log(2) n). Several further results are shown that how the hierarchy can be separated by increasing chains of finite languages. The proofs make use of several auxiliary results for Turing machines with advice.", "paper_title": "Separating the Classes of Recursively Enumerable Languages Based on Machine Size", "paper_id": "WOS:000364655800002"}
