A synthetic perspective is employed to bridge these two areas and to create a unified conceptual framework that can be used to address a broad range of multiobjective spatial decision problems. In this framework, evolutionary algorithms are employed to generate optimal, or near-optimal, solutions to a problem being addressed. Alternatives created are then displayed in an interactive visual support system that can be used by decision makers to discover the competing nature of multiple objectives and to gain knowledge about the tradeoffs among alternatives.
