Specifically, an optimal dictionary is adaptively learned to bate the trivial information of the original training data; then, in order to obtain the sparse representation coefficients, a sparse preserving embedding map is sought to reduce the dimensionality of high-dimensional data, and the test data is classified by the corresponding sparse representation coefficients. Finally, the novel supervised fusion algorithm is applied to the land cover recognition of the off-land scenario. Experimental results show that the proposed method leads to promising results in fusing feature extraction and classification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
