With this new software architecture, the public network port 80 can be shared between Node.js and the Apache web server software system. With this new solution, the Apache web server application still listens to the public network port 80, but any client requests for the Node.js web server application through the port will be forwarded to a special network port which Node.js web server application is listening to. Accordingly, a new solution in which both Apache and Node.js web server applications work together via HTTP proxy developed by the Node-HTTP-Proxy software package is implemented on the server-side. With this new real time experiment control and data transmission solution, the end user can control remote experiments and view experimental data on the web browser without firewall issues and without the need of third party plug-ins. It also provides a new approach for the remote experiment control and real time data transmission based on pure HTTP protocol. The solution will significantly benefit the development of remote laboratory technology.", "paper_title": "Using Node-HTTP-Proxy for Remote Experiment Data Transmission Traversing Firewall", "paper_id": "WOS:000366994600009"}
