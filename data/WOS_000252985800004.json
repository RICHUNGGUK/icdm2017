In this note, we suggest using probability in a Bayesian sense to model the uncertainty regarding the opponent's types of pieces. We use loopy belief propagation for rapid inference and prediction about the piece types of an opponent. Our experimental results indicate that the method can successfully infer the exact type of the opponent's piece. The ratio of true inference is approximately 48.7%, which is more than elementary players' inference strength.", "paper_title": "Using the loopy belief propagation in Siguo", "paper_id": "WOS:000252985800004"}
