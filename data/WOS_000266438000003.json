To our knowledge, this is the first such investigation of peripheral color reduction. For unimpeded performance, results suggest that, unlike spatiotemporal content, peripheral chromaticity cannot be reduced within the central 20 degrees visual angle. Somewhat analogous to dark adaptation, reduction of peripheral color tends to simulate scotopic viewing conditions. This holds significant implications for chromatic Level Of Detail management. Specifically, while peripheral spatiotemporal detail can be attenuated without affecting visual search, often dramatically (e. g., spatial detail can be so reduced up to 50% at about 5 degrees), peripheral chromatic reduction is likely to be noticed much sooner. Therefore, color LOD reduction (e. g., via compression), should be maintained isotropically across the central 20 degrees visual field.", "paper_title": "On Spatiochromatic Visual Sensitivity and Peripheral Color LOD Management", "paper_id": "WOS:000266438000003"}
