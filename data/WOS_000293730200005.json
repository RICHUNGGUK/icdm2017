This strategy satisfies the burst traffic demand of the local hot-spot cell at a specific time and reduces the co-frequency inter cell interference. Dynamic carrier allocation is also considered to satisfy the capacity demand of user migration. Simulations show that this strategy can flexibly allocate carriers, reduce the frequency band cost and capacity redundancy and increase the spectrum utilization rate.", "paper_title": "A Flexible Carrier Allocation Strategy for Multi-carrier Cell Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000293730200005"}
