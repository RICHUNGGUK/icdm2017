Roads in a high resolution SAR image can be modeled as a homogeneous dark area bounded by two parallel lines. The fundamental is based on linear extraction and improved Hough transform. Combining Hough transform and the partition of the line, the problem of location of line segments was solved. The improved Hough transform is tested on synthetic images and noisy images. The experimental results show the method's validity.", "paper_title": "An efficient method of road extraction in SAR image", "paper_id": "WOS:000241892100089"}
