Given a partial preference relation on an arbitrary set of generalized lotteries all on the same finite totally ordered set of prizes, conditions for the representability, either by a linear utility or a Choquet expected utility are provided. Both the cases of a finite and an infinite set of generalized lotteries are investigated.", "paper_title": "RATIONALITY PRINCIPLES FOR PREFERENCES ON BELIEF FUNCTIONS", "paper_id": "WOS:000361266300008"}
