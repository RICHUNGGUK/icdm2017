The fuzzy controller gains are found by solving a nonlinear constrained optimization problem considering the system's dynamics described by a nonlinear model and a set of constraints on the controller gains, control actions and outputs. Experimental results collected on a test-bed show the pertinence of using the proposed tuning technique.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy controllers gains tuning: a constrained nonlinear optimization approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000324794200007"}
