If the tool path is fixed, a novel tool shape optimization method is obtained. If the tool shape is fixed, a tool path optimization method applicable to any rotary cutter is obtained. The approach applies to non-ruled surfaces, and also finds applications in cutter dimension optimization and flank millable surface design. Numerical examples are given to confirm its validity.
