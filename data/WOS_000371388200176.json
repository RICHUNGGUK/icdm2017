This paper examines the relation between a compartmental equivalent circuit and a data-based input-output model of dynamic cerebral autoregulation (DCA) and dynamic CO2-vasomotor reactivity (DVR). The compartmental model is constructed as an equivalent circuit utilizing putative first principles and previously proposed hypothesis-based models. The linear input output dynamics of this compartmental model are compared with the data-based estimates of the DCA DVR process. This comparative study indicates that there are some qualitative similarities between the two-input compartmental model and experimental results.", "paper_title": "Compartmental and Data-Based Modeling of Cerebral Hemodynamics: Linear Analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200176"}
