Bone remodelling is regarded as the regulatory mechanism triggered by mechanical loading. This study was aimed at investigating the effect of orthodontic loading on both tooth movement and neighbouring bone density distribution. A set of computational algorithms incorporating both external and internal remodelling mechanisms was implemented into a patient-specific 3D finite element (FE) model to investigate and analyse orthodontic treatment under four typical modes of orthodontic loading. The consequence of orthodontic treatment was reproduced numerically by using this FE-based technique. The results indicated that the diverse modes of orthodontic loading would result in different magnitudes of tooth movement and particular morphology of bone density distribution. It is illuminated that the newly developed algorithms may replicate the clinical situation more closely compared with the previous proposed method.", "paper_title": "Simulation of bone remodelling in orthodontic treatment", "paper_id": "WOS:000333954600012"}
