We show that, with our method, the probability that the backoff delay is below a given threshold can be computed accurately and efficiently. Then, we extend our backoff delay distribution model to analyze the end-to-end delay, and propose an admission control algorithm based on this analysis. The proposed algorithm is evaluated in a mixed environment with voice and data stations, and simulation results confirm that it effectively provides voice stations with end-to-end delay guarantees. The algorithm is also evaluated in terms of computational cost and shown to be efficient enough for run-time usage. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
