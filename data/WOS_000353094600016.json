By employing a novel omega-matrix measure approach and classical Filippov's discontinuous theory, some new sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the global exponential periodicity and the stability of the memristive neural network. Furthermore, the synchronization condition for the drive-response memristive neural networks via the error-feedback control scheme is also derived. Finally, numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity of the main results. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
