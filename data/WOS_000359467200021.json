Calculations of this feature are performed for both intensity and gradient magnitude image so that texture and gradient information are combined. Moreover, and to the best of our knowledge, non-redundant patterns are adopted on SLBP for the first time, allowing better discrimination. Compared with SLBP, no additional cost of the feature dimensions of NRGSLBP is necessary, and the calculation complexity is considerably smaller than that of other features. Experimental results on several datasets show that the detection rate of our proposed feature outperforms those of other features such as Histogram of Orientated Gradient (HOG), Histogram of Templates (HOT), Bidirectional Local Template Patterns (BLTP), Gradient Local Binary Patterns (GLBP), SLBP and Covariance matrix (COV).", "paper_title": "Human Detection Method Based on Non-Redundant Gradient Semantic Local Binary Patterns", "paper_id": "WOS:000359467200021"}
