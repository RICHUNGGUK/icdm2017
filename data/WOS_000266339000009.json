The paper will describe an innovative approach and relative techniques that can be used to convert existing single-user applications into collaborative applications, without modifying the source code and knowledge of the API of the original single-user applications. The main idea is that user events occurring through the interactions with the application can be caught, distributed, and reconstructed. This approach and supporting techniques were tested in the process of transparently converting a single-user AutoCAD application into a real-time collaborative AutoCAD application called CoAutoCAD, which not only retains the original function and user interface of the single-user AutoCAD application, but supports group collaboration capabilities as well.
