However, routing benefits considerably if one can take advantage of knowledge concerning node mobility. This paper addresses this problem with a generic algorithm based on the use of a high-dimensional Euclidean space, that we call MobySpace, constructed upon nodes' mobility patterns. We provide here an analysis and a large-scale evaluation of routing schemes using MobySpace by replaying real mobility traces. The specific MobySpace evaluated is based on the frequency of visits of nodes to each possible location. We present simulation results for single-copy and multi-copy routing strategies that use MobySpace as a means to route bundles or to control flooding. We show that routing based on MobySpace can achieve good performance compared to a number of common algorithms.
