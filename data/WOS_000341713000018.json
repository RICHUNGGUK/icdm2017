Second, proposing an outstanding fast and simple approach based on introduced concept for voltage estimation after multiple component outages while satisfying required accuracy. Design/methodology/approach - Equivalent load bus theory introduces three transfer matrices that describe power system topology. Mentioned matrices could be calculated simply after system reconfiguration without matrix inversion. Using transfer matrices a large-scale power system can be modeled by a simple two-bus power system from the viewpoint of any desired bus so that load flow calculation leads to same value. The analysis of simplified power system yields to extract a new incremental model based on equivalent bus load theory that will be distinguished as an outstanding fast method for voltage estimation aim. Findings - A deep study for fast voltage estimation aim is dedicated to evaluate proposed method from the accuracy and quickness point of view and the outcomes are compared to a well-known method as Distribution Factors (DF). Results and computational times unveil that presented approach is more accurate and much faster. Originality/value - A novel and new fast voltage estimation method for assessment of power system component outages is introduced.", "paper_title": "A novel and fast voltage estimation scheme for assessment of power system component outages", "paper_id": "WOS:000341713000018"}
