The interviewees are instructors who have taught online courses for more than two years. Eleven interview transcripts, obtained from online instructors from six countries (Australia, Canada, China United Kingdom, United States and Taiwan) were analyzed by using open and axial coding. The analysis data established categories of perceptions related to: teachers' roles in the online environment, the methods for interacting with students, and teachers' expectations for their future educational careers. Finally, three perspectives arose which adequately describe online instructors' teaching experiences: interactive activities, evaluation criteria, and self-expectations. The study also reveals a link connecting those perspectives. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
