The important task is to associate a current subject with other prior appearances of the same subject across time and space in a camera network. Several known techniques rely on Bayesian approaches to perform the matching task. However, these approaches do not scale well when the dimension of the problem increases; e.g. when the number of subject or possible path increases. The aim of this paper is to propose a unified tracking framework using particle filters to efficiently switch between visual tracking (field of view tracking) and track prediction (non-overlapping region tracking). The particle filter tracking system utilizes a map (known environment) to assist the tracking process when targets leave the field of view of any camera. We implemented and tested this tracking approach in an in-house multiple cameras system as well as using on-line data. Promising results were obtained which suggested the feasibility of such an approach.", "paper_title": "Non-overlapping distributed tracking system utilizing particle filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000250242300001"}
