However, little work has been done on model evaluation. We used simulations to compare the performance of five goodness-of-fit statistics applied to different models in a log binomial setting, namely the Hosmer-Lemeshow, the normalized Pearson chi-square, the normalized unweighted sum of squares, Le Cessie and van Howelingen's statistic based on smoothed residuals and the Hjort-Hosmer test. The normalized Pearson chi-square was unsuitable as the rejection rate depended also on the range of predicted probabilities. The Le Cessie and van Howelingen's test statistic had poor sampling properties when evaluating a correct model and was also considered to be unsuitable in this context. The performance of the remaining three statistics was comparable in most simulations. However, using real data the Hjort-Hosmer outperformed the other two statistics.", "paper_title": "Goodness-of-fit statistics for log-link regression models", "paper_id": "WOS:000354465400013"}
