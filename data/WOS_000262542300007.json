These models constrain the set of patches extracted from the data to analyze to be close to a low-dimensional manifold. This manifold structure is detailed for various ensembles suitable for natural signals, images and textures modeling. These manifolds provide a low-dimensional parameterization of the local geometry of these datasets. These manifold models can be used to regularize inverse problems in signal and image processing. The restored signal is represented as a smooth curve or surface traced on the manifold that matches the forward measurements. A manifold pursuit algorithm computes iteratively a solution of the manifold regularization problem. Numerical simulations on inpainting and compressive sensing inversion show that manifolds models bring an improvement for the recovery of data with geometrical features. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
