However, pulsatile flow behaviour is more accurately described by a Womersley model. No clinical studies have addressed the consequences on the estimated dynamics of the BVF when Poiseuille rather than Womersley models are used. The aim of this study is to determine the influence of assumed Poiseuille profile instead of Womersley profile on the estimation and intrasubject variability of dynamical parameters of the BVF. For this purpose, a low number of volunteers sufficed. Brachial artery centerline velocity waveform and vessel diameter were measured with ultrasound within a small group of six volunteers. Within subjects, the intra- and inter-registration variability of BVF parameters estimates did not significantly differ. Poiseuille profiles compared to Womersley underestimates the maximum BVF by 19%, the maximum retrograde volume flow by 32% and the rise time by 18%. It can be concluded that when estimating in a straight vessel the dynamic properties of the BVF, Womersley profiles should preferably be chosen.", "paper_title": "Model-based assessment of dynamic arterial blood volume flow from ultrasound measurements", "paper_id": "WOS:000266092600009"}
