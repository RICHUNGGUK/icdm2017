Through the universal roaming technology, legitimate mobile users can enjoy the ubiquitous services. Mutual authentication and key agreement between mobile users and roaming servers is the primary security issue of many commercial mobile networks. For personal privacy, it becomes an important issue to develop a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme with anonymity for roaming services in global mobility networks to protect user's identity. Recently, many schemes concerned with this issue have been proposed. However, most of those schemes have been demonstrated that may have several security weaknesses and do not achieve user anonymity. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient mutual authentication and key agreement scheme with user anonymity for roaming services in the global mobility network. Under the random oracle model, we show that our scheme can withstand known attacks. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides the secrecy of the session key, strong anonymity of user's identity, and mutual authentication.", "paper_title": "EFFICIENT MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION AND KEY AGREEMENT WITH USER ANONYMITY FOR ROAMING SERVICES IN GLOBAL MOBILITY NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309246100031"}
