Shape is represented in an implicit form and it is characterized by a series of isotropic kernels that provide desirable invariance properties. The shape features are characterized at multiple scales which form a signature that is a compact description of shape over a range of scales. The shape signature is designed to be invariant with respect to group transformations which include translation, rotation, scaling, and reflection. In addition, the integral kernels that characterize local shape geometry enable the shape signature to be robust with respect to undesirable perturbations while retaining discriminative power. Use of our shape signature is demonstrated for shape matching based on a number of synthetic and real examples.", "paper_title": "Shape Matching Using Multiscale Integral Invariants", "paper_id": "WOS:000346970600013"}
