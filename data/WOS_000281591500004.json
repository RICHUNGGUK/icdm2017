In the intervening period, the agent would have moved freely, according to its time budget. The article demonstrates that the probability of finding the agent somewhere in the space-time prism is not equally distributed, so any attempt of a quantitative time geographic analysis must consider the actual probability distribution. This article develops, implements, and demonstrates this distribution. A preceding article introduced probabilistic time geography for space-time cones. With cones and prisms, the elementary space-time volumes of time geography are provided.", "paper_title": "Directed movements in probabilistic time geography", "paper_id": "WOS:000281591500004"}
