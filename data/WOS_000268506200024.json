Over the past few years, a number of computable algorithms of video completion have been developed, however most of these algorithms are based on the pixel domain. Little theoretical and computational work in video completion is based on the compressed domain. In this paper, a moving object completion method on the compressed domain is proposed. It is composed of three steps: motion field transferring, thin plate spline interpolation and combination. Missing space-time blocks will be completed by placing new motion vectors on them so that the resulting video sequence will have as much global visual coherence with the video portions outside the hole. The experimental results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Moving Object Completion on the Compressed Domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000268506200024"}
