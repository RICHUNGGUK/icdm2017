It is motivated by the fact that there are many large-scale scientific projects and commercial applications (e.g., image processing in astronomy), and their waiting time needs to be lowered down in order to maintain customer satisfaction. We first demonstrate several useful properties of this problem by mapping it to the Euclidean space R(n). Utilizing them, we then develop a gradient-based method for dividing and distributing services to multiple machines. The theoretical analyses show that the proposed method converges linearly and the resultant average waiting time is near optimal. Finally, we present experimental results that confirm the convergence speed and solution quality of the proposed method. Using the proposed method, a Service provider requires only a little execution time to deploy his/her services on multiple machines and provides users with a near-optimal average waiting time for their service requests. The proposed method can be extended to other similar optimization problems (e.g., vehicle routing problem) and promisingly achieves the same near-optimal results.", "paper_title": "PROBABILISTIC SERVICE PARTITION FOR PARALLEL AND DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000281745700006"}
