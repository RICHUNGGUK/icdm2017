In this work, an approximation surface blending approach is proposed to achieve tangential continuity across the boundary curve The boundary curve is first offset in the tangent field with the user-specified tolerance after which It is refined to be compatible with the offset curve for surface blending Since the boundary curve is offset in a three-dimensional (3D) space the local self-intersection in the offset curve is addressed in a 2D space by approximately mapping the offset vectors in the respective tangent planes to the parameter space of the base surface The proposed algorithm is validated using examples, and the normal vector deviation along the boundary curve is investigated (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved", "paper_title": "A surface blending approach for displacement features on freeform surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000285119600006"}
