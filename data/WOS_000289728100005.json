We developed such a team of agents using two well-known platforms, one based on a logic-based agent-oriented programming language, called Jason, and the other based on an organisational model, called Moise. While there is significant research on both agent programming and agent organisations, this was one of the first applications of a combined approach where we can program deliberative agents and organise them using a sophisticated organisational model. In this paper, we describe and discuss our contribution to the multi-agent contest using this combination of agent and organisation programming.", "paper_title": "Using agent- and organisation-oriented programming to develop a team of agents for a competitive game", "paper_id": "WOS:000289728100005"}
