The temperature coefficient has improved because the divider introduces the temperature compensation. The output reference voltage is 410.39 mV at the room temperature. The temperature coefficient of the voltage reference is 3.02 ppm/degrees C in the range from -20 degrees C to 120 degrees C. Moreover, the power supply rejection ratio of the voltage reference is -52.6 dB and the power consumption is 5.61 mu W.", "paper_title": "A HIGH PRECISION CMOS VOLTAGE REFERENCE WITHOUT RESISTORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000306071900005"}
