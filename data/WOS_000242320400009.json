We rely on the fact that the full shortest path tree to all destinations (i.e., m = N - 1) is a uniform recursive tree to derive a recursion for the generating function of the number of links of the SPT, and solve this recursion exactly. The explicit form of the generating function allows us to compute the expectation and variance of the size of the subtree for all m. We also obtain exact expressions for the average weight of the subtree.", "paper_title": "Size and weight of shortest path trees with exponential link weights", "paper_id": "WOS:000242320400009"}
