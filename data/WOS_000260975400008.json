Our algorithm is not based on the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (M.C.M.C.). Instead, we provide a novel proof of correctness of our algorithm that is based on interesting \"spatial mixing\" properties of colourings of G(n,d/n). Our result improves upon previous results (based on M.C.M.C.) that required a number of colours growing unboundedly with n. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
