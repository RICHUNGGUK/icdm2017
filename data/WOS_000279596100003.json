XLIVE is a forensic automated framework that can be used in live forensic investigations for gathering live data on a Windows-based system. In addition, we have also implemented a proof-of-concept, called LRDS (Live Resource Detection System). This approach of examination will be used extensively to deal with terabyte/petabyte digital systems, where other approaches, such as a post-mortem analysis, cannot be adopted. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
