(Trans Inf Theory 58(12):7253-7259, 2012); and Xiong (Finite Fields Appl 18(5):933-945, 2012). In this paper we use the method developed in Xiong (Finite Fields Appl 18(5):933-945, 2012) to solve one more special case. We make extensive use of standard tools in number theory such as characters of finite fields, the Gauss sums and the Jacobi sums. The problem of finding the weight distribution is transformed into a problem of evaluating certain character sums over finite fields, which turns out to be associated with counting the number of points on some elliptic curves over finite fields. We also treat the special case that the characteristic of the finite field is 2.", "paper_title": "The weight distributions of a class of cyclic codes II", "paper_id": "WOS:000338117600003"}
