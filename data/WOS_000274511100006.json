The paper describes two methods, one based on time-series modelling and the other on moving block bootstrap analysis, to show how adjacent offsets are correlated and how this degrades the confidence with which the displacement of one line with respect to the other can be determined. In a case study the displacement between two vector representations of the same coastline is determined using offsets. In the case study it is shown how confidence in the displacement is degraded because of correlation between adjacent offsets. It is suggested the methods have application in the field of GIS when offset models are used to determine the positional accuracy of linear vector features.", "paper_title": "The effect of offset correlation on positional accuracy estimation for linear features", "paper_id": "WOS:000274511100006"}
