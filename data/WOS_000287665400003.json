When a user takes a barcode image with the camera in a mobile device, the captured image tends to be blurred due to camera shaking when the user presses the shutter. In addition, the captured image includes part of the complex background of the page with the barcode. In this paper, we point out that the above two issues, which have not been identified in previous works, deteriorate the accuracy of barcode recognition in the mobile computing. We then propose an efficient and effective algorithm to restore and extract 2D barcode from a complex background in a camera-shaken image. Compared with previous approaches, our algorithm outperforms in not only smaller running time but also higher accuracy of the barcode recognition in the mobile computing.", "paper_title": "Stabilization and extraction of 2D barcodes for camera phones", "paper_id": "WOS:000287665400003"}
