In this paper, we solve this problem by replicating data items on mobile hosts. First, we propose three replica allocation methods assuming that each data item is not updated. In these three methods, we take into account the access frequency from mobile hosts to each data item and the status of the network connection. Then, we extend the proposed methods by considering aperiodic updates and integrating user profiles consisting of mobile users' schedules, access behavior, and read/write patterns. We also show the results of simulation experiments regarding the performance evaluation of our proposed methods.", "paper_title": "Data replication for improving data accessibility in ad hoc networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240544700004"}
