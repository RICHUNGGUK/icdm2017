Owing to the functional, an improved delay-dependent asymptotic stability criterion for delayed neural networks (NNs) is derived in term of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). It is shown that the obtained criterion can provide less conservative result than some existing ones. When linear fractional uncertainties appear in NNs, a new robust delay-dependent stability condition is also given. Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the applicability or the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Further results on delay-dependent stability criteria of neural networks with time-varying delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000258766700014"}
