[Fully complex extreme learning machine, Neurocomputing 68 (2005) 306-314]. Although it shows potential applicability in many areas, there is still room for improvement in performance, especially in training-based equalization applications in which the noise is only within the received data. In this paper, we propose a new solution applying the data least squares (DLS) method. Simulations show that DLS-based C-ELM outperforms the ordinary-least-square-based one in channel equalization problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
