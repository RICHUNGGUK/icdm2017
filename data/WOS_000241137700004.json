In the survey part, we discuss three direct optimal control approaches in detail: (i) single shooting, (ii) collocation, and (iii) multiple shooting, and we specify why we believe the direct multiple shooting method to be the method of choice for nonlinear optimal control problems in robotics. We couple it with an efficient robot model generator and show the performance of the algorithm at the example of a five link robot arm. In the real-time optimization part, we outline the idea of nonlinear model predictive control and the real-time challenge it poses to numerical optimization. As one solution approach, we discuss the real-time iteration scheme.", "paper_title": "Fast direct multiple shooting algorithms for optimal robot control", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137700004"}
