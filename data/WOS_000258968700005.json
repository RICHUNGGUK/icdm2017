This information allows researchers to perform association studies for the genetic variants involved in diseases and the individual responses to therapeutic agents. A notable approach to the problem is to encode it as a combinatorial problem (under certain hypotheses, such as the pure parsimony criterion) and to solve it using off-the-shelf combinatorial optimization techniques. The main methods applied to Haplotype Inference are either simple greedy heuristic or exact methods (integer Linear Programming, Semidefinite Programming, SAT and pseudo-boolean encoding) that, at present, are adequate only for moderate size instances. In this paper, we present and discuss an approach based on the combination of local search metaheuristics and a reduction procedure based on an analysis of the problem structure. Some relevant design issues are first described, then a family of local search metaheuristics is defined to tackle the Haplotype Inference. Results on common Haplotype Inference benchmarks show that the approach achieves a good trade-off between solution quality and execution time. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
