The Facial Recognition Technology (FERET) evaluation and the recent Face Verification Competition (FVC2004) have seen the top performance of Gabor feature based methods. This paper aims to give a detailed survey of state of the art 2D face recognition algorithms using Gabor wavelets for feature extraction. Existing problems are covered and possible solutions are suggested.", "paper_title": "A review on Gabor wavelets for face recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000240830900012"}
