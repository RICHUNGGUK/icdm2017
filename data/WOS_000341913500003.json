We prove that, among all sets which consist of lattice translations of a given rectangular parallelepiped, a cube is the best shape to minimize the ratio involving its perimeter and volume as long as the cube is realizable by the lattice. For its proof a solvability of finite difference Poisson-Neumann problems is verified. Our approach to the isoperimetric inequality is based on the technique used in a proof of the Aleksandrov-Bakelman-Pucci maximum principle, which was originally proposed by Cabr (Butll Soc Catalana Mat 15: 7-27, 2000) to prove the classical isoperimetric inequality.", "paper_title": "A Discrete Isoperimetric Inequality on Lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000341913500003"}
