P-boxes and Dempster-Shafer structures are models that unify both kind of information, but they suffer from the main defect of intervals, the wrapping effect. We present here a new arithmetic that mixes, in a guaranteed manner, interval uncertainty with probabilities, while using some information about variable dependencies, hence limiting the loss from not accounting for correlations. This increases the precision of the result and decreases the computation time compared to standard p-box arithmetic.", "paper_title": "A generalization of p-boxes to affine arithmetic", "paper_id": "WOS:000303804100008"}
