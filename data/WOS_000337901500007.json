However, this paradigm raises several new privacy concerns that traditional privacy models do not handle. In addition, DaaS composition may reveal privacy-sensitive information. In this paper, we propose a formal privacy model in order to extend DaaS descriptions with privacy capabilities. The privacy model allows a service to define a privacy policy and a set of privacy requirements. We also propose a privacy-preserving DaaS composition approach allowing to verify the compatibility between privacy requirements and policies in DaaS composition. We propose a negotiation mechanism that makes it possible to dynamically reconcile the privacy capabilities of services when incompatibilities arise in a composition. We validate the applicability of our proposal through a prototype implementation and a set of experiments.", "paper_title": "Privacy-Enhanced Web Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000337901500007"}
