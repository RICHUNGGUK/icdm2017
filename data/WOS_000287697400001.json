In the case of k <= 2 a more elaborate argument gives the stronger bound, c(q,k)n(k). Using a recent result by Austrin and Mossel, this shows that a predicate on t bits, chosen at random among predicates accepting c(q,2)t(2) input vectors, is, assuming the unique games conjecture, likely to be approximation resistant. These results are close to tight: we show that there are other constants, c'(q,k), such that a randomly selected set of cardinality c'(q,k)n(k) points is unlikely to support a balanced k-wise independent distribution and, for some c > 0, a random predicate accepting ct(2)/logt input vectors is nontrivially approximable with high probability. In a different application of the result of Austrin and Mossel we prove that, again assuming the unique games conjecture, any predicate on t Boolean inputs accepting at least (32/33).2(t) inputs is approximation resistant. The results extend from balanced distributions to arbitrary product distributions.", "paper_title": "RANDOMLY SUPPORTED INDEPENDENCE AND RESISTANCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000287697400001"}
