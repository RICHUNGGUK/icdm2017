It has been conjectured (Fu et al., J Graph Theory 24 (1997), 187-191) that all (k, g)cages are k-connected for k >= 3. A connected graph G is said to be superconnected if every minimum cut-set S is the neighborhood of a vertex of minimum degree. Moreover, if G S has precisely two components, then G is called tightly superconnected. It was shown (Xu et al., Ars Combin 64 (2002)9181-192) that every (4, g)-cage is 4-connected. In this article, we prove that every (4, g)-cage is tightly superconnected when g is even and g >= 12. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
