In contrast, emotions have only emerged in artificial intelligence research as a serious topic in the last two decades. Year 2000, in particular, experienced a shift in attitude towards emotions and their relationship to human reasoning and human-computer interaction. This paper presents the second part of our research in this area, which aimed at interpreting psychological theories of emotions computationally and translating them into machine-implementable models. We continue with the previously selected psychological theories, namely Millenson (the psychology of emotion: theories of emotion perspective, Wiley, Hoboken, 1967) and Scherer (Soc Sci Inf 44(4):695-729, 2005), with exploration of the nature of emotional state. Fuzzy logic (FL) type-II is utilised here as a tool to capture the finer details of the psychological and computational interpretations of these theories. The paper presents a full theoretical formalism in FL type-II accompanied by implementation, using the De Montfort University Type-II Fuzzy Logic Toolbox, and detailed discussion of the complexity of the models' computational interpretation and implementation.", "paper_title": "Models for Computational Emotions from Psychological Theories Using Type-II Fuzzy Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000354884100004"}
