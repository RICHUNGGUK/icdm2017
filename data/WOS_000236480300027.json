In contrast to previous works, we derive profit from a finer dynamic programming construction, which takes advantage of the underlying grammatical structure, leading to an improved computational behavior and error repair quality. The formal description applies a deductive approach in order to simplify this task, separating it from the interpretation strategy, and including cut-off facilities.", "paper_title": "Robust spelling correction", "paper_id": "WOS:000236480300027"}
