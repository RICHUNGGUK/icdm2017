However, as schedules of modern construction projects become more and more compressed, the limitation of video-based analysis-intensive manual reviewing process-contrasts sharply with the need for effortless data analysis methods. This paper presents a study on developing a video interpretation model to interpret videos of construction operations automatically into productivity information. More specifically, this research formalizes key concepts and procedures of video interpretation within the construction domain. It focuses on designing a mechanism for furthering the crosstalk between the prior knowledge of construction operations and computer vision techniques. It uses this mechanism to guide the detection and tracking of project resources as well as work state classifications and abnormal production scenario identifications. The resulting approach has the potential to provide a common base for developing automated video interpretation procedures that can greatly improve current data collection and analyzes practices in construction. Experimental results from preliminary studies have shown the potential of the proposed video interpretation method as an improved productivity data analysis method.", "paper_title": "Computer Vision-Based Video Interpretation Model for Automated Productivity Analysis of Construction Operations", "paper_id": "WOS:000276691400003"}
