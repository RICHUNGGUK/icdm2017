The tree structure of GP naturally represents the features, and a new function generated in this work automatically decides the number of the features extracted. In experiments on two common epileptic EEG detection problems, the classification accuracy on the GP-based features is significant higher than on the original features. Simultaneously, the dimension of the input features for the classifier is much smaller than that of the original features. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
