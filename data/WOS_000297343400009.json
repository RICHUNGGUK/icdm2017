Our system includes two novel components. Firstly, to provide coherent and simplified output, we segment frames, and use optical flow to propagate segmentation information from frame to frame; an error control strategy is used to help ensure that the propagated information is reliable. Secondly, to achieve coherent and attractive coloring of the output, we use a color scheme replacement algorithm specifically designed for an online video stream. We demonstrate real-time performance for CIF videos, allowing our approach to be used for live communication and other related applications.", "paper_title": "Online Video Stream Abstraction and Stylization", "paper_id": "WOS:000297343400009"}
