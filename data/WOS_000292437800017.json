This tool, named OPUCEM, brings together formulas from multiple physics models and provides an error-checking machinery to improve reliability of numerical results. It also sets a novel example for an \"open-formula\" concept, which is an attempt to improve the reliability and reproducibility of computations in scientific publications by encouraging the authors to open-source their numerical calculation programs. Finally, we demonstrate the use of OPUCEM in two detailed case studies related to the fourth Standard Model family. The first is a generic fourth family study to find relations between the parameters compatible with the EW precision data and the second is the particular study of the flavor democracy predictions for both Dirac and Majorana-type neutrinos.

The available formulas in the literature sometimes contain typos and most of the time they are valid only under some specific conditions, not suitable for quick comparison across different studies nor direct implementation on a computer. Solution method: One loop exact calculation of the oblique parameters are collected into a freely available C/C++ library for a number of models. One-loop exact calculation of the contributions of a number of models to the oblique parameters are collected in a freely available C/C++ library. The public availability of the implementations and the internal error checking mechanism aim the correctness of the results. Additionally, the Graphical User Interface and auxiliary tools provide the means for rapid result comparison or update when new data becomes available. Unusual features: The library computes the oblique parameters S, T and U both with exact one-loop calculations and with well-defined approximations for a number of models to establish a certain level of confidence. The comparisons between exact and approximate computations, and amongst formulas from different papers provide an error checking machinery which improves the end user reliability.
