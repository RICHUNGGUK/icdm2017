Since CF systems rely on neighbors as information sources, the recommendation quality of CF depends on the recommenders selected. However, conventional CF has some fundamental limitations in selecting neighbors: recommender reliability proof, theoretical lack of credibility attributes, and no consideration of customers' heterogeneous characteristics. This study employs a multidimensional credibility model, source credibility from consumer psychology, and provides a theoretical background for credible neighbor selection. The proposed method extracts each consumer's importance weights on credibility attributes, which improves the recommendation performance by personalizing recommendations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
