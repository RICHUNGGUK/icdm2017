The capability of accurately verifying, locating, and recovering any tampered vertex is one of the most important issues. Published fragile watermarking 3D model schemes have a main drawback, the synchronization problem. To increase the capacity of verification and overcome this drawback, a high verification capacity reversible fragile watermarking scheme for 3D models in the spatial domain is proposed in this paper. Initially, a reversible quantization index modulation embedding scheme employs the principal component analysis (PCA) and modulates the distance from the vertex coordinate to the gravity center of the cover model. And, the spread spectrum technique is adopted to improve the robustness while obeying the sensitive fragility and low distortion requirements for watermarking 3D models. The proposed method can achieve that 100% vertices of the cover model can be watermarked, extracted and verified, while the other 3D fragile watermarking schemes can not. In the meanwhile, the synchronization problem is overcome. Moreover, the proposed method is immune to the causality and convergence problems. Finally, the proposed scheme is robust against vertex reordering and similarity transformation attacks.", "paper_title": "A HIGH VERIFICATION CAPACITY REVERSIBLE FRAGILE WATERMARKING SCHEME FOR 3D MODELS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287124500029"}
