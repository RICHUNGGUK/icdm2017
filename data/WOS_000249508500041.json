We emphasize on predictive accuracy, comprehensibility and interestingness of the rules. However, predictive accuracy, comprehensibility and interestingness of the rules often conflict with each other. This makes it a multi-objective optimization problem that is very difficult to solve efficiently. We have proposed a multi-objective genetic algorithm with a hybrid crossover operator for optimizing these objectives simultaneously. We have compared our rule discovery procedure with simple genetic algorithm with a weighted sum of all these objectives. The experimental result confirms that our rule discovery algorithm has a clear edge over simple genetic algorithm. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V.
