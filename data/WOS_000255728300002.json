In this paper I argue that functionalism is largely silent with respect to the extent of a realization. This is because functionalism describes only those functional relationships that de. ne a mental state: functionalism does not have the means by which to distinguish the realization of a mental state from causal influences on the realization. Because functionalism does not dictate the boundaries of the mind's realization, the case for extended mind must draw on non-functionalist considerations. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
