The objective is to find sub-matrices, i.e., maximal subgroups of genes and subgroups of conditions where the genes exhibit highly correlated activities over a range of conditions. Since these two objectives are mutually conflicting, they become suitable candidates for multi-objective modeling. In this study, a novel multi-objective evolutionary biclustering framework is introduced by incorporating local search strategies. A new quantitative measure to evaluate the goodness of the biclusters is developed. The experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate better performance as compared to existing algorithms available in literature. (c) 2006 Pattern Recognition Society.
