Random grid (RG) is an approach to solve pixel expansion problem. However, the existing VSS methods using RGs are confined to (2,n),(n,n) and (k,n). In this paper, RG-based VSS schemes for general access structures are proposed. The proposed algorithms can encode one secret image into n random grids while qualified sets can recover the secret visually. Furthermore, a cheating immune method is also presented to provided extra ability of cheat-preventing for RG-based VSS. Experimental results demonstrate that both the RG-based VSS for general access structures and cheating immune method are effective. More complicated sharing strategies can be implemented.
