A large test set of 357 PPAR ligands was screened against 48 PPAR models to determine the best models for agonists of PPAR-alpha, PPAR-delta, and PPAR-gamma. Afterwards, a parallel screen was performed using the 357 PPAR ligands and 47 structure-based models for PPARs, which were integrated into a 1537 models comprising in-house pharmacophore database, to assess the enrichment of PPAR ligands within the PPAR hypotheses. For these purposes, we categorized the 1537 database models into 181 protein targets and developed a score that ranks the retrieved targets for each ligand. Thus, we tried to find out if the concept of parallel screening is able to predict the correct pharmacological target for a set of compounds. The PPAR target was ranked first more often than any other target. This confirms the ability of parallel screening to forecast the pharmacological active target for a set of compounds.", "paper_title": "Pharmacophore modeling and parallel screening for PPAR ligands", "paper_id": "WOS:000251409500003"}
