The type assignment STA(B) is an extension of STA, a type assignment for lambda-calculus inspired by Lafont's Soft Linear Logic. We extend STA by means of a ground type and terms for booleans. The key point is that the elimination rule for booleans is managed in an additive way. Thus, we are able to program polynomial time Alternating Turing Machines. Conversely, we introduce a call-by-name evaluation machine in order to compute programs in polynomial space. As far as we know, this is the first characterization of PSPACE which is based on lambda calculus and light logics.", "paper_title": "A logical account of PSPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000256500600013"}
