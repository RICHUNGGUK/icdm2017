However, existing HCRF models of image segmentation do not allow multiple classes to be assigned to a single region, which limits their ability to incorporate contextual information across multiple scales. At higher scales in the image, this representation yields an oversimplified model since multiple classes can be reasonably expected to appear within large regions. This simplified model particularly limits the impact of information at higher scales. Since class-label information at these scales is usually more reliable than at lower, noisier scales, neglecting this information is undesirable. To address these issues, we propose a new consistency potential for image labeling problems, which we call the harmony potential. It can encode any possible combination of labels, penalizing only unlikely combinations of classes. We also propose an effective sampling strategy over this expanded label set that renders tractable the underlying optimization problem. Our approach obtains state-of-the-art results on two challenging, standard benchmark datasets for semantic image segmentation: PASCAL VOC 2010, and MSRC-21.", "paper_title": "Harmony Potentials", "paper_id": "WOS:000298810300005"}
