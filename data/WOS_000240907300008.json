However, human cognitive limitations and differences in attitude between people make this difficult. In this study, a psychological experiment was conducted to examine how blank thought balloons emitted from an embodied agent encourages perspective sharing between a user and an embodied agent. In the experiment, participants (N = 39) were asked to do one of these tasks: reading a thought balloon emitted from an embodied agent, or filling in a speech balloon, or a thought balloon with predicting its content. It is suggested that filling in a blank thought balloon promoted the user to accept the perspective of the embodied agent from the experimental results. Embodied agent technologies for perspective sharing between a user and others are discussed through comparison between the experimental environment and practical problems, and degree of participants' understanding of experimental environment.", "paper_title": "Inducing perspective sharing between a user and an embodied agent by a thought balloon as an input form", "paper_id": "WOS:000240907300008"}
