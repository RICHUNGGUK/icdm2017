The domain of the reference image is initially partitioned into triangular regions using edge and scale information, aiming to place vertices along image edges and increase the number of triangles in textured regions. A region-based matching algorithm is then used to find an initial disparity for each triangle, and a refinement stage is applied to change the disparity at the vertices of the triangles, generating a piecewise linear disparity map. A simple post-processing procedure is applied to connect triangles with similar disparities generating a full 3D mesh related to each camera (view), which are used to generate new synthesized views along the linear camera array. With the proposed framework, view interpolation reduces to the trivial task of rendering polygonal meshes, which can be done very fast, particularly when GPUs are employed. Furthermore, the generated views are hole-free, unlike most point-based view interpolation schemes that require some kind of post-processing procedures to fill holes.", "paper_title": "Stereo Matching and View Interpolation Based on Image Domain Triangulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000321927700003"}
