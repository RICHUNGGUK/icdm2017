To investigate their effectiveness and versatility, these algorithms were evaluated on three analytical tasks that depend on the discovery of repeated patterns: classifying folk song melodies into tune families, discovering themes and sections in polyphonic music, and discovering subject and countersubject entries in fugues. Each algorithm computes a compressed encoding of a point-set representation of a musical object in the form of a list of compact patterns, each pattern being given with a set of vectors indicating its occurrences. However, the algorithms adopt different strategies in their attempts to discover encodings that maximize compression. The best-performing algorithm on the folk-song classification task was COSIATEC, with a success rate of 84%. On the other tasks, variants of SIATECCompress performed best, scoring 45% precision and 60% recall on the thematic analysis task, and 21% precision and 55% recall on the fugue analysis task.", "paper_title": "Music Analysis and Point-Set Compression", "paper_id": "WOS:000362342700004"}
