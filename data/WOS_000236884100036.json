In this workshop paper, we present our view on modeling methods for workflow processes and introduce our research aiming for the development of an \"intelligent\" software tool for workflow process redesign. This tool uses two approaches to redesign workflows: an evolutionary approach, focussing on local updates to a given process, and a revolutionary approach, starting with a clean-sheet of paper.", "paper_title": "Intelligent tools for workflow process redesign: A research agenda", "paper_id": "WOS:000236884100036"}
