We propose a research field called juris-informatics to hope that we could make a great success like bio-informatics to introduce various techniques of informatics into legal domain. In this paper, we show our contributions to apply logic programing to formalizing and implementing burden of proof in legal reasoning.", "paper_title": "Logic Programming and Burden of Proof in Legal Reasoning", "paper_id": "WOS:000310870700002"}
