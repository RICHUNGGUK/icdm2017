It cannot be approximated within 33/29 (> 1.1379) unless P=NP, and the current best approximation algorithm achieves the ratio of 1.5. MAX SMTI remains NP-hard even when preference lists of one side do not contain ties, and it cannot be approximated within 21/19 (> 1.1052) unless P=NP. However, even under this restriction, the best known approximation ratio is still 1.5.
