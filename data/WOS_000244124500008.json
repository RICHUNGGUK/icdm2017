Its primary application is in normalization of array data as well as subsequent identification of 'enriched targets', e.g. differentially expressed genes in expression profiling arrays and enriched sites in ChIP-on-chip experimental data. We show how to accommodate the unique characteristics of ChIP-on-chip data, where the set of 'enriched targets' is large, asymmetric and whose proportion to the whole data varies locally.", "paper_title": "Functional genomics via multiscale analysis: application to gene expression and ChIP-on-chip data", "paper_id": "WOS:000244124500008"}
