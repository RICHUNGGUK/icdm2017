Based on designs of the single rail, single movement way, and long time while overhead hoist transport (OHT) loading and unloading, the OHT traffic jams are happened frequently. This will cause the OHT traffic jam seriously, and influence so much to the product cycle time. Observing the empirical operations for carrying lots and considering the effect and limitations from OHT transportation, this study proposes a heuristic OHT dispatching mile to expedite the movement of lots for reducing job waiting times. The objective is to minimize the transport delay of lots handling service under the automatic material handling environment in 300mm, wafer manufacturing. Numerical experiment results demonstrate that the heuristic dispatching method can effectively expedite the movements for lots delivery. The proposed method is very useful for shop floor control functions, such like scheduling and dispatching is in the 300mm fab-wide automated production environment.", "paper_title": "THE HEURISTIC DISPATCHING METHOD OF AUTOMATIC MATERIAL HANDLING SYSTEM IN 300MM SEMICONDUCTOR FABRICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000267923200015"}
