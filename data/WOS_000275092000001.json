In the case of constant advection, these methods and the traditional semi-Lagrangian ones are proven to be equivalent, but the conservative methods offer the possibility to add adequate filters in order to ensure the positivity. In the non-constant advection case, they present an alternative to the traditional semi-Lagrangian schemes which can suffer from bad mass conservation, in this time splitting setting.
