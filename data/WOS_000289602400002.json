Recently [Information Processing Letters 109 (2009)], an identity-based broadcast encryption scheme was proposed (Ren and Gu, 2009) [1], and it was claimed to be fully chosen-ciphertext secure without random oracles. However, by giving a concrete attack, we indicate that this scheme is even not chosen-plaintext secure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
