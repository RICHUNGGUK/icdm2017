Any reader can obtain each bit of the sealed string with an arbitrarily small error rate, while reading the string is detectable. The protocol is simple and easy to implement. The possibility of using this protocol to seal a single bit in practice is also briefly discussed.", "paper_title": "Quantum bit string sealing", "paper_id": "WOS:000240890100007"}
