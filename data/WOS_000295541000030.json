In the EDA, the individuals are encoded based on the activity-mode list (AML) and decoded by the multi-mode serial schedule generation scheme (MSSGS), and a novel probability model and an updating mechanism are proposed for well sampling the promising searching region. To further improve the searching quality, a multi-mode forward backward iteration (MFBI) and a multi-mode permutation based local search method (MPBLS) are proposed and incorporated into the EDA based search framework to enhance the exploitation ability. Based on the design-of-experiment (DOE) test, suitable parameter combinations are determined and some guidelines are provided to set the parameters. Simulation results based on a set of benchmarks and comparisons with some existing algorithms demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EDA. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
