The LUT approach is validated by considering two examples and by comparing the LUT results with mixed-mode (device-circuit) simulation results. This approach is implemented in a circuit simulator and integrated, for the first time, with an optimizer to enable efficient design of circuits, particularly those involving novel technologies for which compact models are not fully developed. Three FinFET-based circuits are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed environment. Furthermore, it is shown that the table-based platform can take into account variations in process, supply voltage, and temperature during the design.", "paper_title": "A Novel Table-Based Approach for Design of FinFET Circuits", "paper_id": "WOS:000267436000012"}
