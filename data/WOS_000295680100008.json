In this article local and global maximum properties of the volume on the space of all ellipsoids in C are studied, where ultra maximality is a stronger version of maximality: the volume is nowhere stationary. The ellipsoids for which the volume is locally maximum, resp. locally ultra maximum are characterized. The global maximum is the only local maximum and for generic C it is an ultra maximum. The characterizations make use of notions originating from the geometric theory of positive quadratic forms. Part of these results generalize to the case where the ellipsoids are replaced by affine copies of a convex body D. In contrast to the ellipsoid case, there are convex bodies C and D, such that on the space of all affine images of D in C the volume has countably many local maxima. All results have dual counterparts. Extensions to the surface area and, more generally, to intrinsic volumes are mentioned.", "paper_title": "John and Loewner Ellipsoids", "paper_id": "WOS:000295680100008"}
