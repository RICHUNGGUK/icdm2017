The main idea consists in keeping systematically a deep and subtle connection between the of any object and the object itself. Now applying similar ideas to the computation of , we aim to develop a new theory which allows one to determine homotopy groups of spaces. In this work we introduce the notion of , which will be the main definition of our theory, and present an algorithm computing the effective homotopy of a fibration. We also illustrate with examples some applications of our results.", "paper_title": "Effective homotopy of fibrations", "paper_id": "WOS:000304117800006"}
