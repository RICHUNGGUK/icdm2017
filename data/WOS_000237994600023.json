The proposed algorithm also takes into account the computing power and the network condition of each end-system as a control variable in order to avoid the undesirable case that end-systems are overloaded considering their limited resources. The multicast tree is constructed by clustering and modified Dijkstra's algorithms. Finally, we provide the experimental result and compare the proposed algorithm with other algorithms to show that it can provide an effective solution. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
