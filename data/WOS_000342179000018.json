Existing fully adaptive routing algorithms apply conservative VC re-allocation: only empty VCs can be re-allocated, which limits performance. We propose two novel flow control designs. First, whole packet forwarding (WPF) re-allocates a nonempty VC if the VC has enough free buffers for an entire packet. WPF does not induce deadlock if the routing algorithm is deadlock-free using conservative VC re-allocation. It is an important extension to several deadlock avoidance theories. Second, we extend Duato's theory to apply aggressive VC re-allocation on escape VCs without deadlock. Finally, we propose a design which maintains maximal routing flexibility with low hardware cost. For synthetic traffic, our design performs averagely 88.9 percent better than existing fully adaptive routing. Our design is superior to partially adaptive and deterministic routing.", "paper_title": "Novel Flow Control for Fully Adaptive Routing in Cache-Coherent NoCs", "paper_id": "WOS:000342179000018"}
