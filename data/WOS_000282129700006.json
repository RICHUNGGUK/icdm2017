This research investigates the scheduling problem on parallel batch processing machines in the presence of dynamic job arrivals and non-identical job sizes. The processing time and ready time of a batch are equal to the largest processing time and release time among all jobs in the batch, respectively. This problem is NP-hard in the strong sense, and hence two lower bounds were proposed to evaluate the performance of approximation algorithms. An ERT-LPT heuristic rule was next presented to assign batches to parallel machines. Two metaheuristics, a genetic algorithm (GA) and an ant colony optimisation (ACO) are further proposed using ERT-LPT to minimise makespan. The performances of the two approaches, along with a BFLPT-ERTLPT (BE) heuristic were compared by computational experiments. The results show that both metaheurisitcs outperform BE. GA is able to obtain better solutions when dealing with small-job instances compared to ACO, whereas ACO dominates GA in large-job instances.", "paper_title": "Metaheuristics to minimise makespan on parallel batch processing machines with dynamic job arrivals", "paper_id": "WOS:000282129700006"}
