Our experimental results show that the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm-based approaches are successful for sequence clustering. We look at a commonly used cluster validity index to verify our findings. The results for this index indicate that the clustering solutions are of high quality. As a case study, the obtained clusters are then used in a Web recommender system for representing usage patterns. As a result of the experiments, we see that these approaches can successfully be applied for generating clustering solutions that lead to a high recommendation accuracy in the recommender model we used in this paper.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective evolutionary clustering of Web user sessions: a case study in Web page recommendation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273561300004"}
