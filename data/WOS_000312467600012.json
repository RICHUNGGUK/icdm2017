The remeshing algorithms, which are herein adjusted to the needs of elastoplastic deformation analyses, are the Elastic Rebound approach, the Spring Analogy Method and the Radial Basis Functions. The remapping algorithms are the Inverse Distance Algorithm and two data interpolation schemes, namely the Radial Basis Point Interpolation Functions and the Radial Basis Functions. The efficiency and robustness of the algorithms are assessed by simulating the penetration of a rigid flat punch. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
