However, how geometric change to the dynamic alignment of IAK may affect stance phase of foot loading has not yet been fully explained. We have tested our informational framework through readily accessible benchmark data (Fregly et al. 2012): muscle contraction and ground reaction force are compounded into a wrench that is reciprocal to the IAK and resolved into component wrenches belonging to the reciprocal screw system. This revealed the special screw system that defines the freedom available to the knee and more precisely revealed how to measure this first order of freedom. After this step, we determined the reciprocal screw system, which involves the theory of equilibrium. Hence, a screw system of the first order will have a screw system of the fifth order as its reciprocal. We established a framework the estimation of reaction of constraints about the knee using a process that is simplified by the judicious generation of IAK for the first order of freedom in equilibrium.", "paper_title": "An informational framework to predict reaction of constraints using a reciprocally connected knee model", "paper_id": "WOS:000343244000008"}
