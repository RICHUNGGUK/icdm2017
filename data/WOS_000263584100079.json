In any realistic situation, however, there may exist \"exogenously fixed\" or non-discretionary factors that are beyond the control of a DMU's management, which also need to be considered. This paper proposes a slacks-based measure (SBM) of efficiency in the presence of non-discretionary factors in data envelopment analysis. This scalar measure deals directly with the discretionary input excess and the discretionary output shortfall of the decision making units (DMUs) concerned. The new measure has a close connection with the measure proposed by Banker and Morey (1986). We then apply this measure to a real world data set. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
