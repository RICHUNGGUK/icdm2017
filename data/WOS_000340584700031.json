By constructing the appropriate augmented Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, utilizing the theory of Kronecker product and the linear matrix inequality technique, we obtain the delay-dependent synchronization conditions which ensure the nonlinear coupled static neural networks with uncertainties in coupling matrices terms robust synchronization. The robust synchronization problem for the nonlinear hybrid coupled static delayed neural networks is first time investigated in this paper. At last, numerical example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.", "paper_title": "Robust synchronization analysis for static delayed neural networks with nonlinear hybrid coupling", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700031"}
