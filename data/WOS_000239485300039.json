To overcome this bottleneck, many traditional approaches were tested but failed. In this paper, a normal model of a web system was proposed to detect all selfs and all non-selfs, especially all unknown worms. The normal model was built on the 2-dimension attributes of space and time of the system. Moreover, a BP neural network was used to design an adaptive learning mechanism of the immunized web system. The non-self learning was utilized to recognize most unknown worms through the trained BP network, which was trained with the feature data in the worm database. Besides, the innate non-self selection was designed to recognize all known worms. Experiments validated effectiveness of this approach on the BP network and the normal model.", "paper_title": "Anti-worm immunization of web system based on normal model and BP neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300039"}
