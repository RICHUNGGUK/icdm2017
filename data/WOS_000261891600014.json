The fastest known algorithms for the problem are randomized algorithms that run in subexponential time. These algorithms are all ultimately based on the randomized subexponential simplex algorithms of Kalai and of Matousek, Sharir, and Welzl. Randomness seems to play an essential role in these algorithms. We use a completely different, and elementary, approach to obtain a deterministic subexponential algorithm for the solution of parity games. The new algorithm, like the existing randomized subexponential algorithms, uses only polynomial space, and it is almost as fast as the randomized subexponential algorithms mentioned above.", "paper_title": "A DETERMINISTIC SUBEXPONENTIAL ALGORITHM FOR SOLVING PARITY GAMES", "paper_id": "WOS:000261891600014"}
