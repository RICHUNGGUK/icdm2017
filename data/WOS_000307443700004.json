Various PUF implementation techniques have been proposed to translate chip-specific variations into a unique binary string. It is difficult to maintain repeatability of chip ID generation, especially over a wide range of operating conditions. To address this problem, we propose utilizing configurable ring oscillators and an orthogonal re-initialization scheme to improve repeatability. An implementation on a Xilinx Spartan-3e field-programmable gate array was tested on nine different chips. Experimental results show that the bit flip rate is reduced from 1.5% to approximately 0 at a fixed supply voltage and room temperature. Over a 20 degrees C-80 degrees C temperature range and 25% variation in supply voltage, the bit flip rate is reduced from 1.56% to 3.125 x 10(-7).", "paper_title": "An FPGA Chip Identification Generator Using Configurable Ring Oscillators", "paper_id": "WOS:000307443700004"}
