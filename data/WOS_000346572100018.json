The PPT of a host is the time elapsed between the arrival of a packet at the data-link layer and the time the packet is processed at the application layer (RFCs 2679 and 2681). To measure the PPT of a host, stamping the times when these two events occur is needed. However, time stamping at the data-link layer may require placing a specialized packet-capture card and the host under test in the same local network. This makes it complex to measure the PPT of remote end hosts. In this paper, we propose a scheme to measure the PPT of an end host connected over a single- or multiple-hop path and without requiring time stamping at the data-link layer. The proposed scheme is based on measuring the capacity of the link connected to the host under test. The scheme was tested on an experimental testbed and in the Internet, over a U.S. inter-state path and an international path between Taiwan and the U.S. We show that the proposed scheme consistently measures PPT of a host.", "paper_title": "Scheme to Measure Packet Processing Time of a Remote Host through Estimation of End-Link Capacity", "paper_id": "WOS:000346572100018"}
