Alternatively, builders can lease equipment, an option that, in addition to having the advantage of gaining access to the best available technologies at feasible cost, also benefits from the fact that providing maintenance is a contractual obligation of the lessor company. In this context, it must establish a maintenance policy to support the lessee company at an acceptable cost. Thus, this paper proposes a policy for developing an inspection program and forming inspection and maintenance response teams. The application of these concepts targets supporting maintenance planning by equipment-leasing companies in the construction industry. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
