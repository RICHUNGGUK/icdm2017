In this paper, we present a novel self-learning based image decomposition framework. Based on the recent success of sparse representation, the proposed framework first learns an over-complete dictionary from the high spatial frequency parts of the input image for reconstruction purposes. We perform unsupervised clustering on the observed dictionary atoms (and their corresponding reconstructed image versions) via affinity propagation, which allows us to identify image-dependent components with similar context information. While applying the proposed method for the applications of image denoising, we are able to automatically determine the undesirable patterns (e. g., rain streaks or Gaussian noise) from the derived image components directly from the input image, so that the task of single-image denoising can be addressed. Different from prior image processing works with sparse representation, our method does not need to collect training image data in advance, nor do we assume image priors such as the relationship between input and output image dictionaries. We conduct experiments on two denoising problems: single-image denoising with Gaussian noise and rain removal. Our empirical results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, which is shown to outperform state-of-the-art image denoising algorithms.", "paper_title": "Self-Learning Based Image Decomposition With Applications to Single Image Denoising", "paper_id": "WOS:000328948100008"}
