In this implementation, different tasks within the JPEG2000 encoding algorithm are allocated with proper computational resources to achieve high throughput. The proposed architecture is dynamically reconfigured for different tasks during the encoding process. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture provides a throughput of up to 52.1 f/s (or 19.18 ms/frame) to encode a 256x256 standard Lena test image. Compared with various digital signal processor & very long instruction word-based JPEG2000 solutions, the proposed architecture provides significant advantages in terms of throughput and energy consumption.", "paper_title": "High-Efficiency Customized Coarse-Grained Dynamically Reconfigurable Architecture for JPEG2000", "paper_id": "WOS:000326107500019"}
