For such processes we show that as kappa ->infinity, the expected proportion of vertices of degree k has power law parameter 1 + 1/n where eta is the limiting ratio of the expected number of edge endpoints inserted by preferential attachment to the expected total degree. The proof for the undirected process generalizes naturally to give similar results for the directed hub-authority process, and an undirected hypergraph process.", "paper_title": "Distribution of vertex degree in web-graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000239912200001"}
