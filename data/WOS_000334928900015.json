Learning objects created according to e-learning standards such as Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) play a major role in order to produce quality contents for e-learning. A virtual learning environment (VLE) is normally used to support e-learning by providing online courses and other learning activities. Moodle is one of the most widely used VLEs. However, Moodle still does not support the SCORM 2004 Sequencing and Navigation. This article proposes a new technique to create an e-tutorial module, one of the main services in e-learning that supports a certain level of SCORM 2004 Sequencing and Navigation on Moodle version 1.9.2+. This helps to provide learning with more control on the learning sequences and hence supports remediation learning strategy. Besides, study shows that courses built with learning objects complying with the SCORM 2004 standards are interoperable. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
