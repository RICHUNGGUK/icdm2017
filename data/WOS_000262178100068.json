Its backbone is formed by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) multicriteria method and our earlier research into the popularity and impact of a set of redesign \"best practices\". Using AHP, we derive a classification of most suitable directions for a particular process to be redesigned. Criteria such as the popularity, the impact, the goals and the risks of BPR implementation are taken into account. A case study is included to demonstrate the method's feasibility and effectiveness.
