We introduce a general tessellation method for visualizing the dual space around, within, and between biological molecules. Using Delaunay triangulation, a three-dimensional graph is constructed to provide a displayable discretization of the continuous volume. This graph structure is also used to compare the dual space of a system in two different states. Tessellator, a cross-platform implementation of the algorithm, is used to analyze the cavities within myoglobin, the protein-RNA docking interface between aspartyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNA Asp, and the ammonia channel in the hisH-hisF complex of imidazole glycerol phosphate synthase.
