Virtual Slope Walking, inspired by Passive Dynamic Walking, is introduced for gait generation. In Virtual Slope Walking, by actively extending the stance leg and shortening the swing leg, the robot walks on level ground as it walks down a virtual slope. In practical, Virtual Slope Walking is generated by connecting three key frames in the sagittal plane with sinusoids. Aiming for improving the walking stability, the parallel double crank mechanism are adopted in the leg structure. Experimental results show that Stepper-3D achieves a fast forward walking speed of 0.5 m/s and accomplishes omnidirectional walking. Stepper-3D performed fast and stable walking in the RoboCup 2008 Humanoid competitions. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
