In practice, RDF data may often suffer from the unreliability of their data sources, and exhibit errors or inconsistencies. In this paper, we model such unreliable RDF data by probabilistic RDF graphs, and study an important problem, keyword search query over probabilistic RDF graphs (namely, the pg-KWS query). To retrieve meaningful keyword search answers, we design the score rankings for subgraph answers specific for RDF data. Furthermore, we propose effective pruning methods (via offline pre-computed score bounds and probabilistic threshold) to quickly filter out false alarms. We construct an index over the pre-computed data for RDF, and present an efficient query answering approach through the index. Extensive experiments have been conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed approaches.", "paper_title": "Keyword Search Over Probabilistic RDF Graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000352608000007"}
