The parameter uncertainty is assumed to be norm-bounded. The problem to be addressed is the design of state feedback controllers such that the stability of the resulting closed-loop system, is guaran teed and a prescribed H., performance level is ensured for all admissible uncertainties. In terms of a linear matrix inequality (LMI), a sufficient condition, for the solvability of the problem is obtained. A desired non-fragile state feedback controller can be constructed by solving a certain LMI. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the application of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "NON-FRAGILE ROBUST H-infinity CONTROL FOR UNCERTAIN 2-D DELAYED SYSTEMS DESCRIBED BY THE GENERAL MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000271036900021"}
