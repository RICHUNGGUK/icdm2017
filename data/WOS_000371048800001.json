The customers of each of these zones must be serviced within time windows by dedicated routes originating at associated supply points characterized by hard time windows and very limited waiting facilities, if any. A key feature of the problem is that a vehicle can be used to cover routes in different zones at different times. The objective is to minimize the total transportation cost to ensure that the customers are serviced on time and that vehicles arrive at the next customer zone just in time for the next assignment. The problem is addressed by a decomposition-based heuristic. Lower-bound procedures and benchmark problem instances are introduced, highlighting the satisfactory performance of the heuristic. Finally, a wide range of sensitivity analyses on several key parameters reveal interesting facets of the behavior of this new problem class.", "paper_title": "Multi-Zone Multi-Trip Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows", "paper_id": "WOS:000371048800001"}
