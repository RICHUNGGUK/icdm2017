By adopting the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) technique, the latest IEEE 802.16x amendments manage to provide QoS-aware access services with full mobility support. A number of interesting scheduling and mapping schemes have been proposed in research literature. However, they neglect a considerable asset of the OFDMA-based wireless systems: the dynamic adjustment of the downlink-to-uplink width ratio. In order to fully exploit the supported mobile WiMAX features, we design, develop, and evaluate a rigorous adaptive model, which inherits its main aspects from the reinforcement learning field. The model proposed endeavours to efficiently determine the downlink-to-uplink width ratio, on a frame-by-frame basis, taking into account both the downlink and uplink traffic in the Base Station (BS). Extensive evaluation results indicate that the model proposed succeeds in providing quite accurate estimations, keeping the average error rate below 15% with respect to the optimal sub-frame configurations. Additionally, it presents improved performance compared to other learning methods (e.g., learning automata) and notable improvements compared to static schemes that maintain a fixed predefined ratio in terms of service ratio and resource utilization.", "paper_title": "RLAM: A dynamic and efficient reinforcement learning-based adaptive mapping scheme in mobile WiMAX networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000333531200002"}
