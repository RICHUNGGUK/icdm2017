This paper presents the application of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm to solve both offline and online parameter estimation problem for bilinear systems. First, an Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) is proposed to increase the convergence speed and accuracy of the basic particle swarm optimization to save tremendous computation time. An illustrative example for the modeling of bilinear systems is provided to confirm the validity, as compared with the Genetic Algorithm (GA), Linearly Decreasing Inertia Weight PSO (LDW-PSO), Nonlinear Inertia Weight PSO (NDW-PSO) and Dynamic Inertia Weight PSO (DIW-PSO) in terms of parameter accuracy and convergence speed. Second. APSO is also improved to detect and determine varying parameters. In this case, a sentry particle is introduced to detect any changes in system parameters. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm is a good promising particle swarm optimization algorithm for online parameter estimation. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
