An approximate rectangle of influence drawing (also called (epsilon (1),epsilon (2))-RID) is a proximity drawing of a graph such that: (i) if u,v are adjacent vertices then their rectangle of influence \"scaled down\" by the factor does not contain other vertices of the drawing; (ii) if u,v are not adjacent, then their rectangle of influence \"blown-up\" by the factor 1+epsilon (2) contains some vertices of the drawing other than u and v. Firstly, we prove that all planar graphs have an (epsilon (1),epsilon (2))-RID for any epsilon (1)> 0 and epsilon (2)> 0, while there exist planar graphs which do not admit an (epsilon (1),0)-RID and planar graphs which do not admit a (0,epsilon (2))-RID. Then, we investigate (0,epsilon (2))-RIDs; we prove that both the outerplanar graphs and a suitably defined family of graphs without separating 3-cycles admit this type of drawing. Finally, we study polynomial area approximate rectangle of influence drawings and prove that (0,epsilon (2))-RIDs of proper track planar graphs (a superclass of the outerplanar graphs) can be computed in polynomial area for any epsilon (2)> 2. As for values of epsilon (2) such that epsilon (2)a parts per thousand currency sign2, we describe a drawing algorithm that computes (0,epsilon (2))-RIDs of binary trees in area , where c is a positive constant, f(epsilon (2)) is a poly-logarithmic function that tends to infinity as epsilon (2) tends to zero, and n is the number of vertices of the input tree.", "paper_title": "The Approximate Rectangle of Influence Drawability Problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000354066300012"}
