A sequential implementation of the integrated probability data association (IPDA) algorithm under random set framework is derived. Under the assumptions of different detection probabilities and different clutter densities of individual sensor in a multi-sensor system, we reach the conclusion that the sequential IPDA filter depends on the order analyzing the target existence probability of varying sensor orders. Moreover, we obtain the optimal order of sensors for the sequential IPDA filter in terms of maximizing the target existence probability. The conclusions are demonstrated by simulation results.", "paper_title": "On the sensor order in sequential integrated probability data association filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000300774900001"}
