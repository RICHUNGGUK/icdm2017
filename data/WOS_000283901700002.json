A connection is then established between the formulations for graddiv stabilized Taylor-Hood elements: under mild restrictions, the formulations' velocity solutions converge to each other (and to the Scott-Vogelius solution) as the stabilization parameter tends to infinity. Thus the benefits of using Scott-Vogelius elements can be obtained with the less expensive Taylor-Hood elements, and moreover the benefits of all the formulations can be retained if the rotational formulation is used. Numerical examples are provided that confirm the theory. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
