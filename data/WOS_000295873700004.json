The results show the existence of recirculation areas behind the baffles in a way that the extension of these regions dwindles with increasing the number of baffles, leading the fluid flow to approach plug-flow conditions. Baffle wall arrangement are conducted, to improve the unit's performance in terms of higher effective contact time (lower Morrill Index). The results from the new proposed arrangement with six baffle walls show an improvement of about 13% increase in effective contact time compared with that of the original baffle arrangement.
