Advancements and challenges in using nanometer IC processes are addressed, and the impacts of device scaling on wireless systems are discussed. Recent advances in device technologies and system architectures are presented. State-of-the-art low power wireless systems, both from academia and from industry, are summarized. Circuit design techniques and challenges for low voltage and low power applications are discussed, along with RF performance and power trade-offs. Examples of common RF building blocks, e.g. LNA's and VCO's, designed for sub-1V power supplies are presented.", "paper_title": "Current status of CMOS low voltage and low power wireless IC designs", "paper_id": "WOS:000250461500003"}
