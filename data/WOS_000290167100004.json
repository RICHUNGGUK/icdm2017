Our eye-mark recorder provides a wide field-of-view video recording of the user's exact view by positioning the focal point of the mirror at the user's viewpoint. The vertical angle of view of the prototype is 122 degree (elevation and depression angles are 38 and 84 degree, respectively) and its horizontal view angle is 116 degree (nasal and temporal view angles are 38 and 78 degree, respectively). We implemented and evaluated a gaze estimation method for our eye-mark recorder. We use an appearance-based approach for our eye-mark recorder to support a wide field-of-view. We apply principal component analysis (PCA) and multiple regression analysis (MRA) to determine the relationship between the captured images and their corresponding gaze points. Experimental results verify that our eye-mark recorder successfully captures a wide field-of-view of a user and estimates gaze direction with an angular accuracy of around 2 to 4 degree.", "paper_title": "A Wide-View Parallax-Free Eye-Mark Recorder with a Hyperboloidal Half-Silvered Mirror and Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290167100004"}
