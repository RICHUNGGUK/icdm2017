Given that the batch scheduling problem is NP-hard, it is decomposed into three sub-problems: batch forming, machine assignment and batch sequencing. A novel algorithm named weighted nested partitions based on differential evolution (WNPDE) is proposed for the most critical sub-problem: machine assignment sub-problem. The WNPDE retains the global perspective of nested partitions algorithm and the local search capabilities of differential evolution (DE) algorithm. Experimental results indicate that the proposed WNPDE algorithm has high efficiency to minimise the total weighted tardiness (TWT).", "paper_title": "Weighted nested partitions based on differential evolution (WNPDE) algorithm-based scheduling of parallel batching processing machines (BPM) with incompatible families and dynamic lot arrival", "paper_id": "WOS:000290792500003"}
