Traditional histogram construction algorithms, e.g., V-Optimal, use error measures which are the sums of a suitable function, e.g., square, of the error at each point. Although the best-known algorithms for solving these problems run in quadratic time, a sequence of results have given us a linear time approximation scheme for these algorithms. In recent years, there have been many emerging applications where we are interested in measuring the maximum (absolute or relative) error at a point. We show that this problem is fundamentally different from the other traditional non-l(infinity) error measures and provide an optimal algorithm that runs in linear time for a small number of buckets. We also present results which work for arbitrary weighted maximum error measures.", "paper_title": "A note on linear time algorithms for maximum error histograms", "paper_id": "WOS:000247177500009"}
