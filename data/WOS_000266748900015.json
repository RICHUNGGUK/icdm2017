A benzenoid graph G is elementary if every edge belongs to a 1-factor of G. A hexagon of an elementary benzenoid graph is peripheral if it has some edge lying on the boundary of the graph. A peripheral hexagon h of an elementary benzenoid graph G is reducible if the removal of the internal vertices and edges of the common path of the peripheries of h and G results in an elementary benzenoid graph. The vertices of the inner dual I(G) of a plane graph G are the finite faces of G, two vertices being adjacent if and only if the corresponding faces share an edge in G. If S is a set of edges of I(G) which do not belong to the infinite face of I(G) such that I(G) \\ S is the graph where every finite face is a 4-cycle, then S is called a 4-tiling of G. We describe a procedure to compute a 4-tiling of an elementary benzenoid graph in linear time. This computation is the basis for an optimal algorithm to find the sequence of reducible hexagons that decompose a graph of this class.", "paper_title": "4-tilings of benzenoid graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000266748900015"}
