In our strategy, the computation of a single huge SW matrix is spread over multiple GPUs, which communicate border elements to the neighbour, using a circular buffer mechanism that hides the communication overhead. We compared 4 pairs of human-chimpanzee homologous chromosomes using 2 different GPU environments, obtaining a performance of up to 140.36 GCUPS (Billion of cells processed per second) with 3 heterogeneous GPUS.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grain Parallel Megabase Sequence Comparison with Multiple Heterogeneous GPUs", "paper_id": "WOS:000349142100039"}
