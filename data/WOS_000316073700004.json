The datasets X are sampled randomly from a domain Omega, equipped with a distance, rho, and an underlying probability distribution, mu. While performing an asymptotic analysis, we send the intrinsic dimension d of Omega to infinity, and assume that the size of a dataset, n, grows superpolynomially yet subexponentially in d. Exact similarity search refers to finding the nearest neighbour in the dataset X to a query point omega a Omega, where the query points are subject to the same probability distribution mu as datapoints. Let denote a class of all 1-Lipschitz functions on Omega that can be used as decision functions in constructing a hierarchical metric tree indexing scheme. Suppose the VC dimension of the class of all sets {omega:f(omega)a parts per thousand yena}, aaa\"e is o(n (1/4)/log(2) n). (In view of a 1995 result of Goldberg and Jerrum, even a stronger complexity assumption d (O(1)) is reasonable.) We deduce the Omega(n (1/4)) lower bound on the expected average case performance of hierarchical metric-tree based indexing schemes for exact similarity search in (Omega,X). In paricular, this bound is superpolynomial in d.", "paper_title": "Lower Bounds on Performance of Metric Tree Indexing Schemes for Exact Similarity Search in High Dimensions", "paper_id": "WOS:000316073700004"}
