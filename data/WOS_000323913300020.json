Many authors have used minimal cost paths, or geodesics relative to a local weighting potential P, to find a vessel pathway between two end points. We utilize a set of such geodesic paths to find a tubular tree structure by seeking minimal interaction. We introduce a new idea that we call geodesic voting or geodesic density. The approach consists of computing geodesics from a set of end points scattered in the image which flow toward a given source point. The target structure corresponds to image points with a high geodesic density. The \"Geodesic density\" is defined at each pixel of the image as the number of geodesics that pass over this pixel. The potential P is defined in such way that it takes low values along the tree structure, therefore geodesics will migrate toward this structure thereby yielding a high geodesic density. We further adapt these methods to segment complex tree structures in a noisy medium and apply them to segment microglia extensions from confocal microscope images as well as vessels.
