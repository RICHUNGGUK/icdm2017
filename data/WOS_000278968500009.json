We assume that all sensors could adjust their transmission ranges and aggregate data received from other sensors. We adopt a collision-free transmission model using proper schedules for data transmission. We study the problem of finding the schedule under which data from all sensors could be transmitted to the data sink in the minimal time. We propose an approximation algorithm for this NP-hard problem whose performance ratio is bounded by a constant. This significantly improves the existing approximation algorithm that does not have a constant performance ratio.", "paper_title": "Approximation algorithm for minimal convergecast time problem in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000278968500009"}
