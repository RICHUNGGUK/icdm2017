In most of the existing position-based routing algorithms the nodes use the maximum transmission power to discover neighbors, which may cause excessive power consumption. This paper presents several localized power-aware 3D position-based routing algorithms that increase the lifetime of a network by maximizing the average lifetime of its nodes. New algorithms are semi-beacon less, using for neighbor discovery an optimal transmission range (OR) for control packets, and, if needed, maximal transmission range (MR) during routing process. and using adjusted transmission radius for message transmission. PAGR algorithm selects neighbor closest to destination among those within OR if any exists providing progress, or otherwise among those within MR. If greedy progress is not possible, PAGR:CFace(1) variant resorts to face routing on projected network in coordinate plane until recovery is possible, at which point PAGR algorithm resumes. We evaluate our algorithms and compare their power savings with the current power-aware routing algorithms. The simulation results show a significant improvement in the overall network lifetime.
