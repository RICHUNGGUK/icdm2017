Source concepts for CCC were mapped by the project team, where possible, to pre-coordinated ICNP terms. The manual decomposition of source concepts according to the ICNP 7-Axis Model served to validate the mappings. A total of 62%, of the CCC Nursing Diagnoses were a pre-coordinated match to all ICNP concept, 35% were a post-coordinated match and only 3% had no match. During the mapping process, missing CCC concepts were submitted to the ICNP Programme, with a recommendation for inclusion in future releases.", "paper_title": "Translation and Integration of CCC Nursing Diagnoses into ICNP", "paper_id": "WOS:000260905500014"}
