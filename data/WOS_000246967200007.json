Comparison with the average upper continental crust identified natural regional features, such as a relative enrichment of As, due to a low-lying deltaic environment, and of Cr and Zr, related to a specific heavy mineral association. Identification of diffuse contamination is best achieved by comparison with a local reference. The Zeeland subsoil is shown to have undergone only minor anthropogenic influence and to serve this purpose very well. A topsoil-subsoil comparison revealed anthropogenic enrichments for Cell, Cu, P, Pb, S, Sb, Sri, Zn, and partly for As, while typically 'non-anthropogenic' trace elements like Cs, Ga, La, and Rb were found not to be enriched. Except for P and S, the enriched components show a good correlation with Al2O3, a proxy for clay mineralogy, and a bivariate topsoil-subsoil comparison is made using a trimmed Reduced Major Axis regression. Two subregions are identified with different associations (Zn, Pb, and Cd, versus As, Cd, Cu, and Sri) of higher-than-average enrichments.", "paper_title": "Patterns in soil quality: Natural geochemical variability versus anthropogenic impact in soils of Zeeland, The Netherlands", "paper_id": "WOS:000246967200007"}
