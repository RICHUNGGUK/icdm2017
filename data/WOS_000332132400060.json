In this paper, a novel similarity measure (SIMshape) invariant to these basic distortions and any combinations of them is proposed. It is parameter-free and easy to implement. Specifically, a multi-scale shape approximation for time series based on Discrete Haar Wavelet Transform, key point extraction and symbolization is presented first; then, based on this proposed representation and a scale-weight factor, a robust similarity measure is proposed. The novelty of SIMshape lies in two aspects as follows: (a) symbolizing key points sequence extracted from approximate wavelet coefficients; (b) adding the scale-weight factor and shape similarity in the similarity criterion. To show the effectiveness and efficiency, SIMshape is compared with other popular methods Euclidean Distance (ED), LB_keogh, Complexity Invariant Distance (CID), and ASEAL (Approximate Shape Exchange ALgorithm) using two indices: the number of kinds of distortions and the degree of distortion. Obtained results show that compared with ED, CID, LB_keogh, and ASEAL, SIMshape has better robustness in synthetic data, and shows better performance in real time series classification.
