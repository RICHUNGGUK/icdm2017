Inverter-based distributed generators (DGs) can operate either as voltage-controlled voltage source inverters (VCVSI) or current-controlled voltage source inverters (CCVSI). VCVSIs provide the voltage and frequency support, whereas CCVSIs regulate the generated active and reactive powers. The proposed control structure has two main layers. The first layer deals with the voltage and frequency control of VCVSIs. The second layer regulates the active and reactive powers of CCVSIs. These controllers are implemented through two communication networks with one-way communication links and are fully distributed; each DG only requires its own information and the information of its neighbors on the communication network graph. The proposed control framework is verified on a microgrid test system and IEEE 34 test feeder.", "paper_title": "A Multiobjective Distributed Control Framework for Islanded AC Microgrids", "paper_id": "WOS:000340428100010"}
