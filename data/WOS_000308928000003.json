Traditional public key mechanisms are not appropriate because of the large number of messages that have to be transmitted. We first show that a recently proposed scheme, the TSVC based on TESLA is subject to an impersonation attack, and propose a modification that secures it. We then propose a communication scheme based on a variant of TESLA, for which packets are self-authenticating and combine both schemes to get a hybrid scheme that addresses in a flexible way the mobility requirements of V2V communications.", "paper_title": "Secure and privacy-preserving, timed vehicular communications", "paper_id": "WOS:000308928000003"}
