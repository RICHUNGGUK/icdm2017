Stability results for this stabilization method are established. For the Darcy flow, optimal error estimates in the divergence norm for velocity and suboptimal error estimates in the -norm for pressure are obtained, and a superconvergence result for the pressure is derived; a local postprocessing scheme is constructed to generate optimal error estimates in the L (2)-norm for pressure. For the coupled Darcy-Stokes flow, error estimates of optimal order are obtained in terms of the energy norm of velocity and pressure. Numerical results are presented to check the theory developed.", "paper_title": "Analysis of the pressure projection stabilization method for the Darcy and coupled Darcy-Stokes flows", "paper_id": "WOS:000328319900013"}
