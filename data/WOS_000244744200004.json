Although it is true that lumped mass models with a limited number of masses, or even consistent mass formulations with a small number of members, will not be able to reproduce correctly wave propagation effects, particularly for high frequencies (short wavelengths), these effects can be accurately reproduced when using a large number of masses or members, or more conveniently using a frequency domain formulation and the dynamic stiffness matrices for members with distributed mass. This article presents the detailed derivation of the dynamic stiffness matrix of a prismatic member with distributed masses (continuous mass distribution), and its application to the linear dynamic analysis of structures in the frequency domain. The formulation is then verified with a series of simple examples.", "paper_title": "Dynamic stiffness matrices for analyses in the frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000244744200004"}
