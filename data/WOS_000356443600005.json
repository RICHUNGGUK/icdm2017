The NPS measure is obtained from the spectral analysis of space-differential iEEG signals. Ratio between the NPS values obtained from two specific frequency bands is then investigated as a robust generalized measure, and reveals invaluable information about seizure initiation trends. A threshold-based classifier is subsequently applied on the proposed measure to generate alarms. The performance of the method was evaluated using cross-validation on a large clinical dataset, involving 183 seizure onsets in 1785 h of long-term continuous iEEG recordings of 11 patients. On average, the results show a high sensitivity of 86.9% (159 out of 183), a very low false detection rate of 1.4 per day, and a mean detection latency of 13.1 s from electrographic seizure onsets, while in average preceding clinical onsets by 6.3 s. These high performance results, specifically the short detection latency, coupled with the very low computational cost of the proposed method make it adequate for using in implantable closed-loop seizure suppression systems.", "paper_title": "Early Seizure Detection Using Neuronal Potential Similarity: A Generalized Low-Complexity and Robust Measure", "paper_id": "WOS:000356443600005"}
