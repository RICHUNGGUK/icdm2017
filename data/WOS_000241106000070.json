However, existing approaches for mining sequential patterns are designed for point-based events. In many applications, the essence of events are interval-based, such as disease suffered, stock price increase or decrease, chatting etc. This paper presents a new algorithm to discover temporal pattern from temporal sequences database consisting of interval-based events.", "paper_title": "Mining temporal patterns from sequence database of interval-based events", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000070"}
