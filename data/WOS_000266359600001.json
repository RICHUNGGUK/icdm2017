This paper proposed a security bootstrap model of key pre-sharing by a polynomial group based on (t, n) threshold schema of Lagrange Polynomial Group (LPG) and one-way hash function to establish a distributive security infrastructure. This model includes the following two processes: (1) the first phase is to set up a key pre-sharing mechanism based on one-way hash function and Lagrange Interpolation Polynomial Group (LIPG); and (2) the second phase mainly deals with recovering key in a more secure way based oil the digital signature of threshold schema. The one-way hash approach can prevent the spitted key pieces in a key pool from being exposed efficiently. In addition, the threshold digital signature can detect and block the DoS attack and other malicious fraudulent actions efficiently during the processes of key reconstruction and recovery. We performed the experiment under the OPNET Simulation environment to validate the proposed approach from the points of view of computation complexity, the security of bootstrap process, the performance of establishing secure links, the capability of resisting the capture and the network scale, etc. The experimental results show that this approach can ensure the security of MANET environment with better performance.
