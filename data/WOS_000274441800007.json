To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in the area of proxy MIPv6 authentication method. This paper proposes an authentication method in proxy MIPv6. In addition to providing access authentication, the proposed authentication method prevents threats such as replay attack and key exposure. Also, we develop analytic models for the authentication latency and cost analysis. Then, the impacts of mobility and traffic parameters on the authentication cost and latency are analyzed, respectively.
