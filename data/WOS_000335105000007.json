A non-linear fluid solid coupling finite element model is established and method for smeared cracking finite element model is presented. The evolutionary characteristic length method focuses on continuous adaptation of the crack band width which is based on the incremental finite element solution and the idea of nonlocal continuum. An interface coupling method is proposed to achieve the transition from a coarser mesh to a finer one. The results of two numerical examples indicate the superiority of the present formulation over the standard smeared crack model. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
