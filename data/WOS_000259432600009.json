However, there exists the requirement for a comprehensive and integrated view oil trust in the VEs settings. This paper introduces the theory of Fuzzy Cognitive Time Maps (FCTMs) into modeling and evaluating trust relationships and shows]low relevant is the inter-organizational trust based oil trust sources and their credibility. This study has two main contributions. First, it addresses the essential factors of trust in the VEs situation by examining the triple relations of trust factors. Second, the paper proposes a methodology by taking dynamic nature of trust into account to analyze evolution of trust in the VEs setting. Finally, a case study of swift trust is presented. The established cognitive map illustrates the changes of different factors and their effects oil the final trusts. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
