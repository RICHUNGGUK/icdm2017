We note and correct some problems with the original formulae, study the stability of the resulting approximation using some simulations, and suggest an alternative method of computation using a parametric bootstrap. The alternative method is more stable than the algebraic approximation and is faster when the number of predictors is large. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
