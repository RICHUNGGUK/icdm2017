Collaborative simulation issues include the modeling of coupled multidisciplinary systems, and the simulation running time integration of these models that are solved parallelly. Estimation of the local truncation error of coupling models is the key to solve multidisciplinary collaborative simulation problem, which is actually used to restrict the simulation step. This paper presents a variable-step method based on Richardson extrapolation for calculating the local truncation error to solve collaborative simulation problem of multidisciplinary coupling models. Formulas for estimating the local truncation error are derived through theoretical analysis by using integration methods and interpolation technologies, respectively. The simulation experiments are illustrated to validate the accuracy and efficiency of proposed collaborative simulation algorithm in comparison with the usual combinative algorithm.", "paper_title": "Truncation error calculation based on Richardson extrapolation for variable-step collaborative simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000290941000014"}
