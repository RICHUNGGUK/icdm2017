This type of partitionings are critical for existing and emerging applications in very large scale integration (VLSI) computer-aided design (CAD) as they allow to both minimize and evenly distribute the interconnects across the physical devices. Our experimental evaluation on the International Symposium on Physical Design (ISPD98) benchmark show that our algorithms produce solutions, which when compared against those produced by hMeTiS have a maximum subdomain degree that is reduced by up to 36% while achieving comparable quality in terms of cut.", "paper_title": "Multiobjective hypergraph-partitioning algorithms for cut and maximum subdomain-degree minimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000235623300010"}
