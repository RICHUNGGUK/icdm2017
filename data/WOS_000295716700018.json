These two methods can give the interval estimation of true value from the framework of non-probabilistic theory under the condition of few sample points for the uncertain parameters. The uncertainty propagation analysis for the structural responses is implemented based on the quantification results of the uncertain structural parameters. Research on the comparisons of these two methods is performed by a plane truss structure with ten bars, and the numerical results show the feasibility and validity of the proposed methods.
