Several measures have been proposed to minimize inequity of a system. This paper considers an extension to the minimum p-envy location model by evaluating the objective of the model based on a survival function instead of on a distance function since survival probability is directly related to patient outcomes with a constraint on minimum survival rate. The model was tested on a real world data set from the EMS system at Hanover County, VA, and also compared to other location models. The results indicate that, not only does the enhanced p-envy model reduce inequity but we also find that more lives can be saved by using the survival function objective. A sensitivity analysis on different quality of service measures (survival probability and traveled distance) and different choices of priority assigned to serving facility is discussed.
