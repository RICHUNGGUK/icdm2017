By generalising from pattern matching to pattern unification, interaction becomes symmetrical, with information flowing in both directions. CPC provides a natural language to express trade where information exchange is pivotal to interaction. The unification allows some patterns to be more discriminating than others; hence, the behavioural theory must take this aspect into account, so that bisimulation becomes subject to compatibility of patterns. Many popular process calculi can be encoded in CPC; this allows for a gain in expressiveness, formalised through encodings.", "paper_title": "A CONCURRENT PATTERN CALCULUS", "paper_id": "WOS:000347714800011"}
