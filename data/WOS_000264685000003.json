Finite elements are used in the meridian plane and Fourier modes are used in the azimuthal direction. Parallelization is made with respect to the Fourier modes. Continuity conditions across interfaces are enforced using an interior penalty technique. The performance of the method is illustrated on kinematic and full dynamo configurations.
