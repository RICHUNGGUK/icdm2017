The package incorporates state-of-the-art algorithms so as to minimize the computer generation time. In addition, it is designed in a way that (i) the generation efficiency is robust to changes of computer architecture; (ii) memory allocation is flexible; and (iii) the exported objects can be easily integrated with other software. The usage of this package is then illustrated and evaluated in terms of various performance metrics. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
