They evaluate unknown neuron functions from given functional families during the training process. General functional networks with two variables training data set (GFN), separable functional networks (SFN) and associativity functional networks (AFN) are applied to forecast a realworld example. In addition, we compare them with back-propagation neural network (BPNN) in terms of the same measurements. The results reveal that the landslide displacement prediction using functional networks is reasonable and effective, and GFN are consistently better than the other two types of functional networks and BPNN.
