The method is based on a new index, which takes into consideration two levels of processors heterogeneity: the number of cores per node and the computational power of each core. The experimental results show that this index allows achieving balanced workload distributions even on those clusters where heterogeneity can not be neglected.", "paper_title": "A load index and load balancing algorithm for heterogeneous clusters", "paper_id": "WOS:000322326800010"}
