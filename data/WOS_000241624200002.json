It is difficult to adapt the traditional link-based web crawler for this task because of the sparse linkage and data-centered webpage of the relevant resources. In this paper, we propose a meta-search based method enhanced with auxiliary crawling to address the problem caused by sparse linkage of the relevant resources. And to retrieve the data-centered webpages efficiently, domain schema is defined to describe the target resource, and representative data instances are selected for meta-search query composing. Moreover, evaluation criteria for the domain resource survey are also proposed as the guideline for query composing and auxiliary crawling, which enable the resource discovery to be automatically performed by computers. Experiment results on real-world data show that our method is effective and efficient.", "paper_title": "Meta-search based Web resource discovery for object-level vertical search", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200002"}
