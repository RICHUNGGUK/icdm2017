Adding binary variables does not improve the bound of the linear-programming relaxation. On the contrary, added binary variables increase the computational burden in the solution process if problems get large. Therefore, a formulation without binary variables should be more efficient. Accordingly, this study proposes a piecewise-linear approach to formulate an S-shaped membership function (MF) without adding any extra binary variables, which improves the efficiency of fuzzy-linear programming in solving decision/management problems with S-shaped MFs. Finally, a computational experiment is provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models. An illustrative example is also provided to show the usefulness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "An Approximation Approach for Representing S-Shaped Membership Functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000276097400014"}
