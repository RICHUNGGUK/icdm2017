By adaptively routing the packets and balancing the network load, we demonstrate by some simulations the effectiveness of this approach when compared with a shortest-path routing scheme, achieving a performance that is comparable to the Poisson traffic scenario in some cases. The proposed algorithm can be used as a viable alternative to traffic shaping techniques.", "paper_title": "Addressing self-similarity in optical switching networks by means of ant colony optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000252640700005"}
