These cells have the same core (i.e., 6T) but they employ different numbers of MOSFETs to implement the so-called instantly ON, normally OFF mode of operation. The additional transistors are utilized for the restore operation to ensure that the data stored in the nonvolatile circuitry can be written back into the FF core once the power is made available. These three cells (7T, 9T, and 11T) are extensively analyzed in terms of their operations in 32 nm technology, such as operational delays (for the write, read, and restore operations), the static noise margin (SNM), critical charge and process variations (in both the MOSFETs and the resistive element). Simulation results show that an increase in the number of MOSFETs in the cells causes improvements in critical charge and tolerance to process variations at the expense of an increase in power dissipation. The SNM and the delay of the restore operation, however, do not necessarily increase with the number of MOSFETs in the cell, but rather on the control of access to the storage nodes from the single MTJ.", "paper_title": "On the Nonvolatile Performance of Flip-Flop/SRAM Cells With a Single MTJ", "paper_id": "WOS:000355218000017"}
