The issue is particularly subtle in the expansive case of approaches to languages with name-binding. In prior work, adequacy has been formalized only with respect to specific representation techniques. In this article, we give a general formal definition based on model-theoretic isomorphisms or interpretations. We investigate and formalize an adequate interpretation of untyped lambda-calculus within a higher-order metalanguage in Isabelle/HOL using the Nominal Datatype Package. Formalization elucidates some subtle issues that have been neglected in informal arguments concerning adequacy.", "paper_title": "Formalizing Adequacy: A Case Study for Higher-order Abstract Syntax", "paper_id": "WOS:000305832500006"}
