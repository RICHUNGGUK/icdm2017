Often, such systems are expected to function in an environment where uncertainty in system parameters is common. In such an environment, the amount of processing required to complete a task may fluctuate substantially. Determining a resource allocation that accounts for this uncertainty in a way that can provide a probability that a given level of QoS is achieved is an important area of research. We have designed novel techniques for maximizing the probability that a given level of QoS is achieved. These techniques feature a unique application of both path relinking and local search within a Genetic Algorithm. In addition, we define a new methodology for finding resource allocations that are guaranteed to have a non-zero probability of addressing the timing constraints of the system. We demonstrate the use of this methodology within two unique steady-state genetic algorithms designed to maximize the robustness of resource allocations. The performance results for our techniques are presented for a simulated environment that models a heterogeneous cluster-based radar data processing center. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
