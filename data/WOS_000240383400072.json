The mobile intelligence that is presented in this paper optimizes context-aware middleware on a wireless device (a PDA) for a smart home. We presented a system architecture and class diagram of the mobile intelligence controller for automatic service of consumer electronics. We implemented an ECG sensor, environment sensor and a consumer device driver for our experiment. We applied a SVM (Support Vector Machine) to decide on home service through recognition of the user and environment contexts. To increase the pattern algorithm's precision, we applied different importance of contexts according to the characteristics of consumer electronics.", "paper_title": "Research and implementation on the mobile intelligent controller for home automation service", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400072"}
