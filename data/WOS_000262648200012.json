This time delay degrades the transient performance of digital control switching power supplies. By overcoming the sampling and calculation time effect and to calibrate the ripple that occurs during switching cycles, new control algorithm is proposed in this paper to improve the transient performance of switching power supplies by eliminating the time delay in the control loop. Simulation results show the improvement of load transient performance by the proposed algorithms. Experimental system is also set up to verify the analysis and computer simulation results.", "paper_title": "ELIMINATION OF TIME DELAY IN DIGITAL CONTROL LOOP OF SWITCHING DC-DC CONVERTERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000262648200012"}
