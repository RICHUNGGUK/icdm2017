A finite-control-set model-based predictive control algorithm is developed for the control of the active rectifier front-ends. Pulse width modulation is used for the isolation back-ends. A solid-state transformer is constructed with two of the proposed back-to-back converters and experimental results are presented.", "paper_title": "Predictive Control of Series Stacked Flying-Capacitor Active Rectifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000313706700013"}
