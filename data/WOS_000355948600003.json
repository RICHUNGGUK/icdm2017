This paper aims to study the way we collaborate, model the dynamics of collaborations and predict future collaborations among authors. We investigate the collaborations in three disciplines including physics, computer science and information science,and different kinds of features which may influence the creation of collaborations. Path-based features are found to be particularly useful in predicting collaborations. Besides, the combination of path-based and attribute-based features achieves almost the same performance as the combination of all features considered. Inspired by the findings, we propose an agent-based model to simulate the dynamics of collaborations. The model merges the ideas of network structure and node attributes by leveraging random walk mechanism and interests similarity. Empirical results show that the model could reproduce a number of realistic and critical network statistics and patterns. We further apply the model to predict collaborations in an unsupervised manner and compare it with several state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed model achieves the best predictive performance compared with the random baseline and other approaches. The results suggest that both network structure and node attributes may play an important role in shaping the evolution of collaboration networks.", "paper_title": "How we collaborate: characterizing, modeling and predicting scientific collaborations", "paper_id": "WOS:000355948600003"}
