Excluding the higher differential term, the LBM for a temperature field is also achieved as an easy numerical simulation method. However, the LBM is hardly applied to body fitted coordinates for its formulation. It is then difficult to calculate complex lattices using the LBM. In this paper, the finite element discrete Boltzmann equation (FEDBE) is introduced to deal with this weakness of the LBM. The finite element method is applied to the discrete Boltzmann equation (DBE) of the basic equation of the LBM. For FEDBE, the simulation using complex lattices is achieved, and it will be applicable for the development in engineering fields. The natural convection in a square cavity and the Rayleigh-Bernard convection are chosen as the test problem. Each simulation model is accurate enough for the flow patterns, the temperature distribution and the Nusselt number. This method is now considered good for the flow and temperature field, and is expected to be introduced for complex lattices using the DBE. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
