A new set of delay-dependent conditions is established to estimate the state variables of fuzzy neural networks through the observed input and output variables. This ensures that the state estimation error system is asymptotically stable with a guaranteed L-2-L-infinity performance. The presented criterion is formulated in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). An example with simulation results is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy neural state estimator. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
