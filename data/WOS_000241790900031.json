In this paper we present a systematic approach to extracting visual features from image sequences that are used for classifying different activities. Furthermore, since different people perform the same action across different number of frames, matching training and test sequences is not a trivial task. We discuss a new technique for video shot matching where the shots matched are of different sizes. The proposed technique is based on frequency domain analysis of feature data and it is shown to achieve very high accuracy of 94.5% on recognizing a number of different human actions.", "paper_title": "Human activity recognition in videos: A systematic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000241790900031"}
