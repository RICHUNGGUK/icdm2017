Typical tasks such as customer need capture, functional requirement formalization, or design parameter definition are conducted in applications that, for instance, support \"quality function deployment\" and \"failure modes and effects analysis\" techniques. Such applications are noninteroperable with the computer-aided design systems, leading to discontinuous design information flows. This study addresses this issue and proposes a method to enhance the integration of design information generated in the early design stages into a commercial computer-aided design system. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach adopted, a prototype application was developed and two case studies were executed.", "paper_title": "Approach to integrate product conceptual design information into a computer-aided design system", "paper_id": "WOS:000330310200003"}
