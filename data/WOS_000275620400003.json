The position information enables location-based protocols for user applications. Personal networks (PNs) are designed to meet the users' needs and interconnect users' devices equipped with different communications technologies in various places to form one network. Location-aware services need to be developed in PNs to offer flexible and adaptive personal services and improve the quality of lives. This paper gives a comprehensive survey of numerous IPSs, which include both commercial products and research-oriented solutions. Evaluation criteria are proposed for assessing these systems, namely security and privacy, cost, performance, robustness, complexity, user preferences, commercial availability, and limitations. We compare the existing IPSs and outline the trade-offs among these systems from the viewpoint of a user in a PN.", "paper_title": "A Survey of Indoor Positioning Systems for Wireless Personal Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275620400003"}
