Such information need is not uncommon and may not be satisfied by using conventional retrieval methods. We extend existing retrieval models by adding a re-ranking strategy based on a novel graph-based retrieval model using document contexts that are called information units (IU). For evaluation, we focused on a discourse type that appeared in a subset of TREC topics where the retrieval effectiveness achieved by our conventional retrieval models for those topics was low. We showed that our approach is able to enhance the retrieval effectiveness for the selected-TREC topics. This shows that our preliminary investigation is promising and deserves further investigation.", "paper_title": "An information retrieval approach based on discourse type", "paper_id": "WOS:000238573100018"}
