The efficiency and effectiveness of ED services can be improved through identifying the causing ED crowding and modeling the prediction of ED crowding. The nature of ED crowding involves a complex dynamics of intertwined processes and workflows among the different departments within a hospital; thus, the problem cannot be tackled by examining ED alone. It is important to build a model which can identify the factors causing ED crowding and validate the coping strategies of hospitals. This study proposes an intelligence model which first introduces the well-know decision tree method to fit an accommodated nonlinear association and obtain intelligent grading rules of ED crowding; Then it integrates the intelligent grading rules and indexes of coping strategies to construct a hierarchical linear model. The results simultaneously solved traditional modeling issue of high correlation among independent variables and un-convergence. It also provides a better illustration of ED crowding phenomena with more accurate model fitting, as well as a clear linkage between coping strategies and the factors causing ED crowding. Furthermore, our proposed model can have a better understanding of problem nature and guild a better bed management for decision makers. It can also detect intelligently whether hospitals have drawn up active or passive bed management strategies to cope with ED crowding.", "paper_title": "Intelligence modeling for coping strategies to reduce emergency department overcrowding in hospitals", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600021"}
