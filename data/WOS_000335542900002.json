The problem is restricted by many constraints and it belongs to the class of NP-hard. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model for railway crew scheduling with the aim of minimising the number of crew duties by reducing idle transition times. Duties are generated by arranging scheduled trips over a set of duties and sequentially ordering the set of trips within each of duties. The optimisation model includes the time period of relief opportunities within which a train crew can be relieved at any relief point. Existing models and algorithms usually only consider relieving a crew at the beginning of the interval of relief opportunities which may be impractical. This model involves a large number of decision variables and constraints, and therefore a hybrid constructive heuristic with the simulated annealing search algorithm is applied to yield an optimal or near-optimal schedule. The performance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated by applying computational experiments on randomly generated test instances. The results show that the proposed approaches obtain near-optimal solutions in a reasonable computational time for large-sized problems. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
