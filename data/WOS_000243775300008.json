Intermediary websites interface between the supplier and the marketplace; consequently, adoption and use of websites by intermediaries can benefit an extended supply chain. We examined intermediary e-commerce development, focusing on the adoption and use of websites, the factors influencing initial adoption, the characteristics of adopters and patterns of website use. Based on interview and survey data from financial services intermediaries, we used Rogers' model of innovation to identify adopter groups. Statistically significant differences were found between the five adopter categories in terms of key company characteristics, key factors influencing the initial decision to develop a website and its subsequent use. There are implications for providers in widening intermediary participation in website technology. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
