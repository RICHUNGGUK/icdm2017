The descriptions of self, non-self, immunocyte, memory detector, mature detector and immature detector of the network transactions, and the realtime network danger evaluation equations are given. Then, the automated response polices are adaptively performed or adjusted according to the realtime network danger. Thus, MAIM not only accurately evaluates the network attacks, but also greatly reduces the response times and response costs.", "paper_title": "An Immune-inspired Adaptive Automated Intrusion Response System Model", "paper_id": "WOS:000309220000002"}
