The method utilizes a level set framework, thus it has all of the benefits of a sharp, implicitly-represented interface such as the ease of handling complex topological changes. This method is straightforward to implement and leads to a linear system that is symmetric and positive definite, which can be inverted efficiently with standard iterative methods. This approach is second-order accurate for both the Poisson and heat equations, and first-order accurate for the Stefan problem. We demonstrate the accuracy in the L(1) and L(infinity) norms.
