This paper addresses an improved authentication scheme for Radio frequency identification (RFID) applied in VANETs. As often being considered as a precondition for the realization of IoT, RFID can be utilized in the vehicles, so as to make the vehicles identifiable and inventoriable by computers as long as they are fitted out with radio tags. One of the public concerns is likely to focus on a certain large number of security and privacy issues. A few light symmetric key management schemes have been proposed for RFID scenarios. However, as we mentioned already, the authentication methodologies of those light symmetric key management schemes, especially in the scenarios of RFID, are still at an initial phase and call for enormous research efforts. We propose a certificate revocation status validation scheme called EKA2, using the concept of clustering from data mining to evaluate the trustiness of digital certificates.", "paper_title": "An Improved Scheme for Key Management of RFID in Vehicular Adhoc Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000330219400003"}
