A solution based on extended OpenFlow is proposed to support the control virtual network interface in OTN networks. In this way, multi-vendor and multi-domain interoperability is achieved for transport networks, and bandwidth on demand (BoD) service is demonstrated in multi-vendor multi-domain OTN networks. Moreover, based on this hierarchical control architecture, BoD service is conducted in the field trial, which verifies the feasibility to introduce new services in the transport network.", "paper_title": "Field Trial of Bandwidth on Demand Services Based on Hierarchical Control Over Multi-Domain OTN Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000365405100018"}
