In this paper, we study aggregate signatures in certificateless public key settings. We first present the notion and security model of certificateless aggregate signature schemes. Then we give an efficient certificateless aggregate signature scheme. Our scheme is existentially unforgeable under adaptive chosen-message attacks assuming the computational Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. Crown Copyright (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.
