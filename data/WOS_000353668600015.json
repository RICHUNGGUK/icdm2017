The proper recognition of zinc-binding groups.(ZBGs) will help ithprove the accuracy of Virtual screening for riovO HDAC inhibitors. Here, we developed a high-specificity 43G-based phatinacophore model for HDAC8 inhibitors by incorporating customized ZBG features. Subsequently, phartnacophorebased virtual Screening led to the discOvery of three novel HDAC8 inhibitors with low micromole IC50 values (1.8-1.9 mu M). Further studies demonstrated that compound H8-A5 was selective for HDAC8 over HDAC 1/4 and showed antiproliferation activity in MDA-MB-231 cancer cells. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic studies suggested a possible binding mode for H8-A5, which provides a good starting point for the development of HDAC8 inhibitors in cancer treatment.", "paper_title": "Enhancing the Sensitivity of Pharmacophore-Based Virtual Screening by Incorporating Customized ZBG Features: A Case Study Using Histone Deacetylase 8", "paper_id": "WOS:000353668600015"}
