Fragile image authentication is the technique for achieving the goal of image content integrity maintenance. This article presents a fragile image authentication scheme based on the concept of wet paper codes. The proposed scheme modifies dry pixels on an image to conceal an image signature. The proposed authentication scheme can exactly detect the tampered area on a tampered image. For saving computation cost of signature embedding, an exclusive-or operation is used in the proposed authentication scheme. The experimental results show that the proposed method not only has good visual quality of an authorized image but also successfully detects tampered areas on a tampered image.", "paper_title": "A Fragile Digital Image Authentication Scheme Inspired by Wet Paper Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000264096600002"}
