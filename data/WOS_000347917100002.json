Due to the security threats in an untrusted cloud, users are recommended to compute verification metadata, such as signatures, on their data to protect the integrity. Many mechanisms have been proposed to allow a public verifier to efficiently audit cloud data integrity without receiving the entire data from the cloud. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them has considered about the efficiency of public verification on multi-owner data, where each block in data is signed by multiple owners. In this paper, we propose a novel public verification mechanism to audit the integrity of multi-owner data in an untrusted cloud by taking the advantage of multisignatures. With our mechanism, the verification time and storage overhead of signatures on multi-owner data in the cloud are independent with the number of owners. In addition, we demonstrate the security of our scheme with rigorous proofs. Compared to the straightforward extension of previous mechanisms, our mechanism shows a better performance in experiments.", "paper_title": "Efficient Public Verification on the Integrity of Multi-Owner Data in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000347917100002"}
