By semitensor product of matrices, we convert AMVNs into the discrete-time linear representation. A general formula to calculate all of network transition matrices of a specific AMVN is achieved. A necessary and sufficient algebraic criterion to determine whether a given state belongs to loose attractors of length s is proposed. Formulas for the numbers of attractors in AMVNs are provided. Finally, algorithms are presented to detect all of the attractors and basins. Examples are shown to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme.", "paper_title": "Algebraic Representation of Asynchronous Multiple-Valued Networks and Its Dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000328640700011"}
