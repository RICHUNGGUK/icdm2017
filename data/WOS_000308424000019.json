In this paper, we study the residual lifetime of these systems under the condition that the total number of failed components at time is, and at time t(2) (t(2) > t(1)) the system is still working. We obtain explicit expressions for the survival function of the corresponding residual life when the components are exchangeably dependent. We also obtain a signature-based mixture representation for a coherent system satisfying a certain property.", "paper_title": "Residual Lifetime of Consecutive k-out-of-n Systems Under Double Monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000308424000019"}
