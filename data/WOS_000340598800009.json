Recent algorithms for defocus blur alone are both fast and accurate. However, motion blur is a considerably more complex type of camera effect, and as a consequence, current algorithms are either slow or too imprecise to use in high quality rendering. We extend previous work on real-time light field reconstruction for defocus blur to handle the case of simultaneous defocus and motion blur. By carefully introducing a few approximations, we derive a very efficient sheared reconstruction filter, which produces high quality images even for a low number of input samples. Our algorithm is temporally robust, and is about two orders of magnitude faster than previous work, making it suitable for both real-time rendering and as a post-processing pass for offline rendering.", "paper_title": "Layered Reconstruction for Defocus and Motion Blur", "paper_id": "WOS:000340598800009"}
