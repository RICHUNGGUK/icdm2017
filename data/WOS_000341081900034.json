In order to better analyze different user's service requirements and provide customizable services, the new model divided workflow scheduling into two stages: the macro multi-workflow scheduling as the unit of cloud user and the micro single workflow scheduling. It introduced trust mechanism into multi-workflow scheduling level. And in single workflow scheduling level, it classified workflows into time-sensitive, cost-sensitive and balance three types according to different workflow's QoS demand parameters using fuzzy clustering method. Based on it, it customized different service strategies for different type. The simulation experiments show that the new schema has some advantages in shortening workflow's final completion time, achieving relatively high execution success rate and user satisfaction compared to other kindred solutions.", "paper_title": "Trust-driven and QoS demand clustering analysis based cloud workflow scheduling strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000341081900034"}
