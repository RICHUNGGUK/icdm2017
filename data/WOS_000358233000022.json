Most state-of-the-art arithmetic coders produce a (long) codeword of a priori unknown length. Its generation requires a renormalization procedure to permit progressive processing. This paper introduces two arithmetic coders that produce multiple codewords of fixed length. Contrary to the traditional approach, the generation of fixed-length codewords does not require renormalization since the whole interval arithmetic is stored in the coder's internal registers. The proposed coders employ a new context-adaptive mechanism based on variable-size sliding window that estimates with high precision the probability of the symbols coded. Their integration in coding systems is straightforward as demonstrated within the framework of JPEG2000. Experimental tests indicate that the proposed coders are computationally simpler than the MQ coder of JPEG2000 and the M coder of HEVC while achieving superior coding efficiency.", "paper_title": "Context-Adaptive Binary Arithmetic Coding With Fixed-Length Codewords", "paper_id": "WOS:000358233000022"}
