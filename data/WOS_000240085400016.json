Predicted-velocity particle swarm optimization is a new modified version using velocity and position to search the domain space equality. In some cases, velocity information may be effectively, but fails in others. This paper presents a game-theoretic approach for designing particle swarm optimization with a mixed strategy. The approach is applied to design a mixed strategy using velocity and position vectors. The experimental results show the mixed strategy can obtain the better performance than the best of pure strategy.", "paper_title": "Predicted-velocity particle swarm optimization using game-theoretic approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085400016"}
