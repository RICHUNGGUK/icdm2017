In the Fw-MAAR model, each pixel in the to-be-interpolated frame is generated as a linear weighted summation of the pixels within a motion-aligned square neighborhood in the previous frame. To derive more accurate interpolation weights, the aligned actual pixels in the following frame are also estimated as a linear weighted summation of the newly interpolated pixels in the to-be-interpolated frame by the same weights. Consequently, the backward-aligned actual pixels in the following frame can be estimated as a weighted summation of the corresponding pixels within an enlarged square neighborhood in the previous frame. The Bw-MAAR is performed likewise except that it is operated in the reverse direction. A damping Newton algorithm is then proposed to compute the adaptive interpolation weights for the Fw-MAAR and Bw-MAAR models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MAAR model is able to achieve superior performance than the traditional frame interpolation methods such as MCI, OBMC, and AOBMC, and it is even better than STAR model for the most test sequences with moderate or large motions.", "paper_title": "A Motion-Aligned Auto-Regressive Model for Frame Rate Up Conversion", "paper_id": "WOS:000276815900012"}
