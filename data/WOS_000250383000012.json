We show that the possibilistic variance and covariance preserve many properties of variance and covariance in probability theory. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between several crisp possibilistic variances and covariances of fuzzy numbers.", "paper_title": "A comparative analysis of possibilistic variances and covariances of fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000250383000012"}
