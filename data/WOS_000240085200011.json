These were originally designed for a massively parallel hardware architecture but now are implemented completely in software. The algorithms are fast, relatively simple, and they support efficient implementation of the most heavily used KB features. This paper describes these marker-passing algorithms, their strengths and limitations, and how they are used in Scone.", "paper_title": "Marker-passing inference in the scone knowledge-base system", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200011"}
