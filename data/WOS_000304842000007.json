The motivation for this research came from the fact that none of the conventional approaches to engineering simulations includes manipulative control of products by users as foreseen by designers. By implementing control over physics simulations, changes in parameters can be introduced that alter the course of the simulated process. As a means to do this, we propose to use scenario bundles, with which designers can operationalize their conjectures of how human users interact with products as a series of interconnected simulations. For the imaginary use process described in a scenario bundle, the designer can specify various product designs, user characteristics, and environments, which may in each case lead to different concatenations of simulation actions. The proposal facilitates the exploration of possible mismatches and anomalies in use processes. In this article, we describe the theoretical fundamentals and the overall concept of the proposed methodology, as well as its realization as a proof-of-concept implementation. This implementation can be used as a tool to specify scenario bundles and to perform controlled simulations of human-product interaction. The use of the tool is demonstrated through a practical example. Although the implementation has proven to be successful in terms of executing scenario bundles, two bottlenecks need further attention: (i) devising stable algorithms for large deformations in physical interaction simulation and (ii) incorporation of already existing algorithms for simulation of low-level human motion control.
