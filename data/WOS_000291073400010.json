Benchmarking has proven a powerful tool for total quality management and process improvement. Successful benchmarking implementation is based on an effective benchmarking tool. To effectively implement benchmarking processes, this work proposes an integrated framework for the benchmarking tool and knowledge-based system using the data envelopment analysis (DEA) method, and then develops an intellectual benchmarking knowledge-based system (BKBS) for benchmarking, performance evaluation and process improvement. Accordingly, this work illustrates how the benchmarking knowledge-based system (BKBS) is implemented in a medical center. This system can help determine the particular benchmarking partners to evaluate the relative efficiency and fill the gaps between the benchmarking partners in the healthcare industry. Finally, the intellectual benchmarking knowledge-based system offers a very fast way to implement the benchmarking processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
