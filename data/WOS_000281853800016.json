We present a method that reduces the number of control points influencing a vertex to a user-specified number such that the deformations created by the reduced weight set resemble that of the original deformation. To do so we show how to set up a Poisson minimization problem to solve for a reduced weight set and illustrate its advantages over other weight reduction methods. Not only does weight reduction lower the amount of storage space necessary to deform these models but also allows GPU acceleration of the resulting deformations. Our experiments show that we can achieve a factor of 100 increase in speed over CPU deformations using the full weight set, which makes real-time deformations of large models possible.", "paper_title": "Poisson-Based Weight Reduction of Animated Meshes", "paper_id": "WOS:000281853800016"}
