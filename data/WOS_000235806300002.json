We study problems of the form: given simple, parallel drawings P, Q does there exist a continuous transformation between them such that intermediate drawings of the transformation remain simple and parallel with P (and Q)? We prove that a transformation can always be found in the case of orthogonal drawings; however, when edges are allowed to be in one of three or more slopes the problem becomes NP-hard.", "paper_title": "Morphing planar graphs while preserving edge directions", "paper_id": "WOS:000235806300002"}
