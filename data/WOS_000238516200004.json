Over this time, active control has shown to be successful in reducing unsteady pressure oscillations in a variety of combustion systems ranging from benchtop combustors to large-scale industrial rigs with an energy release of 260 MW. In recent years, it has been shown that it is possible to develop control strategies based on dynamic models that are derived using a combination of physically based principles and input-output measurement data. The models developed include both linear models that capture thermoacoustic instabilities and nonlinear models that characterize stable limit cycles. The approaches for deriving model-based controllers include optimization, adaptation, time-delays, and neural networks. These strategies have been used to modulate fuel-flow and air-flow rates entering the combustion process in a number of practical combustors and shown to result in an order of magnitude improvement in performance. In this article, highlights of the area of active combustion control with particular emphasis on models and model-based control strategies are presented. Both linear and nonlinear models that are reported in the literature are discussed. Linear, time-delay, adaptive, and neural control methods that have been developed thus far are presented. The accruing results and experimental verification in laboratory-scale and large-scale combustors are discussed.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear modeling and control of combustion dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000238516200004"}
