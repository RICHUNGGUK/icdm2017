A quantitative study was conducted and data were obtained through a mall-intercept systematic sampling distribution of questionnaires. The results indicate that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and perceived risk all have a significant relationship with consumer attitudes, which subsequently has a significant effect on intention to use online group buying sites. While entertainment gratification was found to be insignificant, we reveal some possible reasons for this finding. The implications of the findings and future research directions are also discussed.", "paper_title": "CONSUME ACCEPTANCE AND CONTINUANCE OF ONLINE GROUP BUYING", "paper_id": "WOS:000335609400009"}
