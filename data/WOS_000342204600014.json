For seeking an accurate prediction, this paper proposes to establish sulphur content prediction model in a hybrid way, where a simplified first principle model is introduced and fine tuned by data-driven modelling methods. The derived hybrid model employs optimization approach to optimize its data representation part, while prior knowledge is embedded in the form of linear constraints. An innovation of the proposed methodology is the full exploitation of prior knowledge about the process for determining reasonable process parameters. Moreover, a novel optimization approach is developed for ensuring accuracy and improving solution efficiency by the integration of genetic algorithm and successive approximation method. The proposed hybrid model possesses flexible interpretable structure and adaptive learning ability. As a result, it ensures the extrapolation property for real-time prediction and is able to provide an in-depth understanding of practical desulphurization process, making it very suitable for process monitoring and operations optimization during LF steel refining. Finally, this hybrid model is validated on recorded data from an industrial LF plant.", "paper_title": "Hybrid modelling for real-time prediction of the sulphur content during ladle furnace steel refining with embedding prior knowledge", "paper_id": "WOS:000342204600014"}
