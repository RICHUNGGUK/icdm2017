The tests employ LP or convex QP techniques, but also can be used heuristically using appropriate test points. We also discuss the selection of efficient d.c. decompositions and propose some preprocessing ideas based on the spectral d.c. decomposition. We report on first numerical experience with this procedure which are very promising.", "paper_title": "Copositivity detection by difference-of-convex decomposition and omega-subdivision", "paper_id": "WOS:000316639000014"}
