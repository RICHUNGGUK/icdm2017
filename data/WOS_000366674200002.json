An association measure is a function of two variables defined on a set X with involutive operation and satisfying the properties similar to the properties of the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Such measure can be used for analysis of the possible positive and negative relationships between variables. The methods of construction of association measures using similarity measures and pseudo-difference operations associated to t-conorms are discussed. The examples of association measures on different domains are considered.", "paper_title": "On definition and construction of association measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000366674200002"}
