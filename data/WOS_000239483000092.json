In this paper, a digital image watermarking scheme is developed using neural network to embedded watermark into DCT domain of each subimage blocks obtained by subsampling, which achieves adaptively watermark embedding and stronger robustness. Furthermore, in order to improve the security of the proposed watermarking, a random permutation process is used in watermarking process. Experiments show that the proposed watermarking scheme is effect and encouraging.", "paper_title": "Robust image watermarking using RBF neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000092"}
