The method uses stochastic models of the unreliability at each failure instant. As a result, a heteroscedastic regression problem arises that is solved by weighted least squares minimization. The main feature of our method is an innovative s-normalization of the failure data models, to obtain analytic expressions of centers and weights for the regression. The method has been Monte Carlo contrasted with Benard's approximation, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation; and it has the highest global scores for its robustness, and performance.", "paper_title": "Improved Estimation of Weibull Parameters Considering Unreliability Uncertainties", "paper_id": "WOS:000301198500005"}
