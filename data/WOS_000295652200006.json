For pure states, this problem corresponds to the matrix algebra question of whether two degree in matrix polynomials are unitarily equivalent; i.e. UA(i)V(dagger) = B-i for 0 <= i <= m where U and V are unitary and (A(i), B-i) are arbitrary pairs of rectangular matrices. We present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that solves this problem with an arbitrarily high success probability and outputs transforming matrices U and V.", "paper_title": "DECIDING UNITARY EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN MATRIX POLYNOMIALS AND SETS OF BIPARTITE QUANTUM STATES", "paper_id": "WOS:000295652200006"}
