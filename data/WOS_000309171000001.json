They have been traditionally approached by dedicated algorithms, which are often hard to extend with side constraints and to apply widely. This paper proposes a constraint-based local search framework for COT/COP applications, bringing the compositionality, reuse, and extensibility at the core of constraint-based local search and constraint programming systems. The modeling contribution is the ability to express compositional models for various COT/COP applications at a high level of abstraction, while cleanly separating the model and the search procedure. The main technical contribution is a connected neighborhood based on rooted spanning trees to find high-quality solutions to COP problems. This framework is applied to some COT/COP problems, e.g., the quorumcast routing problem, the edge-disjoint paths problem, and the routing and wavelength assignment with delay side constraints problem. Computational results show the potential importance of the approach.", "paper_title": "LS(Graph): a constraint-based local search for constraint optimization on trees and paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000309171000001"}
