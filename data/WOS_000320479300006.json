This paper extends the cost-based P-median location-allocation model (Daskin & Dean, 2005) to include a public service element and uses the non-inferior set estimation (NISE) method for evaluation of cost/service trade-offs. Service is measured by the percentage of demand volume that can be served within exogenously specified coverage distances. Importantly, we evaluate the efficiency (i.e. the relative cost and service) of the non-inferior solutions of our model using the commonly used \"population-based\" allocation policy as standard. Computational results illustrate the value of our model under several practical problem settings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
