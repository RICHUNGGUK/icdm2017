The minimization criteria used in the existing versions of CBP learning algorithm in the literature do not approximate the phase of complex-valued output well in function approximation problems. The phase of a complex-valued output is critical in telecommunication and reconstruction and source localization problems in medical imaging applications. In this paper, the issues related to the convergence of complex-valued neural networks are clearly enumerated using a systematic sensitivity study on existing complex-valued neural networks. In addition, we also compare the performance of different types of split complex-valued neural networks. From the observations in the sensitivity analysis, we propose a new CBP learning algorithm with logarithmic performance index for a complex-valued neural network with exponential activation function. The proposed CBP learning algorithm directly minimizes both the magnitude and phase errors and also provides better convergence characteristics. Performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using two synthetic complex-valued function approximation problems, the complex XOR problem, and a non-minimum phase equalization problem. Also, a comparative analysis on the convergence of the existing fully complex and split complex networks is presented. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
