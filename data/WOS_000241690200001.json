Spreading activation selects candidate terms for query expansion from these two resources. Three measures including discrimination ability, concept diversity, and retrieval performance are used for comparisons. The topics and document collections in the ad hoc track of TREC-6, TREC-7 and TREC-8 are adopted in the experiments. The results show that ConceptNet and WordNet are complementary. Queries expanded with WordNet have higher discrimination ability. In contrast, queries expanded with ConceptNet have higher concept diversity. The performance of queries expanded by selecting the candidate terms from ConceptNet and WordNet outperforms that of queries without expansion, and queries expanded with a single resource.", "paper_title": "Query expansion with ConceptNet and WordNet: An intrinsic comparison", "paper_id": "WOS:000241690200001"}
