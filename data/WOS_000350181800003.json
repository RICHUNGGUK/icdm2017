Drawing upon construal level theory and technology acceptance model, this study proposes that users' construal level of an e-learning system interacts with their perceptions of the system (i.e., PEoU and PU) and affects their adoption intention. Data collected from 131 participants in a laboratory experiment show that a higher construal level strengthened the effect of PEoU but mitigated the effect of PU on participants' attitude toward using the system, thus affecting adoption intention. Theoretical contributions and implications are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
