Therefore, the pronunciation patterns of individuals call be used as features for discriminating speakers. This paper exploits the pronunciation characteristics of speakers and proposes a new conditional pronunciation modeling (CPM) technique for speaker verification. The proposed technique establishes a link between articulatory properties (e.g., manners and places of articulation) and phonerne sequences produced by a speaker. This is achieved by aligning two articulatory feature (AF) streams with a phoneme sequence determined by a phoneme recognizer, which is followed by formulating the probabilities of articulatory classes conditioned oil the phonemes as speaker-dependent discrete probabilistic models. The scores obtained from the AF-based pronunciation models are then fused with those obtained from spectral-based acoustic models. A frame-weighted fusion approach is introduced to weight the frame-based fused scores based oil the confidence of observing the articulatory classes. The effectiveness of AF-based CPM and the frame-weighted approach is demonstrated in a speaker verification task. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
