Each bird averages its velocity with its neighbors lying within a fixed radius. We resolve the worst-case complexity of this natural algorithm by providing asymptotically tight bounds on the time to equilibrium. We reduce the problem to two distinct questions in computational geometry and circuit complexity.", "paper_title": "The Convergence of Bird Flocking", "paper_id": "WOS:000340342000002"}
