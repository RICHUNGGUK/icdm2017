After showing that the black-box modeling approaches are not sufficient for long-term prediction of pressures, a structured neural network model is proposed to capture the pressure dynamics of this inherently non-linear system. The paper shows that the proposed network model could be easily trained to predict the pressure dynamics of an experimental hydraulic test setup provided that the training session is initiated with the weights of the developed model.
