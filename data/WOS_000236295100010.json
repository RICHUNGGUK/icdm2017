The use of such networks in factory environments (which are strongly time constraints) can absolutely not guarantee that the applications requirements will be respected. This paper presents a method based on genetic algorithms to minimize end-to-end delays by providing a good distribution of the devices on the network switches. The objective function is defined by using the network calculus which is a deterministic theory and enables to determine bounded delays. In this paper, a case study is described: theoretical results are verified by a real experimentation and compared with results obtained with a network simulator. (C) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
