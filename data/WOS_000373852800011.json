Stakeholders in business and academia are increasingly exploring cloud deployment options for their critical applications. One open problem is that service level agreements (SLAs) in the cloud ecosystem are yet to mature to a state where critical applications can be reliably deployed in clouds. This article systematically surveys the landscape of SLA-based cloud research to understand the state of the art and identify open problems. The survey is particularly aimed at the resource allocation phase of the SLA life cycle while highlighting implications on other phases. Results indicate that (i) minimal number of SLA parameters are accounted for inmost studies; (ii) heuristics, policies, and optimisation are the most commonly used techniques for resource allocation; and (iii) the monitor-analysis-plan-execute (MAPE) architecture style is predominant in autonomic cloud systems. The results contribute to the fundamentals of engineering cloud SLA and their autonomic management, motivating further research and industrial-oriented solutions.", "paper_title": "A Systematic Review of Service Level Management in the Cloud", "paper_id": "WOS:000373852800011"}
