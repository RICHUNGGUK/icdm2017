This setup exhibits an inherent conflict between digital and analog relaying; while analog relaying [known as amplify-and-forward (A&F)] suffers from noise accumulation, digital relaying (known as decode-and-forward) looses the potential coherence gain in combining the relay noises at the decoder. For a large number of relays, the coherence gain is large, and thus analog relaying has better performance; however, it is limited to white channels of equal bandwidth. In this paper, we present a generalization of the analog approach to the case of bandwidth mismatch. Our strategy, coined rematch and forward (R&F), is based upon applying joint source-channel coding techniques that belong to a certain class of maximally analog schemes. Using such techniques, R&F converts the bandwidth of the broadcast section to that of the multiple-access section, creating an equivalent matched-bandwidth network over which A&F is applied. It is shown that this strategy exploits the full bandwidth of the individual channels, without sacrificing the coherence gain offered by A&F. Specifically, for given individual-link capacities, R&F remains within a constant gap from the network capacity for any number of relays and any bandwidth ratio between the sections. Finally, the approach is extended to the case of colored channels.", "paper_title": "Rematch-and-Forward: Joint Source-Channel Coding for Parallel Relaying With Spectral Mismatch", "paper_id": "WOS:000330282600041"}
