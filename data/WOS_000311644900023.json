In the context of nonlinear problems, these linear systems appear as part of a Newton iteration. However, applying DD methods directly to the original nonlinear problem has some attractive features, most notably that the Newton iterations now solve local problems, and thus are expected to be simpler. Furthermore, strong, local nonlinearities may to a less extent affect the numerical algorithm. For linear problems, DD can be applied both as an iterative solver or as a preconditioner. For nonlinear problems, it has until recently only been understood how to use DD as a solver. This article offers a systematic study of domain decomposition strategies in the context of nonlinear porous-medium flow problems. The study thus compares four different approaches, which represents DD applied both as a solver and preconditioner, to both the linearized and nonlinear equations. Our model equations are those obtained from a fully implicit discretization of immiscible two-phase flow in heterogeneous porous media. In particular we emphasize the case of nonlinear preconditioning, an algorithm that to our knowledge so far has not been studied nor implemented for flow in porous media. Our results show that the novel algorithm is up to 75% faster than the standard algorithm for the most challenging problems for a moderate number of subdomains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
