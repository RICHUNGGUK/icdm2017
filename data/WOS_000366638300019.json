Design/methodology/approach - Close reading, analysis, and comparison of key excerpts from Stanislavski's corpus, the writings of later proponents of his System, the literature of early cybernetics, and contemporary scholarship in cognitive science. Also, description of current and potential future applications of the theories presented. Findings - Stanislavski's success in formulating an approach to acting capable of generating performances of previously unrealized naturalness and believability lay in his utilization of heuristics later to be taken up, under different nomenclature, by the field of cybernetics and substantiated by contemporary cognitive science. A conscious interdisciplinary research effort to explore these linkages promises benefits for both fields. Practical implications - Cyberneticians in various sub-disciplines may be inspired to view the theatre rehearsal hall as a potential site of interdisciplinary research projects; particularly in the fields of the behavioral and social sciences. Originality/value - This paper is the first to synthesize existing and original cybernetic analyses of the Stanislavski System with contemporary developments in cognitive science in a manner specifically geared toward the cybernetic community. The current and potential future research projects described are unique.", "paper_title": "Proto-cybernetics in the Stanislavski System of acting Past foundations, present analyses and future prospects", "paper_id": "WOS:000366638300019"}
