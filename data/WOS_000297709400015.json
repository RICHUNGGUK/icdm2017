A perfect reconstruction image modulation method is proposed. In detail, the bidimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) is first improved to adaptively decompose image into monocomponents. Then by the quaternionic analytic method, suitable analytic signals is acquired. A new polar form is further proposed to modulate images, then seven characters are derived including instantaneous amplitude and instantaneous frequencies. We demonstrate the techniques on both synthetic and natural images, depict the needle program of the estimated frequencies and obtain the reconstructions that are the same with the original images. The applications in image segmentation and separation establish the validity of characterizing images of this type as sums of locally narrow band modulated components.", "paper_title": "Perfect reconstruction image modulation based on BEMD and quaternionic analytic signals", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709400015"}
