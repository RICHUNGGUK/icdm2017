An introductory and brief recollection of preceding contributions by psychologists, cognitive scientists and Al researchers provides the necessary background and motivation for our work. A relevant trend of the present research concerns the formal mathematical study of representation phenomena, including precisions about isomorphic and homomorphic representation changes. In order to simplify problem resolution processes, the implemented system performs certain representation changes, by making use of specific procedures which assign and modify a certain relevance value to every attribute involved in the problem representation, on behalf of their respective importance so as to actually solve the problem. The paper includes a full account of mathematical definitions and propositions involved in this system. (C) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
