We then propose a new protocol that is capable of achieving secure QDC with authentication as long as the authenticator would do the authentication job faithfully. Our quantum protocol introduces a mutual authentication procedure, uses the quantum Bell states, and applies unitary transformations in the authentication process. Then it exploits and utilizes the entanglement swapping and local unitary operations in the communication processes. Thus, after the authentication process, the client users are left alone to communicate with each other, and the authenticator has no access to the secrete message. In addition, our protocol does not require a direct quantum link between any two users, who want to communicate with each other. This way also be an appealing advantage in the implementation of a practical quantum communication network.", "paper_title": "QUANTUM DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH MUTUAL AUTHENTICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000264937600002"}
