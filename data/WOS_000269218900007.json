The article discusses specifically the following points: the approach to building a metamodel for MSCs and LSCs, a metamodel extension from MSC to LSC, support for model-based code generation, and finally action model and domain-specific data model integration. The metamodel is formulated in metaGME, the metamodel language for the Generic Modeling Environment.", "paper_title": "Metamodeling live sequence charts for code generation", "paper_id": "WOS:000269218900007"}
