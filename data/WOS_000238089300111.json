Learning from the traditional manual imitation procedure, we first get the contour line of a Dunhuang fresco which is composed of many connected curves, and then render the strokes by learning styles from examples. For several example strokes, the style of example strokes are captured and expressed as style function. Given a target curve, a new stroke can be generated with the style of one example and moreover, the style of the target stroke can be further customized into different styles similar to the examples by interpolation of styles. This research has the potential to provide a computer aided tool for art historians to do imitation work, and improve the efficiency of imitation.", "paper_title": "Interactive sketch generation for Dunhuang frescoes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300111"}
