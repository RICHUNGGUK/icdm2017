We make use of the regularized least-square framework as the basic classifier, which only involves the similarity scores among different music tracks. We present a similarity score that multiplies different scores based on different distance measures. Particularly the distance measures are not restricted to the Euclidean distance. By adding a weight to each single distance based score, we propose an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to adaptively learn the fusion scores. Experiments on real music data set show that our approach can give promising results.", "paper_title": "Content-based information fusion for semi-supervised music genre classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000251952200014"}
