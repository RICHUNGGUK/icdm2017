With the increasing availability, reproduction and sharing of media, the intellectual property of digital media is incapable of guaranty. To claim the ownership of digital camera media, the imperceptible visible watermarking (IVW) mechanism was designed based on the observation that most camera devices contain the postcamera histogram operation. The IVW approach can achieve advantages both the content readability of invisible watermarking methodology and the visual ownership identification of visible watermarking methodology. The computational complexity of IVW is low and can be effectively applied to almost any of the digital electronic devices when capturing the real-world scene without additional instruments. The following results and analysis demonstrate the novel scheme is effective and applicable for versatile images and videos captured. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
