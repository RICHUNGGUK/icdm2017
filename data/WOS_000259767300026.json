However, designers still need to partition the code manually due to the lack of automated partition techniques. To settle this issue, this paper proposes a partition exploration algorithm based on the search space smoothing techniques, and implements the proposed method using a commercial extensible processor (Xtensa LX2 processor from Tensilica Inc.). We have verified the feasibility of the algorithm by implementing the MPEG2 benchmark on the Xtensa-based two-processor system. The final experimental results indicate a performance improvement of at least 1.6x compared to the single-processor system.", "paper_title": "Exploring partitions based on search space smoothing for heterogeneous multiprocessor system", "paper_id": "WOS:000259767300026"}
