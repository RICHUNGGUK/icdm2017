We believe that immersive virtual environments may be used to design expressive and efficient multi-process instruments. In this paper we present the 3D reactive widgets. These graphical elements enable efficient and simultaneous control and visualization of musical processes. Then we describe Piivert, a novel input device that we have developed to manipulate these widgets, and several techniques for 3D musical interaction.", "paper_title": "Interacting with 3D Reactive Widgets for Musical Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000299783300007"}
