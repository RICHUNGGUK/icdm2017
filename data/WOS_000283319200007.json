The theoretical model is based on Triandis' behavioural framework. Prior value research has mostly focused on users' attitudes towards online shopping. We explore the role of perceived value and habit in e-commerce behaviour. Structure equation results suggest that the utilitarian as well as the hedonic values have a significant impact on affect, and indirectly also on e-commerce behaviour. We also assessed the importance of habit on shoppers' online behaviour. According to our results, online shoppers' habitual behaviour has a significant impact on affect. We also found that normative beliefs (social factors) are the preceding factor of habit in cases in which the shopping experience is not recurrent.", "paper_title": "Online shopping viewed from a habit and value perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000283319200007"}
