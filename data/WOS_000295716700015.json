The resulting elliptic problem is analyzed for the strip and disk geometry. The structure of the solution set is explored with the aid of phase plane techniques, perturbation methods, and bifurcation analysis. In each case, the stability of the solution is determined using linear stability theory with the aid of the bifurcation diagram. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
