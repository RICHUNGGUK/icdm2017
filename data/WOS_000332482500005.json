In such applications, inexact approaches provide the ability to achieve significantly lower power. This work demonstrates the power-error trade-offs that can be achieved. Using probabilistic modeling in sub-50-nm silicon transistor technology, the relationship between statistical uncertainties and errors are elucidated for different configurations and topologies and the trade-offs quantified. Gate-level implementation of the probabilistic CMOS logic is validated by circuit simulations of a commercial 45-nm SOI CMOS process technology. Using a practical ALU architecture where voltages can be scaled from most significant to least significant bit blocks as an example, the potential benefits of this technique are shown. A calculation error of 10(-6), an error rate quite tolerable for many computational tasks, is shown to be possible with a total power reduction of more than 40%.", "paper_title": "Inexact Computing Using Probabilistic Circuits: Ultra Low-Power Digital Processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000332482500005"}
