Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is a case in point, as hand-labeled data sets are particularly hard and time-consuming to create. Consequently, evaluations tend to be performed on a small scale, which does not allow for in-depth analysis of the factors that determine a system's performance. In this article we address this issue by means of a realistic simulation of large-scale evaluation for the WSD task. We do this by providing two main contributions: First, we put forward two novel approaches to the wide-coverage generation of semantically aware pseudowords (i.e., artificial words capable of modeling real polysemous words); second, we leverage the most suitable type of pseudoword to create large pseudosense-annotated corpora, which enable a large-scale experimental framework for the comparison of state-of-the-art supervised and knowledge-based algorithms. Using this framework, we study the impact of supervision and knowledge on the two major disambiguation paradigms and perform an in-depth analysis of the factors which affect their performance.", "paper_title": "A Large-Scale Pseudoword-Based Evaluation Framework for State-of-the-Art Word Sense Disambiguation", "paper_id": "WOS:000345150100005"}
