It is the method that incorporates the multi-scale segmentation method (JSEG) into image registration for the first time and proposes an adaptive feature point extraction method on the basis of blocking strategy. Then, NMI is adopted to obtain a set of control point pairs. Finally, the image registration is realized by virtue of Delaunay triangle local transform mapping functions. In accordance with experiments on high resolution remote sensing images collected by different sensors, it is found that the method can not only extract feature points accurately but also ensure reasonable distribution of control point pairs. Meanwhile, compared with traditional multi-scale tools-based methods, the method has relatively high accuracy and robustness.", "paper_title": "A Novel Registration Method for High Resolution Remote Sensing Images Based on JSEG and NMI", "paper_id": "WOS:000352158200013"}
