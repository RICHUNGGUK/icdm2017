These relations restrict the choice of reparameterizations for geometric continuity. In particular, when one bicubic tensor-product B-spline patch is associated with each facet of a quadrilateral mesh with n-valent vertices and we do not want segments of the boundary curves forced to be linear, then the relations dictate the minimal number and multiplicity of knots: For general data, the tensor-product spline patches must have at least two internal double knots per edge to be able to model a G(1)-connected complex of C(1) splines. This lower bound on the complexity of any construction is proven to be sharp by suitably interpreting an existing Surface construction. That is, we have a tight bound on the complexity of smoothing quad meshes with bicubic tensor-product B-spline patches. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
