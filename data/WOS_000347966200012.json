The algorithm introduces the theory of good point set (GPS) and dynamic mutation operator (DMO) and adopts the entire population co-evolutionary migration, based on the concept of Pareto nondomination and global best experience and guidance. The performance of the algorithm is tested through standard multi-objective functions. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs much better in the convergence, diversity and solution distribution than SPEA2, NSGA-II, MOPSO and MOMASEA. It is a fast and robust multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) and is applicable to other MOPs.", "paper_title": "A Novel Hybrid Multi-Objective Population Migration Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000347966200012"}
