Our method is a direct (non-iterative) approach for simulation based upon a parallel matrix inversion algorithm. The new dimension of flexibility provided by our algorithm allows for a more accurate analysis of power/ground mesh structures using resistance, inductance, capacitance, interconnect models. Specifically, we offer a method that employs a sparse approximate inverse technique to consider more reluctance coupling terms for increased accuracy of simulation. Our algorithm shows substantial computational improvement over the best known direct and iterative numerical techniques that are applicable to these large-scale simulation problems.", "paper_title": "A Parallel Direct Solver for the Simulation of Large-Scale Power/Ground Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275851700013"}
