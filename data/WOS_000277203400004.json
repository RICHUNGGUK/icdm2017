In recent years, the main research funding agencies have promoted several initiatives aimed at designing and building open, large scale, realistic experimental facilities that could be used to evaluate innovative networking architectures, paradigms and services. In this paper, after discussing the main challenges in building such infrastructures, we present how, by leveraging the concept of federation, we managed to introduce a first degree of heterogeneity into PlanetLab Europe, a European testbed federated with PlanetLab, by providing UMTS connectivity to PlanetLab Europe nodes. Our contribution is just a first step of an evolutionary path whose further developments will lead to next generation large-scale heterogeneous testbeds for supporting experimentally-driven research on the Network of the Future (Preliminary results within the same framework of this work have been recently published in Canonico et al. (2007) and Botta et al. (2008)).", "paper_title": "Integration of 3G Connectivity in PlanetLab Europe", "paper_id": "WOS:000277203400004"}
