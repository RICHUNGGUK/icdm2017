The main goal of this practical session is to introduce students to the topic of simulating the behavior of real devices. Furthermore, the proposed methodology allows students to simulate electrical, magnetic and mechanical magnitudes involved in the contactor dynamics. The results of the simulations are contrasted with experimental data, showing the reliability of the proposed model. (c) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
