In this work, we propose ABC-MC, a simple multi-channel geographic forwarding scheme. ABC-MC is based on ABC which is a lightweight and reliable routing protocol where nodes do not need to set up or maintain routing/neighbor tables. A unique feature of ABC-MC is that it uses a channel pre-negotiation mechanism to reduce delay. Another unique feature of ABC-MC is that it takes into account the channel usage information within a few (e.g., three) hops in channel selection to reduce interference. Experimental results show that ABC-MC outperforms other protocols in terms of the average delay and throughput performance. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
