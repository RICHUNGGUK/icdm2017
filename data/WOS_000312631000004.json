In an ad hoc grid, every node in the network can spontaneously arise as a resource consumer or a resource producer at any time when it needs a resource or it possesses an idle resource. At the same time, the node in ad hoc grid is often energy constrained. The paper proposes an efficient resource allocation scheme for grid computing marketplace where ad hoc grid users can buy usage of memory and CPU from grid resource providers. The ad hoc grid user agents purpose to obtain the optimized quality of service to accomplish their tasks on time with a given budget, and the goal of grid resource providers as profit-maximization. Combining perspectives of both ad hoc grid users and resource providers, the paper present ad hoc grid resource allocation algorithm to maximize the global utility of the ad hoc grid system which are beneficial for both grid users and grid resource providers. Simulations are conducted to compare the performance of the algorithms with related work.", "paper_title": "An efficient resource allocation for maximizing benefit of users and resource providers in ad hoc grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000312631000004"}
