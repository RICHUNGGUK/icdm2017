One of the compounds selected showed urease inhibition in the low micromolar range. Barbituric acid and compounds 1a, 1d, 1e, 1f, 1g, 1h were found to be more potent urease inhibitors than the standard inhibitor hydroxyurea, yielding IC50 values of 41.6, 83.3, 66.6, 50, 58.8, and 60 mu M, respectively (IC50 of hydroxyurea = 100 mu M). 5-Benzylidene barbituric acid has enhanced biological activities compared to barbituric acid. Furthermore, the results indicated that among the substituted 5-benzylidene barbiturates, those with para substitution have higher urease inhibitor activities. This may be because the barbituric acid moiety is closer to the bimetallic nickel center in unsubstituted or para-substituted than in ortho- or meta-substituted analogs, so it has greater chelating ability.", "paper_title": "Large-scale virtual screening for the identification of new Helicobacter pylori urease inhibitor scaffolds", "paper_id": "WOS:000305602900004"}
