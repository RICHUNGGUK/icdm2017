For example, Facebook offers a service allowing marketers to utilize users' posts to automatically generate advertisements. The effectiveness of this practice depends on the ability to accurately predict a post's influence on its readers. For an advertising strategy of this nature, the influence of a post is determined jointly by the features of the post, such as contents and time of creation, and the features of the author of the post. We propose two models for predicting the influence of a post using both sources of influence, post-and author-related features, as predictors. An empirical evaluation shows that the proposed predictive features improve prediction accuracy, and the models are effective in predicting the influence score. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
