Many goodness-of-fit tests are available. However, most of them are quite insensitive in detecting non-normality when the alternative distribution is symmetric. On the other hand all the procedures are quite powerful against skewed alternatives. A new test for normality based on a polynomial regression is presented. It is very effective in detecting non-normality when the alternative distribution is symmetric. A comparison between well known tests and this new procedure is performed by simulation study. Other properties are also investigated. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
