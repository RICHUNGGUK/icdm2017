Yet, these studies were based mostly on acted basic emotions. This paper explores how manual annotation and image processing can cooperate towards the representation of spontaneous emotional behavior in low-resolution videos from TV. We describe a corpus of TV interviews and the manual annotations that have been defined. We explain the image-processing algorithms that have been designed for the automatic estimation of movement quantity. Finally, we explore how image processing can be used for the validation of manual annotations.", "paper_title": "Manual annotation and automatic image processing of multimodal emotional behaviors: validating the annotation of TV interviews", "paper_id": "WOS:000261069900009"}
