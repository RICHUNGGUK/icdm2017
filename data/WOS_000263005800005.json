If one system collapses, its redundant system Will substitute it to work for a period of time. In Our paper, we have specifically studied the effects of redundant systems on controlling the disaster spreading in networks. Based on the network Structure, several redundant strategies have been formulated. On the one hand, the effects of the redundant systems designed uniformly have been Studied in different types of networks, the result shows that the random network has been improved the best to fight the disaster. On the other hand, the effectiveness of those redundant strategies have been discussed in the scale free network, results show that the strategy based oil total degree is the most effective one to control the spreading. All results found in this paper offer promising perspectives to design redundant systems for preventing cascading failures. Crown Copyright (C) 2008 Published by Elsevier B.V.
