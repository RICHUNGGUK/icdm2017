Development of the new boron products and production technologies, spreading the using area of the boron are the study topics which must be finically discussed. In this study, with the help of colemanite taken in ratio as (0%, 7.5%, 12.5%, and 17.5%) by being mixed by the cement, surfaces of the pumice aggregates have been covered. Permeability of the samples has been investigated by producing lightweight concrete with 400 dose with the help of aggregates covered with colemanite. For this, the experiments of water absorption, capillary water absorption, depth of penetration of water under pressure and rapid chloride permeability have been performed. In addition, analyses of the thin section of covered and uncovered pumice aggregates and SEM (Scanning Electron Microscope) have been investigated. When the control samples produced with the covered aggregates and concretes produced with colemanite covered aggregates are compared each other, it has been determined that special lightweight concretes whose values of capillary water absorption experiment, depth of penetration of water under pressure experiment and rapid chloride permeability are low can be produced.", "paper_title": "Permeability features of concretes produced with aggregates coated with colemanite", "paper_id": "WOS:000358476400007"}
