The telephone-communication system (in which each node denoting a telephone station can either call or receive a phone) and computer-communication system are typical ones of such networks. Given the system demand (d; d(ij is an element of B)) where d(ij) is the required demand between the node pair (i,j) is an element of B with a specified set of node pairs B and d the total demand requirement among all nodes, an algorithm is proposed first to find out all lower boundary points of (d; d(ij is an element of B)) (namely (d; d(ij is an element of B))-MPs here) in terms of MPs. The system reliability can then be calculated in terms of the family of all (d; d(ij is an element of B))-MPs. One example is illustrated to show how all its (d; d(ij is an element of B))-MPs are generated and how the reliability nay be calculated. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
