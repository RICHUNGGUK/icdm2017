Based on Helmholtz principle, the proposed method is parameterless. At the core of the work lies a new way to interpret binary sequences in terms of unions of segments, for which a dynamic programming implementation is given. The proposed algorithm is extensively tested on synthetic and real images and compared with the state of the art.", "paper_title": "On straight line segment detection", "paper_id": "WOS:000259439300006"}
