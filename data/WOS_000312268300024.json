However, 2-D planning with dental casts cannot provide comprehensive information on facial bone conditions, especially with regards to symmetry. To plan and predict postsurgical facial symmetry and occlusions, this paper uses an optical navigation system to track the movement of the upper and lower dental models in model surgery. The corresponding movement and the new position of the jawbones are demonstrated in the computer and the symmetry status can be evaluated. Surgical splints can be fabricated from the virtual models and used in surgery. The procedure provides more realistic predictions, which can assist surgeons to better control postsurgical facial harmony.", "paper_title": "Optical Tracking-Based Model Surgery for Orthognathic Surgical Planning Using a Quantifying Evaluation Method", "paper_id": "WOS:000312268300024"}
