We give a complete characterization of NIR Clos networks built of switching elements of various nonblocking properties. In particular, we propose a novel class of NIR Clos networks that leads to recursive constructions of various cost-efficient multistage NIR networks. Finally, we present examples of such constructions and compare them with the best previously known results.", "paper_title": "On noninterruptive rearrangeable networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241540900018"}
