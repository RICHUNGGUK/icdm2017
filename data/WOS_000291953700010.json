In our model, we focus on addressing two problems: 1) the control model for local motions. We propose to represent a combination of psychological and geometrical rules with a social and physical forces model so that it can avoid individual agent's local collision. 2) Global path planning algorithm with moving obstacle. We propose a more efficient algorithm by extending the indicative route method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can be tuned to simulate different types of crowd behaviors under a variety of conditions, and can naturally exhibit emergent phenomena that have been observed in real crowds.", "paper_title": "Real-time control of individual agents for crowd simulation", "paper_id": "WOS:000291953700010"}
