Here we show that the same method applies to the analogous model of random k-uniform hypergraphs, establishing asymptotic normality throughout the (sparse) supercritical regime. Previously, asymptotic normality was known only towards the two ends of this regime. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Random Struct.
