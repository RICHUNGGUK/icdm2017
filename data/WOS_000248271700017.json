The software implements several new algorithms (including the Disagree method that returns the taxa, that disagree between two trees and the Nodal method that compares two trees using nodal information) and several previously described methods (such as the Partition method, Triplets or Quartets) to compare phylogenetic trees. One of the novelties of this software is that the FMTS (From Multiple to Single) program allows the comparison of trees that contain both orthologs and paralogs. Each option is also complemented with a randomization analysis to test the null hypothesis that the similarity between two trees is not better than chance expectation.", "paper_title": "TOPD/FMTS: a new software to compare phylogenetic trees", "paper_id": "WOS:000248271700017"}
