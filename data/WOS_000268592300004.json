Through the Chapman Enskog expansion, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations can be recovered. Numerical tests, including the steady Poiseuille flow, the double shear flow and the driven cavity flow, have been carried out to verify the present model. The numerical results agree well with the analytical solutions or the existing results, and it is found that the present model exhibits much better numerical stability than the single relaxation time model.", "paper_title": "INCOMPRESSIBLE MRT LATTICE BOLTZMANN MODEL WITH EIGHT VELOCITIES IN 2D SPACE", "paper_id": "WOS:000268592300004"}
