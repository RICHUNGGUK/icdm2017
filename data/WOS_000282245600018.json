We firstly apply the principal component analysis for input multi-modal images. We next smooth the first principal component with a preliminary filter and use it as a supplementary image for cross bilateral filtering of input images. Among some preliminary filters, the undecimated wavelet transform is useful for effective denoising of various multi-modal images such as color, multi-lighting and medical images.", "paper_title": "Denoising of Multi-Modal Images with PCA Self-Cross Bilateral Filter", "paper_id": "WOS:000282245600018"}
