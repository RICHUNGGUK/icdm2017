Design/methodology/approach - Design science, an artifact of proof-of-concept system is used for deciding co-branding partners. Findings - The present study attempts to demonstrate the proof-of-concept of the proposed MAUT-based decision model for a company in determining a beneficial and supportive co-branding partner. Practical implications - This paper aims to provide clues for industries in terms of providing a MAUT-based decision-making approach and a strategic information system. Examples from the telecommunication industry also demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. Originality/value - The proposed decision-making method: provides clues for ranking and selection of co-branding partners; explores the brand personality of the potential partners primitively; utilizes the MAUT approach to estimate utilities of the partners; and furnishes a roadmap for brand alliance research.", "paper_title": "Using multi-criteria decision aid to rank and select co-branding partners From a brand personality perspective", "paper_id": "WOS:000268835500007"}
