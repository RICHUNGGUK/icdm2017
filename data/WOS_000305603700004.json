Existing methods are effective to demonstrate content, but are not capable of preserving semantic relationships among keywords while still linking the word cloud to the underlying document groups that generated them. Such representation is highly desirable for exploratory analysis of document collections. In this paper we present a novel approach to build document clouds, named ProjCloud that aim at solving both semantical layouts and linking with document sets. ProjCloud generates a semantically consistent layout from a set of documents. Through a multidimensional projection, it is possible to visualize the neighborhood relationship between highly related documents and their corresponding word clouds simultaneously. Additionally, we propose a new algorithm for building word clouds inside polygons, which employs spectral sorting to maintain the semantic relationship among words. The effectiveness and flexibility of our methodology is confirmed when comparisons are made to existing methods. The technique automatically constructs projection based layouts the user may choose to examine in the form of the point clouds or corresponding word clouds, allowing a high degree of control over the exploratory process.", "paper_title": "Semantic Wordification of Document Collections", "paper_id": "WOS:000305603700004"}
