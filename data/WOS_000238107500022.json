Since policies are usually expressed by rules, we propose a method to derive tests from a set of rules with a single modality. For each element of our language and each type of rule, we propose a pattern of test, which we call a tile. We then combine those tiles into a test for the whole rule.", "paper_title": "Test generation for network security rules", "paper_id": "WOS:000238107500022"}
