Since sampled-data systems can be rewritten as equivalent jump systems, the receding horizon H(infinity) control problems for time-varying jump systems are considered first and the design methods of a state feedback receding horizon H(infinity) controller and an output feedback receding horizon H(infinity) controller are given. Then the obtained results are applied to sampled-data systems and the design methods of a state feedback receding horizon H(infinity) controller and an output feedback receding horizon H(infinity) controller are given. Two numerical examples are given to illustrate the theory.", "paper_title": "Receding horizon H(infinity) control problems for sampled-data systemsx", "paper_id": "WOS:000251027700002"}
