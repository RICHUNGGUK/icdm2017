Two energy conservations of the LDG scheme are proved for the generalized Zakharov system. Numerical experiments for the Zakharov system are presented to illustrate the accuracy and capability of the methods, including accuracy tests, plane waves, soliton-soliton collisions of the standard and generalized Zakharov system and a two-dimensional problem.
