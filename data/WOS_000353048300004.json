Recent research trends for multicore programming models have come to the direction that parallel design patterns can be a solution to develop multicore applications. As parallel design patterns are with regularity, we view this as a great opportunity to exploit power optimizations in the software layer. In this paper, we investigate compilers for low power with parallel design patterns on embedded multicore systems. We evaluate four major parallel design patterns, Pipe and Filter, MapReduce with Iterator, Puppeteer, and Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) Model. Our work attempts to devise power optimization schemes in compilers by exploiting the opportunities of the recurring patterns of embedded multicore programs. The proposed optimization schemes are rate-based optimization for Pipe and Filter pattern , early-exit power optimization for MapReduce with Iterator pattern, power aware mapping algorithm for Puppeteer pattern, and multi-phases power gating scheme for BSP pattern. In our experiments, real world multicore applications are evaluated on a multicore power simulator. Significant power reductions are observed from the experimental results. Therefore, we present a direction for power optimizations that one can further identify additional key design patterns for embedded multicore systems to explore power optimization opportunities via compilers.", "paper_title": "Compilers for Low Power with Design Patterns on Embedded Multicore Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000353048300004"}
