Whereas localities have been introduced as a modelling tool for membrane systems and more general GALS (globally asynchronous locally synchronous) systems, a/sync places make it possible to model synchronous communication between transitions. We investigate the interaction between locally synchronous execution and synchronous communication. Our focus is in particular on the causalities in the concurrent runs of a new Petri net model combining these features. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
