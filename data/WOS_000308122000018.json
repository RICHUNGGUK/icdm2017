In this update, we present the modernized version of program ARVO [J. Busa, J. Dzurina, E. Hayryan, S. Hayryan, C-K. Hu, J. Plavka, I. Pokorny, J. Skivanek, M.-C. Wu, Comput. Phys. Comm. 165 (2005) 59]. The whole package has been rewritten in the C language and parallelized using OpenCL. Some new tricks have been added to the algorithm in order to save memory much needed for efficient usage of graphical cards. A new tool called 'input_structure' was added for conversion of pdb files into files suitable for work with the C and OpenCL version of ARVO.
