The designed controllers have a very simple structure and do not involve any saturation or recursive computation, which is widely applied in designing a controller of feedforward nonlinear systems. Using the transformation of coordinates and the property of Hurwitz polynomial, the problem of designing controller can be converted into the problem of finding a parameter, which can be solved by solving the optimization problem with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) constraints. A simulation example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design procedure.", "paper_title": "Global asymptotic stabilization of feedforward nonlinear systems with a delay in the input", "paper_id": "WOS:000236076600001"}
