The underlying decision problem Kemeny Score is NP-complete even in case of four input rankings to be aggregated into a \"median ranking\". We analyze efficient polynomial-time data reduction rules with provable performance bounds that allow us to find even all optimal median rankings. We show that our reduced instances contain at most candidates where denotes the average Kendall's tau distance between the input votes. On the theoretical side, this improves a corresponding result for a \"partial problem kernel\" from quadratic to linear size. In this context we provide a theoretical analysis of a commonly used data reduction. On the practical side, we provide experimental results with data based on web search and sport competitions, e.g., computing optimal median rankings for real-world instances with more than 100 candidates within milliseconds. Moreover, we perform experiments with randomly generated data based on two random distribution models for permutations.", "paper_title": "Theoretical and empirical evaluation of data reduction for exact Kemeny Rank Aggregation", "paper_id": "WOS:000336440400001"}
