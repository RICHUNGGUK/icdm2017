We are able to represent the projection of 3D points on a catadioptric image linearly with a 6x10 projection matrix, which uses lifted coordinates for image and 3D points. This projection matrix can be computed from 3D-2D correspondences (minimum 20 points distributed in three different planes). We show how to decompose it to obtain intrinsic and extrinsic parameters. Moreover, we use this parameter estimation followed by a non-linear optimization to calibrate various types of cameras. Our results are based on the sphere camera model which considers that every central catadioptric system can be modeled using two projections, one from 3D points to a unitary sphere and then a perspective projection from the sphere to the image plane. We test our method both with simulations and real images, and we analyze the results performing a 3D reconstruction from two omnidirectional images.", "paper_title": "Calibration of Central Catadioptric Cameras Using a DLT-Like Approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000288673000006"}
