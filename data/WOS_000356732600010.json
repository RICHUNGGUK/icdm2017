Based on Mikhailov's membership function, we first give a membership function, which is used to measure the decision maker's satisfaction degree for the priority vector derived from each interval constraint. Then by using the membership function, we propose a new fuzzy programming method to get the most satisfaction degree of each priority vector. The NFPM has many prominent characteristics, especially, it is capable of deriving the priority vector from a consistent or inconsistent interval reciprocal comparison matrix. Moreover, the NFPM can overcome some drawbacks of Mikhailov's fuzzy programming method (FPM) for inconsistent interval reciprocal comparison matrices. Finally, several examples are given to illustrate the applicability and advantage of the proposed method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
