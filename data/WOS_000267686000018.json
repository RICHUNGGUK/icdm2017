The planar 2-DOF parallel manipulator with actuation redundancy is treated as non-dimensional structure. The physical model of the solution space is studied. Based on the kinematic model and Jacobian matrix, the global conditioning index, global velocity index and global stiffness index of the 2-DOF parallel manipulators are investigated, and the geometrical parameters without dimension are determined. Based on the optimum non-dimensional result, the optimum dimensional parameters are achieved. The result of this paper is useful for the development of 2-DOF 3-RRR redundant parallel manipulators.
