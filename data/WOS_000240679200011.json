This work spawned an effort in the IETF to develop a generalized method for routing and tunneling different address families across uniform IPv4 or IPv6 backbone networks. Inspired by the CERNET2 effort, the IETF Softwires working group has introduced a framework for a solution that offers a generalized, network-based capability for routing and tunneling multiple address families across native IPv4 or IPv6 backbone networks.", "paper_title": "The transition to IPv6, Part II - The Softwire Mesh, Framework Solution", "paper_id": "WOS:000240679200011"}
