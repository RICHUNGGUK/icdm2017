A new signature set must be assigned every time the number of active users changes. This correspondence cons siders signature sets that are less sensitive to changes in the number of active users. Equiangular signature sequences are proven to solve a certain max-min signal-to-intererference-plus-noise problem, which results from their interference invariance. Unions of orthonormal bases have subsets that come close to satisfying the Welch bound. Bounds on the maximum number of bases with minimum maximum correlation are derived and a new construction algorithm is provided. Connections are made between these signature design problems, Grassmannian line packing, frame theory, and algebraic geometry.", "paper_title": "On quasi-orthogonal signatures for CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236126000035"}
