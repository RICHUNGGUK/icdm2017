In order to support this move, it is vital that adaptive personalisation systems, in these domains, are capable of integrating adaptively composed activities into adaptively personalised content positions [1]. Through the integration of the approaches that are used in the automated composition of web services with those found in Adaptive Hypermedia, we believe that it will be possible to support a unified approach to the adaptation of content and services through the leveraging of the characteristics that are common to both adaptive application domains.", "paper_title": "A unified approach to Adaptive Hypermedia personalisation and Adaptive Service Composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424300038"}
