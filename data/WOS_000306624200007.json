We first construct a higher-order tensor with all the images in the training set, and apply HOSVD to obtain a small set of orthonormal basis tensors that can span the principal subspace for all the training images. The coordinate, which best describes an image under this set of orthonormal basis tensors, is computed as the density character vector. Furthermore, a multi-class SVM classifier is designed to classify the extracted density character vectors into different density levels. Compared with traditional methods, we can make significant improvements to crowd density estimation. The experimental results show that the accuracy of our method achieves 96.33%, in which the misclassified images are all concentrated in their neighboring categories. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
