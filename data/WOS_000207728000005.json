Peer-to-peer (P2P) systems have emerged as an infrastructure enabling technologies for enhanced scalability and reliability in file sharing and content distribution. It is envisioned that P2P enabled service-oriented grid systems would virtualize various resources as services with high scalability and reliability. Many legacy software resources exist nowadays, but making them grid aware services for effective resource sharing has become an issue of vital importance. This paper presents GSLab, a toolkit for automatically wrapping legacy software into services that can be published, discovered and reused in grid environments. GSLab employs Sun Grid Engine (SGE) to enhance its performance in execution of wrapped services. Using GSLab, we have automatically wrapped a legacy computer animation rendering code written in C as a service that can be discovered and accessed in a SGE environment. The evaluation results show that the performance of GSLab improves with an increase in the number of computing nodes involved.", "paper_title": "Automatically wrapping legacy software into services: A grid case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000207728000005"}
