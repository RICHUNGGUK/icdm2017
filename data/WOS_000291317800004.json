From the 3DZM, the ultrasonic backscattered power spectrum can be predicted and model based scatterer properties, such as effective scatterer diameter (ESD), can be estimated. Additionally, the 3DZM can be exploited to visualize and identify possible scattering sites, which may aid in the development of more effective scattering models to better represent the ultrasonic interaction with underlying tissue microstructure. In this study, 3DZMs were created from a set of human fibroadenoma samples. ESD estimates were made assuming a fluid-filled sphere form factor model from 3DZMs of volume 300 x 300 x 300 mu m. For a collection of 33 independent human fibroadenoma tissue samples, the ESD was estimated to be 111 +/- 40.7 mu m. The 3DZMs were then investigated visually to identify possible scattering sources which conformed to the estimated model scatterer dimensions. This estimation technique allowed a better understanding of the spatial distribution and variability of the estimates throughout the volume.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Human Fibroadenomas Using Three-Dimensional Impedance Maps", "paper_id": "WOS:000291317800004"}
