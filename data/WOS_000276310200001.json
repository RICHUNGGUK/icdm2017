Nevertheless, the solution to the recurrence can be obtained from the analytic solution by finding an asymptotic series expansion. Conversely, the analytic solution can be obtained by summing the generating function by the Borel summation method. This is an explicit example, which we study detail, of a behaviour known to be typical for a large class of holonomic functions. We also express the solution using Bessel functions and Lommel polynomials.", "paper_title": "A divergent generating function that can be summed and analysed analytically", "paper_id": "WOS:000276310200001"}
