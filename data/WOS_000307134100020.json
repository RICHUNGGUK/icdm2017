The proposed method evaluates the reliability of association rules (ARs) aiming to discover interesting associations between attributes in functional brain imaging, i.e. single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET). AR mining firstly requires a masking process for reducing the computational cost, which is based on Fisher discriminant ratio (FDR), in order to identify \"transactions\" or relationships among discriminant brain areas. Once the activation map is achieved by means of activation estimation (AE), the resulting regions of interest (ROIs) are subjected to AR discovery with a specified minimum support and confidence. Finally, the proposed CAD system performs image classification by evaluating the number of previously mined rules from controls that are verified by each subject. Several experiments were carried out on two different image modalities (SPECT and PET) in order to highlight the generalization ability of the proposed method. The AR-based method yields an accuracy up to 92.78% (with 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity) and 91.33% (with 82.67% sensitivity and 100% specificity) for SPECT and PET, respectively, thus outperforming recently developed methods for early diagnosis of AD.
