In practice, the electrocardiography (ECG) is one of the well-known non-invasive procedures used as records of heart rhythms and diagnosis of unusual heart diseases. In this paper, we propose a healthcare management system, named CardiaGuard, which is specialized in monitoring and analysis the heart disorder events for the elderly. The CardiaGuard cloud service is an expert system designed based on the hybrid classifier implemented using support vector machine (SVM) and random tree (RT) classification algorithm. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation which shows the proposed hybrid classification engine are able to detect six types of cardiac disorders with higher accuracy rate than the SVM-based classifier alone. CardiaGuard poses a great solution to enhance the quality of good clinical practice on the healthcare management for the elderly in cardiology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
