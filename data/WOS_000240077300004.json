Deviating from the standard model, it is assumed in this article that the outcome of a pairwise comparison may be manipulated by the two participants. The higher ranked party may intentionally lose to the lower ranked party in order to gain group benefit. We discuss incentive compatible mechanism design issues for such scenarios and develop both possibility and impossibility results.", "paper_title": "On incentive compatible competitive selection protocol - (Extended abstract)", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300004"}
