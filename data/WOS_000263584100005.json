To cater for the advertising needs, the early initiatives are resorting to the techniques traditionally employed by the television industry, which have proven deficiencies related to targeting and viewers' comfort. In response to that, we have developed a new advertising model. based on identifying products semantically related to the things that draw the viewer's attention on the screen. Thereupon, a personalization engine selects the products which are potentially interesting for the viewer, and assembles interactive services that provide him/her with tailor-made commercial functionalities. This paper provides guidelines on how to support the proposed model over the technological basis of the modern Digital TV receivers (either domestic or mobile ones), and describes a sample scenario of personalized advertising.
