By reviewing the related literatures on visual secret sharing schemes for multiple secrets (VSSM schemes), the pixel expansion is at least 2x for sharing m secrets, and the contrast is at most 1/2x. In this paper, we propose a novel VSSM scheme that is different from all previous schemes. Our approach, which is based on the secret separating and camouflaging processes, not only can generate non-expansion shares but also obtain higher contrast on recovered images without the need to redesign the codebook. Experimental results show that the proposed scheme has achieved better performance than all of the existing VSSM schemes.", "paper_title": "A VISUAL SHARING SCHEME FOR MULTIPLE SECRETS BY CAMOUFLAGING PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000285273700033"}
