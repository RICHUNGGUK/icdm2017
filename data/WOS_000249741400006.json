Panangaden [E. D'Hondt, P. Panangaden, Quantum weakest preconditions, Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 16 (2006) 429-451], and they presented a representation of weakest precondition of a quantum program in the operator-sum form. In this Letter, we give an intrinsic characterization of the weakest precondition of a quantum program given in a system-environment model. Furthermore, some sufficient conditions for commutativity of quantum weakest preconditions are presented. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
