In this paper, we consider situations with linguistic, interval or fuzzy preference information, and develop some fuzzy ordered distance measures, such as linguistic ordered weighted distance measure, uncertain ordered weighted distance measure, linguistic hybrid weighted distance measure, and uncertain hybrid weighted distance measure, etc. After that, based on hybrid weighted distance measures, we establish a consensus reaching process of group decision making with linguistic, interval, triangular or trapezoidal fuzzy preference information.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy ordered distance measures", "paper_id": "WOS:000300290100004"}
