The first layer of the model is used to classify these changes into different operating conditions. In the second layer, the process under each operating condition is modeled using bootstrap aggregated neural networks (BANN) with sequential training algorithm. ne overall output is obtained by combining all the trained networks. Results of application to the actual process show that the proposed soft-sensing model possesses good generalization capability.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical neural network based product quality prediction of industrial ethylene pyrolysis process", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300165"}
