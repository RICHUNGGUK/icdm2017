The refinement algorithm tracks the movement of the 2D diffuse-interface and subsequently refines the mesh locally at that interface, while coarsening the mesh in the rest of the computational domain, based on error estimators. Convergence of the method is validated using a Gaussian distribution problem and results are presented for a Cahn-Hilliard diffuse-interface model applied to capture the transient dynamics of polymer blends.
