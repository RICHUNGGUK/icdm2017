Through introducing SLA into optical packet switching networks, a balancing scheme for quality of service-aware service provisioning is proposed, which uses packet loss ratio as availability index to obtain a larger number of SLA-satisfied services and achieve a better balance among different level services by means of discarding packets with better packet loss capacity in priority to fully make use of the capacity of services themselves. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the other two typical service provisioning schemes in terms of the above two aspects.", "paper_title": "A balancing scheme for QoS-aware service provisioning in OPS networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000301332600011"}
