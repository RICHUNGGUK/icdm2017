The so-called asynchronous switching means that the switches between the candidate controllers and system modes are asynchronous. By using the average dwell time (ADT) approach, sufficient conditions for the existence of an asynchronously switched controller is derived such that the resulting closed-loop system is exponentially stable. The desired controller gains and the admissible switching signals are obtained in terms of a set of matrix inequalities. A numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
