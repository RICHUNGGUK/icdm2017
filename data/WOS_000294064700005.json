We sought, therefore, to develop an ex vivo organ culture system to study early changes in cerebral arteriolar structure and function, and to compare associated findings to those for non-cerebral arterioles. Pilot studies revealed that rabbit cerebral arterioles maintained contractility longer when cultured in media containing rabbit-specific plasma rather than fetal bovine serum. Cerebral and skeletal muscle arterioles were cultured in a pressure myograph for 5 days; maximum dilatory and contractile responses were measured at 0, 1, 3, and 5 days. Passive properties were preserved in cerebral arterioles over the entire culture period, although skeletal muscle arterioles underwent constrictive remodeling. Cerebral arterioles also maintained a myogenic capability over the entire culture period, albeit at progressively larger diameters, whereas the skeletal muscle arterioles did so only over 3 days. Culture in rabbit serum, which contains numerous growth factors and clotting factors, did not induce or increase inward remodeling in cerebral or skeletal arterioles. These results suggest inherent, organ-specific differences in arteriolar remodeling, and that extensive results in the literature on non-cerebral arterioles should not be extrapolated to predict responses in the cerebral microcirculation.", "paper_title": "Differential remodeling responses of cerebral and skeletal muscle arterioles in a novel organ culture system", "paper_id": "WOS:000294064700005"}
