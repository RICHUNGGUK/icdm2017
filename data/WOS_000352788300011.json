An integrative analysis perspective combining different model checking approaches based on different property categories is provided. The methodology is applied to the synthetic pulse generator system and several verification experiments are carried out to demonstrate the use of our approach to formally analyse various aspects of synthetic biology systems.", "paper_title": "A Property-Driven Methodology for Formal Analysis of Synthetic Biology Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000352788300011"}
