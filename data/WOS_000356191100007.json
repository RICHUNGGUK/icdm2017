Keeping a uniform B-rep and the unsuppressed geometry data enables the use of various existing repairing, defeaturing and meshing algorithms to process CAD models with small gaps and overlaps on surface boundaries. The continuous geometry of the input model remains untouched in the repairing, defeaturing and meshing process, and the output mesh is loyal to this geometry. Such feature is often desirable in numerical simulations that require meshes with high geometry fidelity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.
