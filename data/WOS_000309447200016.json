When the input is ground, the procedure terminates and provides a decision algorithm for the word problem. In this paper, we present a modular extension of ground AC-completion for deciding formulas in the combination of the theory of equality with user-defined AC symbols, uninterpreted symbols and an arbitrary signature disjoint Shostak theory X. Our algorithm, called AC(X), is obtained by augmenting in a modular way ground AC-completion with the canonizer and solver present for the theory X. This integration rests on canonized rewriting, a new relation reminiscent to normalized rewriting, which integrates canonizers in rewriting steps. AC(X) is proved sound, complete and terminating, and is implemented to extend the core of the ALT-ERGO theorem prover.", "paper_title": "CANONIZED REWRITING AND GROUND AC COMPLETION MODULO SHOSTAK THEORIES: DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000309447200016"}
