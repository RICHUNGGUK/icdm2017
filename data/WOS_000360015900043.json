Minimax formulations are proposed for this problem. It is assumed that the post-change family of distributions has a member which is least favorable in a well-defined sense. An algorithm is proposed in which ON-OFF observation control is employed using the least favorable distribution, and a generalized likelihood ratio-based approach is used for change detection. Under additional conditions on the post-change family of distributions, it is shown that the proposed algorithm is asymptotically optimal, uniformly for all possible post-change distributions.", "paper_title": "Data-Efficient Minimax Quickest Change Detection With Composite Post-Change Distribution", "paper_id": "WOS:000360015900043"}
