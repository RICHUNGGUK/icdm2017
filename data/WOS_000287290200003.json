This paper discusses two different implementations of this approach. The implementations differ in the use of the new information available: in the first implementation new information is partially used to generate updated realizations: however, in the second implementation, the realizations are updated using all the new information available. The implementations are validated using the Walker Lake data set, and compared through a case study at a stockwork gold deposit. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
