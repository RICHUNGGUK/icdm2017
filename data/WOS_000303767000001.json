This transmission requires a specific routing algorithm. To prolong the network lifetime, sensor nodes need a secure load-balancing route. In this paper, we investigate the facts of ensuring secure sensed data in a balanced energy network backbone, and propose energy-efficient secure path algorithm (ESPA) for WSNs. It is a process of ensuring sensed data authenticity and integrity under a well-structured energy-efficient routing. To overcome the limitation caused by the symmetric key cryptography algorithms for securing data in WSNs, we proposed a mechanism for checking data integrity in a balanced energy network backbone. On this basis, we use the combined version of distance energy aware routing and a checking data integrity method for WSNs. ESPA provides a better performance in maximizing the network lifetime.", "paper_title": "Energy-Efficient Secure Path Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000303767000001"}
