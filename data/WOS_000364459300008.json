TCAM density is improved by novel resistive memory cells that exploit phase change and spin-torque transfer magnetoresistive RAM technologies. The proposed tcam system achieves average speedups of 3 to 4.5 times and average energy reductions of 5 to 8 times as compared to a conventional RAM-based system.", "paper_title": "RESISTIVE TERNARY CONTENT ADDRESSABLE MEMORY SYSTEMS FOR DATA-INTENSIVE COMPUTING", "paper_id": "WOS:000364459300008"}
