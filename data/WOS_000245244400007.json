However, very little is known about the other neighborhoods. In this article we prove that every one-dimensional neighborhood that is big enough so that every letter of the entry word can affect the computation is equivalent (in terms of real-time recognition) either to the usual neighborhood {-1, 0, 1} or to the one-way neighborhood {0, 1}.", "paper_title": "Cellular automata: Real-time equivalence between one-dimensional neighborhoods", "paper_id": "WOS:000245244400007"}
