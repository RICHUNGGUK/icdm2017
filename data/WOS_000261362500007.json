The method and prototype software are demonstrated with a grammar for a sales process. The method improves on existing approaches by offering the generative power of grammar-based methods while addressing the principal challenge to using such approaches in the design of business processes: the limitations on automated evaluation of alternatives and thus the need to provide designers with tools to manage the potentially overwhelming array of choices generated by design grammars.", "paper_title": "PROCESS GRAMMAR AS A TOOL FOR BUSINESS PROCESS DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000261362500007"}
