Our process is based on quantitative representations of the organization and mission, and utilizes normative models of team and individual decision making. Our assessment methodology has been applied to evaluate the benefits of the Sensing and Patrolling Enablers Yielding Effective Security system-a ground-based decentralized C3I system comprised of emerging and existing sensing, SA/C-2, and Shaping technologies. To facilitate the assessment analysis, our models have been implemented using a computational agent framework for the Distributed Dynamic Decision making (DDD) virtual simulation platform.
