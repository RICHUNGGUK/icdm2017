In particular parameters extracted from Fujisaki's model of intonation are presented and evaluated. Machine learning models were build with the utilization of C4.5 decision tree inducer, instance based learner and Bayesian learning. The datascts utilized for the purpose of training machine learning models were extracted from two emotional databases of acted speech. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of Fujisaki's model attributes since they enhanced the recognition process for most of the emotion categories and learning approaches helping to the segregation of emotion categories.", "paper_title": "Evaluating intonational features for emotion recognition from speech", "paper_id": "WOS:000252047100006"}
