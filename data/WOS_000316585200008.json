In particular, two conceptual elements of this behavior were explored: the yield surfaces and the plastic potentials, as defined in the framework of elastoplastic constitutive models. For this purpose, we implemented a contact model that mimics the mechanical behavior of cemented bonds, we constructed a set of polydisperse samples with different solid fractions, and we tested these samples by means of a biaxial device with four rigid walls. The yield surfaces and plastic potentials were thus obtained and analyzed as functions of the solid fraction of the material, drawing interesting conclusions, confirming previous experimental findings, and, consequently, evidencing the great potential of discrete element simulations in exploring the behavior of real cemented geomaterials.
