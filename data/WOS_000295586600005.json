Some delay-independent and delay-dependent stabilization approaches are developed for both state feedback and observer-based feedback cases, which are based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach and a parallel distributed compensation scheme. The time delay is dealt by Lyapunov theory allied with the Halanay Lemma. The restriction on the interval between each impulsive instant and output sampled instant needs not be equal to or less than a constant scalar, but it only requires an inequality satisfaction. When the impulsive effects vanish, the results can be extended to the corresponding sufficient conditions for the cases of a nonlinear continuous time-delay system with a state feedback and observer-based sampled output feedback. Finally, some examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Controller Design for Nonlinear Impulsive Fuzzy Systems With Time Delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000295586600005"}
