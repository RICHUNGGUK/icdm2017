This provides hardware and software updates, and enables issue solving and upgrade ability without device modification. In order to prevent an attacker from eavesdropping or manipulating the configuration data, security is a necessity. This work describes an architecture that allows the secure, remote reconfiguration of an FPGA. The architecture is partially dynamically reconfigurable and it consists of a static partition that handles the secure communication protocol and a single reconfigurable partition that holds the main application. Our solution distinguishes itself from existing work in two ways: it provides entity authentication and it avoids the use of a trusted third party. The former provides protection against active attackers on the communication channel, while the latter reduces the number of reliable entities. Additionally, this work provides basic countermeasures against simple power-oriented side-channel analysis attacks. The result is an implementation that is optimized toward minimal resource occupation. Because configuration updates occur infrequently, configuration speed is of minor importance with respect to area. A prototype of the proposed design is implemented, using 5, 702 slices and having minimal downtime.", "paper_title": "Secure, Remote, Dynamic Reconfiguration of FPGAs", "paper_id": "WOS:000350529900008"}
