Since structural information is needed for chemical synthesis, we must infer chemical graphs from the obtained descriptor. This is formalized as a graph inference problem from a real-value vector. By generalizing subword history, which was originally introduced in formal language theory to extract numerical information of words and languages based on counting, we propose a comprehensive framework to investigate the computational complexity of chemical graph inference. We also propose a (pseudo-)polynomial-time algorithm for inferring graphs in a class of practical importance from spectrums.", "paper_title": "On computational complexity of graph inference from counting", "paper_id": "WOS:000328125300013"}
