We first define two distance features for measuring global and local structural differences between two point sets, respectively. The two distances are then combined to form a GLMD based cost matrix which provides a flexible way to estimate correspondences by minimizing global or local structural differences using a linear assignment solution. To improve the correspondence estimation and enhance the interaction between the two steps, an annealing scheme is designed to gradually change the cost minimization from local to global and the thin plate spline transformation from rigid to non-rigid during registration. We test the performance of our method in contour registration, sequence images and real images, and compare with six state-of-the-art methods where our method shows the best alignments in most scenarios.
