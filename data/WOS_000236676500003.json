The fuzzy Lyapunov function is defined in fuzzy blending quadratic Lyapunov functions. Based on fuzzy Lyapunov functions, some stability conditions are derived to ensure nonlinear systems are asymptotic stable. By using parallel distributed compensation (PDC) scheme, we design a nonlinear fuzzy controller for the nonlinear system. This control problem will be reformulated into linear matrix inequalities (LMI) problem.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy Lyapunov method for stability conditions of nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000236676500003"}
