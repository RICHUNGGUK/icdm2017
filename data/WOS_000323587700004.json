Reading on electronic paper displays was also compared with reading on paper. In Experiment 1,100 participants performed a reading task where the display area for the text was equated for the displays. The results indicated that participants' visual performance and visual fatigue did not differ significantly among different electronic paper displays, ambient illuminance conditions, or light sources. In Experiment 2, another 60 participants performed the same reading task where the full screen of each electronic paper display was used to present the text. The results showed that reading speed differed significantly across different electronic paper displays and ambient illuminance levels. The reading speed was slower for displays with smaller screens and increased as the ambient illuminance increased. Changes in the critical flicker fusion frequency significantly differed across ambient illuminance levels. Implications of the results for the use of electronic paper displays are discussed.
