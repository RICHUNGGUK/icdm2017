A decision procedure for PPTL formulas is given. To this end, Normal Form (NF) and Labeled Normal Form Graph (LNFG) for PPTL formulas are defined, and algorithms for transforming a formula to its normal form and constructing the LNFG for the given formula are presented. Further, the finiteness of LNFGs is proved in details. Moreover, the decision procedure is extended to check the satisfiability of the formulas of Propositional Interval Temporal Logic. In addition, examples are also given to illustrate how the decision procedure works.", "paper_title": "A decision procedure for propositional projection temporal logic with infinite models", "paper_id": "WOS:000252473400003"}
