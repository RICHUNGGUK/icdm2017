We establish that these necessary conditions are sufficient for all but a relatively small number of (possibly) exceptional cases. For v = 1 (mod 8) there are at most 12 possible exceptions: {177, 249, 305, 377, 385, 465, 473, 489, 497, 537, 553, 897}. For v = 0 (mod 8) there are at most 98 possible exceptions the largest of which is v = 3696. The materials in this paper also enable us to obtain four previously unknown(4, 8) GWhD(8n+1), namely for n = 16, 60, 191, 192 and to reduce the list of unknown (4, 8) GWhD(8n) to 124 values of v the largest of which is v = 3696.", "paper_title": "Existence of (2,8) GWhD(v) and (4,8) GWhD(v) with v equivalent to 0, 1 (mod 8)", "paper_id": "WOS:000262968100008"}
