This paper presents a compact plastic joint with several channels to integrate wires and optical fibres. These wires and fibres will be used to supply and send data from micro-devices inside surgical tools. The aim of our study is to design a biocompatible compact joint with two degrees of freedom and a mobility range close to +/- 90 degrees. The architecture of this new joint is based on a generic design with biocompatible plastic and super-elastic NiTi wires. Analytical simulation allows to readily suggest different solutions for different scales. Because the surgeon works with a visual feedback, the articulated joint is controlled in an open-loop configuration. Finally, this paper presents two kinds of applications that use the plastic joint: a tele-operated surgical robot and a hand-held surgical instrument. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
