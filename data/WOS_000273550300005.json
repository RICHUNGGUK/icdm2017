We compare methods for allocating link flow detectors to a traffic network with respect to the quality of the estimated OD-matrix. First, an overview of allocation methods proposed in the literature is presented. Second, we construct a controlled experimental environment where any allocation method can be evaluated, and compared to others, in terms of the quality of the estimated OD-matrix. Third, this environment is used to evaluate and compare three fundamental allocation methods. Studies are made on the Sioux Falls network and on a network modeling the city of Linkoping. Our conclusion is, that the most commonly studied approach for detector allocation, maximizing the coverage of OD-pairs, seems to be unfavorable for the quality of the estimated OD-matrix.", "paper_title": "Allocation of Link Flow Detectors for Origin-Destination Matrix Estimation-A Comparative Study", "paper_id": "WOS:000273550300005"}
