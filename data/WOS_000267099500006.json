The results indicated that ANFIS statistically outperforms ANN in terms of effluent prediction. The minimum mean absolute percentage errors of 11.99% and 12.75% for SSeff and CODeff could be achieved using ANFIS. The maximum values of correlation coefficient for SSeff and CODeff were 0.75 and 0.92, respectively. The minimum mean square errors of 0.17 and 19.58, and the minimum root mean square errors of 0.41 and 4.42 for SSeff and CODeff could also be achieved. ANFIS's architecture consists of both ANN and fuzzy logic including linguistic expression of membership functions and if-then rules, so it can overcome the limitations of traditional neural network and increase the prediction performance.
