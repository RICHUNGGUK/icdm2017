The core issue of context-aware application development is how to make the application behave suitably according to the changing context without coupling such context dependencies in the program. Several programming paradigms and languages have been proposed to facilitate the development, but they are either lack of sufficient flexibility or somewhat complex for programming and deploying. A reference programming model is proposed in this paper to make up inadequacy of those approaches. In the model, virtual tables constructed by system and maintained by space manager connect knowledge of both developer and space manager while separating dependency between context and application logic from base program. Hierarchy and architecture of the model are presented, and implementation suggestions are also discussed. Validation and evaluation show that the programming model is lightweight and easy to be implemented and deployed. Moreover, the model brings better flexibility for developing context-aware applications.", "paper_title": "A Reference Programming Model for Building Context-Aware Application", "paper_id": "WOS:000293258900014"}
