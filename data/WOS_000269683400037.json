In 1958, Markov determined the inversion complexity of every Boolean function and, in particular, proved that [log(2)(n + 1)] NOT gates are sufficient to compute any Boolean function on n variables. In this paper, we consider circuits computing non-deterministically and determine the inversion complexity of every Boolean function. In particular, we prove that one NOT gate is sufficient to compute any Boolean function in non-deterministic circuits if we can use an arbitrary number of guess inputs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
