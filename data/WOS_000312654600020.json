However, it is a challenge to identify the small subset of functionally important mutations from tens of thousands of rare variants in a whole exome/genome. Therefore, we developed a toolkit called PriVar, a systematic prioritization pipeline that takes into consideration calling quality of the variants, their predicted functional impact, known connection of the gene to the disease and the number of mutations in a gene, and inference from linkage analysis.", "paper_title": "PriVar: a toolkit for prioritizing SNVs and indels from next-generation sequencing data", "paper_id": "WOS:000312654600020"}
