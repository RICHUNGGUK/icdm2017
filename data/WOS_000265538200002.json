This study aims to design towards increased levels of engagement in voicemail browsing by using the 'Richness, Control and Engagement' (RC & E) framework. This framework explains the levels of engagement in terms of the levels of richness and control that are shaped by the features of a product and the user's expertise. A product was developed that utilized gestures and sound to access digital voicemail contents. An experiment was conducted in which 28 participants interacted with the product while varying (1) the number of features of the user interface, (2) the amount of voicemail content and (3) the type of task. Results showed that the levels of engagement could be predicted according to the levels of richness and control experienced when a task-term was added to the framework. Implications of the refined RC & E framework for interaction design practice are discussed.", "paper_title": "Product features and task effects on experienced richness, control and engagement in voicemail browsing", "paper_id": "WOS:000265538200002"}
