To list just a few examples, adaptability is important in pervasive computing, where software in mobile devices need to adapt to dynamic changes in wireless networks; autonomic computing, where software in critical systems are required to be self-manageable; and grid computing, where software for long running scientific applications need to be resilient to hardware crashes and network outages. In this paper, we provide a realization of the transparent shaping programming model, called TRAP. NET, which enables transparent adaptation in existing. NET applications as a response to the changes in the application requirements and/or to the changes in their execution environment. Using TRAP. NET, we can adapt an application dynamically, at run time, or statically, at load time, without the need to manually modify the application original functionality-hence transparent.", "paper_title": "TRAP.NET: A REALIZATION OF TRANSPARENT SHAPING IN .NET", "paper_id": "WOS:000269249400003"}
