It is a natural generalization of the previous decoding algorithm which was only for one-point AG codes. As such, it retains the same advantages of fast speed, regular structure, and direct message recovery. Upon this generalization, we add a technique from the Guruswami-Sudan list decoding that boosts the decoding speed significantly. Compared with other known decoding algorithms for general AG codes, it has a similar decoding performance and allows streamlined practical implementation by its simple and regular structure.", "paper_title": "Unique Decoding of General AG Codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000333099400004"}
