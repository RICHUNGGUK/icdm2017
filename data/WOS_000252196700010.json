Therefore, observing and analysing current processes can enable analysts to converge on the specification of the new system, generating and evaluating new system alternatives throughout. In this paper, we propose a method to support this reengineering process that analyses the strengths and weaknesses of the current process; considers the strategic needs of the organization; provides guidelines for the prescriptive construction of i* models; and drives the systematic generation and evaluation of alternative technological and organizational solutions for the new system.
