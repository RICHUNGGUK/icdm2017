The system uses a single forward looking camera to capture the road scene. Vehicles are detected based on their edges and symmetrical characteristics. A method to extract the symmetric regions in the image using a multi-sized window and clustering technique is introduced. We hypothesize the vehicle's locations in the image from the detected symmetric regions and the regions are then further processed to enhance their symmetrical edges. A bounding box of a vehicle is detected from the projection maps of the enhanced vertical and horizontal edges. The hypothesized vehicles are then verified using a two-class classifier, which consists of an edge oriented histogram (EOH) feature extractor and a support vector machine (SVM). Once a vehicle is verified, a tracking process based on a Kalman filter and a reliability point system is used to track the movement of the vehicle in consecutive video frames. The system was successfully implemented and tested on a standard PC. Experimental results on live video feed and pre-recorded video sequences for various road scenes showed that the system is able to detect multiple vehicles in real time.", "paper_title": "Symmetry-based monocular vehicle detection system", "paper_id": "WOS:000307539300001"}
