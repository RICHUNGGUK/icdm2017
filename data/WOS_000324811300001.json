This study usesthe Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) as a modelling tool to predict the strain in tie section for High Strength Self Compacting Concrete (HSSCC) deep beams. 3773 experimental data were collected. The input data andits corresponding strains in tie section as output data were recorded at all loading stages. Results from ANFIS are compared with the classical linear regression (LR). The comparison shows that the ANFIS's results are highly accurate, precise and satisfactory.", "paper_title": "Applications of the ANFIS and LR in the prediction of strain in tie section of concrete deep beams", "paper_id": "WOS:000324811300001"}
