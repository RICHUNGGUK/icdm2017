Design/methodology/approach - Based on the three-dimensional structure theory of the information service industry, this paper combines a comprehensive analysis with the practical experiences of Peking University Library as a case study. Findings - The paper proposes three-dimensional extensions of a digital library service system. It analyses the respective functions of organisations and librarians, information resources, services and methods and the interactions between them. Originality/value - Innovatively, the theory of three-dimensional structures is applied to the discussion of the development of the digital library service system. It is significant for the integrality of a digital library theoretical system, as well as for the practical developments, innovations and sustainability of the digital library.", "paper_title": "Three-dimensional extension of a digital library service system", "paper_id": "WOS:000285659600002"}
