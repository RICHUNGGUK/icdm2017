The semantic distance between entities and between trust categories is borrowed to calculate trustworthiness more precisely. In the model, the behavior trust and capability trust are distinguished and evaluated separately; on the basis of the trust evaluations, all entities in pervasive environments make independent decisions that can maximize their own profit with the trust model. The simulation experiment results proved the effectiveness of the model in improving the interaction success ratio and efficiency between entities under pervasive environments.
