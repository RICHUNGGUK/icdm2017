HeartSaver is based on adroit integration of four different modern technologies: electronics, wireless communication, computer, and information technologies in the service of medicine. The physical device consists of four modules: sensor and ECG processing unit, a microcontroller, a link between the microcontroller and the cell phone, and mobile software associated with the system. HeartSaver includes automated cardiac pathology detection algorithms. These algorithms are simple enough to be implemented on a low-cost, limited-power microcontroller but powerful enough to detect the relevant cardiac pathologies. When an abnormality is detected, the microcontroller sends a signal to a cell phone. This operation triggers an application software on the cell phone that sends a text message transmitting information about patient's physiological condition and location promptly to a physician or a guardian. HeartSaver can be used by millions of cardiac patients with the potential to transform the cardiac diagnosis, care, and treatment and save thousands of lives. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
