A node-based discretization of the numerical fluxes for the physical conservation laws allows to derive a scheme that is compatible with the geometric conservation law (GCL). Fluxes are computed using a nodal solver which can be viewed as a two-dimensional extension of an approximate Riemann solver. The first-order scheme is conservative for momentum and total energy, and satisfies a local entropy inequality in its semi-discrete form. The two-dimensional high-order extension is constructed employing the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) in the acoustic approximation. Many numerical tests are presented in order to assess this new scheme. The results obtained for various representative configurations of one and two-dimensional compressible fluid flows show the robustness and the accuracy of our new scheme. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
