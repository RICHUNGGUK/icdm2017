One has quantum systems as objects, whereas the other also allows classical systems on an equal footing. The former has been axiomatized using environment structures. We extend this axiomatization to the latter by introducing decoherence structures.", "paper_title": "Axiomatizing complete positivity", "paper_id": "WOS:000367346600012"}
