This paper gives an overview of NGOA solutions, the enabling optical access network technologies, architecture principles, and related economics and business models. NGOA requirements (including peak and sustainable data rate, reach, cost, node consolidation, and open access) are proposed, and the different solutions are compared against such requirements in different scenarios (in terms of population density and system migration). Unsurprisingly, it is found that different solutions are best suited for different scenarios. The conclusions drawn from such findings allow us to formulate recommendations in terms of technology, strategy, and policy. The paper is based on the main results of the European FP7 OASE Integrated Project that ran between January 1, 2010 and February 28, 2013.", "paper_title": "Next-Generation Optical Access Seamless Evolution: Concluding Results of the European FP7 Project OASE", "paper_id": "WOS:000349548900025"}
