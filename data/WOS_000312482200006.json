By attaching a back texture image on a single-sided 2D graphical object, we can enrich the surface and texture detail on 2D graphical objects and improve our visual experience when manipulating and animating them. A family of novel operations on 2.5D graphics, including rolling, twisting, and folding, are proposed in this work, allowing users to efficiently create compelling 2.5D visual effects. Very little effort is needed from the user's side. In our experiment, various creative designs on double-sided graphics were worked out by the recruited participants including a professional artist, which show and demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of our proposed method.", "paper_title": "Double-Sided 2.5D Graphics", "paper_id": "WOS:000312482200006"}
