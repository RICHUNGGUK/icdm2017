Virtual network (VN) planning has been proposed for this new networking paradigm by taking advantage of network virtualization. VN planning is essentially a united virtualization of optical and server resources in a collaborative manner. In this article, we first elaborate the advantages and problems of existing VN planning schemes through a comprehensive survey. Next, we provide a VN planning scheme. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy, particularly in the context of power outage and evolving recovery. Finally, the future opportunities and challenges are also discussed.", "paper_title": "Virtual Network Planning for Converged Optical and Data Centers: Ideas and Challenges", "paper_id": "WOS:000328643600009"}
