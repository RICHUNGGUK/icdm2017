We show that this technique is robust enough for viewpoint changes, lighting changes, large motions of the matched object and small changes in rotation and scale. Unlike other well-known color-based techniques, this technique only uses the gray level values of the image. The proposed algorithm is mainly based on the definition of a particular multi-scale template model and a similarity measure for template matching. The matching approach has been tested on video sequences acquired with a conventional webcam showing a promising behavior with this kind of low-quality images.", "paper_title": "Matching deformable features based on oriented multi-scale filter banks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239560700035"}
