We have considered the widely employed sigma-count, fuzzy numbers, and gradual numbers. Gradual numbers assign numbers to values of a relevance scale, typically [0, 1]. Contrary to sigma-count and fuzzy numbers, they provide a precise representation of the cardinality of a fuzzy set. We illustrate our claims by calculating the cardinality of the fuzzy set of pixels that match a certain fuzzy color in an image. For that purpose we consider fuzzy color spaces previously defined by the authors, consisting of a collection of fuzzy sets providing a suitable, conceptual quantization with soft boundaries of crisp color spaces. Finally, we show the suitability of our approaches to fuzzy quantification for different applications in image processing. First, the calculation of histograms. Second, the definition of the notion of dominant fuzzy color, and the calculation of the degree to which we can say that a certain color is dominant in an image. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
