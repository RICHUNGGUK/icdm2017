The real-valued time-delay neural network (RVTDNN) and the backpropagation (BP) learning algorithm were implemented on FPGA using Xilinx system generator for DSP and the Virtex-6 FPGA ML605 evaluation kit. Different RVTDNN architectures are proposed for various values of the number of hidden neurons, the activation function resolution, and the fixed-point data format. These architectures are evaluated and compared in terms of modeling performances and resource utilization using 16-QAM modulated test signal.", "paper_title": "FPGA-implementation of dynamic time delay neural network for power amplifier behavioral modeling", "paper_id": "WOS:000310639400017"}
