Some properties of the sinc-collocation method required for our subsequent development are given and are utilized to reduce the computation of solution of the system of second-order boundary value problems to some algebraic equations. Numerical examples are included to demonstrate the validity and applicability of the technique and a comparison is made with the existing results. The method is easy to implement and yields very accurate results. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
