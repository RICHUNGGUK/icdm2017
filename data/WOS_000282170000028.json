The U-Compare system provides a wide range of bio text mining resources in a highly interoperable workflow environment where workflows can very easily be created, executed, evaluated and visualized without coding. We have linked U-Compare to Taverna, a generic workflow system, to expose text mining functionality to the bioinformatics community.", "paper_title": "Text mining meets workflow: linking U-Compare with Taverna", "paper_id": "WOS:000282170000028"}
