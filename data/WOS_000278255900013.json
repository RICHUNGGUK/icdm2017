The algorithm described in this paper takes (a) two temporally-separated CT scans, I(1) and I(2), and (b) a series of nodule locations in I(1), and for each location it produces an affine transformation that maps the locations and their immediate neighborhoods from I(1) to I(2). It does this without deformable registration and without initialization by global affine registration. Requiring the nodule locations to be specified in only one volume provides the clinician more flexibility in investigating the condition of the lung. The algorithm uses a combination of feature extraction, indexing, refinement, and decision processes. Together, these processes essentially \"recognize\" the neighborhoods. We show on lung CF scans that our technique works at near interactive speed and that the median alignment error of 134 nodules is 1.70 mm compared to the error 2.14 mm of the Diffeomorphic Demons algorithm, and to the error 3.57 mm of the global nodule registration with local refinement. We demonstrate on the alignment of 250 nodules, that the algorithm is robust to changes caused by cancer progression and differences in breathing states, scanning procedures, and patient positioning. Our algorithm may be used both for diagnosis and treatment monitoring of lung cancer. Because of the generic design of the algorithm, it might also be used in other applications that require fast and accurate mapping of legions. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
