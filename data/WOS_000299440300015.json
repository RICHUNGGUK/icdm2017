In this scheme, nodes that already obtain the broadcast message serve as relays to help forward it to other nodes. Relying on the sheer number of relay nodes, our scheme provides a new angle for jamming countermeasure, which not only significantly enhances the performance of jamming-resistant broadcast, but can readily be combined with other existing or emerging antijamming approaches in various applications. We present the collaborative broadcast protocol, and analyze its successful packet reception rate and the corresponding cooperation gain for both synchronous and asynchronous relays for a snapshot scenario. We also investigate the full broadcast process based on a Markov chain model and derive a closed-form expression of the average broadcast delay. Simulation results in both single-hop and multihop networks indicate that our scheme is a promising antijamming technique in wireless networks.", "paper_title": "Jamming-Resistant Collaborative Broadcast Using Uncoordinated Frequency Hopping", "paper_id": "WOS:000299440300015"}
