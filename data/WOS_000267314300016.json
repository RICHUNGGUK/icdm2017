Consequently, the method of Homogenization of Periodic Structures (HPS) is used to identify the effective permeability tensor evolution under the effect of cement filtration. The expression of the macroscopic permeability tensor derived through the HPS procedure is shown to depend on the permeating fluid viscosity and the geometrical arrangement of the sand grains and cement deposit within the microstructure. Numerical computations are made using various two-dimensional and three-dimensional microstructures, and the model results are confronted with grouting experiments performed on small scale columns in the laboratory.
