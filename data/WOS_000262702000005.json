Then, we propose a sequential learning method for the structure identification of the CRFNN in order to confirm the fuzzy rules and their correlative parameters effectively. Furthermore, we improve the BP algorithm based on the characteristics of the proposed CRFNN to train the network. By modeling the typical nonlinear systems, we draw the conclusion that the proposed CRFNN has excellent dynamic response and strong learning ability.", "paper_title": "A novel compensation-based recurrent fuzzy neural network and its learning algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000262702000005"}
