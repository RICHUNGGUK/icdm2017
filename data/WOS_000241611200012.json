Typical energy optimization measures include voltage reduction and operating at the slowest possible speed. We employ additional methods, including hybrid asynchronous dynamic design to enable operating over a wide range of battery voltage, aggregating large combinational logic blocks, and transistor sizing and reordering. We demonstrate the methods on simple adders, and discuss extension to other circuits. Three novel adders are proposed and analyzed: a 2-bit pass transistor logic (PTL) adder and two dynamic 2-bit adders. Circuit simulations on a 0.18-mu m process at low voltage show that leakage energy is below 1%. The proposed adders achieve up to 40% energy savings relative to previously published results, while also operating faster.", "paper_title": "Minimal energy asynchronous dynamic adders", "paper_id": "WOS:000241611200012"}
