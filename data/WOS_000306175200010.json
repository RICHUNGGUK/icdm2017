Delivering such massive data streams to the end system nodes at the edge of the Internet has been a challenging problem in terms of high stress on the network links and high demand on network resources and routing node capacities. Most of existing research has been dedicated on geo-distance based routing with various optimizations to alleviate the performance impact on geo-distance based routing due to unpredictable network dynamics. Most representative techniques are targeted at reducing the delivery path length or optimizing routing path by utilizing network locality. In this paper, we identify the inefficiency of geo-distance based routing protocols in many existing multicast overlay networks in terms of both resource utilization and group communication efficiency. To address this issue, we develop a utility-based routing scheme (UDR) that can provide efficient group communication services in a decentralized geographical overlay network. Our approach makes three unique contributions. First, we introduce a utility function to refine the geo-distance based routing in such a way that the routing path selection can carefully incorporate both geo-distance based metric and the network latency. Second, we enhance our utility driven routing scheme with self-adaptive capability by considering the nodes' state and network density. Thus, nodes in the multicast network can dynamically accommodate the changes of network conditions based solely on their local knowledge about the network. Third, we devise a suite of optimization techniques to minimize the maintenance cost and computational complexity of our self-adaptive and utility-drive routing scheme. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments based on a realistic network topology model and show that the UDR method is highly scalable and it effectively enhances the multicast delivery efficiency for large scale group communication services compared to existing geo-distance based routing protocols.", "paper_title": "Scaling Group Communication Services with Self-adaptive and Utility-driven Message Routing", "paper_id": "WOS:000306175200010"}
