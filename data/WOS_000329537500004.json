The procedure, which is quite naive, benefits from simple explicit expressions of the derivatives, to any order, of the Pochhammer and reciprocal Pochhammer symbols with respect to their argument. The algorithm may be used algebraically, irrespective of the values of the parameters. It reproduces the exact results obtained by other authors in cases of especially simple parameters. Implemented numerically, the procedure improves considerably, for higher orders in e, the numerical expansions given by other methods. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
