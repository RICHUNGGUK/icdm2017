The discontinuity is treated by splitting the domain at the discontinuities in a multi block fashion. Each sub-domain is discretized with compact second derivave summation by parts operators and the blocks are patched together to a global domain using the projection method. This guarantees a conservative, strictly stable and high order accurate scheme. The analysis is verified by numerical simulations in one and two spatial dimensions. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
