The system aims to detect and classify prostatic tissue textures captured from microscopic samples taken from needle biopsies. Biopsies are usually analyzed by a trained pathologist with different grades of malignancy typically corresponding to different structural patterns as well as apparent textures. In the context of prostate cancer diagnosis, four major groups have to be accurately recognized: stroma, benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, and prostatic carcinoma. Recently, multispectral imagery has been proposed as a new image acquisition modality which unlike conventional RGB-based light microscopy allows the acquisition of a large number of spectral bands within the visible spectrum, resulting in a large feature vector size. Many features in the initial feature set are irrelevant to the classification task and are correlated with each other, resulting in an increase in the computational complexity and a reduction in the recognition rate. In this paper, a Round-Robin (RR) sequential forward selection RR-SFS is used to address these problems. RR is a technique for handling multi-class problems with binary classifiers by training one classifier for each pair of classes. The experimental results demonstrate this finding when compared with classical method based on the multiclass SFS and other ensemble methods such as bagging/boosting with decision tree (C4.5) classifier where it is shown that RR-SFS method achieves the best results with a classification accuracy of 99.9%.", "paper_title": "Round-Robin sequential forward selection algorithm for prostate cancer classification and diagnosis using multispectral imagery", "paper_id": "WOS:000293961900011"}
