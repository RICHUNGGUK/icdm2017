The obtained stability condition is applied to the problem of networked control system robust design in the presence of network-induced delays and data packet dropouts. Illustrative examples are provided to show the advantage and applicability of the developed results in this case.", "paper_title": "Improved synthesis method for network-based control", "paper_id": "WOS:000293842400020"}
