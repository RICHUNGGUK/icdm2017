In these work meetings the participants share information, discuss ideas, make decisions and produce documents. Specifically, we approach a type of meeting in which the participants are at distance and make use of mobile devices on wireless networks. Along this line, we have developed a system to support these new kinds of electronic meeting settings. The system design was informed with our observations of real meetings, the analysis of some EMSs and other information collection techniques. The system, called REMO, follows a three-stage model (pre-meeting, meeting and post-meeting) and includes a wide set of collaborative tools. REMO can be used both from a central meeting place, with video-projectors and interactive whiteboards, and from remote locations.", "paper_title": "A system to support collaborative mobile electronic meetings", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500025"}
