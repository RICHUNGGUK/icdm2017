We construct PSN polytopes by three different methods, the most versatile of which is an extension of Sanyal & Ziegler's \"projecting deformed products\" construction to products of arbitrary simple polytopes. For general r and k, the lowest dimension we achieve is 2k+r+1. Using topological obstructions similar to those introduced by Sanyal to bound the number of vertices of Minkowski sums, we show that this dimension is minimal if we additionally require that the PSN polytope is obtained as a projection of a polytope that is combinatorially equivalent to the product of r simplices, when the dimensions of these simplices are all large compared to k.", "paper_title": "Prodsimplicial-Neighborly Polytopes", "paper_id": "WOS:000290031200006"}
