However, its application is still very limited, partly due to the complexity of existing semiparametric estimation methods. We propose a new semiparametric estimation method based on the induced smoothing and rank type estimates. The parameter estimates and their variances can be easily obtained from the smoothed estimating equation; thus it is easy to use in practice. Our numerical study shows that the new method is more efficient than the existing methods with respect to its variance estimation and coverage probability. The proposed method is employed to reanalyze a data set from a brain tumor treatment study. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
