Therefore signal detection of MIMO-OFDM system is important issue. In this letter, extended DFE detection scheme is proposed. According to simulation result, the extended DFE detection has similar performance with QRD-M detection but the complexity is about 24.02% of QRD-M detection. Therefore the proposed E-DFE detection can be efficiently used in MIMO-OFDM system.", "paper_title": "Extended DFE Detection Scheme in MIMO-OFDM System", "paper_id": "WOS:000359466800022"}
