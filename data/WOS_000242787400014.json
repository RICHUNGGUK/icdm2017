To stabilize the discrete boundary value problem, two sets of boundary closures are introduced to couple the velocity and vorticity fields. A Newton solver is used for solving steady-state and time-dependent equations. In this solver, the Jacobian matrix is formulated and stored in component form. To solve the system of linearized equations within each iteration of Newton's method, preconditioned Bi-CGSTAB is used in combination with a matrix-vector product computed in component form. The almost dense Jacobian matrix is approximated by a partial Jacobian. For the preconditioner equation, the partial Jacobian is approximately factored using several methods. In a detailed study of several preconditioning techniques, a promising method based on ILUT preconditioning in combination with reordering and double scaling using the MC64 algorithm by Duff and Koster is selected. To validate the implicit compact scheme solver, several nonreacting model problems have been considered. At least third order accuracy in space is recovered on nonuniform grids. A comparison of the results of the implicit compact scheme solver with the results of a traditional implicit low order solver shows an order of magnitude reduction of computer memory and time using the compact scheme solver in the case of time-dependent mixing problems.
