The recovery of original skills, when possible, is closely related to the frequency, quality, and duration of rehabilitative therapy. Rehabilitation gloves are tools used both to facilitate rehabilitation and to control improvements by an evaluation system. Mechanical gloves have high cost, are often cumbersome, are not re-usable and, hence, not usable with the healthy hand to collect patient-specific hand mobility information to which rehabilitation should tend. The approach we propose is the virtual glove, a system that, unlike tools based on mechanical haptic interfaces, uses a set of video cameras surrounding the patient hand to collect a set of synchronized videos used to track hand movements. The hand tracking is associated with a numerical hand model that is used to calculate physical, geometrical and mechanical parameters, and to implement some boundary constraints such as joint dimensions, shape, joint angles, and so on. Besides being accurate, the proposed system is aimed to be low cost, not bulky (touch-less), easy to use, and re-usable. Previous works described the virtual glove general concepts, the hand model, and its characterization including system calibration strategy. The present paper provides the virtual glove overall design, both in real-time and in off-line modalities. In particular, the real-time modality is described and implemented and a marker-based hand tracking algorithm, including a marker positioning, coloring, labeling, detection and classification strategy, is presented for the off-line modality. Moreover, model based hand tracking experimental measurements are reported, discussed and compared with the corresponding poses of the real hand. An error estimation strategy is also presented and used for the collected measurements. System limitations and future work for system improvement are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
