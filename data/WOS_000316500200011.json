It is crucial to locate and replace the faulty processors to maintain a system's high reliability. The fault diagnosis is the process of identifying faulty processors in a system through testing. This paper shows that the largest connected component of the survival graph contains almost all of the remaining vertices in the dual-cube DC when the number of faulty vertices is up to twice or three times of the traditional connectivity. Based on this fault resiliency, this paper determines that the conditional diagnosability of DC, (n >= 3) under the comparison model is 3n-2, which is about three times of the traditional diagnosability.", "paper_title": "CONDITIONAL FAULT DIAGNOSABILITY OF DUAL-CUBES", "paper_id": "WOS:000316500200011"}
