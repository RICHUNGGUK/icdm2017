Nevertheless, most of combinatorial optimization problems have critical requirements in their definition and are usually not easy to solve due to the difficulty in gene encoding. The traveling salesman problem is an example that requires each node to be visited exactly once. In this paper, we propose a genetic local search method with priority-based encoding. This method retains generality in applications, supports schema analysis during searching process, and is verified to gain remarkable search results for the traveling salesman problem.", "paper_title": "Priority-based genetic local search and its application to the traveling salesman problem", "paper_id": "WOS:000242556300054"}
