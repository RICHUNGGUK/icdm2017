In a multi-criteria decision making context, a pairwise comparison matrix A = (a(ij)) is a reciprocal matrix that represents auseful tool for determining a weighting vector wfor a set Xof decision elements; but, when Ais inconsistent, the weighting vector, usually proposed in literature, may provide a ranking on Xthat does not agree with the expressed preference intensities a(ij), thus, it is unreliable. We analyze a condition of transitivity for a reciprocal matrix A = (a(ij)) over an abelian linearly ordered group, that, whenever Ais a pairwise comparison matrix, allows us to state a qualitative dominance ranking on Xand obtain ordinal evaluation vectors; in this way, we get a first tool for checking the reliability of a weighting vector. We also provide tools to check the transitivity. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
