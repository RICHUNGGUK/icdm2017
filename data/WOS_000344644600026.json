NetPathMiner interfaces with various input formats including KGML, SBML and BioPAX files and allows for manipulation of networks in three different forms: metabolic, reaction and gene representations. NetPathMiner ranks the obtained paths and applies Markov model-based clustering and classification methods to the ranked paths for easy interpretation. NetPathMiner also provides static and interactive visualizations of networks and paths to aid manual investigation.", "paper_title": "NetPathMiner: R/Bioconductor package for network path mining through gene expression", "paper_id": "WOS:000344644600026"}
