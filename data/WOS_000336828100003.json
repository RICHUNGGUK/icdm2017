Unrotated and Varimax-rotated factor analyses performed on the imputed datasets were compared. All methods performed similarly, although multiple imputation yielded more disperse imputed values. Main differences occurred when a variable with missing values correlated poorly to the other features and when a variable had relevant loadings in several unrotated factors, which sometimes changed the order of the rotated factors.
