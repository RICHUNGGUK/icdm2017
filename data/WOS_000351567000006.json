To enhance the intra prediction accuracy, 35 intra prediction modes were used in the prediction units (PUs), with partition sizes ranging from 4 x 4 to 64 x 64 in HEVC. However, the manifold prediction modes dramatically increase the encoding complexity. This paper proposes a fast mode- and depth-decision algorithm based on edge detection and reconfiguration to alleviate the large computational complexity in intra prediction with trivial degradation in accuracy. For mode decision, we propose pixel gradient statistics (PGS) and mode refinement (MR). PGS uses pixel gradient information to assist in selecting the prediction mode after rough mode decision (RMD). MR uses the neighboring mode information to select the best PU mode (BPM). For depth decision, we propose a partition reconfiguration algorithm to replace the original partitioning order with a more reasonable structure, by using the smoothness of the coding unit as a criterion in deciding the prediction depth. Smoothness detection is based on the PGS result. Experiment results show that the proposed method saves about 41.50% of the original processing time with little degradation (BD bitrate increased by 0.66% and BDPSNR decreased by 0.060 dB) in the coding gain.", "paper_title": "Fast Mode and Depth Decision for HEVC Infra Prediction Based on Edge Detection and Partition Reconfiguration", "paper_id": "WOS:000351567000006"}
