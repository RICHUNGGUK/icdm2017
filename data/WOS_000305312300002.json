To serve their customers, SaaS providers utilise resources of internal data centres or rent resources from a public Infrastructure as a Service (laaS) provider. In-house hosting can increase administration and maintenance costs whereas renting from an laaS provider can impact the service quality due to its variable performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose innovative admission control and scheduling algorithms for SaaS providers to effectively utilise public Cloud resources to maximize profit by minimizing cost and improving customer satisfaction level. Furthermore, we conduct an extensive evaluation study to analyse which solution suits best in which scenario to maximize SaaS provider's profit. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithms provide substantial improvement (up to 40% cost saving) over reference ones across all ranges of variation in QoS parameters.
