Training patterns are input to the algorithm one by one and grouped into blobs through similarity tests. The statistical mean of each blob is regarded as a prototype representing all the patterns included in the blob. The collection of such means can then be used to substitute the original training set, and, consequently, the training set for later supervised learning is reduced. This approach has several advantages. The distribution of the data contained in each blob is statistically well described. Each obtained prototype is a good representative of the patterns included in the corresponding blob. Different numbers of representatives are extracted automatically according to the similarity relationship among and the distribution of the original training patterns. Furthermore, our method can be applied efficiently to both regression and classification problems. Experimental results show that the proposed method performs more effectively than other prototype reduction methods.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL PROTOTYPE REDUCTION APPROACH FOR SUPERVISED LEARNING", "paper_id": "WOS:000305161100007"}
