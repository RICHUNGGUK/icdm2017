The reactive transport benchmark of GNR MoMaS is here presented and solved on its easy 1D version. The reactive transport code SPECY is presented with a brief description of its main numerical methods: discontinuous finite elements for solving advection, mixed hybrid finite elements for solving dispersion and Newton-Raphson method to linearise the equilibrium chemistry and respect of the chemically allowed interval and positive continuous fractions methods to increase the robustness of the chemistry resolution. By successive mesh and time step refinement, we use the reactive transport code SPECY to look for a reference solution to this problem.", "paper_title": "Looking for some reference solutions for the reactive transport benchmark of MoMaS with SPECY", "paper_id": "WOS:000278899300003"}
