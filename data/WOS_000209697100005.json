It is shown that the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the link from source to destination and that from relays to destination are correlated due to the common CCI at the destination. Considering the correlated SINRs, the exact closed-form expression for the outage probability is derived. It is shown that the analytical results perfectly match the simulation results.", "paper_title": "Exact Outage Probability of Nth-Best Multicast Relay Networks with Co-Channel Interference", "paper_id": "WOS:000209697100005"}
