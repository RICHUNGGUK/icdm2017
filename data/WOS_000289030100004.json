By comparing physician billing data from Quebec, Canada and hospital admission records, we assessed the timeliness of medical visits for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) to two types of outpatient healthcare settings. Overall, ILI visits by children aged 5-17 years at community-based settings were the most strongly correlated with hospital admissions and gave the greatest lead over hospital admissions. However, a degree of year-to-year variation suggests that syndromic surveillance of influenza should not focus on just a single subgroup. These findings reveal the richness of these real-time data for epidemic monitoring and demonstrate the flexibility of syndromic surveillance. By using real-time data, an evolving epidemic can be rapidly characterized by its epidemiological patterns, which is not possible with traditional surveillance systems. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
