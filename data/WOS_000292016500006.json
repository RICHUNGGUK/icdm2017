C-shaped compact microstrip antennas with different physical dimensions and electrical parameters were simulated by means of a software package that employs the method of finite difference time domain. With the aid of the artificial bee colony algorithm, an expression for the resonant length depending on physical dimensions was constructed by using simulation data. The resonant length expression provided less than 1.6% error on average over the simulated 144 antennas. A comparison between the results obtained in this work and previous results presented in the literature is given to show the accuracy of the proposed expression.", "paper_title": "A novel expression for resonant length obtained by using artificial bee colony algorithm in calculating resonant frequency of C-shaped compact microstrip antennas", "paper_id": "WOS:000292016500006"}
