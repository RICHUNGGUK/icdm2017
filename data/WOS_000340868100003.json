Graph embedding framework theory is used to construct the dimensionality reduction stage of speech emotion recognition. Special penalty and intrinsic graphs of the graph embedding framework is proposed to penalize the impacts from different speakers in the task of speech emotion recognition. The original speech emotion features are extracted by various categories, reflecting different characteristics of each speech sample. According to the experiments in speech emotion corpus using different classifiers, the proposed method with linear and kernelized mapping forms can both achieve relatively better performance than the state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction methods.", "paper_title": "Graph Learning Based Speaker Independent Speech Emotion Recognition", "paper_id": "WOS:000340868100003"}
