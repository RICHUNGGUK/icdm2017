Periventricular Leukomalacia (PVL) is such a pathology diagnosed on infants with a very low birth weight (< 1500g). Next to the US images Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) volumes are commonly used for the inspection of this pathology. Since on both modalities, up to now, we still lack a golden standard for the quantification of the syndrome cross-validation through a multi-modal registration is highly beneficial to the clinical diagnosis. In this article we present a 2D US - 3D MRI registration scheme combining an interactive initialization step, B-spline image interpolation, a mutual information based metric and an evolutionary algorithm optimization scheme.", "paper_title": "2D/3D registration of neonatal brain images", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485200033"}
