A general formulation of the method for bounded and moving domains is presented. Furthermore, an approximation property of the reconstruction formula is proved. Then, based on a two-dimensional test problem posed oil a moving domain, a special Ansatz for the movement of the particles is proposed. The obtained numerical results indicate that this method is well suited for such problems, and thus a first step to apply the FVPM to real industrial problems involving free boundaries or fluid-structure interaction is taken. Finally, we perform a numerical convergence study for a shock tube problem and a simple linear advection equation.
