This paper focuses on application research that emphasizes the development of a new systematic approach to accomplishing job rotation for staff nurses in a large-scale hospital system with branches located in different geographical areas. The proposed approach is based on the analytic hierarchy process (A HP) methodology and 0-1 integer programming (IP) for implementing job rotation with multiple factors and interactive perspectives. The A HP method is employed to assess and set the weights for each nurse candidate and job/department candidate. The 0-1 IP model applies these weights to find an optimal rotation plan. The results show that the proposed approach is able to help decision makers provide feasible and quality solutions for achieving job rotation in a hospital system.", "paper_title": "AN INTERACTIVE PERSPECTIVE MODEL BASED ON AHP AND 0-1 IP FOR THE STAFF JOB ROTATION OF NURSES IN LARGE-SCALE HOSPITALS", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100007"}
