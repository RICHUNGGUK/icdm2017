Each micro-navigation sensor system consists of a global positioning system receiver, a solid-state inertial measurement unit and lasers. To maintain the orientation accuracy of the satellites in the network, an orientation information transfer (OIT) method was developed. Two laser links are established to align a satellite with low orientation accuracy from a satellite with high orientation accuracy. The OIT process is similar to the spread of an epidemic, which has been extensively studied in the epidemiology. Therefore, the information transfer process was analysed by applying a modified epidemic model. The relation between OIT process and the orientation accuracy of the satellites in the network was mathematically investigated. It is shown that the OIT using lasers greatly improves the orientation accuracy of all satellites in the network. Furthermore, the overall orientation accuracy of the satellite network can be improved by increasing the alignment rate or decreasing the decay rate, which are the parameters of the system. The simulation results verified the analysis of the system. The results showed the feasibility of using epidemic theory to analyse orientation accuracy of a satellite network. Finally, this OIT model will allow coordination of relative attitudes between satellites.", "paper_title": "Orientation accuracy analysis of multiple satellite networks using epidemic model", "paper_id": "WOS:000268935000002"}
