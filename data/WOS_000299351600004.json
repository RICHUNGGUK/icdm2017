In contrast, \"utility-aware\" methods are informed by models of screeners' preferences and can increase the rate at which the useful information is discovered. Clique-oriented prioritization (COP) extends a recently proposed economic framework and aims by changing which hits are sent for confirmatory testing to maximize the number of scaffolds with at least two confirmed active examples. In both retrospective and prospective experiments, COP enables accurate predictions of the number of clique discoveries in a batch of confirmatory experiments and improves the rate of clique discovery by more than 3-fold. In contrast, other similarity-based methods like ontology-based pattern identification (OPI) and local hit-rate analysis (LHR) reduce the rate of scaffold discovery by about half. The utility-aware algorithm used to implement COP is general enough to implement several other important models of screener preferences.", "paper_title": "Utility-Aware Screening with Clique-Oriented Prioritization", "paper_id": "WOS:000299351600004"}
