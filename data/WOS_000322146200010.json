Mathematical model of the switch is obtained using graph theory. Initially network traffic entry and exit parts in a single RAPIEnet switch are identified, so that a bipartite conflict graph can be constructed. The obtained conflict graph is transformed to three kinds of matrices to be used as inputs for our simulation model, and selection of any of the matrix forms is application-specific. A greedy edge-coloring algorithm is used to schedule the network traffic and to solve the minimum coloring problem. After scheduling, empty slots are identified for forwarding the non real-time traffic of asynchronous devices. Finally, an algorithm for synchronizing the schedules of adjacent switches is proposed using edge-contraction and minors. All simulations were carried out using Matlab.", "paper_title": "A Scheduling and Synchronization Technique for RAPIEnet Switches Using Edge-Coloring of Conflict Multigraphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000322146200010"}
