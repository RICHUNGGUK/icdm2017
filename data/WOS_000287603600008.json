However, unless users continue using mobile services, service providers cannot achieve success. Drawing upon the expectation confirmation theory, this research develops a mobile post-adoption model. The post-adoption behaviour includes three variables: continuance intention, recommendation and complaint. We conducted data analysis with partial least squares. The results indicated that expectation confirmation, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and usage cost significantly affect users' satisfaction, further determining their post-adoption behaviour. In addition, perceived usefulness has a direct effect on the continuance intention.", "paper_title": "An empirical examination of users' post-adoption behaviour of mobile services", "paper_id": "WOS:000287603600008"}
