This impact is usually evaluated as the quantity of affected data as well as the duration of the failure. However, the impact also has economic consequences such as the cost of the personnel required to repair the failures, the cost of the personnel to restore the services, penalties through possible service level agreement violations, etc. We evaluate the impact of the protection schemes and the network component's availability on the operational cost.
