Domain switching is realized by an optimization algorithm to minimize the free energy of each grain and is thus a gradual process with applied loading. Similar to phase field modeling, no priori domain-switching criterion is imposed in the proposed model and its computational efficiency is much higher. The domain textures evolution process can also be captured. Simulation results on both tetragonal and rhombohedral PZT ceramics illustrate the efficiency of this model. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
