However, many applications do not require complete coverage all the time. For such applications, one effective method to save energy and prolong network lifetime is to partially cover the area. This method for prolonging network lifetime recently attracts much attention. However, due to the hardness of verifying the coverage ratio, all the existing centralized or distributed but nonparallel algorithms for partial coverage have very high time complexities. In this work, we propose a framework which can transform almost any existing complete coverage algorithm to a partial coverage one with any coverage ratio by running a complete coverage algorithm to find full coverage sets with virtual radii and converting the coverage sets to partial coverage sets via adjusting sensing radii. Our framework can preserve the characteristics of the original algorithms and the conversion process has low time complexity. The framework also guarantees some degree of uniform partial coverage of the monitored area.", "paper_title": "Transforming Complete Coverage Algorithms to Partial Coverage Algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000287580000014"}
