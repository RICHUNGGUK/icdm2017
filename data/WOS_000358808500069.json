Given a set of positive and negative examples of a specific foreground (an object of interest (001) in an image or a tracked objet in a video), we first learn the foreground distribution model and its characteristic features that best discriminate it from its contextual background. For this goal, an objective function based on feature likelihood ratio is proposed for supervised FR computation. FR is then incorporated in foreground segmentation of new images and videos using level sets and energy minimization. We show the effectiveness of our approach on several examples of image/video figure-ground segmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
