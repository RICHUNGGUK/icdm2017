In computing q-values, qvality employs a standard bootstrap procedure to estimate the prior probability of a score being from the null distribution; for PEP estimation, qvality relies upon non-parametric logistic regression. Relative to other tools for estimating statistical confidence measures, qvality is unique in its ability to estimate both types of scores directly from a null distribution, without requiring the user to calculate p-values.", "paper_title": "<sc>qvality</sc>: non-parametric estimation of q-values and posterior error probabilities", "paper_id": "WOS:000264651800022"}
