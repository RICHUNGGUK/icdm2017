A set of agents collaborate to capture a hostile intruder in the network. While the agents can move in the network one hop at a time, the intruder is assumed to be arbitrarily fast i.e. it can traverse any number of nodes contiguously as far as there are no agents in those nodes. Here we consider a new version of the problem where each agent can replicate new agents when needed, i.e. the algorithm starts with a single agent and new agents are created on demand. We define a new class of algorithms for capturing an intruder. In particular, we propose two different algorithms on mesh and torus networks and we will later discuss about the merits of each algorithm based on some performance criteria.", "paper_title": "Intruder capturing in mesh and torus networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291000021"}
