The effective integration of people with disabilities in the workplace is a huge challenge to society, and it presents an opportunity to make use of new technologies. The project, called AZTECA, aims to develop new tools that contribute to the employment of groups of people with visual, hearing, or motor disabilities in office environments. These different tools for the disabled people have been modelled with intelligent agents that use Web services. These agents are implemented and deployed within the PANGEA platform so PANGEA conforms the skeleton of the system and allows to develop an integral system. The main target of prototype presented in this work is the people detection using ZigBee technology and the personalization of the workplace according to the user's disability.", "paper_title": "Personalization of the Workplace through a Proximity Detection System Using User Profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000323958700001"}
