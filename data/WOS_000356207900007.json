We find that CSI has been following its scope very closely in the last three years and that the majority of its publications have a technical focus. Articles published in CSI constantly cite research from various technical disciplines, but there are also a limited number of references to non-technical literature. Mostly technical journals cite CSI papers, with a few exceptions of non-technical journals. We conclude that CSI stays within its scope of computer standards and interfaces interpreted in a technical sense. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
