A number of difficulties that people cope with when dealing with problems related to infinity include its abstract nature, understanding infinity as an ongoing, never ending process, understanding infinity as a set of an infinite number of elements and appreciating well-known paradoxes. Infinity can be understood in several ways with often incompatible meanings, and can involve value judgments or assumptions that are neither explicit nor desired. To usher in its definition, we distinguish several aspects, teleological, artistic (Escher); some definitive, some potential, and others actual. This article also deals with some still unresolved aspects of the concept of infinity.", "paper_title": "Walking Through Cantor's Paradise and Escher's Garden: Epistemological Reflections on the Mathematical Infinite (II)", "paper_id": "WOS:000357406400004"}
