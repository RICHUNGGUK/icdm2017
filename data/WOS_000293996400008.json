We present a method for decoupling the time scales. Its central ideas are the introduction of a wear density on the entire wearing surface and the establishment of an evolution equation in the slow time scale. The sample problem of a wearing disk rolling on a rigid rail is studied. In particular. we discuss the non-monotonous influence of the speed on the wear evolution and on the polygonalization of wheels. (C) 2011 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
