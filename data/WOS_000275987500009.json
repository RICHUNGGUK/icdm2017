It is shown that the proposed learning algorithm converges globally to an AR optimal estimate. Compared with conventional second-order and high-order statistical algorithms, the proposed learning algorithm can obtain a robust estimate which has a smaller mean-square error than the conventional least-squares estimate. Compared with the learning algorithm based on the generalized least absolute deviation method, instead of minimizing a non-smooth linear L(1) function, the proposed learning algorithm minimizes a quadratic convex function and thus is suitable for online parameter estimation. Simulation results confirm that the proposed learning algorithm can obtain more accurate estimates with a fast convergence speed. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
