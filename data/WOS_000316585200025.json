The method is based on a large deformation finite element analysis employing the updated Lagrangian formulation. It can simulate the changing geometry of slopes during failure. An extended Mohr-Coulomb constitutive model represents the strain softening behaviour of slope material. The results of a series of analyses show that the post-failure deformation of slopes is a function of the rate of strength reduction and also the stiffness of the slope material. These two factors influence the initiation of progressive failure of slopes. The validity of the method is evaluated by simulation of a test embankment failure and comparison of the predicted results with the observed record of the failure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
