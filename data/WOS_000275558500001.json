An optimisation algorithm is presented which generates the fixed wireless access network infrastructure design, and results are presented to illustrate the use of the model and its implementation. Economic measures based on the net present value (NPV) are defined to assess the financial viability of potential network designs. The NPV is used within the mathematical optimization framework to produce cost-effective deployments that maximize economic performance while maintaining technical constraints on the network. The model takes into account time-varying input parameters on CapEx, OpEx, revenues and subscriber requirements to model the dynamic nature of the market. Technical radio constraints taken into account include downlink area coverage, interference, capacity and availability. The model and optimisation framework are illustrated by considering the deployment and configuration of infrastructure for three scenarios representing urban, suburban and rural regions. Experiments illustrating the staged deployment of infrastructure over a number of time periods are also presented.", "paper_title": "Modelling and planning fixed wireless networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000275558500001"}
