However, the design and development of this kind of systems is difficult, especially due to the multidisciplinarity involved. We propose a design and development process based on the use of several conceptual models. In this process several techniques are used. In this paper we present our proposal of using pattern-based techniques to design groupware systems. We define collaboration patterns for modeling collaborative tasks and protocols of cooperation. These techniques are part of a methodological framework which outlines several stages and notations to describe other aspects of a groupware system.", "paper_title": "Applying pattern-based techniques to design groupware applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000241135500028"}
