The Backward Recursive PCE-based parallel approach (PA) for disjoint paths can achieve best computation performance at high cost of computation complexity and communication overhead. In this paper, we propose an enhanced PA (EPA), based on a no-differentiated in-BNs pair strategy to decrease the computation complex and communication overhead. The simulation results show that the EPA scheme can effectively reduce the computation and communication overhead.", "paper_title": "An enhanced backward recursive PCE-based computation scheme for end-to-end disjoint paths in multi-domain networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000305533300003"}
