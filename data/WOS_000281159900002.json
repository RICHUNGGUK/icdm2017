Reducing the related energy consumption is very important for wireless devices. Compared to conventional grid systems, energy aware grids need to support application quality of service (QoS) with limited energy. There is an inherent conflict in the design goals for high grid application QoS and low energy consumption. To address this challenging problem, this article considers joint optimisation of application QoS and energy conservation in grid environment. Joint optimisation of application QoS and energy conservation is targeted to maximise the system utility without exceeding the deadline and the total energy available, which can be provided by an exhaustible source such as a battery. This article formulates joint optimisation of application QoS and energy conservation as constrained maximisation problem; the constraints include energy budget and application QoS requirements. This article also presents a QoS and energy aware scheduling algorithm (QESA) which balances application QoS and energy conservation to improve system performance. In the simulation, the performance evaluation of QESA is conducted.", "paper_title": "Joint optimisation of application QoS and energy conservation in grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000281159900002"}
