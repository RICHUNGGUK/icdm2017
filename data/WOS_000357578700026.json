On the other hand, the life science research usually produces new knowledge at an increasing speed; Knowledge such as papers, databases and other systems knowledge that a researcher needs to deal with is actually a complex task that needs much of efforts and time. Thus the management of knowledge is therefore an important issue for life scientists. Approaches has been developed to organize biological knowledge sources and to record provenance knowledge of an experiment into a readily resource are presently being carried out. This article focuses on the knowledge management of in silico experimentation in bioinformatics workflow systems.", "paper_title": "Technical Perspectives on Knowledge Management in Bioinformatics Workflow Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000357578700026"}
