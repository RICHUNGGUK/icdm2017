The stochastic neural networks under consideration are subject to time-varying delay in both the state and measurement equations. The aim is to design a stable full-order linear filter assuring asymptotical mean-square stability and a prescribed or generalized H (2) performance indexes for the filtering error systems. Delay-dependent sufficient conditions for the existence of and generalized H (2) filters are both proposed in terms of linear matrix inequalities. Finally, numerical example demonstrates that the proposed approaches are effective.", "paper_title": "Delay-dependent H-infinity and generalized H-2 filtering for stochastic neural networks with time-varying delay and noise disturbance", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700011"}
