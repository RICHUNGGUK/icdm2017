The overall objective is to minimize the total weighted tardiness of the set of jobs related to these tasks. A mixed integer formulation is decomposed into two levels: the upper level master problem of task assignment and scheduling; and the lower level routing subproblem. The master problem is solved by using Lagrangian relaxation and a lower bound is obtained. Either the solution turns out to be feasible for the lower level or a feasible solution for the problem is constructed, and an upper bound is obtained. If the convergence is not satisfied, cuts are generated to exclude previous feasible solutions before solving the master problem again. Two types of cuts are proposed to reduce the duality gap. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated from computational experiments. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
