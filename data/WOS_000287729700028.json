The Ostrovsky equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation and also is complicated due to a nonlinear integral operator as well as spatial and temporal derivatives. In this paper we propose a numerical scheme for solving this equation. Our numerical method is based on a collocation method with three different bases such as B-spline, Fourier and Chebyshev. A numerical comparison of these schemes is also provided by three examples. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
