Our objective is to derive a regularized Gauss-Newton method using the corresponding operator equation in which the unknown is the geometric domain. The theoretical foundation for the Gauss-newton method is given by establishing the differentiability of the initial boundary value problem with respect to the boundary Curve in the sense of a domain derivative. The numerical examples show that out theory is useful for practical purpose and the proposed algorithm is feasible.
