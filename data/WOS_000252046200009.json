The number of Latin squares having a fixed isotopism in their autotopism group is at the moment an open problem. In this paper, we use Grobner bases to describe an algorithm that allows one to obtain the previous number. Specifically, this algorithm is implemented in SINGULAR to obtain the number of Latin squares related to any autotopism of Latin squares of order up to 7. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
