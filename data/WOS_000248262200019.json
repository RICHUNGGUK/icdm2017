An image is modeled as a set of spatial patterns defined on a rectangular lattice. The distance between a spatial pattern and each cluster is defined as a combination of the Euclidean distance in the feature space and the spatial dissimilarity which reflects how much of the pattern's neighbourhood is occupied by other clusters. Our approach has been compared with the Fuzzy C-Mean (FCM) algorithm, a spatial fuzzy clustering algorithm and a Markov Random Field (MRF) based algorithm by segmenting synthetic images, texture mosaics and natural images. The results of those comparative experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach can segment images more effectively and provide more robust segmentation results. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
