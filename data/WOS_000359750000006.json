They first point out some new weaknesses of the diffusion layer and key schedule of this algorithm. Then they exploit them to cryptanalyst the full round version of KLEIN-64 using an asymmetric biclique. The (worst case) computations and data complexity of this cryptanalysis are 2(62.84) and 2(39), respectively. A modified version of this cryptanalysis is also presented which is slightly faster at the expense of the data required.", "paper_title": "Biclique cryptanalysis of the full-round KLEIN block cipher", "paper_id": "WOS:000359750000006"}
