Many successful applications for geophysical flows followed. This paper introduces the original development of an MPDATA solver operating on a classical set of conservation laws, applicable to high-speed compressible flows. The solver belongs to a general class of the second-order nonoscillatory forward-in-Lime schemes. Theoretical considerations are supported with numerical examples. An elementary three-dimensional spherical wave-propagation problem illustrates that MPDATA correctly captures signal transfer in acoustic flows.
