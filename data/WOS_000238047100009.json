The protection of mobile agents against the attacks of malicious hosts is considered a very challenging security problem. It has inspired lot of research interest, but very few measures exist to counter blocking attack where a host with malicious intentions refuses to transmit a mobile agent to the next host. It becomes an important requirement for the agent owner to rescue the data collected by the agent under custody and redeem a loss. In this paper, we present two schemes that rescue the offering results from a malicious host's blocking attack, and make a comparison of their performance from several aspects. Our approach has two new features that previous protocols lack. It allows the proper handling of time-sensitive offers and supports the gradual decision-making execution. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V.
