Using high frequency electromagnetic simulation of 3-Dimensional inductors performed by Ansoft HFSS(R), we have investigated the effects of number of turns, effective radius, metal line width, and different substrates on the quality factor, Q and self-resonant frequency, f(sr) of these inductors. We also have compared the simulated results with the measurement results of 3-D inductors fabricated using this technology.", "paper_title": "Design of high-Q 3-D integrated inductors for high frequency applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000243030200002"}
