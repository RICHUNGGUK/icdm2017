For each design, performed all atom replica exchange molecular dynamics, esimulations over several microseconds and compared the results to extensive published NMR. data. We find excellent agreetrient with experimental NPE distande restraints, suggesting that molecular simulation caribe a useful tool for the computational design of pre organized solution state structure. Moreover, our analysis of conformational populations estimates that, despite the potential for increased flexibility due to backbone amide isomerizaton, N-methyIation provides about 0.5 kcal/mol of reduced conformational entropy to cyclic RGD peptides. The combination Of pre organization and binding site compatibility explains the Strong binding affinity of cilengitide to integrin.", "paper_title": "Molecular Simulation of Conformational Pre-Organization in Cyclic RGD Peptides", "paper_id": "WOS:000353668600010"}
