Several authors have shown that multiple seeds can have better sensitivity and specificity than single seeds. We describe a linear programming (LP)-based algorithm to optimize a set of seeds. Theoretically, our algorithm offers a performance guarantee: the sensitivity of a chosen seed set is at least 70% of what can be achieved, in most reasonable models of homologous sequences. In practice, our algorithm generates a solution which is at least 90% of the optimal. Our method not only achieves performance better than or comparable to that of a greedy algorithm, but also gives this area a mathematical foundation.", "paper_title": "Optimizing multiple spaced seeds for homology search", "paper_id": "WOS:000241414800006"}
