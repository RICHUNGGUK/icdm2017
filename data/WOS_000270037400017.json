We show that some resistive-open defects may lead to a new type of dynamic behavior that has never been experienced in the past. It is modeled by dynamic two-cell incorrect read faults of two different types. Such fault models represent failures in the sense amplifier, which prevent it from performing any read operations (in case of type 1 [1]) or only a single type of read operation (in case of type 2). Results of electrical simulations are presented to provide a complete understanding of such a faulty behavior and possible March test solutions are proposed to detect all d2cIRFs.", "paper_title": "Analysis of Resistive-Open Defects in SRAM Sense Amplifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000270037400017"}
