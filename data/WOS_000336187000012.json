The complexity of MHT is typically managed by 'reducing' the number of mixture components. Two complementary MHT mixture reduction algorithms are proposed and assessed using a simulation involving a cluttered infrared (IR) seeker scene. A simple means of incorporating intensity information is also derived and used by both methods to provide well balanced peak-to-track association weights. The first algorithm (MHT-2) uses the Integral Squared Error (ISE) criterion, evaluated over the entire posterior MHT pdf, in a guided optimization procedure, to quickly fit at most two components. The second algorithm (MHT-PE) uses many more components and a simple strategy, involving Pruning and Elimination of replicas, to maximize hypothesis diversity while keeping computational complexity under control.
