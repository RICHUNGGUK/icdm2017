This method differs from previous ones by extracting the packaging model parameters under active bias conditions without global numerical optimization techniques. The main advantage of this method is that a unique and physically meaningful set of extrinsic packaging model parameters are extracted by using a set of closed form expressions based on the coaxial measurement for packaged device and on-wafer measurement for chip. Good agreement is obtained between simulated and measured results for a gallium arsenide MESFET with 0.5 m gatelength and 400 m gatewidth over a wide range of bias points up to 8 GHz.
