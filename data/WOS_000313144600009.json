In this paper, we extend our discussion to the general RWP mobility model, where the waypoints may not be uniformly distributed, and hosts may use different. distributions to generate their waypoints. In particular, we study a useful property, namely the Inter-Arrival Time (IAT) of hosts to a given area in a network, when the mobility of such hosts is modeled using the random waypoint mobility model. We derive the value of IAT analytically. Three schemes are used to estimate its value. The correctness of our analysis and estimations are verified through simulations. Case studies are also carried out in this paper to show how IAT could be used in the study and applications of mobile wireless networks. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
