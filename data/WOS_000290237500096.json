This trend is acting as an incentive to develop an auction model for mobile-based environment. Recently, Kuo-Hsuan Huang proposed a mobile auction agent model (MoAAM), which allows the bidders to participate in online auctions through a mobile agent. He used modular exponentiation operations in his method. As a result, the processing time for key generation, bidding, and verification were long. Thus, we propose to add the concept of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) onto MoAAM, because ECC has low computation amount and small key size, both of which will aid to increase the speed in generating keys, bidding, and verification. In terms of reduction of computation load on mobile devices and auction-manager server, the proposed method will make online auction system more efficient as well as more convenient to use. This paper mainly uses the English auction protocol as the key auction protocol. The protocol consists of four entities: Registration Manager (RM), Agent House (AH), Auction House (AUH), and Bidders (B). The Registration Manager registers and verifies Bidder identity. The Agent House manages the agents and assigns public transaction keys to Bidders. The Auction House provides a place for auction and maintains all necessary operations for a smooth online auction. Bidders are buyers who are interested in purchasing items at the auction. Our proposed method conforms to the requirements of an online auction protocol in terms of anonymity, traceability, no framing, unforgetability, non-repudiation, fairness, public verifiability, unlinkability among various auction rounds, linkability within a single auction round, efficiency of bidding, one-time registration, and easy revocation.
