Through using appropriate non-weighted and weighted quantities, structural properties of two kinds of HFCN networks(HFCN-I and HFCN-II) are characterized and analyzed. The study of Linux kernels from the viewpoint of complex networks can provide a better description of the organizational principles and evolving mechanism of complex software systems.", "paper_title": "Generalized collaboration networks in software systems: a case study of Linux kernels", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971100018"}
