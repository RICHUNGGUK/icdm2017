It is the most time-consuming phase and has been recognized as the bottleneck of KBS development. This paper presents a matrix representation and mapping (MRM) approach to facilitate the effectiveness of knowledge acquisition in building a KBS. The proposed MRM approach, which is based on matrix representation and mapping operations, comprises six consecutive steps for generating rules. The procedure in each step is elaborated. A case study oil primarily diagnosing all automotive system is employed to illustrate how the MRM approach works. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
