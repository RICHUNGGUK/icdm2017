The hybrid algorithm combines the mix encoding particle swarm optimization algorithm with the back propagation (BP) algorithm to form a hybrid learning algorithm (MPSO-BP) for training Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFNs), which adapts to the network structure and updates its weights by choosing a special fitness function. The proposed method is used to deal with three nonlinear problems, and the results obtained are compared with existent bibliography, showing an improvement over the published methods.", "paper_title": "A hybrid MPSO-BP structure adaptive algorithm for RBFNs", "paper_id": "WOS:000269914300011"}
