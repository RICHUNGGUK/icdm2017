The object of this method is to reduce subjective factor in building a fuzzy classifier, and to improve the classification recognition rate and stability for classification system. For this object, a method of determining fuzzy integral density based on membership matrix is proposed, and the classifier ensemble algorithm based on fuzzy integral is introduced. The method of selecting classifier sets is also presented. The proposed method is evaluated by the comparison of experiments with standard data sets and the existed classifier ensemble methods.", "paper_title": "A classifier ensemble method for fuzzy classifiers", "paper_id": "WOS:000241106000097"}
