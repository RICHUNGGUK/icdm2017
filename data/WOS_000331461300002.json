As it was designed for low cost, it is quite vulnerable to security issues, such as privacy concerns. This paper(1) presents a new RFID mutual authentication protocol, which is designed to be configured on EPC Gen2 platform and to meet various security requirements while providing efficiency using PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator). Group-ID is used to minimize the authentication time. Security analysis of the proposed protocol is discussed.", "paper_title": "Group-ID based RFID Mutual Authentication", "paper_id": "WOS:000331461300002"}
