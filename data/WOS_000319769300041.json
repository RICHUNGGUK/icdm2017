The method, genetic-based random key generator, is proposed for generating keys for the OTP method with a high degree of key randomness; this adds more strength to the OTP method against breaking this cryptosystem. This algorithm is composed of two parts. Initially, the first population is being generated by LCG method, and then, genetic operators for generating the next populations are being used. Generating random keys with the presented method requires seven-parameter key that increases the security of communication between the transceivers.", "paper_title": "Genetic-based random key generator (GRKG): a new method for generating more-random keys for one-time pad cryptosystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000319769300041"}
