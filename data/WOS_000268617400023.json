Belovs, A. Rosmanis, J. Smotrovs, Multi-letter reversible and quantum finite automata, in: Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on Developments in Language Theory, DLT'2007, Harrachov, Czech Republic, in: Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4588, Springer, Berlin, 2007, pp. 60-71], and they showed that multi-letter QFAs can accept with no error some regular languages ((a + b)*b) that are unacceptable by the one-way QFAs. In this paper, we continue to study multi-letter QFAs. We mainly focus on two issues: (1) we show that (k + 1)-letter QFAs are computationally more powerful than k-letter QFAs, that is, (k + 1)-letter QFAs can accept some regular languages that are unacceptable by any Wetter QFA, A comparison with the one-way QFAs is made by some examples; (2) e prove that a k(1)-letter FA A(1) and another k(2)-letter QFA A(2) are equivalent. if and only if, they are (n(1) +n(2))(4) +k-1-equivalent, and the time complexity of determining the equivalence of two multi-letter QFAs using this method is O(n(12) +k(2) n(4) +kn(8)), where n(1) and n(2) are the numbers of states of A(1) and A(2), respectively, and k = max(k(1), k(2)). Some other issues are addressed for further consideration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
