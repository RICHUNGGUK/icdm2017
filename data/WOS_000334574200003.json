The goal is to determine allocations (a matching between buyers and items) and prices of all items to maximize total revenue given that all buyers are envy-free. We give a polynomial time algorithm to compute a revenue maximizing envy-free pricing when every buyer evaluates at most two items at a positive valuation, by reducing it to an instance of weighted independent set in a perfect graph and applying the Strong Perfect Graph Theorem. We complement our result by showing that the problem becomes NP-hard if some buyers are interested in at least three items.", "paper_title": "Envy-Free Pricing in Multi-Item Markets", "paper_id": "WOS:000334574200003"}
