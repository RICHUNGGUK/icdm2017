This paper proposes auxiliary spheres instead of the initial pipe surfaces as the base surfaces in constructing closings, so that the closing based algorithm of two steps (constructing a closing for each pipe and blending the closings) can G(1)-continuously connect multiple parametric normal ringed surfaces with freeform directrices and variable radii. The basic theory of an auxiliary sphere tangent to the normal ringed surface is addressed. Either one or two (yielding more design parameters) auxiliary spheres can be added. How the parameters influence the closing configuration is discussed. In addition, the blending shape can be optimized by genetic algorithm after assigning some fiducial points on the blend. The enhanced algorithm is illustrated with four practical examples. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.
