Furthermore, the results in this paper are less conservative than the ones reported so far in the literature. One example is given to illustrate the feasibility of our main results.", "paper_title": "An LMI-based approach to the global stability of bidirectional associative memory neural networks with variable delay", "paper_id": "WOS:000238112000042"}
