We study fluctuations of the per-cell sum-rate capacity in the non-ergodic regime and provide results of the type of the central limit theorem (CLT) and large deviations (LD). Our results show that CLT fluctuations of the per-cell sum-rate Cm are of order 1/root m, where m is the number of cells, whereas they are of order 1/m in classical random matrix theory. We also show an LD regime of the form P(vertical bar Cm-C vertical bar > epsilon) = epsilon(-m alpha) with alpha = alpha(epsilon) > 0 and C = lim(m ->infinity) C(m), as opposed to the rate e(-m2 alpha) in classical random matrix theory.
