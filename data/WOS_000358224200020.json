In this brief, we propose a novel approach for exemplar extraction through structured sparse learning. The new model accounts for not only the reconstruction capability and the sparsity, but also the diversity and robustness. To solve the optimization problem, we adopt the alternating directional method of multiplier technology to design an iterative algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experiments of various examples including traffic sign sequences.", "paper_title": "Robust Exemplar Extraction Using Structured Sparse Coding", "paper_id": "WOS:000358224200020"}
