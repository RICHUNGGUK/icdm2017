However, labelling of cell populations is not well defined, making it difficult to integrate the output of algorithms to external knowledge sources. Results: We developed flowCL, a software package that performs semantic labelling of cell populations based on their surface markers and applied it to labelling of the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies Human Immunology Project Consortium lyoplate populations as a use case. Conclusion: By providing automated labelling of cell populations based on their immunopheno-type, flowCL allows for unambiguous and reproducible identification of standardized cell types.", "paper_title": "flowCL: ontology-based cell population labelling in flow cytometry", "paper_id": "WOS:000354453700035"}
