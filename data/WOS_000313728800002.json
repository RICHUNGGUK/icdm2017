This is well known as a strong converse theorem for the identification via channels. In this paper, we prove that the sum of two error probabilities tends to one exponentially and derive an explicit lower bound of this exponent function.", "paper_title": "Converse Coding Theorems for Identification via Channels", "paper_id": "WOS:000313728800002"}
