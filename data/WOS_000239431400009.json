A major challenge is to maximize the lifetime of battery-powered sensors to support such transmissions. Battery, as the power provider of the sensors, therefore emerges as the key factor for achieving high performance in such applications. Recent study in battery technology reveals that the behavior of battery discharging is more complex than we used to think. Battery powered sensors might waste a huge amount of energy if we do not carefully schedule and budget their discharging. In this paper we study the effect of battery. behavior on routing for streaming data transmissions in wireless sensor networks. We first give an on-line computable energy model to mathematically model battery discharge behavior. We show that the model can capture and describe battery behavior accurately at low computational complexity and thus is suitable for on-line battery capacity computation. Based on this battery model we then present a battery-aware routing (BAR) protocol to schedule the routing in wireless sensor networks. The routing protocol is sensitive to the battery status of routing nodes and avoids energy loss. We use the battery data from actual sensors to evaluate the performance of our protocol. The results show that the battery-aware protocol proposed in this paper performs well and can save a significant amount of energy compared to existing routing protocols for streaming data transmissions. Network lifetime is also prolonged with maximum data throughput. As far as we know, this is the first work considering battery-awareness with an accurate analytical on-line computable battery model in sensor network routing. We believe the battery model can be used to explore other energy efficient schemes for wireless networks as well.", "paper_title": "Battery-aware routing for streaming data transmissions in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000239431400009"}
