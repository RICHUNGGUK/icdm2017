In this article a framework is presented which allows the simultaneous and integrated design of a structure and controller. The structure is designed using topology optimization and the objectives and constraints are related to the closed-loop control performance and defined in the frequency domain. For simple examples it is shown that this approach leads to at least as good performance as a sequential approach consisting of eigenfrequency optimization followed by controller tuning, and leads to lighter designs. The framework allows rapid development of prototype designs, which may save a number of the costly design iterations which are currently made in industrial practice. Examples are found in the semiconductor industry, microscopy, micro-electromechanical devices, medical devices and robotics.", "paper_title": "Integrated topology and controller optimization of motion systems in the frequency domain", "paper_id": "WOS:000352705400009"}
