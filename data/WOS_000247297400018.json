There are a number of hypermedia/web engineering methods that provide mechanisms to specify the product requirements, including those concerning structure, navigation, interaction, presentation and access. But apart from product requirements there are also process requirements which in the web arena are constantly changing. Hence, to be put in practice without disturbing the project goals nor compromising its success, methods have to rely on empirical and flexible process models that can be easily adapted to fit process requirements. Little attention has been paid to the process model in most hypermedia/web methods which usually apply a classical iterative process based on the use of prototypes that are tested with users. In this paper we describe how we did apply the ADM web engineering method following a flexible star life cycle in the context of a specific web project highlighting the main benefits of this approach. In particular we will describe the different cycles applied in the ARCE project, illustrating the application of a usability engineering life cycle in a real case. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
