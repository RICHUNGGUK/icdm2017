By formulating the domain derivative of the nonhomogeneous Navier-Stokes equations and applying a regularized Gauss-Newton iterative algorithm, the numerical examples are given for recovering the shape. The results show that our theory is useful for practical purpose and the proposed algorithm is feasible. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
