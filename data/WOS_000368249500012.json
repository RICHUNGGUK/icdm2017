Also, the achieved results are experimentally validated through identification procedure. Design/methodology/approach - The proposed system identification approach is applied to a RSLFM with a tip mass. At first, the dynamic model of the system is derived using Lagrange method. Then, an efficient method is developed for identification of such a system. This method facilitates the nonlinear complicated identification problem of the RSLFM to a simplified root finding problem. Findings - The main advantage of the developed method is to convert a complicated system identification process to a simple nonlinear equation solution. This approach uses small-size input/output data set and requires a short-time interval of data acquisition, which gives important advantages in lower computational load and lower execution time. The investigated approach is studied on experimental system identification of a single link flexible manipulator. To demonstrate this fact, the developed method is successfully applied in identification of two other mechanical systems; the inverted pendulum on a cart and the ball and beam apparatus. Originality/value - In this work, the proposed identification approach has been originally applied to a RSLFM and two other mechanical examples. All obtained identification results show the performance and applicability of the developed method clearly. This approach is not restricted in using state space or transfer function. It has significant superiority in comparison with other known approaches including autoregressive with exogenous input (ARX) and Box-Jenkins (BJ).", "paper_title": "An efficient numerical and experimental system identification approach for a flexible manipulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000368249500012"}
