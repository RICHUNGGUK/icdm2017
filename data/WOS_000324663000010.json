This paper presents a new resource for the Spanish sentiment analysis research community. We have generated a new lexicon by translating into Spanish the Bin Liu English Lexicon. In order to assess the validity of the proposed lexicon a set of experiments on a Spanish review corpus are presented. In addition, the resource presented is compared with another existing Spanish lexicon. The results show that our resource outperforms the currently available Spanish lexicon for sentiment analysis.
