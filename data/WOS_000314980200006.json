In the first stage, a document is segmented into blocks and then blocks are classified into two classes: signature block and printed word block. Gradient-based features are used for block feature extraction and support vector machine classifier is used for block-wise classification. In the second stage, printed characters that may be present in isolated form or overlapped/touched with signature part are removed from signature blocks. From each of the detected signature blocks, the isolated printed characters (if exist) are removed using context information. To detect overlapping/touching printed stroke in a signature block, at first some hypothetical zones are detected where possible overlapping/touching may occur. Bounding box information of neighboring printed word block and local linearity of character strings near the signature blocks are used to detect hypothetical zones. Next, to detect the overlapping/touching printed strokes in hypothetical zones of a signature block, the corner points of contours obtained by Douglas and Peucker polygonal approximation algorithm and skeleton junction points are used. Finally, the touching strokes of signature are separated from text characters using the contour smoothness information near skeleton junction points. The experiment is performed in \"Tobacco-800\" dataset [The legacy tobacco document library (ltdl), available at http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/, University of California, San Francisco, 2007.] and the results obtained from the experiment are promising.", "paper_title": "SIGNATURE SEGMENTATION FROM MACHINE PRINTED DOCUMENTS USING CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000314980200006"}
