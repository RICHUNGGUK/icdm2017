The developed BE provides heavy reduced cumulative communication overhead and yields increased security. The reduction of the communication overhead is achieved via employment of time-bound session encrypting keys (TB-SEKs). The increased security against ciphertext only attack appears as a consequence of the reduced communication overhead and the increased security against the chosen- plaintext attack is obtained via employment of the time-bound key-encrypting keys (TBKEKs). Appropriate methods for management of TB-SEKs and TBKEKs are given. The proposed scheme is compared with traditional BE schemes and the advantages as well as the related trade-offs are pointed out.", "paper_title": "A novel broadcast encryption based on time-bound cryptographic keys", "paper_id": "WOS:000239421000020"}
