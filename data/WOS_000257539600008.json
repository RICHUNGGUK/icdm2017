Troster, Phys. Rev. B 76 (2007) 012402]. In the present paper we shall provide additional information on the motivation, main ideas and constructions underlying the algorithm. Also we discuss important details of its construction with emphasis on an analysis of its scaling behavior with system size. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
