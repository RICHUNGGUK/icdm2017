A membrane computing system is a computing model using massive parallelism inspired by the functioning of living cells. The graphical schemes of these computing devices look like the windows of a graphical operating system representing programs running parallel on the computer. Both similarities and differences of membrane-systems and graphical operating systems are detailed as well as some possible simulation methods.", "paper_title": "Membrane computing and geographical operating systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000243998200020"}
