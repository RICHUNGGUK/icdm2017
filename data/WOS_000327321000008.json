Each processor element includes 14 bits of digital memory in addition to seven analogue registers. Digital operands include NOR and NOT with operations of diffusion, subtraction, inversion and squaring available in the analogue domain. The cells of the array can be configured as an asynchronous propagation network allowing operations such as flood filling to occur with times of similar to 1 mu s across the array. Exploiting this feature allows the chip to recognise the difference between closed and open shapes at 30,000 frames per second. The chip is fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology.", "paper_title": "Mixed signal SIMD processor array vision chip for real-time image processing", "paper_id": "WOS:000327321000008"}
