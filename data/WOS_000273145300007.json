Based on the time to reach the maximum number of blocked terminals, we derive iterative schemes for its mass function and moments. An important feature of the underlying Markovian framework is that the arrival pattern need not be a Poisson process. Packet transmission requirements and durations of collisions are both of phase-type. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the effects of the retransmission probability and the duration of one slot on the number of collisions. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
