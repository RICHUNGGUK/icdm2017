Public key infrastructure (PKI) and attribute certificates (ACs) can provide the appropriate framework to effectively support authentication and authorization services, offering mutual trust to both learners and service providers. Considering PKI requirements for online distance learning networks, this paper discusses the potential application of ACs in a proposed trust model. Typical e-learning trust interactions between e-learners and providers are presented, demonstrating that robust security mechanisms and effective trust control can be obtained and implemented. The application of ACs to support m-learning is also presented and evaluated through an experimental test-bed setup, using the general packet radio service network. The results showed that AC issuing is attainable in service times while simultaneously can deliver flexible and scalable solutions to both learners and e-learning providers. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
