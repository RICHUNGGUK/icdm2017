It allows us to solve, either directly or through a transformation, many real-world problems. We present in this paper a new competitive genetic algorithm to solve this problem. This algorithm has been checked on a set of 153 benchmark instances with known optimal solution and it outperforms the results obtained with previous ATSP heuristic methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
