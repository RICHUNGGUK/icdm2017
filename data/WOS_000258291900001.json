The investigation considers several configurations of the parameters defining the network connectivity, and the Barabasi-Albert network model is also considered for comparisons. The results show that the effect of connectivity is significant only for shorter tasks, the locality of connection simplied by the spatial constraints reduces efficiency, and the addition of edges can improve the efficiency of the execution, although with increasing locality of the connections the improvement is small.", "paper_title": "On the effects of geographical constraints on task execution in complex", "paper_id": "WOS:000258291900001"}
