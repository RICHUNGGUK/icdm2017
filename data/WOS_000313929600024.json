Technologies such as OSGi and Web Services have been used to deploy several services as an example, such as biomedical parameter monitorization, alerts, and communication with a coordination center. A complete functional service which uses context-awareness has been explained and the benefits of using Service Oriented Architecture are explained. Finally, the lessons learned of this kind of development, which involves several types of systems, data, languages, and development groups, are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
