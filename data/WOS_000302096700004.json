The investigation covers two kinds of different settings. In the setting with the interaction topologies for the position and velocity information flows being modeled by different graphs, some sufficient conditions on the fixed interaction topologies are derived for the agents to reach consensus. In the setting with the interaction topologies for the position and velocity information flows being modeled by the same graph, we systematically investigate the consensus algorithm for the agents under both fixed and dynamically changing directed interaction topologies. Specifically, for the fixed case, a necessary and sufficient condition on the interaction topology is established for the agents to reach (average) consensus under certain assumptions. For the dynamically changing case, some sufficient conditions are obtained for the agents to reach consensus, where the condition imposed on the dynamical topologies is shown to be more relaxed than that required in the existing literature. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the theoretical findings through some numerical examples.", "paper_title": "Coordination of Multiple Agents With Double-Integrator Dynamics Under Generalized Interaction Topologies", "paper_id": "WOS:000302096700004"}
