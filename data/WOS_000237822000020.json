In this correspondence, we report that the modification presented by Chu is susceptible to a suitably modified attack devised by Das and Maitra in 2004. In fact, the experimental results show that Chu's scheme is even weaker than the CKLS scheme in terms of our attack.", "paper_title": "Cryptanalysis of Chu's DCT based watermarking scheme", "paper_id": "WOS:000237822000020"}
