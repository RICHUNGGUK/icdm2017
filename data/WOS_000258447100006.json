Therefore, the,aim of this work is to analyze the quality, satisfaction, and loyalty sequence in the logistic service delivery context, with the purpose of considering the role of information and communication technologies (ICT) in this chain of effects. Design/methodology/approach - After reviewing the different approaches given by the literature, SEM analysis is used to contrast the hypotheses for the analyzed constructs in the presence of high/low ICT level. A questionnaire based on personal survey was conducted among manufacturers. The study collected data from 194 companies. Structural equation modeling was applied to these data to test relationships among the variables in the study. Findings - The reliability and validity tests show satisfactory results. The conclusions confirm this chain of consequences, and emphasize the incidence of ICT in the description and intensity of these relations. Research limitations/implications - As non-probabilistic sampling methods have been used, in subsequent research, it would be useful to obtain a more representative population sample. In future, works relations between the variables proposed would be analyzed contemplating the sectoral nature of the sample, accepting that relationship intensity may be modified according to the company's sector of activity. Originality/value - This paper describes a framework to explore the relationships between service quality, customer satisfaction and loyalty in the supply chain from the perspective of ICT.", "paper_title": "Logistics service quality: a new way to loyalty", "paper_id": "WOS:000258447100006"}
