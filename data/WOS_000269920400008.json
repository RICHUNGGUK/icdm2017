The aim of this study was to present a model based on fuzzy logic for differential diagnosis of alterations in urinary elimination, considering nursing diagnosis approved by the North American Nursing Diagnosis Association, 2001-2002. Fuzzy relations and the maximum-minimum composition approach were used to develop the system. The model performance was evaluated with 195 cases from the database of a previous study, resulting in 79.0% of total concordance and 19.5% of partial concordance, when compared with the panel of experts. Total discordance was observed in only three cases (1.5%). The agreement between model and experts was excellent (kappa = 0.98, P < .0001) or substantial (kappa = 0.69, P < .0001) when considering the overestimative accordance (accordance was considered when at least one diagnosis was equal) and the underestimative discordance (discordance was considered when at least one diagnosis was different), respectively. The model herein presented showed good performance and a simple theoretical structure, therefore demanding few computational resources.", "paper_title": "Model for Differential Nursing Diagnosis of Alterations in Urinary Elimination Based on Fuzzy Logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000269920400008"}
