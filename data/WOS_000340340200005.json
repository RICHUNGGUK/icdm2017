The Laplacians of several functions are evaluated and the accuracies of various MPS Laplacian models in solving the Poisson equation that is subjected to both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are assessed. For regular grids, the Laplacian model with smaller N is generally more accurate, owing to the reduction of leading errors due to those higher-order derivatives appearing in the modified equation. For irregular grids, an optimal N value does exist in ensuring better global accuracy, in which this optimal value ofN will increase when cases employing highly irregular grids are computed. Finally, the accuracies of these MPS Laplacian models are assessed in an incompressible flow problem. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
