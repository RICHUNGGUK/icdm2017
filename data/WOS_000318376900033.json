In this study, a modified form of direct sampling (DS) method is introduced which not only keeps the strength of DS simulation technique but also speeds it up by one or two orders of magnitude. While previous methods are based on pasting only one point at a time, here the simulation is done by pasting a bunch of nodes at a time, effectively combining the flexibility of DS with the computational advantages of patch-based methods. This bears the potential of significantly speeding up the DS method. The proposed simulation method can be used with unilateral or random simulation paths. No overlap occurs in the simulation procedure because the bunch takes the shape of the empty space around the simulated nodes. Systematic tests are carried on different training images including both categorical and continuous variables, showing that the realizations preserve the patterns existent in the training image. To illustrate the method, a Matlab implementation of the method is attached to the paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
