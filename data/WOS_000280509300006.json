From the Redfield theory, we obtain a description of the quadrupolar relaxation as a computational process in a spin 3/2 system, through a model in which the environment is comprised by five qubits and three different quantum noise channels. The interaction between the environment and the spin 3/2 nuclei is described by a quantum circuit fully compatible with the Redfield theory of relaxation. Theoretical predictions are compared to experimental data, a short review of quantum channels and relaxation in NMR qubits is also present.", "paper_title": "NUCLEAR SPIN 3/2 ELECTRIC QUADRUPOLE RELAXATION AS A QUANTUM COMPUTATION PROCESS", "paper_id": "WOS:000280509300006"}
