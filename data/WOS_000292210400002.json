In a Lotkaian framework we prove formulae for the h-index in case of random removal of items and in case of random removal of sources. In conclusion, we warn for the use of the h-index in case of incomplete data sets.", "paper_title": "The influence of random removal of sources and items on the h-index", "paper_id": "WOS:000292210400002"}
