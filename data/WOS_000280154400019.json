MIQCP problems are very difficult because they combine two kinds of non-convexities: integer variables and non-convex quadratic constraints. To produce strong relaxations of MIQCP problems, we use techniques from disjunctive programming and the lift-and-project methodology. In particular, we propose new methods for generating valid, inequalities from the equation Y = xx(T). We use the non-convex constraint Y - xx(T) <= 0 to derive disjunctions of two types. The first ones are directly derived from the eigenvectors of the matrix Y - xx(T) with positive eigenvalues, the second type of disjunctions are obtained by combining several eigenvectors in order to minimize the width of the disjunction. We also use the convex SDP constraint Y - xx(T) >= 0 to derive convex quadratic cuts, and we combine both approaches in a cutting plane algorithm. We present computational results to illustrate our findings.", "paper_title": "Convex relaxations of non-convex mixed integer quadratically constrained programs: extended formulations", "paper_id": "WOS:000280154400019"}
