This paper presents a novel Ternary CAM (TCAM) based NAND Pseudo CMOS-Longest Prefix Match (NPC-LPM) search engine. The proposed system provides a simple hardware based solution using novel 11T TCAM cell structures and NPC word line technique, for network routers. The experiments were performed on 256 x 128 NPC-LPM system under 0.13 mu m technology. The simulation result shows that the proposed design provides low power dissipation of 5.78 mW and high search speed of 315 MSearches/s under 1.3 V supply voltage. The presented NPC-LPM system meets the speed requirement of Optical Carrier (OC) 3072 with line-rate of 160 Gb/s in Ethernet networking and IPv6 protocol. The experimental results also show that the proposed system improves power-performance by 65%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
