However, the best result obtained so far for the inverse ST has a time complexity O(N log k) and a space complexity O(N), where N and k are the text size and the context order of the transform, respectively. In this article, we present a novel algorithm that can compute the inverse ST for any k-order contexts in an O(N) time and space complexity, a linear result independent of k. The main idea behind the design of this linear algorithm is a set of cycle properties of k-order contexts that we explore for this work. These newly discovered cycle properties allow us to quickly compute the Longest Common Prefix (LCP) between any pair of adjacent k-order contexts that may belong to two different cycles, which eventually leads to the proposed linear-time solution.", "paper_title": "Computing the Inverse Sort Transform in Linear Time", "paper_id": "WOS:000292839300014"}
