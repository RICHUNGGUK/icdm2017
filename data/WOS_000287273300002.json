For deterministic algorithms the best competitive ratio that can be obtained is 2 and no randomized algorithm is known that improves this ratio for general spaces. For the line, Bartal et al. (1998) [2] give a 155/78 competitive algorithm, but their algorithm is specific to the geometry of the line. We consider here the 2-server problem over Cross Polytope Spaces M-24. We obtain an algorithm with competitive ratio of and show that this ratio is best possible. This algorithm gives the second non-trivial example of metric spaces with better than 2-competitive ratio. The algorithm uses a design technique called the knowledge state technique a method not specific to M-24. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
