We assume that G evolved under the duplication-mutation with complementarity (DMC) model from a seed graph, G(0), and we also observe the binary forest that represents the duplication history of G. A posterior density for the DMC model parameters is established, and we outline a sampling strategy by which one can perform Bayesian inference; that sampling strategy employs a particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH) algorithm. We test our methodology on numerical examples to demonstrate a high accuracy and precision in the inference of the DMC model's mutation and homodimerization parameters.", "paper_title": "Bayesian Inference for Duplication-Mutation with Complementarity Network Models", "paper_id": "WOS:000364289700005"}
