The cylinder should be analyzed subjected to dynamic and shock loads. Design/methodology/approach - The functionally graded cylinder is assumed to be made of many subcylinders. The material properties within a subcylinder are assumed to vary linearly in the thickness direction. The material properties in subcylinders are chosen as linear functions. The properties are controlled by volume fraction that is an exponential function of radius. The shell is assumed to be in plane strain condition, and is subjected to axisymmetric dynamic loading. The Navier Equation is solved by Galerkin finite element and Newmark methods. By using the Fast Fourier Transform, the time response is transferred to frequency domain and natural frequencies are illustrated. Findings - The dynamic behavior of functionally graded thick hollow cylinder is discussed. The radial wave propagation due to an internal pressure unloading is studied. The time history of radial stresses are discussed and the mean velocity of radial stress wave propagation for different exponent \"n\" of FGM are determined. Originality/value - This paper presents the high strength technique to studying and analyzing the functionally graded thick hollow cylinders subjected to dynamic loads and the mean velocity of radial wave propagation is obtained using the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic response and radial wave propagation velocity in thick hollow cylinder made of functionally graded materials", "paper_id": "WOS:000247569000005"}
