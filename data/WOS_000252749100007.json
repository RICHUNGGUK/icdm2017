Consequently, business process modeling is the centre through which to conduct and improve how a business is operated. Moreover, security is a crucial issue for business performance, but is usually considered after the business processes definition. Many security requirements can be expressed at the business process level. A business process model is important for software developers, since they can use it to obtain the necessary requirements for software design and creation. In this work, we shall show a microprocess, consistent with the MDA approach, through which it is possible to specify and refine security requirements at a high level of abstraction and obtain a subset of all analysis-level classes and use cases from the context problem, in such a way that they can be incorporated into the development of a software system. In addition, an extension of UML 2.0 activity diagrams through which it is possible to identify such requirements will be presented.", "paper_title": "An MDA approach to develop secure business processes through a UML 2.0 extension", "paper_id": "WOS:000252749100007"}
