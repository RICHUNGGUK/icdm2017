In this paper, we proposed a polynomial model to approximate the density map of fingerprints and used the model's parameters as a novel kind of feature for fingerprint representation. Thus, the density information can be utilized into the matching stage with a low additional storage cost. A decision-level fusion scheme is further used to combine the density map matching with conventional minutiae-based matching and experimental results showed a much better performance than using single minutiae-based matching.", "paper_title": "Fingerprint recognition using model-based density map", "paper_id": "WOS:000237850600033"}
