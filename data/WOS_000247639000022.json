Soc. Jpn. 1991; 60:2105-2108), which is based on the CIP method (J. Comput. Phys. 1985: 61:261-268; J Comput. Phys. 1987; 70:355-372; Comput. Phys. Commun. 1991; 66:219-232; J Comput. Phys. 2001; 169:556-593) and the adaptive Soroban grid technique (J. Comput. Phys. 2004; 194:55-77) were combined in (Comput. Mech. 2006; published online) for computation of 3D fluid-object and fluid-structure interactions in the presence of free surfaces and fluid-fluid interfaces. Although the grid system is unstructured, it still has a very simple data structure and this facilitates computational efficiency. Despite the unstructured and collocated features of the grid, the method maintains high-order accuracy and Computational robustness. Furthermore, the meshless feature of the combined technique brings freedom from mesh moving and distortion issues. In this paper, the combined technique is extended to ship hydrodynamics computations. We introduce a new way of computing the advective terms to increase the efficiency in that part of the computations. This is essential in ship hydrodynamics computations where the level of grid refinement needed near the ship Surface and at the free surface results in very large grid sizes. The test cases presented are a test computation with a wave-making wedge and simulation of the hydrodynamics of a container ship.
