Here, the authors focus on energy resources for smart grids and smart buildings, investigating how a smart grid infrastructure accesses the energy resources in a smart building to obtain or control data. The energy service interface (ESI), which plays a communication gateway role at the boundary of a customer building, hasn't received much study. The authors examine its design principles for enabling fine-grained access, implement and deploy an ESI prototype, and illustrate interactive energy services between the grid infrastructure and smart buildings.", "paper_title": "Fine-Grained Access to Smart Building Energy Resources", "paper_id": "WOS:000328945700007"}
