The nodes act both as routers and as communication end points. This makes the network layer more prone to security attacks. A main challenge is to judge whether or not a routing message originates from a trustworthy node. The solution thus far is cryptographically signed messages. The general assumption is that nodes in possession of a valid secret key can be trusted. Consequently, a secure and efficient key-management scheme is crucial. Keys are also required for protection of application data. However, the focus here is on network-layer management information. Whereas key-management schemes for the upper layers can assume an already running network service, schemes for the protection of the network layer cannot. Keys are a prerequisite to bootstrap a protected network service. This article surveys the state of the art within key management for ad hoc networks, and analyzes their applicability for network-layer security. The analysis puts some emphasis on their applicability in scenarios such as emergency and rescue operations, as this work was initiated by a study of security in MANETs for emergency and rescue operations.", "paper_title": "A SURVEY OF KEY MANAGEMENT IN AD HOC NETWORKS", "paper_id": "WOS:000208213400004"}
