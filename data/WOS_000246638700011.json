Design/methodology/approach - The implementation of this new model is independent of the coordinate system used, thus is more tractable mathematically. It is simpler to use than other models. It has the correct energy properties. Findings - The model requires fewer variables to describe anisotropic media. Research limitations/implications - The simplicity of the coordinated vector hysteresis model is only valid for ellipsoidally magnetizable media. Practical implications - The design of vector hysteresis devices will be far more accurate using this model. Originality/value - The elaboration of this model has not been presented before.", "paper_title": "The coordinated vector model", "paper_id": "WOS:000246638700011"}
