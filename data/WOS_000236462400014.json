One possible aid is to maintain a network of trust between sources. In this paper, we propose to model such a network as an intuitionistic fuzzy relation. This allows to elegantly handle together the problem of ignorance, i.e. not knowing whether to trust or not, and vagueness, i.e. trust as a matter of degree. We pay special attention to deriving trust information through a trusted third party, which becomes especially challenging when distrust is involved.", "paper_title": "A many valued representation and propagation of trust and distrust", "paper_id": "WOS:000236462400014"}
