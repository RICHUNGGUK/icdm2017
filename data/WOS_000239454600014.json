The former algorithms are optimal up to a constant factor, the latter algorithm is far away from the lower bound, but it is the first algorithm to solve the general multilevel problem. To solve the multicommodity problem, we also define a new problem, the friendly tour operator problem, which we approximate by a greedy algorithm.", "paper_title": "Non-metric multicommodity and multilevel facility location", "paper_id": "WOS:000239454600014"}
