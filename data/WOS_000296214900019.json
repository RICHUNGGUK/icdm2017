The NCC detector uses the adaptable threshold decision (ATD) method to separate the cell from the cervical smear image, and then uses the maximal gray-level-gradient-difference (MGLGD) method, proposed in this paper, to extract the nucleus from the cell. The experimental results show that the NCC detector is superior to two existing methods, the gradient vector flow-active contour model (GVF-ACM) and the edge enhancement nucleus and cytoplast contour (ENNCC) detector, in segmenting the cytoplast and nucleus of a cell.
