For this, we define a complete phase semantics suitable for BBI and characterize it as trivial phase semantics. We deduce an embedding between trivial phase semantics for intuitionistic linear logic (ILL) and Kripke semantics for BBI. We single out the elementary fragment of ILL, which is both undecidable and complete for trivial phase semantics. Thus, we obtain the undecidability of BBI.", "paper_title": "Nondeterministic Phase Semantics and the Undecidability of Boolean BI", "paper_id": "WOS:000315457400006"}
