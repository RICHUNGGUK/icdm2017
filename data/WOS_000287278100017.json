Hence, many studies attempted to propose the variation of the model to improve the pricing capability. This study works on the volatility (fuzzy volatility) in the binomial tree option pricing model and proposes a fuzzy pricing model. Applying the fuzzy binomial option tree pricing model, more stock and call prices with their corresponding possibilities can be obtained. The richer information allows investors of different tendencies to adjust their portfolios. Meanwhile, the call price tends to be closer to the market price than its counterpart. Hence, the fuzzy model is favored.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL OPTION PRICING MODEL VIA FUZZY BINOMIAL DECISION TREE", "paper_id": "WOS:000287278100017"}
