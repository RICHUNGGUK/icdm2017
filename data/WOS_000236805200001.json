We introduce a new search model called function matching that enables us to solve the above problems. The function matching problem has as its input a text T of length n over alphabet Sigma(T) and a pattern P=P[1] P[2]center dot center dot center dot P[m] of length m over alphabet Sigma(P). We seek all text locations i, where the m-length substring that starts at i is equal to f(P[1]) f(P[2])center dot center dot center dot f(P[m]), for some function f :Sigma(P)->Sigma(T). We give a randomized algorithm that solves the function matching problem in time O(n log n) with probability 1/n of declaring a false positive. We give a deterministic algorithm whose time is O(n vertical bar Sigma(P)vertical bar log m) and show that it is optimal in the convolutions model. We use function matching to efficiently solve the problem of two-dimensional parameterized matching.", "paper_title": "Function matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000236805200001"}
