In accordance with the requirement of mobile applications, this paper proposes a low-cost human object extraction method, which consists of a face object and a hair object extraction based on their color information and a simple body extraction utilizing the position information of the face object. In the proposed method, skin color and hair color are estimated through color space segmentation, and a human object is effectively extracted by using a radial active contour model. Simulation results of the human object extraction with the use of XScale processor claims that QCIF 15 fps video sequences can be processed in real time.", "paper_title": "Real-time human object extraction method for mobile systems based on color space segmentation", "paper_id": "WOS:000237202400015"}
