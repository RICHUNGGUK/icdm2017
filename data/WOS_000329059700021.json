The library leverages semantic annotations in the database to associate reactions with human-readable descriptions, making the reactions retrievable through simple string searches. Our goal is to provide a useful tool for quantitative modelers who seek to accelerate modeling efforts through the reuse of previously published representations of specific chemical reactions.", "paper_title": "A C library for retrieving specific reactions from the BioModels database", "paper_id": "WOS:000329059700021"}
