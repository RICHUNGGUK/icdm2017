A recursive filtering and fixed-point smoothing algorithm is proposed assuming that the Bernoulli random variables describing the uncertainty in the observations are independent and the state-space model generating the signal is unknown and only the covariance functions of the processes involved in the observation equation are available. A numerical simulation example concerning the phase modulation problem shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.", "paper_title": "Signal estimation with nonlinear uncertain observations using covariance information", "paper_id": "WOS:000261298900005"}
