Today, the orders that the surgeon can give to robotized camera holders remain limited. In order to provide higher level interactions between the surgeon and a robotized camera holder, we have developed a new method for the automatic tracking of laparoscopic instruments which works in near real-time. The method is based on the measurement of the 3D positions of the insertion points of the instruments in the abdominal cavity and a simple shape model of the laparoscopic instruments. We present the results of our first experimentation on a cadaver.", "paper_title": "Automatic localization of Laparoscopic instruments for the visual servoing of an endoscopic camera holder", "paper_id": "WOS:000241556300066"}
