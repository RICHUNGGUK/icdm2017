The KLT is also known to be suboptimal for some non-Gaussian models. This paper proves high-rate optimality of the KLT for variable-rate encoding of a broad class of non-Gaussian vectors: Gaussian vector-scale mixtures (GVSM), which extend the Gaussian scale mixture (GSM) model of natural signals. A key concavity property of the scalar GSM (same as the scalar GVSM) is derived to complete the proof. Optimality holds under a broad class of quadratic criteria, which include mean-squared error (MSE) as well as generalized f-divergence loss in estimation and binary classification systems. Finally, the theory is illustrated using two applications: signal estimation in multiplicative noise and joint optimization of classification/reconstruction systems.", "paper_title": "Optimality of KLT for high-rate transform coding of Gaussian vector-scale mixtures: Application to reconstruction, estimation, and classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000240076700012"}
