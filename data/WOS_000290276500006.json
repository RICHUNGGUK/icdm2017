On the other hand, Network Address Translation (NAT) has become pervasive in almost all networking scenarios, from residential Internet access to enterprise networks. Despite the effort of NAT traversal, it is still very likely that P2P applications cannot receive incoming connection requests properly if they are behind NAT. To quantify the performance impact of NAT on BitTorrent-like P2P systems, we have created and validated a detailed but tractable mathematical model. We have also proposed and briefly examined a simple but effective strategy to mitigate the negative impact on NAT peers. In this paper, we further extend our model to cover the proposed biased optimistic unchoke strategy, and optimize the system performance in terms of both average peer download time and system finish time. We also create a new, faster Java-based BitTorrent simulator, which is used to validate the extended model and show the optimality of the proposed strategy and its boundary conditions.", "paper_title": "Optimizing BitTorrent-like peer-to-peer systems in the presence of network address translation devices", "paper_id": "WOS:000290276500006"}
