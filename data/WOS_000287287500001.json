Choquet integral and Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence are applied to aggregate inuitionistic fuzzy information and some new types of aggregation operators are developed, including the induced generalized intuitionistic fuzzy Choquet integral operators and induced generalized intuitionistic fuzzy Dempster-Shafer operators. Then we investigate their various properties and some of their special cases. Additionally, we apply the developed operators to financial decision making under intuitionistic fuzzy environments. Some extensions in interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy situations are also pointed out.
