For a polygonal 2-tree on n vertices, we present an algorithm to compute a minimum average stretch spanning tree in 0 (n logn) time. This algorithm also finds a minimum fundamental cycle basis in polygonal 2-trees. We show that there is a unique minimum cycle basis in a polygonal 2-tree and it can be computed in linear time.
