Carotid artery recognition, the first task in lumen segmentation, should be performed in a fully automated, fast, and reliable way to further facilitate the low-level task of arterial delineation. In this paper, a user-independent, real-time algorithm is introduced for carotid artery localization in longitudinal B-mode ultrasound images. The proposed technique acts directly on the raw image, and exploits basic statistics along with anatomical knowledge. The method's evaluation and parameter value optimization were performed on a threefold cross validation basis. In addition, the introduced algorithm was systematically compared with another algorithm for common carotid artery recognition in B-mode scans, separately for multi-frame and single-frame data. The data sets used included 2,149 images from 100 subjects taken from three different institutions and covering a wide range of possible lumen and surrounding tissue representations. Using the optimized values, the carotid artery was recognized in all the processed images in both multi-frame and single-frame data. Thus, the introduced technique will further reinforce automatic segmentation in longitudinal B-mode ultrasound images.", "paper_title": "Robust Carotid Artery Recognition in Longitudinal B-Mode Ultrasound Images", "paper_id": "WOS:000348366100016"}
