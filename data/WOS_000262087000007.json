This allows us to reflect and model vagueness and uncertainty of our knowledge, which results from imprecision of measurement and in accuracy of computation. Basing on the theory of fuzzy limits, we develop the structure of statistical fuzzy convergence and study its properties. Relations between statistical fuzzy convergence and fuzzy convergence are considered in the First Subsequence Theorem and the First Reduction Theorem. Algebraic structures of statistical fuzzy limits are described in the Linearity Theorem. Topological structures of statistical fuzzy limits are described in the Limit Set Theorem and Limit Fuzzy Set theorems. Relations between statistical convergence, statistical fuzzy convergence, ergodic systems, fuzzy convergence and convergence of statistical characteristics, such as the mean (average), and standard deviation, are studied in Secs.2 and 4. Introduced constructions and obtained results open new directions for further research that are considered in the Conclusion.", "paper_title": "STATISTICAL FUZZY CONVERGENCE", "paper_id": "WOS:000262087000007"}
