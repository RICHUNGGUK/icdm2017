Our key idea is to use the ratio of training and test data densities as an outlier score. This approach is expected to have better performance even in high-dimensional problems since methods for directly estimating the density ratio without going through density estimation are available. Among various density ratio estimation methods, we employ the method called unconstrained least-squares importance fitting (uLSIF) since it is equipped with natural cross-validation procedures, allowing us to objectively optimize the value of tuning parameters such as the regularization parameter and the kernel width. Furthermore, uLSIF offers a closed-form solution as well as a closed-form formula for the leave-one-out error, so it is computationally very efficient and is scalable to massive datasets. Simulations with benchmark and real-world datasets illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Statistical outlier detection using direct density ratio estimation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286211500006"}
