However, many experimental results show that the strength envelopes of almost all of geomaterials are characteristically nonlinear. This paper presents a method (upper bound limit analysis method) to analyze the stability of a homogeneous slope based on a general nonlinear failure criterion, in which different shear strength reduction strategies (SSRS) can be used. Based on the presented method, three SSRSs (i.e. by factoring the unconfined shear strength c(0) only, by factoring the tensile strength sigma(t) only, by factoring both the unconfined shear strength c(0) and the tensile strength sigma(t)) are used to calculate the safety factors of a homogeneous slope under a general nonlinear failure criterion. Compared results show different SSRSs have significant influence on the calculated safety factor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
