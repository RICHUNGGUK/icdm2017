In this paper, we show that the current selectivity may change due to the implementation of load shedding. Our algorithm, called RLS, determines the optimum drop location by these changed selectivity rather than those pre-calculated values. Simulation results demonstrate that RLS achieves higher accuracy than traditional algorithms.", "paper_title": "Rate-sensitive load shedding in data stream systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247840000012"}
