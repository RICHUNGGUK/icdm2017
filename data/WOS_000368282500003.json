EFR aims at alleviating the trade-off between practicability of traffic restoration and the cost of network resources observed in existing networking solutions. We present an extension of EFR capable of managingmultiple partial link failures. We describe EFR and its extension, formulate the EFR related optimization problems, and discuss approaches for their resolution. We also discuss numerical results illustrating effectiveness of EFR in terms of the link capacity cost. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
