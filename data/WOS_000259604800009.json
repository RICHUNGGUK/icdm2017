In order to take contextual information into account, input patterns are generated considering each pixel of the difference image along with its neighboring pixels. A heuristic technique is suggested to identify a few initial labeled patterns without using ground truth information. The network is initially trained using these labeled data. The unlabeled patterns are iteratively processed by the already trained perceptron to obtain a soft class label. Experimental results, carried out on two multispectral and multitemporal remote sensing images, confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "paper_title": "Change detection of remote sensing images with semi-supervised multilayer perceptron", "paper_id": "WOS:000259604800009"}
