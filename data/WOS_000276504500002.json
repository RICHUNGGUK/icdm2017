A set SaS dagger V is a paired-dominating set if every vertex in V-S is adjacent to a vertex in S and the subgraph induced by S contains a perfect matching. The paired-domination problem is to determine the paired-domination number, which is the minimum cardinality of a paired-dominating set. Motivated by a mistaken algorithm given by Chen, Kang and Ng (Discrete Appl. Math. 155:2077-2086, 2007), we present two linear time algorithms to find a minimum cardinality paired-dominating set in block and interval graphs. In addition, we prove that paired-domination problem is NP-complete for bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, even for split graphs.", "paper_title": "Labelling algorithms for paired-domination problems in block and interval graphs", "paper_id": "WOS:000276504500002"}
