Therefore the measurement of crystal size distribution attracts much attention. Image analysis is an advanced method developed recently for crystal size distribution estimation. A feasible image enhancement method is proposed for crystal identification in crystallization image by using histogram equalization and Laplacian mask algorithm sequentially. The experiments result indicates that the effect of the crystal image can be improved obviously, and the crystals can be identified more easily and exactly.", "paper_title": "Image enhancement method for crystal identification in crystal size distribution measurement", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300114"}
