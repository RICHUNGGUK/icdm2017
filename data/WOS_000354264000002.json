In this article, we address the admission control and resource allocation problem jointly, by establishing a unified modeling and control framework. Convergence to a desired reference point and stability and feasibility of the control strategy are guaranteed while achieving high performance of the co-hosted web applications. The efficacy of the proposed approach is illustrated in a real test bed.
