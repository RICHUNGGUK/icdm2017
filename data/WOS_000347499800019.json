In this paper, a new structure of coupled repressilators is introduced to exploit the underlying functions. The new coupled repressilator model consists of two identical repressilators inhibiting each other directly. The coupling delays are taken into account. The existence of a unique equilibrium for this system is verified firstly, then the stability criteria for equilibrium are analyzed without and with coupling delays. The different functions on equilibrium and its stability played by related biochemical parameters in the structure including maximal transcription rate, coupling strength, the decay rate ratio between proteins and mRNAs, and coupling delays are discussed. At last, several numerical simulations are made to demonstrate our results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
