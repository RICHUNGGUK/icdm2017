Trans-rectal ultrasound image based CAD would be extremely important to support prostate cancer diagnosis. An effective approach to realize a CAD scheme for this purpose is described in this work, employing a multi-feature kernel classification model based on generalized discriminant analysis. The mutual information of feature value and tissue pathological state is used to select features essential for tissue characterization. System-dependent effects are reduced through predictive deconvolution of the acquired radio-frequency signals. A clinical study, performed on ground truth images from biopsy findings, provides a comparison of the classification model applied before and after deconvolution, showing in the latter case a significant gain in accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.", "paper_title": "Predictive Deconvolution and Hybrid Feature Selection for Computer-Aided Detection of Prostate Cancer", "paper_id": "WOS:000274211700019"}
