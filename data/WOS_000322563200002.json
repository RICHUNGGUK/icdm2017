We demonstrate the complexity of this problem using an experimental study performed with proficient workforce, and then show how the problem can be decomposed, aggregated, and solved using sequential recurrent linear programming assignment problems. We also refer to the improvements that the proposed algorithm has achieved in practice when applied to multiple semiconductor production facilities, and discuss its efficiency and uniqueness as a fast heuristic relative to other proposed methods.
