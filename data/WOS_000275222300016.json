We propose a novel hybrid approach integrating the clustering algorithm and consensus protocol to provide better Quality of Service (QoS) and solve the file consistency problem in the P2P file-sharing system. First, the clustering algorithm is introduced in our approach to provide better QoS. After clustering, we use consistent hash Junction to assign each processor and key to the corresponding processor in the de-Bruijn network. The de-Bruijn graph is nearly optimal and feature very short average routing distances. Finally, We use the consensus protocol to reach the consistent file information.", "paper_title": "FILE CONSISTENCY PROBLEM OF FILE-SHARING IN PEER-TO-PEER ENVIRONMENT", "paper_id": "WOS:000275222300016"}
