In this paper, we present a structural distortion model for video streaming over time-varying fading channels. Based on the model, we study the end-to-end distortion for various bit-rate allocation strategies and channel conditions. We show that the robustness to channel variations is crucial for the streaming performance when frequent bit-rate adaptations are not feasible. It is achieved at the expense of higher source distortion in the encoder. Our findings are illustrated on a practical problem of distortion-optimal selection of transport formats in an adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme used in HSDPA.", "paper_title": "Trade-Offs in Bit-Rate Allocation for Wireless Video Streaming", "paper_id": "WOS:000269776700007"}
