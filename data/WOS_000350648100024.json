In the proposed HHS algorithm, a novel harmony improvisation mechanism is developed with the modified memory consideration rule and the global-best pitch adjustment scheme to enhance the global exploration. A parallel updating strategy is employed to enrich the harmony memory diversity. To well balance the exploration and the exploitation, the fruit fly optimization (FFO) scheme is integrated as a local search strategy. For solving MKPs, binary strings are used to represent solutions and two repair operators are applied to guarantee the feasibility of the solutions. The HHS is calibrated based on the Taguchi method of design-of-experiment. Extensive numerical investigations based on well-known benchmark instances are conducted. The comparative evaluations indicate the HHS is much more effective than the existing HS and FFO variants in solving MKPs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
