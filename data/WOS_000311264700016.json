Similarity measurement that measures the similarity between two users or items is critical to CF. However, traditional similarity measurement approaches for memory-based CF can be strongly improved. In this paper, we propose a novel similarity measurement, named Jaccard Uniform Operator Distance (JacUOD), to effectively measure the similarity. Our JacUOD approach aims at unifying similarity comparison for vectors in different multidimensional vector spaces. Compared with traditional similarity measurement approaches, JacUOD properly handles dimension-number difference for different vector spaces. We conduct experiments based on the well-known MovieLens datasets, and take user-based CF as an example to show the effectiveness of our approach. The experimental results show that our JacUOD approach achieves better prediction accuracy than traditional similarity measurement approaches.", "paper_title": "JacUOD: A New Similarity Measurement for Collaborative Filtering", "paper_id": "WOS:000311264700016"}
