Then, the SS algorithm builds a reference set from the pheromone trails of the ACO, and improves these to obtain better solutions Thereafter, the ACO uses the improved solutions to update the pheromone set. Finally in this iteration, the ACO searches the solution set using the new pheromone trails after the SS has terminated In ACOSS, ACO and the SS share the solution space for efficient exchange of the Solution set The ACOSS algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms using a set of standard problems available in the literature The experimental results validate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.", "paper_title": "An efficient hybrid algorithm for resource-constrained project scheduling", "paper_id": "WOS:000274351300019"}
