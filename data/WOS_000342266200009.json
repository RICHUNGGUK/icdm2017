Remarkably, most data centers are still not energy efficient, because they operate full speed around the clock regardless of demand. In this paper, we present a novel distributed algorithm that adjusts server speed and workload routing according to the demand of multiple (virtualized) applications. Unlike previous studies that use the mean response time of a simple M/M/1 queue, the proposed algorithm incorporates the response time distribution obtained from a G/G/1/PS queue. We explain the optimality of the proposed algorithm and discuss the impact of incorporating response time constraints. The numerical results show the effectiveness of the algorithm when implemented in a distributed manner. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
