Existing PCCR systems suffer from several problems, including the restriction of users' head movement, and the requirement of individual calibration. This paper presents a head position compensation model using a single camera and a single light source, which realizes the analytic compensation of head motion effects on pupil-glint vectors. We then present a transformation model for individual differences to simplify the calibration process to a one-point calibration. On this basis, we establish a novel gaze estimation method that reduces the minimum hardware requirements for accurate estimation to a single camera (not calibrated) and a single light source. Without the need for a complex system, our method has the ability to estimate gaze during natural head movement, and to substantially simplify user calibration. Each step of the proposed method in this paper makes real-time implementation possible, which provides an effective solution for eye-gaze tracking in human-computer interaction systems.", "paper_title": "Gaze estimation in a gaze tracking system", "paper_id": "WOS:000297709100007"}
