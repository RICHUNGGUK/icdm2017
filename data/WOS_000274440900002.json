The proposed system detects novel worms and instantly generates their signatures. This feature helps to check the spread of any kind of worm-known or unknown. We envision a two-layer hierarchical architecture comprising local security managers (LSMs), metropolitan security managers (MSM), and a global security manager (GSM). Local managers collect suspicious flows and hand them to metropolitan managers. Metropolitan managers then use cluster analysis to sort worms from the suspicious flows. The sorted worms are used to generate the worm signature which is relayed to the global manager and then to all the collaborating networks. A separate scheme is proposed to automatically select suitable values of the system parameters. This parameter selection procedure takes into account the current network state and the threat level of the ongoing attack. The performance of the whole system is investigated using real network traffic with traces of worms. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable to accurately detect email worms during the early phase of their propagations.
