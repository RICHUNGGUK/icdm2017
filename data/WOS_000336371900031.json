There is a growing need for precise and reliable methods to assess the bio-deterioration in concrete structures and identify the extent of biodeposition. This study proposes statistical image analysis method and application of the neural network classification approach to quantify bio-depositories on flooring surface that is exposed to outdoor environment. The results yield percentages of various bio-depositories on the sample.", "paper_title": "Quantification of biofilm on flooring surface using image classification technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000336371900031"}
