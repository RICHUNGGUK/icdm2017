The fuzzy logic weighted multi-criteria of the protocol is used to dynamically evaluate the active route lifetime in order to determine the appropriate routes. Multiple routing paths are. established to provide extra schemas of video streaming or multicast transmission and enhance the robust transmission against unreliability and limited bandwidth of wireless links. Due to frequent node movements, the topologies of mobile ad hoc networks change rapidly. The evaluation of dynamic route lifetime is challenging in the wireless networks. The fuzzy weighted logic multi-criteria are based on the remained energies of the nodes on the routes, the number of hop-counts and the sent controlled packages. The simulation results of the FMAR show that the protocol is quite efficient and superior to AODV with the respects to the node mobility, the packet delivery ratio, average route acquisition latency delay, the routing overhead and the average end-to-end delay.
