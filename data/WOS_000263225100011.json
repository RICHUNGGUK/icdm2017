The objective is to design a stable filter guaranteeing the asymptotic stability and a prescribed H-infinity performance of the filtering error system. Motivated by the parallel distributed compensation technique, we design a new filter model in this paper. Filter parameter matrices can be obtained from the solution of a convex optimization problem in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). When these LMIs are feasible, an explicit expression of a desired H-infinity fuzzy filter is given. Two numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and less conservativeness of the proposed design approach.", "paper_title": "New Results on H-infinity Filtering for Fuzzy Time-Delay Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000263225100011"}
