As sunscreens are considered an important preventive measure, studies to develop better and safer sunscreens are crucial. Cinnamates are UVB filters with good efficiency and cost-benefit, therefore, their study could lead to the development of new UV filters. A benchmark to define the most suitable density functional theory (DFT) functional to predict UV-vis spectra for ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate was performed. Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations were then carried out [B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) and B3P86/6-311+G(d, p) in methanol environment] for seven cinammete derivatives implemented in the Gaussian 03 package. All DFT/TD-DFT simulations were performed after a conformational search with the Monte-Carlo method and MMFF94 force field. B3LYP and B3P86 functionals were better at reproducing closely the experimental spectra of ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate. Calculations of seven cinnamates showed a lambda(max) of around 310 nm, corroborating literature reports. It was observed that the energy for the main electronic transition was around 3.95 eV and could be explained by electron delocalization on the aromatic ring and ester group, which is important to UV absorption. The methodology employed proved to be suitable for determination of the UV spectra of cinnamates and could be used as a tool for the development of novel UV filters.", "paper_title": "Benchmark studies of UV-vis spectra simulation for cinnamates with UV filter profile", "paper_id": "WOS:000355953200018"}
