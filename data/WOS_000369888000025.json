In this setting we analyze in detail the distributions of the corresponding Dirac point-masses of V. Illustrations include certain models from neural networks: An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a neural network configuration in which a hidden layer of weights are randomly sampled, and where the object is then to compute resulting output. For RKHSs H of functions defined on a prescribed countable infinite discrete set V, we characterize those which contain the Dirac masses (delta(x) for all points x in V. Further examples and applications where this question plays an important role are: (i) discrete Brownian motion-Hilbert spaces, i.e., discrete versions of the Cameron-Martin Hilbert space; (ii) energy-Hilbert spaces corresponding to graph-Laplacians where the set V of vertices is then equipped with a resistance metric; and finally (iii) the study of Gaussian free fields.", "paper_title": "Discrete Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces: Sampling and Distribution of Dirac-masses", "paper_id": "WOS:000369888000025"}
