The aim of the global dynamics evaluation is mainly the machine synthesis. The necessity of such formulation arises especially in robotics where the accessible velocities and accelerations on the given trajectory are important for the motion planning and for the design optimization of robots and manipulators. The analogical problem can be very important also for the design of any other machine type. The developed software is therefore one of the important tools for the multiobjective machine synthesis.
