By constructing more effective Lyapunov functionals, and combining with Jensen integral inequality or free-weighting matrix approach, several less conservative sufficient conditions for the existence of state estimator are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and the reduced conservatism of proposed results. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
