Constructing a connected dominating set (CDS) has been widely used as a connectivity topology strategy to reduce the network communication overhead. In the paper, a novel energy efficient distributed backbone construction algorithm based on connected dominating set is presented to make the network connected and further prolong the network lifetime, balance energy consumption. The algorithm is with O(n) time complexity and O(n) message complexity. The results show that our algorithm outperforms several existing algorithms in terms of network lifetime and backbone performance.", "paper_title": "Energy efficient connectivity maintenance in wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400013"}
