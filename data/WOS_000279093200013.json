In cooperation with the GSM system, GPRS supports both voice and packet data services. Obviously, combining voice and data traffic implies the nature of contending with finite radio resources. The paper focuses on voice/data integrated GPRS downlink traffic and proposes two hierarchical resource allocation strategies by considering time slots and radio blocks simultaneously with two different TDMA frame configurations. The radio block based resource allocation can characterize the multiplexing scheme of the practical GPRS operation. The performance of the proposed strategies were evaluated analytically by multidimensional Markov chain and verified through intensive computer simulations. Based on both the analytical and simulation results, it showed that the proposed allocation strategies can offer high utilization of transmission resource, as well as low blocking probability to GPRS users. The results of the study provide not only a practical thinking for implementation but also a guideline for analysis. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.
