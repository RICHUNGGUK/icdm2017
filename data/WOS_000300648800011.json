A new score function is defined based on the prospect value function, and examples are given to demonstrate the validity of this score function. As for the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making problems in which criteria weights are fixed, and the criteria values of alternatives are in the form of interval intuitionistic fuzzy numbers, an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making approach is proposed based on the prospect score function. This approach gives a matrix of score function values and a comprehensive evaluation value of each alternative. And the order of alternatives is listed by comparing the projection values of each alternative to the positive ideal solution. Finally, an example shows the feasibility and validity of this approach.
