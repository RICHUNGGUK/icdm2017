Data sieving is an important technique to improve the performance of noncontiguous I/O accesses by combining small and noncontiguous requests into a large and contiguous request. It has been proven effective even though more data are potentially accessed than demanded. In this study, we propose a new data sieving approach namely performance model-directed data sieving, or PMD data sieving in short. It improves the existing data sieving approach from two aspects: (1) dynamically determines when it is beneficial to perform data sieving; and (2) dynamically determines how to perform data sieving if beneficial. It improves the performance of the existing data sieving approach considerably and reduces the memory consumption as verified by both theoretical analysis and experimental results. Given the importance of supporting noncontiguous accesses effectively and reducing the memory pressure in a large-scale system, the proposed PMD data sieving approach in this research holds a great promise and will have an impact on high-performance I/O systems.", "paper_title": "Performance model-directed data sieving for high-performance I/O", "paper_id": "WOS:000355231600008"}
