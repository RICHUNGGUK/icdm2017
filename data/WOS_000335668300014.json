The problem is represented as an optimal state transition problem for TA. The model comprises of the parallel composition of submodels such as jobs and resources. The procedure of the proposed methodology can be divided into two steps. The first step is to decompose the TA model into several submodels by using decomposable condition. The second step is to combine individual solution of subproblems for the decomposed submodels by the penalty function method. A feasible solution for the entire model is derived through the iterated computation of solving the subproblem for each submodel. The proposed methodology is applied to solve flowshop and jobshop scheduling problems. Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm compared with a conventional TA scheduling algorithm without decomposition.", "paper_title": "Decomposition of timed automata for solving scheduling problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000335668300014"}
