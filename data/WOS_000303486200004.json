For the applications of performing face evaluation and/or recognition from low-resolution video surveillance, in the past, super-resolution image reconstruction was mainly used as a separate preprocessing step to obtain a high-resolution image in the pixel domain that is later passed to a face feature extraction and recognition algorithm. Such three-stage approach suffers a high degree of computational complexity. A low-dimensional morphable model space based face super-resolution reconstruction and recognition algorithm is proposed in this paper. The approach tries to construct the high-resolution information both required by reconstruction and recognition directly in the low dimensional feature space. We show that comparing with generic pixel domain algorithms, the proposed approach is more robust and more computationally efficient. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
