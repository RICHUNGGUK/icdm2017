The proposed algorithm is however very time consuming so that it cannot be applied to large-size real-world images. In this paper, we propose two major modifications i.e. utilization of a low-cost parametric score function estimator and derivation of a modified equivariant version of Newton-Raphson algorithm for solving the estimating equations. These modifications make the algorithm much faster and allow us to perform more experiments with artificial and real data which are presented in the paper.", "paper_title": "Markovian blind image separation", "paper_id": "WOS:000236486300014"}
