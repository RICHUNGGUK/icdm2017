Our method improves the memory bandwidth requirements for patch control points, translating into superior performance compared to existing methods. Our input is general, allowing for meshes that contain both quadrilateral and triangular faces in the input control mesh, as well as control meshes with boundary. We present two implementations of our scheme designed to run on Direct3D 11 class hardware equipped with a tessellator unit.", "paper_title": "Approximating Subdivision Surfaces with Gregory Patches for Hardware Tessellation", "paper_id": "WOS:000273315300046"}
