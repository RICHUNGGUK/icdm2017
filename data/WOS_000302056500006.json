We present tests for outlying values of the parameters (mu, lambda) of this distribution when data are available from a sample of independent units and possibly with more than one event per unit. Outlier tests are constructed from likelihood ratio tests for equality of parameters. The test for an outlying value of. is based on an F-distributed statistic that is transformed to an approximate normal statistic when there are unequal numbers of events per unit. Simulation studies are used to confirm that Bonferroni tests have accurate size and to examine the powers of the tests. The application to first hitting time models, where the IG distribution is derived from an underlying Wiener process, is described. The tests are illustrated on data concerning the strength of different lots of insulating material.", "paper_title": "Tests for outliers in the inverse Gaussian distribution, with application to first hitting time models", "paper_id": "WOS:000302056500006"}
