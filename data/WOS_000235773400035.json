However, the lack of good methods to analyze interesting fragments in large collections of web pages is preventing existing large web sites from using fragment-based techniques. Fragments are considered to be interesting if they are completely or structurally shared among multiple web pages. This paper first gives a formal description of the problem, and then presents our system for shared fragments analysis. We propose a well-designed data structure for representing web pages, and develop an efficient algorithm by utilizing database techniques. Our system is unique in its shared fragments analysis for large collections of web pages. The system has been built and successfully applied to some sets of large web pages, which has shown its effectiveness and usefulness, and may serve as a core building block in many applications.", "paper_title": "A shared fragments analysis system for large collections of web pages", "paper_id": "WOS:000235773400035"}
