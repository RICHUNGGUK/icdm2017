Instead we only require that the epipolar constraint between any two frames is satisfied and that the fundamental matrix can be estimated. By tracking sparse features across many frames and aggregating the multiple depth estimates together, we are able to improve the overall estimate for any given frame. Once the depth estimates are available, we treat the generation of the depth maps as a label propagation problem. This allows us to combine the automatically generated depth maps with any user corrections and modifications (if so desired). (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
