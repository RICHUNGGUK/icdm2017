Simple test cases with structured and unstructured grids are used to demonstrate that reliable error estimates on the basis of power series expansions can be made if the grids are refined systematically. However, if the grid refinement ratio is not constant in the complete domain, the definition of the typical cell size is not obvious, and the observed order of accuracy may not be equal to the expected theoretical order of the discretization. Some alternatives for the definition of the typical cell size are tested. In these tests, the error estimation does not show a significant effect of the definition of the typical cell size even for some cases with data sets clearly outside the asymptotic range'. For non-geometrically similar grids, the best estimates of the observed order of accuracy are obtained with the typical cell size on the basis of the mode of the cell size (the cell size that occurs more often in a given grid).
