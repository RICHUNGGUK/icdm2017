At the low level, we define plantons, which are a group of similar organs, to depict tree organ details statistically. At the high level, a set of transitions between plantons is provided to describe the stochastic distribution of organs. Based on such a tree model, we propose a novel tree modeling approach, synthesizing trees by plantons, which are extracted from tree samples. All tree samples are captured from the real world. We have designed a maximum likelihood estimation algorithm to acquire the two-level statistical tree model from single samples or multi- samples. Experimental results show that our new model is capable of synthesizing new trees with similar, yet visually different shapes.", "paper_title": "Synthesizing trees by plantons", "paper_id": "WOS:000236753500002"}
