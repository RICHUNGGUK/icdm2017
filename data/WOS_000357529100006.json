Our motivation comes from the need to provision multiple server CPUs in cloud-based data center environments. Using stochastic control theory we show that a class of DWRR policies provide the service differentiation objectives, without requiring any knowledge about the arrival and the service process statistics. The member policies provide the data center administrator with trade-off options, so that the communication and computation overhead of the policy can be adjusted. We further evaluate the proposed policies via simulations, using both synthetic and real traces obtained from a medium scale mobile computing application.", "paper_title": "CPU Provisioning Algorithms for Service Differentiation in Cloud-Based Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000357529100006"}
