Density, velocity and entropy per unit volume are used as independent variables for a single-phase, single-component flow. Time-dependent nodal values and interpolation functions are introduced to represent the flow field. Nodal vectors of mass, velocity and entropy are defined as bond graph state variables. It can be shown that the system total energy can be represented as a three-port IC-field. The conservation of linear momentum for the nodal velocity is represented at the inertial port, while mass and entropy conservation equations are represented at the capacitive ports. All kind of boundary conditions are handled consistently and can be represented as generalized modulated effort or flow sources. As a result of a combination of bond graph concepts with elements of numerical methods, a new approach was developed, which is a foundation of a bridge between bond graphs and CFD.
