The objective of this research is enhancing the accuracy and availability of Newton-based WLAN positioning. Two tracking algorithms have been designed for this purpose. Results obtained from simulations run using true ranging observables demonstrate the suitability of the proposed algorithms. This technique allows the tracking of mobile terminals in real-time indoors with around 1.5 m of error with three access points at sight. Additionally, tracking with only two access points is possible with an accuracy drop of around 1 m. Other advantages of the proposed solution include its flexibility of deployment and cost-effectiveness. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
