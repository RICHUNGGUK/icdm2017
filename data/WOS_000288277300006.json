Previous computational methods for T3S protein prediction have only achieved limited accuracy, and distinct features for effective T3S protein prediction remain to be identified. Results: In this work, a distinctive N-terminal position-specific amino acid composition (Aac) feature was identified for T3S proteins. A large portion (similar to 50%) of T3S proteins exhibit distinct position-specific Aac features that can tolerate position shift. A classifier, BPBAac, was developed and trained using Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on the Aac feature extracted using a Bi-profile Bayes model. We demonstrated that the BPBAac model outperformed other implementations in classification of T3S and non-T3S proteins, giving an average sensitivity of similar to 90.97% and an average selectivity of similar to 97.42% in a 5-fold cross-validation evaluation. The model was also robust when a small-size training dataset was used. The fact that the position-specific Aac feature is commonly found in T3S proteins across different bacterial species gives this model wide application. To demonstrate the model's application, a genome-wide prediction of T3S effector proteins was performed for Ralstonia solanacearum, an important plant pathogenic bacterium, and a number of putative candidates were identified using this model.", "paper_title": "High-accuracy prediction of bacterial type III secreted effectors based on position-specific amino acid composition profiles", "paper_id": "WOS:000288277300006"}
