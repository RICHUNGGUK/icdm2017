False data injection attack, which is against state estimation through SCADA network, has recently attracted wide research interests. This paper further develops the concept of load redistribution (LR) attack, a special type of false data injection attack. The damage of LR attacks to power system operations can manifest in an immediate or a delayed fashion. For the immediate attacking goal, we show in this paper that the most damaging attack can be identified through a max-min attacker-defender model. Benders decomposition within a restart framework is used to solve the bilevel immediate LR attack problem with a moderate computational effort. Its effectiveness has been validated by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method solution in our previous work. For the delayed attacking goal, we propose a trilevel model to identify the most damaging attack and transform the model into an equivalent single-level mixed-integer problem for final solution. In summary, this paper enables quantitative analysis of the damage of LR attacks to power system operations and security, and hence provides an in-depth insight on effective attack prevention when resource budgets are limited. A 14-bus system is used to test the correctness of the proposed model and algorithm.", "paper_title": "Quantitative Analysis of Load Redistribution Attacks in Power Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000306807200015"}
