Based on a proposed conceptual framework that models the relationships between physical and virtual spaces, this paper presents an attempt to adjust the space-time prism concept of Hgerstrand's time geography to identify potential activity opportunities in virtual space, focusing on the virtual space access channels available in physical space. A three-dimensional (3D) spatio-temporal Geographic Information System (GIS) design has been developed in this research to accommodate the adjusted space-time prism concept to support the representation, visualization, and analysis of potential human activities and interactions in physical and virtual spaces using the prism representation. Following the design, a prototype system has been successfully implemented in a 3D GIS environment. Such a system can provide powerful analytical tools for studies related to potential human activities and applications such as location-based services (LBS) and accessibility analysis in the information age.", "paper_title": "Exploring potential human activities in physical and virtual spaces: a spatio-temporal GIS approach", "paper_id": "WOS:000254214600003"}
