This paper shows that critical states with non-unique responses occur at least at very specific bi-axial stress states. This can happen for cases where the constant related to the second invariant of strain is positive, but not for the case with this constant equal to zero (the Neo-Hookean case). The dependence of the instabilities on the ratio between the two constitutive constants is shown by evaluated fold lines. The instability is shown to be related to the imposed boundary conditions. An analytical treatment of the problem shows that dynamic edge effects correspond to the static instability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
