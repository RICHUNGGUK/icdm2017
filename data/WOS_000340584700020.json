One major part of fuzzy logic is ranking fuzzy numbers. In many fuzzy program systems, ranking fuzzy numbers has a remarkable role in decision making and data analysis. Despite the fact that a variety of methods exists for ranking fuzzy numbers, no one can rank fuzzy numbers perfectly in all cases and situations. In this paper, a new method for ranking fuzzy numbers based on the left and right using distance method and alpha-cut has been presented. To achieve this, a fuzzy distance measure between two generalized fuzzy numbers is proposed. The new measure is expanded with the help of the fuzzy ambiguity measure. The calculation of this method is derived from generalized trapezoidal fuzzy numbers and distance method concepts. Furthermore, a comparison of generalized fuzzy numbers between the proposed method and other resembled methods is provided.", "paper_title": "A developed distance method for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers", "paper_id": "WOS:000340584700020"}
