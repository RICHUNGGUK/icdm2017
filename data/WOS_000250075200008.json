Then, a single vehicle is assigned to each zone. In this paper, we present an analytical model to design a tandem AGV system with two-load AGVs. The analytical model is obtained by performing a design procedure which consists of two steps, 'selection of feasible zones' and 'selection of final guide path.' A numerical example is presented to show the design procedure. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
