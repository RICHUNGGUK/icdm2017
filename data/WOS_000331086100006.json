As opposed to standard simulation confidence intervals, we provide confidence intervals that account for uncertainty about the input model parameters; our method is appropriate when enough simulation effort can be expended to make simulation-estimation error relatively small. To achieve this we introduce metamodel-assisted bootstrapping that propagates input variability through to the simulation response via an equation-based model rather than by simulating. We develop a metamodel strategy and associated experiment design method that avoid the need for low-order approximation to the response and that minimizes the impact of intrinsic (simulation) error on confidence level accuracy. Asymptotic analysis and empirical tests over a wide range of simulation effort show that confidence intervals obtained via metamodel-assisted bootstrapping achieve the desired coverage.", "paper_title": "Quantifying Input Uncertainty via Simulation Confidence Intervals", "paper_id": "WOS:000331086100006"}
