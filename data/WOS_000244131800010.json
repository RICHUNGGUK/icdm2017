We formulate the model as an optimal control problem. The algorithm in this correspondence optimizes the multidrug cancer chemotherapy schedule. The objective is to minimize the tumor size under a set of constraints. We combine the adaptive elitist genetic algorithm with a local search algorithm called iterative dynamic programming (IDP) to form a new memetic algorithm (MA-IDP) for solving the problem. MA-IDP has been shown to be very efficient in solving the multidrug scheduling optimization problem.", "paper_title": "A memetic algorithm for multiple-drug cancer chemotherapy schedule optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000244131800010"}
