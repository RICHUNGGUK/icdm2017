Firstly, the current transportation situation in China is given and then some basic concepts of RITS are talked about as well. Secondly, the necessity of RITS is analyzed to show its strategic position. Then, the overall architecture of RITS is introduced here to make a clear picture of RITS and how it works. Finally, apart from key technologies in RITS, its sustainable strategies are mentioned to show the future development of RITS.", "paper_title": "OVERVIEW OF INTELLIGENT RAILWAY TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS IN CHINA", "paper_id": "WOS:000318578000003"}
