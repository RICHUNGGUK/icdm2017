However, the current multipath routing strategy may cause problem that the node energy near sink becomes obviously higher than other nodes which makes the network invalid and dead. It also has serious impact on the performance of wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN). In this paper, we propose a pair-wise directional geographical routing (PWDGR) strategy to solve the energy bottleneck problem. First, the source node can send the data to the pair-wise node around the sink node in accordance with certain algorithm and then it will send the data to the sink node. These pair-wise nodes are equally selected in 360 degrees scope around sink according to a certain algorithm. Therefore, it can effectively relieve the serious energy burden around Sink and also make a balance between energy consumption and end-to-end delay. Theoretical analysis and a lot of simulation experiments on PWDGR have been done and the results indicate that PWDGR is superior to the proposed strategies of the similar strategies both in the view of the theory and the results of those simulation experiments. With respect to the strategies of the same kind, PWDGR is able to prolong 70% network life. The delay time is also measured and it is only increased by 8.1% compared with the similar strategies.", "paper_title": "PWDGR: Pair-Wise Directional Geographical Routing Based on Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000373098300003"}
