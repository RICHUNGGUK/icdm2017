Windowed interpolation fast Fourier transformation (WIFFT) is an efficient algorithm for power system harmonic estimation, which can eliminate the errors caused by spectral leakage and picket fence effect. However, the fitting polynomial in the interpolation procedure contains both even and odd terms, and this increases the computational burden. This paper proposes a simple symmetrical interpolation FFT algorithm, where the even terms are removed from the fitting polynomial based on the triangular self-convolution windows (TSCW). The polynomials for frequency and amplitude computations are provided. Considerable leakage errors and harmonic interferences can be suppressed by the TSCW. Accurate estimations of harmonic parameters can be obtained via the fitting polynomial and the TSCW, both with adjustable order to fulfill different accuracy and speed requirements of practical power harmonic measurement. Simulation results and measurements have validated the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Harmonic Estimation Using Symmetrical Interpolation FFT Based on Triangular Self-Convolution Window", "paper_id": "WOS:000350356000002"}
