We assume that an arriving order contains some defective items. The buyer adopts a sublot sampled inspection policy to inspect selected items. The number of defective items in the sublot sampling is a random variable. The buyer's lead time is assumed reducible by adding crash cost. Two integrated inventory models with backorders and lost sales are derived. We first assume that the lead time demand follows a normal distribution, and then relax the assumption about the lead time demand distribution function and apply the minimax distribution-free procedure to solve the problem. Consequently, the order quantity, reorder point, lead time and the number of shipments per lot from the vendor to the buyer are decision variables. Iterative procedures are developed to obtain the optimal strategy.", "paper_title": "Integrated vendor-buyer inventory system with sublot sampling inspection policy and controllable lead time", "paper_id": "WOS:000245591700006"}
