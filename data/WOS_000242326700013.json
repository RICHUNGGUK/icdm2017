The thiazoles were initially docked into the binding pocket of a human 5-HT3A receptor homology model, constructed on the basis of the crystal structure of the snail acetylcholine binding protein (AChBP), using the GOLD program. The docked conformations were then extracted and used to build the 3D-QSAR models, with cross-validated r(cv)(2) values 0.785 and 0.744 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively. An additional five molecules were used to validate the models further, giving satisfactory predictive r(2) values of 0.582 and 0.804 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively. The results would be helpful for the discovery of new potent and selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonists.", "paper_title": "Structure-based 3D-QSAR studies on thiazoles as 5-HT3 receptor antagonists", "paper_id": "WOS:000242326700013"}
