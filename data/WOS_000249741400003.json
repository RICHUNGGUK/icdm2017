In this paper we show that the requirement that the adequate order used for truncating a Petri net unfolding must be well-founded is superfluous in many important cases, i.e., it logically follows from other requirements. We give a complete analysis when this is the case. These results concern the very 'core' of the unfolding theory. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
