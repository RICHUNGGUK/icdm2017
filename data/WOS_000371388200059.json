Single-mode access, combined with static spectrum partitioning between co-deployed RATs and independent resource allocation for employed RATs, results in suboptimal spectrum utilization in multi-RAT systems. This paper models user access in multi-RAT systems and proposes enabling multi-mode UE to simultaneously utilize multiple RATs, using multi-RAT carrier aggregation, to improve the performance and spectrum utilization of multi-RAT systems. Several realizations of multi-mode access with varying implementation requirements are presented and discussed. Detailed system-level simulations, for a system co-deploying High Speed Packet Access (HSPA) and Long-Term Evolution (LTE), are performed to investigate the gains and limitations of different user access configurations in multi-RAT systems.", "paper_title": "On the Utilization of Multi-Mode User Equipment in Multi-Radio Access Technology Cellular Communication Systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000371388200059"}
