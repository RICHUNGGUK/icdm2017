A natural idea is to test whether the equality < T > = sat(T) holds, that is, whether T generates its saturated ideal. By generalizing the notion of primitivity from univariate polynomials to regular chains, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition, together with a Grobner basis free algorithm, for testing this equality. Our experimental results illustrate the efficiency of this approach in practice. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
