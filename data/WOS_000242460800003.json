Losing packets in the network is inevitable, and losing voice packets degrades audio quality. There are many loss-recovery techniques that designers can use to mitigate the undesired effects of packet loss. Some of these loss-recovery techniques use sender-based procedures, and others use receiver-based procedures. We examine several well-known sender-based loss-recovery techniques and evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of each one in real-time interactive VoIP applications. We analyze the bandwidth requirements, buffering delays, and perceptual sound qualities of these techniques. We study the effectiveness of these approaches under various packet-loss conditions, and we also compare the effectiveness of these techniques against a speech codec that has high degree of packet-loss robustness.", "paper_title": "QoS evaluation of sender-based loss-recovery techniques for VoIp", "paper_id": "WOS:000242460800003"}
