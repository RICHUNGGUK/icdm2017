The control scheme consists of two controllers: a SVM based controller which fulfils the direct inverse model control and a traditional controller which fulfils the close-loop control. And so the scheme can deal with the errors between the process and the SVM based internal model generated by model mismatch and additional disturbance. Simulations are given to illustrate the proposed design procedure and the properties of the SVM based internal model control scheme for unknown nonlinear systems with time delay.", "paper_title": "SVM based internal model control for nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000239483000135"}
