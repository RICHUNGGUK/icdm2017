However, the PD queueing structure is not scalable because the number of queues in a node can be as large as the number of all possible source-destination pairs. In this work, we study the capacity region of wireless networks with per-link (PL) queueing model. The advantage of the PL queueing structure is that the number of queues in a node can be reduced significantly to the number of its neighboring nodes. In this paper, the capacity region of a wireless network with PL queueing structure is characterized, and a dynamic routing and power control policy, namely, DRPC-PL, is proposed to stabilize the network whenever the input rate is within the capacity region.
