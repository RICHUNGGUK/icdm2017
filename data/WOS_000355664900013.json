Herein, we show that this problem is only NP-complete even if LTL admits past-time operators and arithmetical constraints on counters. As far as past-time operators are concerned, their addition to LTL immediately leads to complications and hence an NP upper bound cannot be deduced by translating formulae into LTL and studying the problem only for this latter logic. We also provide other complexity results obtained by restricting further the class of flat counter systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
