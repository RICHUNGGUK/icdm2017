This paper extends our efforts on fuzzy relational algebraic operations under a fuzzy relational data model, namely, extended-possibility-based model. With a more general setting of fuzzy relational algebraic operators, some properties of the operators are investigated including equivalent definitions and transformation rules of the operators. These properties are important and desirable for processing queries in an effective and efficient manner. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
