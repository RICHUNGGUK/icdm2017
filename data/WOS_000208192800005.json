The system uniquely combines dead reckoning and fiducial marker-based localization schemes, exclusively using widely available, low end and low power consumer hardware components. The proposed system was tested with various walking patterns inside a building, achieving an indoor positioning accuracy of 3.38% of the total distance walked. This accuracy is comparable to those obtained with solutions deploying specialized high cost hardware components. The low cost wearable system proposed herein could serve as the foundation for a pervasive solution for indoor way finding and patient tracking. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.
