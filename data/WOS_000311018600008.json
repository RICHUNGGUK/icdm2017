In an abstract model, the state space is largely reduced, however, a counterexample found in such a model may not be a real counterexample. Accordingly, the abstract model needs to be further refined where an NP-hard state separation problem is often involved. In this paper, a novel approach is presented, in which extra boolean variables are added to the abstract model for the refinement. With this approach, not only the NP-hard state separation problem can be avoided, but also a smaller refined abstract model can be obtained. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
