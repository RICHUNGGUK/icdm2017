In contrast to other state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed approach employs the sequence data of the three RGB channels, analyzes eight fuzzy gradient values for each of the eight directions, and processes two temporal neighboring frames concurrently. Numerous simulation results confirm that this novel 3D framework performs well in terms of objective criteria (PSNR, MAE, NCD, and SSIM) and the more subjective measure of human vision in the different color sequences. An efficiency analysis of several promising 3D algorithms was performed on a DSP; computation times for various techniques are presented.", "paper_title": "Fuzzy 3D filter for color video sequences contaminated by impulsive noise", "paper_id": "WOS:000354715300009"}
