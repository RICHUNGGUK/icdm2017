We explore the characteristics of the modulus defined by these curves and choose curve parameters such that F-p multiplication becomes more efficient. The proposed algorithm uses Montgomery reduction in a polynomial ring combined with a coefficient reduction phase using a pseudo-Mersenne number. As an application, we show that the performance of pairings on BN curves in hardware can be significantly improved, resulting in a factor 2.5 speedup compared with state-of-the-art hardware implementations.", "paper_title": "Efficient Hardware Implementation of F-p-Arithmetic for Pairing-Friendly Curves", "paper_id": "WOS:000301800000007"}
