These factors are divided into vendor's service and personal psychology perspectives. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach - The research sample consisted of 631 respondents with experience in using broadband television. This study adopted structural equation modeling to test the proposed model. Findings - The results show that the structural model has a good fit and indicates that perceived system quality, perceived content quality, customization, perceived ease of use, and perceived risk directly influence users' opinions toward broadband television and indirectly affect their continuance intention to use through attitude to use. Practical implications - From a managerial standpoint, this study can assist internet protocol television (IPTV) service providers in understanding the critical determinants that influence consumers' continuance intention to use IPTV. Originality/value - This study contributes to the understanding of consumers' continuance intention to use IPTV by introducing customers' perspectives for vendor's service factors (perceived system quality, perceived content quality, customization, and perceived ease of use) to current theoretical models. From a personal psychology perspective, this study provides sound evidence that the determinants of perceived price level and perceived risk are critical factors that affect consumers' attitude to use and continuance intention to use of broadband televisions.", "paper_title": "Understanding broadband television users' continuance intention to use", "paper_id": "WOS:000352103300001"}
