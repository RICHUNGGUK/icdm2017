We show that EML satisfiability is only PSPACE-complete by designing a Ladner-like algorithm. This extends a well-known and nontrivial PSPACE upper bound for graded modal logic. Furthermore, we provide a detailed comparison with logics that contain Presburger constraints and that are dedicated to query XML documents. As an application, we provide a logarithmic space reduction from a variant of Sheaves Logic SL into EML that allows us to establish that its satisfiability problem is also PSPACE-complete, significantly improving the best known upper bound.
