There is no requirement that the 2D corresponding lines on different images represent the same segment of a 3D line, which may not appear on all images. A 3D line is reconstructed by minimizing a geometric cost function that measures the distance of the reprojected end points of the 3D segment from the measured 2D lines on different images. An algorithmic procedure is provided with guaranteed convergence to a solution where the geometrie cost function achieves a (local) minimum. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.
