Assuming small perturbations, the linearized steady-state 2D equation is implemented in a deterministic manner in order to avoid noise intrinsic in statistical approaches. Implementation details are discussed and the comparison with available experimental data in terms of forces exerted on the suspended shuttle is presented. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
