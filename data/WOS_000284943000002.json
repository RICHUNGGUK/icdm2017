The representation organizes motion data as samples in a high dimensional generalization of a vector field we call a 'motion field'. Our runtime motion synthesis mechanism freely 'flows' in the motion field and is capable of creating novel and natural motions that are highly-responsive to the real time user input, and generally not explicitly specified in the data.", "paper_title": "Motion Fields for Interactive Character Locomotion", "paper_id": "WOS:000284943000002"}
