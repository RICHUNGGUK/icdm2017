First, we define the notions of L-valued set of pure subsystems and L-valued set of strong pure subsystems, as well as, their relation is considered. Also, L-valued n-tuple operator consist of n successors is defined, some of its properties are examined and its relation with pure subsystem is analyzed. Furthermore, we investigate some concepts such as L-valued set of (strong) homomorphisms, L-valued set of (strong) isomorphisms, and L-valued set of admissible relations. Moreover, we discuss bifuzzy topological characterization of L-valued tree automata. Finally, the relations of homomorphisms between the L-valued tree automata to continuous mappings and open mappings is examined.", "paper_title": "Algebraic properties of complete residuated lattice valued tree automata", "paper_id": "WOS:000308532700008"}
