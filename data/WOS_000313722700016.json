Transmission gate (TG) switches are used to implement the preamplifier circuit. The use of TG switches results in a reduction in the power consumption of the high-speed comparator as well as clock feedthrough and the effect of charge injection. The simulation results demonstrate that it can work at 1.25 GHz suitable for high speed applications, and consumes 273.6 mu W with a power supply of 1.8 V at 100 MHz and Monte Carlo simulation shows that the comparator has a low offset voltage approximately 0.499 mV.", "paper_title": "A high-speed latched comparator with low offset voltage and low dissipation", "paper_id": "WOS:000313722700016"}
