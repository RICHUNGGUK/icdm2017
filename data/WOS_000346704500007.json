Steganography's ultimate concerns are undetectability, robustness, and capacity of data hiding. Three-dimensional (3D) meshes have been used more and more in industrial, medical, and entertainment applications during the last decades. In this paper, a high-capacity and very-low-distortion 3D mesh steganography scheme based on novel directional N-dimensional surfacelet transform is proposed. Experimental results show that the cover model distortion is very low. This novel approach can provide a much higher hiding capacity and lower distortion than existing approaches in the transform domain, at the same time, observing the main steganographic factors on 3D models.
