Methods: In the health promotion center of a hospital, 340 participants with a body mass index (BMI) greater than 25 were recruited and surveyed for the development of a text messaging program. After developing the interface linking the EHRs with personalized text messages for weight loss, we pilot-tested this program in 102 participants for its feasibility, acceptability and satisfaction. Results: According to the needs analysis, the participants desired additional information about personalized nutrition and exercise. We selected many variables from the EHRs and questionnaires to create text messages with a more personalized program. After a 1-month trial of the text messaging program, the participants' satisfaction score was 7.9 +/- 1.5 and recommendation score was 7.5 +/- 1.8. Conclusions: A personalized short message service (SMS) linked with EHRs was feasible, and the pilot test showed high satisfaction and recommendation scores. Further evaluation using a well-designed trial will be needed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
