In frequent pattern mining, closed frequent pattern mining and weighted frequent pattern mining are two main approaches to reduce the search space. Although many related studies have been suggested, no mining algorithm considers both paradigms. Even if closed frequent pattern mining represents exactly the same knowledge and weighted frequent pattern mining provides a way to discover more important patterns, the incorporation of closed frequent pattern mining and weight frequent pattern mining may loss information. Based on our analysis of joining orders, we propose closed weighted frequent pattern mining, and present how to discover succinct but lossless closed frequent pattern with weight constraints. To our knowledge, ours is the first work specifically to consider both constraints. An extensive performance study shows that our algorithm outperforms previous algorithms. In addition, it is efficient and scalable. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
