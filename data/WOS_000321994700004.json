The flow fields of 33 fluidic amplifiers with different dimensions, each attached to an identical actuating mechanism, were studied to obtain their threshold flow velocities, using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), with the technique of dynamic mesh and a user-defined function. The computational results indicate that each of the geometric parameters has a significant effect on the threshold flow velocity. Five representative computational results were validated by laboratory measurement. The agreement between the simulations and measurements is considered to be quite acceptable. Physical analysis of typical simulation results is also presented. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
