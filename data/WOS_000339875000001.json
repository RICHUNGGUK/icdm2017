However, many scientific and commercial applications are highly dependent on Information Servers (ISs) for storage and organization of their data. A data-information system that supports operations on multiple information servers in a grid environment is referred to as an interoperable grid system. Different perceptions by end-users of interoperable systems in a grid environment may lead to different reasons for integrating data. Even the same user might want to integrate the same distributed data in various ways to suit different needs, roles or tasks. Therefore multiple mediator views are needed to support this diversity. This paper describes our approach to supporting semantic interoperability in a heterogeneous multi-information server grid environment. It is based on using Integration Operators for generating multiple semantically rich RDF/OWL-based user defined mediator views above the grid participating ISs. These views support different perceptions of the distributed and heterogeneous data available. A set of grid services are developed for the implementation of the mediator views.", "paper_title": "Integration operators for generating RDF/OWL-based user defined mediator views in a grid environment", "paper_id": "WOS:000339875000001"}
