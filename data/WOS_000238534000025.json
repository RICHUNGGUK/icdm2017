This machine operating at variable speed generate vibrations that can be harmful for the machine itself and its environment. Thus, it is necessary for the manufacturer to take into account noise and vibration at the design stage. Acoustic measurements are performed in order to validate our multi-physical model. Afterwards, the experimental design method is used to build response surfaces of the noise with respect to the main factors.
