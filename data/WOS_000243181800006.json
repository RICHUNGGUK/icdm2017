We show that by regarding HTML code as a set of CSS files and accompanying information, or as an XSL file with an accompanying XML file, it is possible to improve the maintainability of web sites/pages - irrespective of the complexity of the pages concerned. We also describe how, as a by-product of this work, it is possible to produce an 'in house' a set of style sheets (CSS or XSL) which can be used as a basis for web page/site design thoughout a company. The implications of the use of the style sheets for web page/site maintenance, or design, are discussed as well as the potential for the use of our tool in enabling SMEs and/or individuals to standardize their web site(s) irrespective of their knowledge of manipulation of web site code.", "paper_title": "A data mining based method for web site maintenance", "paper_id": "WOS:000243181800006"}
