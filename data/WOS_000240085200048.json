Grounded on a communication-based view, we examined key drivers of user intention to share knowledge in virtual communities from three aspects: the knowledge to be shared, the individual self and the environment. In particular, a self-concept-based motivation model was employed to investigate individuals' motivational factors. An empirical study of 363 virtual community users demonstrated the salient and dominant influences of enhanced knowledge self-efficacy and self-image on knowledge contribution intention. Enjoyment in helping others, trust and system usability were also found to be important motivations for knowledge sharing. Implications for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.", "paper_title": "An empirical study of what drives users to share knowledge in virtual communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200048"}
