This is achieved by progressing through a series of codes, each of which fault-tolerantly corrects at least one error. Throughout the conversion the encoded qubit remains protected. We found, through computational search, that the method used to convert between codes given in this paper is optimal.", "paper_title": "FAULT-TOLERANT QUANTUM ERROR CORRECTION CODE CONVERSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000315304900005"}
