The resulting machines, though, are usually too large for being usable in many real world applications, especially when fast real-time response is needed. Some approaches aim at decreasing the complexity of the resulting full-size SVM classifiers. The most successful methods follow the \"reduced-set\" procedure, but they have to start from a full SVM solution, and then solve a pre-image problem, prone to fall in local minima. We propose here a compact multiclass SVM (CMSVM) method, that does not need the full SVM solution as a starting point (and hence scales potentially better), and does not need to address the pre-image problem. We evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme by means of real world data sets, and we compare it against other state-of-the-art MSVM techniques. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.
