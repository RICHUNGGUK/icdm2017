One key challenge is that modern languages and systems provide poor support for ensuring concurrency correctness properties-atomicity, sequential consistency, and multithreaded determinism-because all existing approaches are impractical. Dynamic, software-based approaches slow programs by up to an order of magnitude because capturing and controlling cross-thread dependences (i.e., conflicting accesses to shared memory) requires synchronization at virtually every access to potentially shared memory. This paper introduces a new software-based concurrency control mechanism called OCTET that soundly captures cross-thread dependences and can be used to build dynamic analyses for concurrency correctness. OCTET achieves low overheads by tracking the locality state of each potentially shared object. Non-conflicting accesses conform to the locality state and require no synchronization; only conflicting accesses require a state change and heavyweight synchronization. This optimistic tradeoff leads to significant efficiency gains in capturing cross-thread dependences: a prototype implementation of OCTET in a high-performance Java virtual machine slows real-world concurrent programs by only 26% on average. A dependence recorder, suitable for record & replay, built on top of OCTET adds an additional 5% overhead on average. These results suggest that OCTET can provide a foundation for developing low-overhead analyses that check and enforce concurrency correctness.", "paper_title": "OCTET: Capturing and Controlling Cross-Thread Dependences Efficiently", "paper_id": "WOS:000327697300039"}
