In this paper we highlight the application of some key concepts of web services for the specification and design of a complex supervisory web-based HMI. Hence, a novel approach based on a service oriented architecture and web services allowing flexible and transparent interaction between the field devices and human operators currently being considered is now possible. An overall design framework is presented and discussed. A real representative case study illustrating this approach is described and discussed from the human-machine interaction point of view, as well as further work. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
