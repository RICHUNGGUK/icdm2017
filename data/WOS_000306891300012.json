Pairwise comparison, used by AHP, shares a common weakness with other input formats used to represent user preferences, namely, that the input mode is static. In other words, users must provide all the preference data at the same time, and the criteria must be completely defined from the start. To overcome this weakness, we propose a framework that allows users to provide partial and/or incomplete preference data at multiple times. Since this is a complicated issue, we specifically focus on a particular aspect as a first attempt within this framework. For that reason, we re-examine a mechanism to achieve consistency in AHP, i.e. a linearization process, which provides consistency when adding a new element to the decision process or when withdrawing an obsolete criterion under the dynamic input mode assumption. An algorithm is developed to determine the new priority vector from the users' new input. Finally, we apply the new process to a problem of interest in the water field, specifically, the adoption of a suitable leak control policy in urban water supply. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
