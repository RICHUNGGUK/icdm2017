Firstly, we utilize a T-S fuzzy model to represent a chaotic system. Secondly, using comparison methods. a general asymptotical stability criteria is derived for chaotic systems with impulsive effects. Finally, as an illustrative example, Lorenz system is considered to verify the effectiveness of the control scheme. (C) 2008 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
