Existing anti-collision protocols can rapidly identify the staying tags by remembering the order in which the tags were recognized in the previous identification process. This paper proposes a novel protocol, dynamic blocking adaptive binary splitting (DBA), based on the blocking mechanism, which prevents the newly-arriving tags from colliding with the staying tags. Moreover, DBA utilizes a dynamic condensation technique to reduce the number of idle slots produced when recognized tags leave. Following the condensation process, multiple staying tags may be required to share the same slot, and thus may cause collisions among them. Accordingly, an efficient ordering binary tree mechanism is proposed to split the collided tags deterministically according to the order in which they were recognized. The analytical and simulation results show that DBA consistently outperforms previous algorithms in all of the considered environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
