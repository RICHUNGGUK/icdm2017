The means for accessing information suffer from severe drawbacks. The SoDa project was launched (2000-2003, IST program of the European Commission) to bring solutions by an efficient use of information and communication technologies. Integration of information sources of different natures was realized by the SoDa Intelligent System. Surveys of users demonstrated that large gains in terms of efficiency, costs, etc. were expected by engineers, companies, agencies and research institutes. The SoDa Service was created in 2003. During the past three years, it has undergone several improvements, including works on the user interface and on the presentation of the services, all aiming at consolidating it with respect to access by users. Promotion efforts were made in the media, including TV. The use of the SoDa Service is increasing from year to year: in 2003, 10,000 requests were satisfied, in 2004, 17,000 requests and 27,000 in 2005. This article presents the lessons learned from the past years and the perspectives of the SoDa Service. We discuss the sustainability of the SoDa Service, the technologies used and the approach to customers, in the perspective of building a 13213 merchant site. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
