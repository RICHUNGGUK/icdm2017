Based on synthetic data representative of signals observed by SGs at various station locations, we demonstrate that the addition of SG information mitigates the error in the estimation of gravity rates of change caused by the presence of long period, interannual, and annual signals in the AG data. These results are discussed as a function of the sampling rate of the absolute gravity measurements, the duration of the observations, and the uncertainties of the AGs. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
