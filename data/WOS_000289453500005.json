For the time being we support a low cost approach based on the transmission of limited vision information by means of the auditory channel. The See ColOr mobility aid for visually impaired individuals transforms a small portion of a coloured video image into sound sources represented by spatialised musical instruments. Basically, the conversion of colours into sounds is achieved by quantisation of the HSL colour system. Our purpose is to provide blind people with a capability of perception of the environment in real time. In this work the novelty is the simultaneous sonification of colour and depth, the last parameter being coded by sound rhythm. The main drawback of our approach is that the sonification of a limited portion of a captured image involves limited perception. As a consequence, we propose to extend the local perception module by introducing a new global perception module aiming at providing the user with a clear picture of the entire scene characteristics. Finally, we present several experiments to illustrate the limited perception module, such as: (1) detecting an open door in order to go out from the office; (2) walking in a hallway and looking for a blue cabinet; (3) walking in a hallway and looking for a red tee shirt: (4) avoiding two red obstacles; (5) moving outside and avoiding a parked car.
