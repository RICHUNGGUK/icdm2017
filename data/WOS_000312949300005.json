Since frequency resources are universally reused in every cell in a system, a typical OFDMA system tries to maximize the spectral efficiency. Users located near the cell-edge tend to have the weakest signal strength. So they might experience severe inter-cell interferences (ICIs). In this paper, we propose a sequential frequency reuse (SqFR) that reduces ICIs by a sequential sub-channel allocation. By giving more power to sub-carriers allocated to cell-edge users, our SqFR significantly enhances the performance of cell-edge users. The performance of the proposed SqFR is investigated via the analysis and simulations. Simulation results show that proposed SqFR improves the performance of cell-edge users in an OFDMA system under both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic conditions.
