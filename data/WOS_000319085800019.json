A visual feature-based constraint underlies most conventional motion estimation methods. For example, optical flow methods assume that the brightness of each pixel is constant in two consecutive frames. However, it is difficult to realize accurate extraction and tracking using only visual feature information, because viewpoint changes and inconsistent illumination cause the visual features of some regions of objects to appear different in consecutive frames. A structure-based constraint of objects is also necessary for tracking. In the proposed method, both visual feature matching and structure matching are formulated as a linear assignment problem and then integrated.", "paper_title": "Extraction and Tracking Moving Objects in Detail Considering Visual Feature Constraint and Structure Constraint", "paper_id": "WOS:000319085800019"}
