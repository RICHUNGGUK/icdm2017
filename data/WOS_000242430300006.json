Design: Observational study performed as part of a larger randomized trial in six rural communities in Utah and Idaho from January 2002 to March 2004. Ninety-nine primary care providers received a PDA-based CDSS for use at the point-of-care, and were asked to use the tool with at least 200 patients with suspected RTIs. Measurements: Clinical data were collected electronically from the devices at periodic intervals. Providers also completed an exit questionnaire at the end of the study period. Results: Providers logged 14,393 cases using the CDSS, the majority of which (n = 7624; 53%) were from family practitioners. Overall adherence with CDSS recommendations for the five most common diagnoses (pharyngitis, otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and upper respiratory tract infection) was 82%. When antibiotics were prescribed (53% of cases), adherence with the CDSS-recommended antibiotic was high (76%). By logistic regression analysis, the odds of adherence with CDSS recommendations increased significantly with each ten cases completed (P = 0.001). Questionnaire respondents believed the CDSS was easy to use, and most (44/65; 68%) did not believe it increased their encounter time with patients, regardless of prior experience with PDAs. Conclusion: A standalone PDA-based CDSS for acute RTIs used at the point-of-care can encourage better outpatient antimicrobial prescribing practices and easily gather a rich set of clinical data.", "paper_title": "Use of a personal digital assistant for managing antibiotic prescribing for outpatient respiratory tract infections in rural communities", "paper_id": "WOS:000242430300006"}
