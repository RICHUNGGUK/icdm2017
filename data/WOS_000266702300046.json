The DE is employed here to improve the affinities of the clones of the antibodies (Abs) in the CSA. Several nonlinear functions are used to verify and demonstrate the effectiveness of our hybrid optimization approach. It is further applied for the construction of the cascade-correlation (C-C) neural network, in which the optimal hidden nodes can be obtained. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.
