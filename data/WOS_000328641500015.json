Research demonstrated the effectiveness of vibrotactile flow for conveying intuitive directional information on a mobile device. In this paper, we extend previous research by investigating the perceptual characteristics of vibrotactile flows rendered on a mobile device and proposing a synthesis framework for vibrotactile flows with desired perceptual properties.", "paper_title": "Perceptual Analysis of Vibrotactile Flows on a Mobile Device", "paper_id": "WOS:000328641500015"}
