As a potential remedy to alleviate these performance challenges, cross-layer design and optimization beyond layered architecture have been envisioned as in many similar communication systems. In this article some recent cross-layer design and solutions for improving the performance of IEEE 802.16 WiMAX are described. Moreover, a novel routing-scheduling scheme to illustrate the application and realization of the cross-layer paradigm in this domain is presented.", "paper_title": "APPLICATIONS OF THE CROSS-LAYER PARADIGM FOR IMPROVING THE PERFORMANCE OF WIMAX", "paper_id": "WOS:000281866300012"}
