These blocks of features come with a well-defined semantics. For instance, in spatiotemporal data, a certain block of features concerns a spatial component of the data (say, x-y or x-y-z coordinates), while another one deals with the features that describe time series associated with the corresponding locations. The results of clustering that are being produced locally are reconciled by minimizing a distance between the proximity matrices that are formed at the higher conceptual level and induced by the individual partition matrices. The optimization problem is formulated and presented along with its iterative scheme.", "paper_title": "Proximity-Based Clustering: A Search for Structural Consistency in Data With Semantic Blocks of Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000325684400016"}
