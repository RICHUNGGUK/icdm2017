Without a third party to play the roles of verifier and recorder, however, buyers face a potential problem of being cheated by a malicious seller. Thus, we aim to develop a mail order system over the Internet that can guarantee user anonymity and secrecy during the transaction process. The low computation of the mutual authentication between the parties involved contributes to the practicality of this new system, while the correctness of this process can be confirmed by the BAN logic model.
