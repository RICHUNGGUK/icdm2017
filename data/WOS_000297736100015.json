The efficiency of the method depends directly on how to build and use the neighbour list. In the present work, the available searching algorithms for SPH codes are analyzed. Different gridding algorithms are evaluated, the gains in efficiency obtained from reordering of particles is investigated and the cell-linked list and Verlet list methods are studied to create the neighbour list. Furthermore, an innovative searching procedure based on a dynamic updating of the Verlet list is proposed. The efficiency of the algorithms is analyzed in terms of computational time and memory requirements.
