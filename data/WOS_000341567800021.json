This paper presents a distributed approach based on local semidefinite programming (LSDP) to solve the localization problem in large-scale WSNs. At first, we propose a new technique to divide a large-scale WSN into several overlapped local networks, each of which creating a local map according to the LSDP algorithm. Then, a novel merging algorithm is presented to effectively merge all local maps into a global map, which contains the exact position of interested nodes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed method can achieve better scalability and higher accuracy and is also robust to the measurement noise.", "paper_title": "Local Semidefinite Programming-Based Node Localization System for Wireless Sensor Network Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000341567800021"}
