The controls for ECWS are classified into controls for system continuity, access controls, communication controls, and informal controls. The control design for ECWS is not well structured and demands understanding of the complex causal relationships among environmental factors (infrastructure, organizational requirements for security), controls, implementation, and performance. In order to aid the design of ECWS controls, the application of a fuzzy cognitive map, ECFCM (EC-control design using a fuzzy cognitive map), was developed. Structural equation modeling was used to identify relevant relationships among the components and indicate their direction and strength. A standardized causal coefficient from structural equation modeling was then used to create a fuzzy cognitive map, through which the state or movement of one control component was shown to have an influence on the state or movement of others. Thus ECFCM provides a practical insight to IS auditors by addressing the applicability of soft approaches in capturing and illustrating the use of FCM in the design of ECWS controls.
