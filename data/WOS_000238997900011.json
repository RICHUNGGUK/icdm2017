Design/methodology/approach - These functions, like the connections between pairs of entities in the systems, are formulated using the derivative concept. The system will thus be analysed in function of processes between mathematically formulated variables. Findings - For each entity in the system or in the environment system it will be possible to determine networks of dependence and interdependence, which will be represented by their associated functions. Originality/value - The functions described in this paper aim to decipher the processes that occur in systems. The characterisation of these functions via derivates implies an acknowledgement of the processes in the system, given that by simply observing the value of the derivatives obtained, one can uncover the network of interdependences between system entities.", "paper_title": "A connection between derivates and processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000238997900011"}
