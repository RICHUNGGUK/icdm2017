Through numerical tests of the nonlinear Landau damping and two-stream instability, we compared the present scheme with other schemes such as the Spline and CIP ones. We mainly investigated the conservation property of the L1-norm, energy, entropy and phase space area for each scheme, and demonstrated that the IDO-CF scheme is capable of performing stable long time scale simulation while maintaining high accuracy. The scheme is based on an Eulerian approach, and it can thus be directly used for Fokker-Planck, high dimensional Vlasov-Poisson and also guiding-center drift simulations, aiming at particular problems of plasma physics. The benchmark tests for such simulations have shown that the IDO-CF scheme is superior in keeping the conservation properties without causing serious phase error. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
