In this paper, we design a light based device to solve a generalized version of the Subset Sum problem which was previously handled by Oltean and Muntean. We further design a system which is capable of providing us with the solution subset of the problem in addition to the YES/NO answer to the question of whether there exists a solution or not.", "paper_title": "Solving the generalized Subset Sum problem with a light based device", "paper_id": "WOS:000288255800032"}
