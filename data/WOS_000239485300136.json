This method allows the time prediction in which a variable will arrive to abnormal or important values. The data of each variable are used to estimate the parameters of a continuous mathematical model. At this moment, four models are used: first-order or second-order in three types (critically damped, overdamped or underdamped). An optimization algorithm is used for estimating the model parameters for a dynamic response to step input function, because this is the most frequent disturbance. Before performing the estimation, the most appropriate model is determined by means of a feed-forward neural network.", "paper_title": "Neural network based industrial processes monitoring", "paper_id": "WOS:000239485300136"}
