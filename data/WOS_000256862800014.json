To facilitate Mura detection, background signal shading should level off and Mura signal must be amplified. In this paper, Mura signal amplification and background signal flattening method is proposed based on human visual system (HVS). The proposed DC normalized contrast sensitivity function (CSF) is used for the Mura signal amplification and polynomial regression (PR) is used to level off the background signal. In the enhanced image, tri-modal thresholding segmentation technique is used for finding Dark and White Mara at the same time. To select reliable defect, falsely detected invisible region is eliminated based on Weber's Law. By the experimental results of artificially generated 1-d signal and TFT-LCD image, proposed algorithm has novel enhancement results and can be applied to real automated inspection system.", "paper_title": "A development of the TFT-LCD image defect inspection method based on human visual system", "paper_id": "WOS:000256862800014"}
