Effective and proper evaluation for reuse selection may accelerate the implementation of sustainable conservation This stud presents a comprehensive methodology for the reuse selection of historic buildings The criteria. which are relevant to the reuse selection of historic buildings, have been identified through FDM method and used to construct an ANP model Thereafter, the application of ANP for the reuse selection has been demonstrated through two illustrative examples in Taiwan The result reveals that the proposed methodology can effectively capture the interdependencies among the various criteria These have rarely been applied in the context of reuse selection problems and their utilization has made evaluation and selection for reuse a feasible concept This approach also enables decision-makers to better understand the complex relationships of the relevant attributes in reuse selection problems. which may subsequently improve the acceptability of the decision (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
