Through in-depth interviews with 11 university students, it was found that students want subject guides that are clean and simple, and although students do not use subject guides often, they might use them more if subject guides were more specifically customized to meet their needs. In the context of designing subject guides for students, one size does not fit all, and librarians should consult with students and faculty to assess their needs and wants to create guides that are more useful, and more used.", "paper_title": "Subject Guides in Academic Libraries: A User-Centred Study of Uses and Perceptions", "paper_id": "WOS:000298313200007"}
