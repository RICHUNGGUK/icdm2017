These services, however, are strongly prone to packet loss due to the highly dynamic topology and shared wireless medium inherent in the VANETs. A possible strategy to enhance the delivery rate is to use redundancy for handling packet loss. This is a suitable technique for VANETs as it does not require any interaction between the source and receivers. In this work, we discuss novel approaches for the use of redundancy based on the particularities of video streaming over VANETs. A thorough study on the use of redundancy through Erasure Coding and Network Coding in both video unicast and video broadcast in VANETs is provided. We investigate each strategy, design novel solutions and compare their performance. We evaluated the proposed solutions from the perspective not only of cost as bandwidth utilization, but also the offered receiving rate of unique video content at the application layer. This perspective is fundamental to understanding how redundancy can be used without limiting the video quality that can be displayed to end users. Furthermore, we propose the selective use of redundancy solely on data that is more relevant to the video quality. This approach offers increases in overall video quality without leading to an excessive overhead nor to a substantial decrease in the receiving rate of unique video content. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
