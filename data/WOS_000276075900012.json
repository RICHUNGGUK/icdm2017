A combined genetic algorithm-gradient approach is used to obtain the minimum weight structure for various numbers of cross-sections. The problem is investigated for the well known ten-bar truss structure. Results show that decreasing the number of cross-sections from nine to four has a small impact on the weight of approximately 5.3%.", "paper_title": "Structural optimization with limited number of element properties", "paper_id": "WOS:000276075900012"}
