Because WMSNs are usually deployed at unattended or hostile environments, an adversary can easily compromises several sensor nodes and controls them to launch attacks. These compromised nodes are difficult to be detected by traditional secure scheme due to having all keying materials. This paper proposes a novel trust evaluation model to detect the compromised nodes in WMSNs. Under our design, each node computes the trust value of their behaviors and builds a local trust management. Moreover, an energy-efficient secure routing is proposed to achieve secure data collection and meet the requirement of energy efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is evaluated by analysis and extensive simulations. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.
