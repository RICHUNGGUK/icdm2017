Other technologies would also benefit from greater portability, such as the libraries associated with speech or gesture recognition and handwriting translation. A growing trend is wearable computing devices, which require tangible user interfaces. The software that drives these devices will undergo the same rapid development cycle cell phones have, and new versions will constantly emerge for newer models. In this domain, the essence of the TUI can be encapsulated, enabling the drivers or toolkits to migrate in time.", "paper_title": "Cross-platform development: Software that lasts", "paper_id": "WOS:000241162400012"}
