In this paper, we further study coimplications generated from pseudo-uninorms on a complete lattice. Firstly, we further discuss the properties of residual coimplications generated from pseudo-uninorms on a complete lattice. Then, we recall the induced operators by coimplications on a complete lattice and give conditions such that they are pseudo-uninorms. Finally, we give out some characterizations of the residual coimplications generated from (right) infinitely Lambda-distributive disjunctive pseudo-uninorms on a complete lattice.
