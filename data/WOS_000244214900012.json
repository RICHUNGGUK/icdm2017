In this paper we show how to modify their basic construction in order to achieve a scheme that is provably secure under the assumption that factoring large composites of a certain form is hard. Our scheme is as efficient as the original Cramer Damgard solution while relying on a seemingly weaker intractability assumption. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.
