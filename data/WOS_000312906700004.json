Sparse representation has been proven to have strong ability to denoise. However, it performs suboptimally when the noise is sparse in some dictionary. A novel joint sparse representation (JSR)-based image denoising method is proposed. The images can be recovered well from multiple noisy copies. All copies share a common component-the image, while each individual measurement contains an innovation component-the noise. Our method can separate the common and innovation components, and reconstruct the images with the sparse coefficients and the dictionaries. Experiment results show that the performance of the proposed method is better than that of other methods in terms of the metric and the visual quality.", "paper_title": "Denoising for Multiple Image Copies through Joint Sparse Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000312906700004"}
