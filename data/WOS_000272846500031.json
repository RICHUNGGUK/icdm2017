A deterministic equivalent of the stochastic super-efficiency model is given. It is shown that this deterministic model can be converted to a quadratic program. Sensitivity analysis of the proposed super-efficiency model is discussed. The SNL Executive Compensation database is used to illustrate the methods developed in this article. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
