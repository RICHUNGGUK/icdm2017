The rule-based setting in which neural networks are interpreted provides a convenient way of expressing knowledge in a transparent and modular manner and at a desired level of granularity (specificity). In this study, we formulate a certain engineering-based style of interpretation in which a given neural network is represented as a collection of local linear models where such models are developed around a collection of linearization nodes. The notion of multi-linearization of neural networks captures the essence of the proposed interpretation. We formulate the problem as an optimization of (i) a collection of linearization nodes around which individual linear models are formed and (ii) aggregation of the individual linearizations, where the linearization fields are subject to optimization. Given the non-differentiable character of the problem, we consider the use of population-based optimization of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). Numeric experiments are provided to illustrate the main aspects of the multi-linearization of neural networks. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.
