It possesses many desirable properties for interconnection networks. In this paper, we study fault-tolerant embedding of paths in twisted cubes. Let TQ(n)(V, E) denote the n-dimensional twisted cube. We prove that a path of length I can be embedded between any two distinct nodes with dilation 1 for any faulty set F subset of V(T Q(n)) boolean OR E(T Q(n)) with \\F\\ <= n - 3 and any integer l with 2(n-1) - 1 <= l <= \\V (T Q(n) - F)\\-1 (n >= 3). This result is optimal in the sense that the embedding has the smallest dilation 1. The result is also complete in the sense that the two bounds on path length l and faulty set size \\F\\ for a successful embedding are tight. That is, the result does not hold if l <= 2(n-1) - 2 or \\F\\ >= n - 2. We also extend the result on (n - 3) -Hamiltonian connectivity of T Q(n) in the literature. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
