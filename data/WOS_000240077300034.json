For the case where all requested pages have the same length, we present an online deterministic algorithm named BAR and prove that it is 4.56competitive. This improves the previous algorithm of Kim and Chwa [11] which is shown to be 5-competitive by Chan et al. [4]. In the case that pages may have different lengths, we prove a lower bound of Omega(Delta/log Delta) on the competitive ratio where Delta is the ratio of maximum to minimum page lengths. This improves upon the previous root Delta lower bound in [11,4] and is much closer to the current upper bound of (Delta + 2 root Delta + 2) in [7]. Furthermore, for small values of A we give better lower bounds.", "paper_title": "Improved on-line broadcast scheduling with deadlines", "paper_id": "WOS:000240077300034"}
