First, the client end samples and redisplays the handwritten text by using digital ink technics, segments handwritten characters, edits them and saves original handwritten information into a self-defined document. The self-defined document saves coordinates of all sampled points of handwriting characters. Second, the server recognizes handwritten document based on the proposed Gabor feature extraction and affinity propagation clustering (GFAP) method, and returns the recognition results to client end. Moreover, the server can also collect the labeled handwritten characters and fine tune the recognizer automatically. Experimental results on HIT-OR3C database show that our handwriting recognition method improves the recognition performance remarkably.", "paper_title": "Handwritten Chinese text editing and recognition system", "paper_id": "WOS:000339387000018"}
