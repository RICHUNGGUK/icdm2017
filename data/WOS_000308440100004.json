The authors already proposed a hierarchical visual motion retrieval system that runs on the web. Also the authors proposed motion features used for motion similarity calculations in the system. However, this system has not supported distributed motion databases because there is a problem that motion data transmission cost between client personal computer and database servers is very high. This time, the authors solved the problem by employing motion data compression to reduce the transmission cost. In this paper, the authors propose this extended version of a motion retrieval system that supports distributed motion databases. The authors also indicate the usefulness of the system by showing experimental results of user evaluations. The experimental results indicate that the proposed system is effective for retrieving motion data from a motion database including many motions more than one thousand.", "paper_title": "Hierarchical visual motion retrieval system for distributed motion DB and its user experiments", "paper_id": "WOS:000308440100004"}
