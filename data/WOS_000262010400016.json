They are the means. the variances, and the perturbations of the higher-order statistics (HOS) such as the skewness and the kurtosis. The HOS-based features show meaningful differences among normal. grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 voices, classified in the GRBAS scale. The jitter. the shimmer, the harmonic-to-noise ratio (HNR). and the variance of the short-time energy are utilized as the conventional features. The performances are measured by the classification and regression tree (CART) method. Specifically, the CART-based method by utilizing both the conventional features and the HOS-based ones shows its effectiveness in the pathological voice quality Measurement. with the classification accuracy of 87.8%.", "paper_title": "Objective Pathological Voice Quality Assessment Based on HOS Features", "paper_id": "WOS:000262010400016"}
