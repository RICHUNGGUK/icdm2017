In this paper the authors present such a tool, coupled with an approach to functional safety analysis, based on the integration of functional tests into the model itself. The analysis of the resulting model is done through a stochastic Bayesian model. This approach strives to both bypass the necessity for costly hardware testing and integrate the functional safety analysis into an intuitive component development process. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
