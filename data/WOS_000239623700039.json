This data alignment is the first step towards constructing an inferential batch-end quality sensor, capable of predicting 3 quality variables before batch run completion using a multivariate statistical partial least squares model. This inferential sensor provides on-line quality predictions, allowing corrective actions to be performed when the quality of the polymerization product does not meet the specifications, saving valuable production time and reducing operation cost.", "paper_title": "Data alignment via dynamic time warping as a prerequisite for batch-end quality prediction", "paper_id": "WOS:000239623700039"}
