A 16-bit processor with the appropriate number of input and output ports is implemented in all topologies and tile shapes. The hexagonal and five-sided processor tiles and arrays of tiles are laid out with industry standard automatic place and route design flow and Manhattan-style wires without full-custom layout. A 1080p H. 264/AVC residual video encoder and a 54 Mb/s 802.11a/g OFDM wireless local area network baseband receiver are mapped onto all topologies. The six-neighbor hexagonal tile incurs a 2.9% area increase per tile compared with the four-neighbor 2-D mesh, but its much more effective interprocessor interconnect yields an average total application area reduction of 22% and an average application power savings of 17%.", "paper_title": "Processor Tile Shapes and Interconnect Topologies for Dense On-Chip Networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000337167600016"}
