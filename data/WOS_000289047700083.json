This paper studies the DEA models with type-2 data variations. In order to deal with the existed type-2 fuzziness, we propose the mean reduction methods for type-2 fuzzy variables. Based on the mean reductions of the type-2 fuzzy inputs and outputs, we formulate a new class of fuzzy generalized expectation DEA models. When the inputs and outputs are mutually independent type-2 triangular fuzzy variables, we discuss the equivalent parametric forms for the constraints and the generalized expectation objective, where the parameters characterize the degree of uncertainty of the type-2 fuzzy coefficients so that the information cannot be lost via our reduction method. For any given parameters, the proposed model becomes nonlinear programming, which can be solved by standard optimization solvers. To illustrate the modeling idea and the efficiency of the proposed DEA model, we provide one numerical example. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
