Since architectures based on networked servers seems to be not scalable enough to support massively multiplayer applications, peer-to-peer (P2P) architectures have been proposed as an efficient and truly scalable solution for this kind of systems. However, the main challenge of P2P architectures consists of providing each avatar with updated information about which other avatars are its neighbors. We have denoted this problem as the awareness problem. Although some proposals have been made, none of them provide total awareness to avatars under any situation. This paper presents a new awareness method based on unicast communication that is capable of providing awareness to 100% of avatars, regardless of both their location and their movement pattern in the virtual world. Therefore, it allows large scale DVEs based on P2P architectures to properly scale with the number of users while fully providing awareness to all of them.", "paper_title": "Providing full awareness to distributed virtual environments based on peer-to-peer architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000239486600029"}
