We analyze the run time of these algorithms and consider several related problems, including the computation of two-sided ideal classes, isomorphism classes of orders, connecting ideals for orders, and ideal principalization. We conclude by giving the complete list of definite Eichler orders with class number at most 2.", "paper_title": "ALGORITHMIC ENUMERATION OF IDEAL CLASSES FOR QUATERNION ORDERS", "paper_id": "WOS:000277584700002"}
