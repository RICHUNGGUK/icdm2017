In this work, we focus on the estimation of the 3-D Euclidean shape and motion of a non-rigid shape observed by a perspective camera. In such case deformation and perspective effects are difficult to decouple - the parametrization of the 3-D non-rigid body may mistakenly account for the perspective distortion. Our method relies on the fact that it is often a reasonable assumption that some of the points on the object's surface are deforming throughout the sequence while others remain rigid. Thus, relying on the rigidity constraints of a subset of rigid points, we estimate the perspective to metric upgrade transformation. First, we use an automatic segmentation algorithm to identify the set of rigid points. These are then used to estimate the internal camera calibration parameters and the overall rigid motion. Finally, we formulate the problem of non-rigid shape and motion estimation as a non-linear optimization where the objective function to be minimized is the image reprojection error. The prior information that some of the points in the object are rigid can also be added as a constraint to the non-linear minimization scheme in order to avoid ambiguous configurations. We perform experiments on different synthetic and real data sets which show that even when using a minimal set of rigid points and when varying the intrinsic camera parameters it is possible to obtain reliable metric information.
