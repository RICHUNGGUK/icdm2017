Despite the promising model and hype surrounding, security has become the major concern that people hesitate to transfer their applications to clouds. Concretely, cloud platform is under numerous attacks. As a result, it is definitely expected to establish a firewall to protect cloud from these attacks. However, setting up a centralized firewall for a whole cloud data center is infeasible from both performance and financial aspects. In this paper, we propose a decentralized cloud firewall framework for individual cloud customers. We investigate how to dynamically allocate resources to optimize resources provisioning cost, while satisfying QoS requirement specified by individual customers simultaneously. Moreover, we establish novel queuing theory based model M/Geo/1 and M/Geo/m for quantitative system analysis, where the service times follow a geometric distribution. By employing Z-transform and embedded Markov chain techniques, we obtain a closed-form expression of mean packet response time. Through extensive simulations and experiments, we conclude that an M/Geo/1 model reflects the cloud firewall real system much better than a traditional M/M/1 model. Our numerical results also indicate that we are able to set up cloud firewall with affordable cost to cloud customers.", "paper_title": "A Decentralized Cloud Firewall Framework with Resources Provisioning Cost Optimization", "paper_id": "WOS:000349769500001"}
