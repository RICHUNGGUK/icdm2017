The approach reduces feasible solution space using the DM's preferences. Hypothetical solutions called partition ideals (PIs) that dominate portions of the efficient frontier are generated and those that are inferior to a feasible solution are used to eliminate the dominated regions. We investigate the issues in representation of the reduced feasible solution space. We develop procedures for locating PIs and measuring the size of feasible solution space. We incorporate these ideas into an approach that converges to a neighborhood of the most preferred solution of the DM. We demonstrate the approach on an example problem.", "paper_title": "AN INTERACTIVE PARTITIONING APPROACH FOR MULTIOBJECTIVE DECISION MAKING UNDER A GENERAL MONOTONE UTILITY FUNCTION", "paper_id": "WOS:000325419500006"}
