In this paper we describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a spatially aware search engine which is capable of handling queries in the form of the triplet of < theme > < spatial relationship > < location >. The process of identifying geographic references in documents and assigning appropriate footprints to documents, to be stored together with document terms in an appropriate indexing structure allowing real-time search, is described. Methods allowing users to query and explore results which have been relevance-ranked in terms of both thematic and spatial relevance have been implanted and a usability study indicates that users are happy with the range of spatial relationships available and intuitively understand how to use such a search engine. Normalised precision for 38 queries, containing four types of spatial relationships, is significantly higher (p < 0.001) for searches exploiting spatial information than pure text search.", "paper_title": "The design and implementation of SPIRIT: a spatially aware search engine for information retrieval on the internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000248222800001"}
