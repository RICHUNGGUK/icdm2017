To conduct such assessments, it has been recognized that mathematical model observers are very useful, particularly for purposes of imaging system development and optimization. One type of model observer that has been widely applied in the medical imaging community is the channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), which is well-suited to known-location discrimination tasks. In the present work, we address the need for reliable confidence interval estimators of CHO performance. Specifically, we show that the bias associated with point estimates of CHO performance can be overcome by using confidence intervals proposed by Reiser for the Mahalanobis distance. In addition, we find that these intervals are well-defined with theoretically-exact coverage probabilities, which is a new result not proved by Reiser. The confidence intervals are tested with Monte Carlo simulation and demonstrated with two examples comparing X-ray CT reconstruction strategies. Moreover, commonly-used training/testing approaches are discussed and compared to the exact confidence intervals.
