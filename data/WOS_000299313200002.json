Moreover, confidential information is becoming increasingly integrated into complex info-innovation solutions and is accordingly exposed to novel means of manipulation and theft. The legal requirements concerning information security (IS) policies in organizations are mainly based on reactive approaches that follow the standards applied in this area and are regularly updated every few years.
