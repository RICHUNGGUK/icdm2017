The objective of these methods is to minimize the error of deviating from the nuclear overhauser effect (NOE) distance constraints. However, the corresponding objective function is highly nonconvex and, consequently, difficult to optimize. Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) methods based on semidefinite programming (SDP) provide a natural framework for these problems. However, the high complexity of SDP solvers and the often noisy distance constraints provide major challenges to this approach. The main contribution of this article is a new SDP formulation for the EDM approach that overcomes these two difficulties. We model the protein as a set of intersecting two-and three-dimensional cliques. Then, we adapt and extend a technique called semidefinite facial reduction to reduce the SDP problem size to approximately one quarter of the size of the original problem. The reduced SDP problem can be solved approximately 100 times faster, and it is also more resistant to numerical problems from erroneous and inexact distance bounds.", "paper_title": "Determining Protein Structures from NOESY Distance Constraints by Semidefinite Programming", "paper_id": "WOS:000317178900003"}
