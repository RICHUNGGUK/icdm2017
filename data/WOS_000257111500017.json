For an arbitrary such channel, we give multiletter characterizations of two different two-dimensional capacity regions. The first region comprises the rates at which it is possible for one sender to send classical information, while the other sends quantum information. The second region consists of the rates at which each sender can send quantum information. For each region, we give an example of a channel for which the corresponding region has a single-letter description. One of our examples relies on a new result proved here, perhaps of independent interest, stating that the coherent information over any degradable channel is concave in the input density operator. We conclude with connections to other work and a discussion on generalizations where each user simultaneously sends classical and quantum information.", "paper_title": "Capacity theorems for quantum multiple-access channels: Classical-quantum and quantum-quantum capacity regions", "paper_id": "WOS:000257111500017"}
