Using the credibilistic expected value and the credibilistic lower semivariance of fuzzy variables, this paper proposes both the credibilistic return index and the credibilistic risk index, which are measures of investment return and investment risk with annuity form for evaluating single project. Moreover, a composite risk-return index for selecting the optimal investment strategy is also presented. Then, we set up a general project portfolio optimization model with fuzzy returns and two specific models: triangle and interval fuzzy returns. Furthermore, we provide two algorithms: the improved heuristic rules based on genetic algorithm and the traversal algorithm. Finally, two numerical examples are presented to illustrate the efficiency and the effectiveness of these proposed optimization methods. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
