The gain matrix is obtained by considering the energy of the structure. To compare the efficiency of the proposed method, a three-storey building with two active tendons in the first and third floors is considered. The proposed gain selection and other techniques reported in the literature for LQR controllers are used to compare the response of the structure for three accelograms. A comparison of the displacement and control forces illustrates the superiority of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Active control of structures using energy-based LQR method", "paper_id": "WOS:000240349700005"}
