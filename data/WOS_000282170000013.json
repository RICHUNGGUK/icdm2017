Validation was based on the recently available and annotated large maize chromosome one. Results show a considerable improvement in the annotation of Sireviruses, and support our approach as an important addition to the bioinformatics toolbox of plant biologists.", "paper_title": "MASiVE: Mapping and Analysis of SireVirus Elements in plant genome sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000282170000013"}
