Unreliable failure detectors (FDs) are classical mechanisms that provide information about process failures and can help systems to cope with the high dynamics of these networks. A number of failure detection algorithms have been proposed so far. Nonetheless, most of them assume a global knowledge about the membership as well as a fully communication connectivity; additionally, they are time-based, requiring that eventually some bound on the message transmission will permanently hold. These assumptions are no longer appropriate to the new scenario. This paper presents a new FD protocol that implements a new class of detectors, namely S-M, which adapts the properties of the S class to a dynamic network with an unknown membership. It has the interesting feature of being time-free, so that it does not rely on timers to detect failures; moreover, it tolerates the mobility of nodes and message losses.", "paper_title": "Eventually Strong Failure Detector with Unknown Membership", "paper_id": "WOS:000311905200007"}
