These notions are motivated by DNA strand design where Watson-Crick complementarity can be formalized as an antimorphic involution. We investigate closure properties of these codes, as well as necessary conditions for theta-solid codes to be maximal. We show how the concept of theta-join can be utilized such that codes that are not themselves theta-comma free can be split into a union of subcodes that are theta-comma free.", "paper_title": "Involution Solid and Join codes", "paper_id": "WOS:000262367100007"}
