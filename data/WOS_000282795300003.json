However, wrong correspondences or the so-called outliers are still rather inevitable, especially in urban environments with the presence of repetitive structures, and/or a large dissimilarity in viewpoints. In this paper, we propose a verification model to optimize the image matching results by significantly reducing the number of outliers. Several geometric and appearance-based measurements are exploited, and conditional probability is used to compute the probability of each true correspondence. The model is validated by extensive experiments on images from the ZuBud database, which are taken in different weather conditions, seasons, and with different cameras. It is also demonstrated on a real-time application of an image-based navigation system.
