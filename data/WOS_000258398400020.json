It has recently been found in the dynamics of qubits where each time step is conditioned on a measurement result on part of the system. We analyse the simplest case of one qubit dynamics with one complex parameter in some detail. We point out that two attractive cycles can exist and provide examples how the fractal like Julia set divides the areas of corresponding initial states. We show how to determine the set of parameters for which one, two or no stable fixed cycles exists and provide the numerically calculated images of the sets. The results can be relevant for the quantum state purification protocol based on the similar dynamics of two or more qubits and in general for any protocol based on conditioned nonlinear dynamics where truly chaotic behavior may occur.", "paper_title": "Properties of complex chaos in conditional qubit dynamics", "paper_id": "WOS:000258398400020"}
