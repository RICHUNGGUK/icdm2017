Notably, a most prevalent B-Raf(v600e) mutant in Raf kinase family exhibits elevated kinase activity and results in constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway, thus making it a promising drug target for cancer therapy. Herein, virtual screening is applied to identify its potential inhibitors. Following the 25 ns molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, ZINC38541768, ZINC38541767, and ZINC12496469 are identified as B-Raf(v600e) potential inhibitors in a DFG- in conformation. Furthermore, according to the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) method, these three small molecules exhibit similar and good binding affinity toward B-Raf(v600e) (-38.76 kcal mol(-1), -42.60 kcal mol(-1), and -39.04 kcal mol(-1)). At the same time, several critical residues, such as I463, V471 in the P-loop, and DFG motif residue D594 within the A-loop, are also well clarified. All these results may not only indicate some future applications of inhibitors targeting B-Raf(v600e), but also benefit B-Raf(v600e) harboring cancer patients.", "paper_title": "In silico identification of novel kinase inhibitors by targeting B-Raf(v660e) from natural products database", "paper_id": "WOS:000373564100005"}
