However, we show that in Liu and Wang's scheme, after several generations, the adversary is able to launch a successful forgery attack with a high probability. Therefore, Liu and Wang's scheme is not secure. After analyzing the cause of the attack, an improved scheme is given, which can combat against the proposed attack in an efficient way.
