It includes several efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for evaluating the posterior of genetic architectures, i.e. the number and locations of QTL, their main and epistatic effects and gene-environment interactions. R/qtlbim provides extensive informative graphical and numerical summaries, and model selection and convergence diagnostics of the MCMC output, illustrated through the vignette, example and demo capabilities of R (R Development Core Team 2006).
