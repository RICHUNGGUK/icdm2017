This construction is usually done by hand, and deep knowledge of the game and much time to tune them are needed for the construction. To avoid these difficulties, automatic construction of the functions is useful. In this paper, we propose a new method to generate features for evaluation functions automatically based on game records. Evaluation features are built, on simple features based on their frequency and mutual information. As an evaluation, we constructed evaluation functions for mate problems in shogi. The evaluation function automatically generated with several thousand evaluation features showed the accuracy of 74% in classifying positions into mate and non-mate.", "paper_title": "Automatic construction of static evaluation functions for computer game players", "paper_id": "WOS:000241631200037"}
