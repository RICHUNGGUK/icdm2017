This reliance on the network has increased the breadth of consumers of network status information while the increasing complexity of networks has expanded the diversity of the producers of this information. To enable this wide variety of producers and consumers to effectively interoperate, relevant standards are paramount. In this paper, we present a general model used to represent both network measurements collected from performance tools as well as describing the physical and logical characteristics of the underlying network. This system is currently being standardized in the Open Grid Forum to enable other uses within the wider grid and distributed computing community (Open Grid Forum, http://www.ogf.org/).
