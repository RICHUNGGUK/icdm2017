This is facilitated by the comprehensive inspection capabilities virtual prototypes offer. For virtual prototypes, execution speed is crucial to support the users' productivity. Parallel simulation techniques are employed to offset the speed impact of the increasing number of cores that need to be simulated in virtual prototypes of parallel and embedded systems. SystemC is the de facto industry standard library for virtual platform modeling. Since currently no parallel SystemC library is commonly available, typical SystemC models are coded for execution in sequential simulation environments. Simply putting such models into parallel simulators may lead to thread-safety issues and may additionally cause nondeterministic simulator behavior. This article proposes a methodology to support simulation creators to face the challenge of integrating such legacy models into parallel SystemC environments. The feasibility of the proposed method is evaluated by parallelizing the latest instance of the EU FP7 project EURETILE embedded platform simulator. Using legaSCi, on four host processor cores a speedup of 2.13x is demonstrated, without having to change the individual models of the simulator.", "paper_title": "legaSCi: Legacy SystemC Model Integration into Parallel Simulators", "paper_id": "WOS:000346416300021"}
