Every positive integer N has a unique expansion N = b(0)q(0)+ b(1)q(1)+...+ b(m)q(m), where the digits b(i) are nonnegative integers with b(0) < a(1), b(i) = a(i+1) and such that b(i) = a(i+1) implies b(i-1) = 0, the so-called Ostrowski expansion of N to base alpha. On the other hand let c([ 0, x)) be the characteristic function of the half-open interval [0, x) and let D-N*((2)) (alpha): = root integral(0)(1) (Sigma(n=1)(N) c([0,x)) ({n alpha}) - Nx)(2) dx be the L-2-discrepancy of the sequence (n alpha) mod 1, where {y} denotes the fractional part of the real number y. In this paper, we give an explicit formula for D-N*((2)) (alpha) entirely in terms of the digits b(0),..., b(m). This formula enables one to compute the L-2-discrepancy in at most O(log(4) N) steps, where the O-constant does not depend on alpha, while in the classical formulae for the L-2-discrepancy N-2/2 calculation steps are necessary. The fastest algorithm so far was found by S. Heinrich [3] and works (for all sequences) in O(N log N) steps.", "paper_title": "An Explicit Formula for the L-2-discrepancy of (n alpha)-sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000235340000006"}
