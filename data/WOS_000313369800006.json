Considering the characteristics of multistage machining processes (MMPs), a measuring and sensing network (MSN) for analyzing product-quality and equipment-fault is proposed and its complexity is discussed. In order to establish this MSN, first, product machining form features, machining components, measuring and sensing elements are abstracted as different network nodes. The coupling relationships (such as evolving, locating, machining, inspecting and monitoring) between different nodes are mapped into network edges. Next, a level-by-level evolution model is presented to illustrate the formation procedure of establishing MSN. Then, combined with complex network theory, the related topological and physical properties are defined to analyze the MSN. Finally, a case study is put forward to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Complexity analysis of distributed measuring and sensing network in multistage machining processes", "paper_id": "WOS:000313369800006"}
