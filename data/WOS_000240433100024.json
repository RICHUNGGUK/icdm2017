Versatile software tools for interactively displaying and analyzing these networks are therefore very much in demand. The public-domain open software environment Cytoscape has been developed with the goal of facilitating the design and development of such software tools by the scientific community. Results: We present GenePro, a plugin to Cytoscape featuring a set of versatile tools that greatly facilitates the visualization and analysis of protein networks derived from high-throughput interactions data and the validation of various methods for parsing these networks into meaningful functional modules.", "paper_title": "GenePro: a cytoscape plug-in for advanced visualization and analysis of interaction networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000240433100024"}
