This is often done by questionnaires (also called instruments or scales) or by interviews. This subjectivity of the diagnostic decision-making process may limit the reliability of diagnosis. In the present study, a new method of scale relevance, based on double cluster analysis, is proposed as it is important to verify what we are trying to find with the proposed scale. If two data sets cluster differently, we must consider them as different. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
