In greedy methods, the system aims to return the most relevant images for a query at each iteration. in planned methods, the most informative images are returned during a few iterations and the most relevant ones are only presented afterward. In the past, we proposed a greedy approach based on optimum-path forest classification (OPF) and demonstrated its gain in effectiveness with respect to a planned method based on support-vector machines and another greedy approach based on multi-point query. In this work, we introduce a planned approach based on the OFF classifier and demonstrate its gain in effectiveness over all methods above using more image databases. In our tests, the most informative images are better obtained from images that are classified as relevant, which differs from the original definition. The results also indicate that both OPF-based methods require less user involvement (efficiency) to satisfy the user's expectation (effectiveness), and provide interactive response times.
