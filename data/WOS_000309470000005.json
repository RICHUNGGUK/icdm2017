We show the set of Abelian primitive words is not context-free. We can determine whether a word is Abelian primitive in linear time (for fixed alphabet size). Also differently from classical primitive words, we find that a word may have more than one Abelian root. We also consider enumeration of Abelian primitive words.", "paper_title": "ABELIAN PRIMITIVE WORDS", "paper_id": "WOS:000309470000005"}
