In addition to the default Full-Search motion estimation of the MPEG-2 Test Model 5, fourteen fast ME algorithms were implemented in both scalar and vector form. Results demonstrate a reduction of up to 68% in the dynamic instruction count of the full search-based encoder whereas the fast motion estimation algorithms achieved a reduction in instruction count of nearly 90%, both accelerated via three 128-bit vector/SIMD instructions when compared to the scalar, reference implementation of the standard. We address in detail the profiling, vectorization and the development of these vector instruction set extensions, discuss in depth the implementation of a parametric vector accelerator that implements these instructions and show the introduction of that accelerator into a 32-bit RISC processor pipeline, in a closely-coupled configuration.
