The optimization of the topology of the embedded three-dimensional microvascular network is carried out by coupling a multi-objective constrained genetic algorithm with a finite-element based physics solver, the latter validated through experiments. The optimization is carried out on multiple conflicting objective functions, namely the void volume fraction left by the network, the energy required to drive the fluid through the network and the maximum temperature when the material is subjected to thermal loads. The methodology presented in this work results in a viable alternative for the multi-physics optimization of these materials for active-cooling applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.
