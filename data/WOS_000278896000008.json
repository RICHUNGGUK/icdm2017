The geometric patterns of the wear surface were first classified, then wear volume formulae were derived by integral calculus. SolidWorks(A (R)) software or published formulae were used to verify the accuracy of the proposed formulae. The analytical results showed that the wear shape of the liner can be categorized into seven wear patterns, including the special case of wear at 90A degrees, and the seven corresponding wear formulae were derived. In addition, wear of the cylindrical elongation might add considerably to the volume loss of the liner, depending on the height and shape of the elongation and the depth and direction of the linear penetration, being maximally 21% in the investigated model. The proposed wear formulae and patterns will be useful for more accurate performance evaluation of existing hip components implanted in patients and for the designing of new hip components.", "paper_title": "Wear patterns of, and wear volume formulae for, cylindrically elongated acetabular cup liners", "paper_id": "WOS:000278896000008"}
