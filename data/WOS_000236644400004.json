The software consists of data structures, application subroutine libraries and the built-in Matlab subroutine library. For each application, the user writes an application-specific main program using the data structures and routines in the subroutine libraries. This gives the user flexibility to build a main program that is adapted to the specific needs of the current application. The software has been tested in a number of real-world projects, e.g. tunnels and bridges. The examples show that the software is a useful design tool for design work.", "paper_title": "Development of software for structural analysis adapted to construction engineering applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000236644400004"}
