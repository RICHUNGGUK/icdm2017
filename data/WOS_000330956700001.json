To show the performance of our proposed MMC algorithm, 13 benchmark continuous optimization problems and the related results are compared with harmony search, improved harmony search, global-best harmony search and self-adaptative harmony search. The experimental results demonstrate that MMC improves the results obtained by the other metaheuristics in a set of multi-modal functions.", "paper_title": "An optimization algorithm inspired by musical composition", "paper_id": "WOS:000330956700001"}
