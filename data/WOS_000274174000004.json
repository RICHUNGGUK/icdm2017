A key idea is that the clients construct a logical peer-to-peer network and each of them determines the replacement of its own cache by taking into account access probabilities to data items from neighboring clients and the broadcast periods of data items or the times remaining until these items are broadcasted next. We confirm that the proposed strategies reduce the average response time by simulation experiments. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
