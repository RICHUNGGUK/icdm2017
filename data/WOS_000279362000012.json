We show that this algorithm has an approximation guarantee of 5 if the weights satisfy probability constraints ( for any pair of vertices u and v, w(uv) + w(vu) = 1). Special cases of the feedback arc set problem in such weighted tournaments include the feedback arc set problem in unweighted tournaments and rank aggregation. To complement the upper bound, for any constant epsilon > 0, we exhibit an infinite family of ( unweighted) tournaments for which the aforesaid algorithm ( irrespective of how ties are broken) has an approximation ratio of 5 - epsilon.", "paper_title": "Ordering by Weighted Number of Wins Gives a Good Ranking for Weighted Tournaments", "paper_id": "WOS:000279362000012"}
