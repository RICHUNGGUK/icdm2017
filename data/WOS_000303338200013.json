Consequently, easy-to-use software tools are required to process data from these studies, for example, using exon and junction arrays. Here, we introduce JETTA, an integrated software package for the calculation of gene expression indices as well as the identification and visualization of alternative splicing events. We demonstrate the software using data of human liver and muscle samples hybridized on an exon-junction array.", "paper_title": "JETTA: junction and exon toolkits for transcriptome analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000303338200013"}
