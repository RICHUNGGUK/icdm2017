In this work, we present a methodology to speed up the High Throughput Screening (HTS) process, by allowing focused screens or for hitlist triaging when a prohibitively large number of hits is identified in the primary screen, where we have extended the principle of consensus scoring in a nonlinear neural network manner. This led us to introduce a nonlinear Generalist scoring Function, GFscore, which was trained to discriminate true positives from false positives in a data set of diverse chemical compounds. This original Generalist scoring Function is a combination of the five scoring functions found in the CScore package from Tripos Inc. GFscore eliminates up to 75% of molecules, with a confidence rate of 90%. The final result is a Hit Enrichment in the list of molecules to investigate during a research campaign for biological active compounds where the remaining 25% of molecules would be sent to in vitro screening experiments. GFscore is therefore a powerful tool for the biologist, saving both time and money.", "paper_title": "GFscore: A general nonlinear consensus scoring function for high-throughput docking", "paper_id": "WOS:000239204400018"}
