The approximation algorithm is used to transform the optimum aggregation tree into NP-C problem to solve the smallest Steiner tree. Then the cluster-based optimising directed diffusion routing is adopted to construct aggregation tree for data fusion. At the fusion phase, we introduce consensus factor to support degree matrix, to replace original constant factor and provide more weight effect for reliable sensor. The improved support degree matrix will measure the support degree of each sensor to form a novel weighted fusion algorithm. The analyses on simulation show that our fusion algorithm can make data fusion effectively, which also has higher performance in delay, energy and accuracy.", "paper_title": "Low energy WSN data aggregation algorithm based on improved aggregation tree model", "paper_id": "WOS:000345236900002"}
