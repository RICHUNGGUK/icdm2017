To describe timbre, the temporal dynamics is an important component as well as the widely used spectral envelope. In this paper, we present new temporal dynamics similarity measures, which will prove valuable for the recognition of timbral patterns. These similarity measures are evaluated, first alone, then in conjunction with spectral envelope similarity measures, for both single tones and solo recordings. Results are provided, showing that the new temporal dynamics features significantly improve timbral pattern recognition. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
