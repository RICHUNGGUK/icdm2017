In this paper, two semantic-based self-organized algorithms aimed at taxonomy hierarchy semantic space are proposed, which can dynamically partition the network into distinct semantic clusters according to network load, with semantic relationship among data within a cluster and load balance among clusters all well maintained. The experiment indicates good performance and scalability of these two clustering algorithms.", "paper_title": "A self-organized semantic clustering approach for super-peer networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241624200043"}
