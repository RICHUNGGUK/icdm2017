Therefore, every task has to be schedulable under the chosen scheduling policy, and estimates of tasks' worst-case execution times must be conservative in case a task runs longer than is usual. To address the significant underutilization of a system's resources under normal operating conditions that can arise from these assumptions, several mixed-criticality scheduling approaches have been proposed. However, to date, there have been few quantitative comparisons of system schedulability or runtime overhead for the different approaches. In this article, we present a side-by-side implementation and evaluation of the known mixed-criticality scheduling approaches, for periodic and sporadic mixed-criticality tasks on uniprocessor systems, under a mixed-criticality scheduling model that is common to all these approaches. To make a fair evaluation of mixed-criticality scheduling, we also address previously open issues and propose modifications to improve particular approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that user-space implementations of mechanisms to enforce different mixed-criticality scheduling approaches can be achieved atop Linux without kernel modification, with reasonably low (but in some cases nontrivial) overhead for mixed-criticality real-time task sets.", "paper_title": "Implementation and Evaluation of Mixed-Criticality Scheduling Approaches for Sporadic Tasks", "paper_id": "WOS:000341390100009"}
