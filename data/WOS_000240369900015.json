In the simulations, the solid particle is modeled by a droplet with strong interfacial tension and large viscosity. The van der Waals attraction force is taken into account for the interaction between the particles. The ratio of the hydrodynamic drag force to cohesive force, I, is introduced, and the effect of I on the aggregate deformation and breakup in shear flows is investigated. It is found that the aggregate is easier to deform and to be dispersed when I is over 100. (c) 2006 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
