Such an approach takes advantage of a particular communication model called Semantic Triangle in which communication agents share the referents (real world objects) and not the concepts (mental image or impression of a real object from the sender agents point of view), thus ensuring an effective semantic interoperability in the information exchange process. The proposed approach has been submitted to an experiment that involved an instantiation of the communication process based on semantic machines and showed the approach feasibility for the semantic information exchange and its effectiveness.", "paper_title": "A NOVEL APPROACH FOR SEMANTIC INTEROPERABILITY IN THE WEB BASED ON THE SEMANTIC TRIANGLE COMMUNICATION MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000299173500006"}
