Applying techniques of spectrum sharing in CR networks can achieve the efficient utilization of network resources. Usually, data rates of user sessions are time varied because of the dynamic behaviors of CR networks. It is expected that the occurrence of link outage should be avoided and incorporated into the routing design under conditions of increasingly crowded spectrum. This paper proposes an integral framework, which considers these two correlated schemes (resource reconfiguration and robust routing) simultaneously. For that, the resource reconfiguration scheme is developed for the efficient usage of network resources and aims at reducing the occupancy of licensed bands. The link outage, resulting from random session rate, is confined within an acceptable range by using strategy of virtual network portfolio'. A robust optimization approach is proposed to guarantee reliable data transmission among possible interfering links. Both these two items (resource reconfiguration and robust routing) are formulated in a framework of cross-layer optimization. The evolutionary process of CR network states is provided in simulations, where the results show that the joint design proposal can achieve the least interferences among different licensed users while realizing robust routing.
