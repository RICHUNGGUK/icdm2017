For this system, we introduce a scheme using a side-information from a special node. The information is used as an encryption key so that the detectable region of the key defines a privacy zone. We implement the scheme on the basis of IEEE 802.15.4 and realize the world's first ambient network platform with the above functionality. An experiment and demonstration show the effectiveness of the proposed system.", "paper_title": "Realization of Secure Ambient Wireless Network System Based on Spatially Distributed Ciphering Function", "paper_id": "WOS:000327167400016"}
