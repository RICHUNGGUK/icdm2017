The one-sided scaffold filling problem can be described as given an incomplete genome I and a complete (reference) genome G, fill the missing genes into I such that the number of common (string) adjacencies between the resulting genome I' and G is maximized. This problem is NP-complete for genome with duplicated genes and the best known approximation factor is 1.33, which uses a greedy strategy. In this paper, we prove a better lower bound of the optimal solution, and devise a new algorithm by exploiting the maximum matching method and a local improvement technique, which improves the approximation factor to 1.25. For genome with gene repetitions, this is the only known NP-complete problem which admits an approximation with a small constant factor (less than 1.5).", "paper_title": "An Improved Approximation Algorithm for Scaffold Filling to Maximize the Common Adjacencies", "paper_id": "WOS:000328640700009"}
