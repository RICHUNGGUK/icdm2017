This paper analyses how effective the positive data sharing scheme will be and examines whether any other personal credit attributes can serve the same purpose. In our work, a survey was conducted to verify industry's perception on what attributes was essential for credit risk assessment. The result was compared with the implication from the neuro-fuzzy data mining on real transaction data. The comparison suggests that the perception on positive data is not absolutely correct and the positive data sharing cannot always achieve its purposes.", "paper_title": "The effectiveness of positive data sharing in controlling the growth of indebtedness in Hong Kong credit card industry", "paper_id": "WOS:000236545100025"}
