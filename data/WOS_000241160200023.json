Focusing on the case of the e-government local partnership in the County of Surrey in the United Kingdom, I analyse the characteristics and the development through time of the networking activity, using the theoretical framework provided by the literature on policy networks. By analysing data collected from primary sources, including focused interviews, I show the changes occurred in the partnership networking for local e-government policy, and point out some independent variables for explaining them. I conclude suggesting new directions of research on the topic.", "paper_title": "Local networking for e-services: A UK case study", "paper_id": "WOS:000241160200023"}
