The finite element method and a linear quadratic regulator are used to study the electro-mechanical behaviour and the gain calculation. Due to the discrete nature of the problem, a simple binary Genetic algorithm is used as an optimization tool. Three examples are presented related to the optimal allocation based on Lyapunov functional. The PSD (Power Spectral Density) of the state space variables as well as input voltages are presented in order to identify the controlled modes and to show the effective attenuation obtained due to control of specific modes.
