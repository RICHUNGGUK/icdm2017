This problem lies at the heart of several problems in quantum computation and information, such as the complexity of QMA(2). While the problem is NP-hard, our algorithms are better than brute force for several instances of interest. In particular, they give PSPACE upper bounds on promise problems admitting a QMA(2) protocol in which the verifier performs only a logarithmic number of elementary gates on both proofs, as well as the promise problem of deciding if a bipartite local Hamiltonian has a large or small ground energy. For Q >= 0, our algorithm runs in time exponential in parallel to Q parallel to(F). While the existence of such an algorithm was first proved recently by Brandao, Christandl and Yard (2011) [8], our algorithm is conceptually simpler. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
