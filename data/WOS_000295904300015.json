In this regard, different architectural frameworks have been developed, i.e., IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS). Push to Multimedia (PTM) is one of the main services provided by the IMS based Next Generation Networks (NGN). It is half duplex service that is controlled by a centralized server and allows the users to communicate by using push technology. Currently, in PTM, message sent by one user will be received by all the other members of the group. The sender has no authority to send its information to the selected members of the PTM group. This scenario limits the scope of the PTM in daily life and puts unnecessary load on the network. Moreover, in PTM, all the members of the group are allowed to send and receive all types of data, i.e., audio, video, text (triple play). There is no mechanism to limit the rights of a user in a PT M session. This mechanism increases the network load and reduces the scalability. In this paper, we proposed a new casting technique to deliver the information to selected users only. Moreover, we also proposed a mechanism to allocate different rights to the members of the same group. This solution reduces the network load and results in efficient utilization of resources. Moreover, this solution also increases the applicability of the PTM service in daily life. Scalability of the PTM group is also enhanced by the solution proposed in the paper.", "paper_title": "AN EXTENDED PUSH TO MULTIMEDIA SERVICE FOR IP MULTIMEDIA SUBSYSTEM", "paper_id": "WOS:000295904300015"}
