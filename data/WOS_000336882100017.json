The task is to decide if G can be transformed into a cluster graph, i.e., a disjoint union of cliques, by changing at most k adjacencies, i.e. by adding/deleting at most k edges. We give a subexponential-time parameterized algorithm that in time 2(O(root pk)) + n(O(1)) decides whether G can be transformed into a cluster graph with exactly p cliques by changing at most k adjacencies. Our algorithmic findings are complemented by the following tight lower bound on the asymptotic behavior of our algorithm. We show that unless ETH fails, for any constant 0 < sigma <= 1, there is p = Theta(k(sigma)) such that there is no algorithm deciding in time 2(o(root pk)) . n(O)(1) whether G can be transformed into a cluster graph with at most p cliques by changing at most k adjacencies.
