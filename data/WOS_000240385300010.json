But the high-order statistical relationship does play an important part in pattern recognition (classification) area. In order to take advantage of the high-order statistical relationship among variables of input samples in neural network, a novel independent radial basis function (IRBF) neural network is proposed in this paper. Then a new hybrid system combining multiresolution analysis, principal component analysis (PCA) and our proposed IRBF neural network is also proposed for face recognition. According to experiments on FERET face database, our proposed approach could outperform newly proposed ICA algorithm. And it is also confirmed that our proposed approach is more robust to facial expression, illumination and aging than ICA in face recognition.", "paper_title": "A novel model for independent radial basis function neural networks with multiresolution analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000240385300010"}
