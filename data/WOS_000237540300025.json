Triggering multiple applications on sensor networks at a post-deployment stage results into complex interactions between them. In this paper, we discuss considerations for multiservice sensor networks such as resource allocation and energy conservation. First, we identify the uniqueness of node selection strategies for such multi-service sensor networks. Second, we discuss their effects on network usability and longevity. We present a holistic nodes election protocol for such networks. Simulation results show increased longevity of networks when our protocol is implemented on the network.", "paper_title": "Binding multiple applications on wireless sensor networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000237540300025"}
