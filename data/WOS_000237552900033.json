These points are based on scale-space and catastrophe theory, and are invariant under gray value scaling and offset as well as scale-Euclidean transformations. The differential properties and noise characteristics of these points are mathematically well understood. It is possible to retrieve the exact location of a top-point from any coarse estimation through a closed-form vector equation which only depends on local derivatives in the estimated point. All these properties make top-points highly suitable as anchor points for invariant matching schemes. By means of a set of repeatability experiments and receiver-operator-curves we demonstrate the performance of top-points and differential invariant features as image descriptors.", "paper_title": "Top-points as interest points for image matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000237552900033"}
