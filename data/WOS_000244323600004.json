Because of this, the reuse of software components is becoming a normal practice for improving the productivity of the software programmers, and the quality of the products that they develop. The employment of reusable components presents a number of advantages, such as the reduction in time necessary to develop new software, or the simplification of many computational tasks. There are some proprietary software environments in the engineering domain that are practically de facto standards, since they offer a broad functionality, robustness and constant updating. Therefore, those environments could be ideal candidates to be reusable components when developing new software. An example of this is Matlab, which can be encapsulated, in order to use it as a true reusable component. This will provide the user with efficient tools for designing his/her own applications. Moreover, there is an increasing importance for any software to offer distributed services. To perform this task, it is fundamental to have at one's disposal reusable components that support Internet-based distributed applications and services development. In the present work, a software component framework that effectively encapsulates Matlab is described. This software allows developers the reuse of Matlab, for both local and distributed applications. To address those issues the NET technology was employed. The component framework developed can be integrated in the toolbars of software development environments supporting the NET framework. This facilitates the construction of applications that can reuse the components, since the software developers can use and test them and change their properties in design-time. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
