Specifically, suitable grasp configurations reducing gravitational and inertial effects during object manipulation, and minimizing and equally distributing the grasping forces among all the available fingers, must be computed. A new method for fast synthesis of multi-fingered grasp configurations is proposed in this paper. In particular, to reduce the computational complexity, all the regions of the object surface favoring the synthesis of minimal inertia grasps are evaluated first. Then, a reduced number of discrete grasping regions are selected on the basis of the fingertip size, model uncertainty, and surface curvature. Finally, an exhaustive search of the optimal grasp configurations with respect to the grasp quality is performed. Several case studies and comparisons with other methods are proposed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
