In this paper we focus on standards and methodologies for Grid platform within the context of the Remote Sensing Data Processing Grid Node (RSDPGN) that implements a loose-coupling parallel structure for orchestrating traditional remote sensing algorithms and software packages on the Condor platform. We have implemented 17 remote sensing applications in one system using Web service and work-flow technology without any change to traditional codes. Some core algorithm codes are come from a remote sensing software package which we has neither resource codes nor APIs. Others come from the program codes accumulated by our group. The design and prototype implementation of RSDPGN are presented. The advantage and shortage of loose-coupling structure is analysed. Through a case study of land surface temperature calculation from MODIS data, we demonstrate the way to modify software packages in details. Moreover we discuss the problems and solutions based on our experience such as system architecture, the kinds of functional modules, fast data transfer, and state monitoring.", "paper_title": "Remote sensing information processing grid node with loose-coupling parallel structure", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200123"}
