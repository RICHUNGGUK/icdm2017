Hence, how to recover failed requests caused by disaster with minimum spectrum resources is an important issue for network operators. In the past years, elastic optical networks provide a new way to reduce the spectrum consumption in optical networks. Based on the technology, bandwidth-adaptability protection with content connectivity (BCP) is proposed in this study. We first introduce the concept of BCP, which includes path calculation and spectrum allocation. For path calculation, working path and backup path employ links in different shared risk link groups to avoid disaster failure in optical networks. For spectrum allocation, modulation format of backup path is adjusted according to the requirement of point-to-content requests to reduce the spectrum consumption. Then, an integer linear program and two heuristic algorithms (BCP_KSP, BCP_MSP) are proposed for static and dynamic traffic scenarios, respectively. Simulation results show that, compared to traditional method without bandwidth adaptability, BCP has better performance in terms of spectrum resource utilization and blocking probability.", "paper_title": "Bandwidth-adaptability protection with content connectivity against disaster in elastic optical datacenter networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000361526700013"}
