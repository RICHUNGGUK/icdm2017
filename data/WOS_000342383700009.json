In this paper, this communication scenario is studied for compound channels, where it is only known to the transmitter and receivers that the actual channel realization is fixed and from a prespecified set of channels. The information theoretic criterion of strong secrecy is analyzed in detail and its impact on the decoding performance of the non-legitimate receiver is characterized. In particular, it is shown that regardless of the computational capabilities and the applied decoding strategy of the non-legitimate receiver, his decoding error always tends to one. This gives a valuable signal processing implication of the strong secrecy criterion and identifies desirable properties of an optimal code design. Further, an achievable strong secrecy rate region is derived and a multiletter outer bound is given. Both together yield a multiletter expression of the strong secrecy capacity region of the compound BCC.", "paper_title": "Robust Broadcasting of Common and Confidential Messages Over Compound Channels: Strong Secrecy and Decoding Performance", "paper_id": "WOS:000342383700009"}
