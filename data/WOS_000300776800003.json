The main aim in this paper is to derive a multi-channel sampling theory for the shift-invariant space V (phi). By using a type of Fourier duality between the spaces V (phi) and L-2[ 0, 2 pi] we find necessary and sufficient conditions allowing us to obtain stable multi-channel sampling expansions in V (phi).", "paper_title": "MULTI-CHANNEL SAMPLING ON SHIFT-INVARIANT SPACES WITH FRAME GENERATORS", "paper_id": "WOS:000300776800003"}
