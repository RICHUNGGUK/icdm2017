A new architecture that allows dynamic deployment of different TM functions is presented. By considering the processing requirements of operations such as policing and congestion, queuing, shaping, and scheduling, a solution has been derived that is scalable with a consistent programmable interface. Programmability is achieved using a function computation unit which determines the action (e. g., drop, queue, remark, forward) based on the packet attribute information and a memory storage part. Results of a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA reference design are presented.", "paper_title": "A Scalable and Programmable Modular Traffic Manager Architecture", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337300003"}
