The degradation is more in the case of an on-off keying (OOK) modulation scheme. The antenna aperture averaging method is used to improve system performance for different modulation schemes. With this method, it is found that improvement in system performance employing OOK modulation is higher as compared to subcarrier binary phase-shift keying and subcarrier quadrature phase-shift keying modulation schemes.
