Some threshold proxy signature schemes have been proposed up to data. But nearly all of them are under the certificate-based (CA-based) public key systems. In this paper, we put forward an identity-based (ID-based) threshold proxy signature scheme with known signers from bilinear pairings for the first time. Most of our constructions would be simpler but still with high security due to the properties of bilinear map built from Weil pairing or Tate pairing.", "paper_title": "Identity-based threshold proxy signature scheme with known signers", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800051"}
