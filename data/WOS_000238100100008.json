Our work mainly concerns in how to dynamically determine a protection cycle (i.e., two link-disjoint paths between a node pair) to establish a dependable lightpath with backup paths sharing. This problem is identified as NP-complete, thus a heuristic for finding near optimal solution with reasonable computation time is usually preferred. Inspired from the principle of ant colony optimization, we propose in this paper an ant-based mobile agents algorithm for this problem with improved blocking performance. To enable the new ant-based algorithm, we propose to use on each network node both a routing table that contains a set of feasible protection cycles between source destination nodes and also a pheromone table for mobile agents. By keeping a suitable number of mobile agents in a network to continually and proactively update the routing tables based on the current network congestion state, the routing solution of a connection request can be obtained with a reasonable computation time. Extensive simulation results upon the ns-2 network simulator and two typical network topologies show that our new algorithm can achieve a significantly lower blocking probability than the promising algorithm for dynamic lightpath protection proposed in [11] with a comparable computation complexity.", "paper_title": "Ant-based survivable routing in dynamic WDM networks with shared backup paths", "paper_id": "WOS:000238100100008"}
