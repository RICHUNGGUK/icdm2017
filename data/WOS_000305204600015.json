Ontology Engineering is the research field that provides the mechanisms to manage the life cycle of the ontologies. However, the process of building ontologies can be tedious and sometimes exhaustive. OWL-VisMod is a tool designed for developing ontological engineering based on visual analytics conceptual modeling for OWL ontologies life cycle management, supporting both creation and understanding tasks. This paper is devoted to evaluate OWL-VisMod through a set of defined tasks. The same tasks also will be done with the most known tool in Ontology Engineering, Protege, in order to compare the obtained results and be able to know how is OWL-VisMod perceived for the expert users. The comparison shows that both tools have similar acceptation scores, but OWL-VisMod presents better feelings regarding user's perception tasks due to the visual analytics influence.
