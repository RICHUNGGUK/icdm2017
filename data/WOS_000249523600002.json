Since the publication of the Liu and Layland bound, many researchers have tried to improve the schedulability bound of the RM scheduling. The LL bound does not make any assumption on the relationship between any of the task periods. In this paper we consider the relative period ratios in a system. By reducing the difference between the smallest and the second largest virtual period values in a system, we can show that the RM schedulability bound can be improved significantly. This research has also proposed a system design methodology to improve the schedulability of real time system with a fixed system load.", "paper_title": "Rate monotonic schedulability tests using period-dependent conditions", "paper_id": "WOS:000249523600002"}
