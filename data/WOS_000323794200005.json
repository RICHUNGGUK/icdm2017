The basic classifier is the Bootstrapped Dendritic Classifier (BDC), which combine the output of an ensemble of weak Dendritic Classifiers by majority voting. Weak Dendritic Classifiers are trained on bootstrapped samples of the train data setting a limit on the number of dendrites. We validate the approach on the segmentation of the thrombus in 3D Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) data of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) patients simulating the human oracle by the provided ground truth. The generalization results in terms of accuracy and true positive ratio of the classification of the entire volume by the classifier trained on one slice confirm that the approach is worth its consideration for clinical practice.
