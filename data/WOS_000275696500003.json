This model is flexible since it allows choosing several distinct criteria, such as content aboutness, coverage, novelty, trust, timeliness, and combining them by a soft aggregation to define a personalized filter. The personal filter is encoded into the user profile that also contains the representations of the user interests that can evolve over time. An implementation of the system applying a combination of the aboutness and coverage criteria has been evaluated and compared to other filtering systems, showing its superior effectiveness. Finally, the possible use of the other criterion is discussed.", "paper_title": "A flexible multi criteria information filtering model", "paper_id": "WOS:000275696500003"}
