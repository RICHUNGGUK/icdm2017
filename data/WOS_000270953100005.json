Simplified fuzzy if-then rules have been widely used in function approximation problems due to no complicated defuzzification is required. The proposed simplified fuzzy rule-based classification system, whose number of output is equal to the number of different classes, approximates an unknown mapping from input to desired output for each discriminant function. Not only a fuzzy data mining method is proposed to find simplified fuzzy if-then rules from training data, but also the genetic algorithm is employed to determine some user-specified parameters. To evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method, computer simulations are performed on some well-known datasets, showing that the generalization ability of the proposed method is comparable to the other fuzzy or nonfuzzy methods.", "paper_title": "MINING SIMPLIFIED FUZZY IF-THEN RULES FOR PATTERN CLASSIFICATION", "paper_id": "WOS:000270953100005"}
