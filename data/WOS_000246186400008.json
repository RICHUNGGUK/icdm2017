We develop a MAC protocol based on slotted ALOHA that allows neighbors of a transmitter to act as relays and forward a packet toward its final destination when the transmission to the intended recipient fails. The proposed technique provides additional robustness against fading, packet collisions and radio mobility. Network simulations confirm that under heavy traffic conditions, in which every radio always has packets to send, the proposed cooperative-diversity slotted-ALOHA protocol can provide a higher one-hop and end-to-end throughput than the standard slotted-ALOHA protocol can. A similar advantage in end-to-end delay can be obtained when the traffic is light. As a result, the proposed cooperative-diversity ALOHA protocol can be used to improve these measures of Quality of Service (QoS) in ad hoc wireless networks.", "paper_title": "Cooperative-diversity slotted ALOHA", "paper_id": "WOS:000246186400008"}
