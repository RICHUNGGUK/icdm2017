The models represent scattering from a wide range of glossy surface types with high accuracy. In particular, they enable representation of types of surface scattering which previous parametric models have had trouble modeling accurately. In a study of the scattering behavior of measured reflectance data, we investigate what key properties are needed for a model to accurately represent scattering from glossy surfaces. We investigate different parametrizations and how well they match the behavior of measured BRDFs. We also examine the scattering curves which are represented in parametric models by different distribution functions. Based on the insights gained from the study, the new models are designed to provide accurate fittings to the measured data. Importance sampling schemes are developed for the new models, enabling direct use in existing production pipelines. In the resulting renderings we show that the visual quality achieved by the models matches that of the measured data.", "paper_title": "BRDF Models for Accurate and Efficient Rendering of Glossy Surfaces", "paper_id": "WOS:000300622500009"}
