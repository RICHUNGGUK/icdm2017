When analyzing multilane traffic flow, it is important how we define lane-changing rules. However, conventional models have used simple lane-changing rules that are dependent only on the distance from neighboring vehicles. We propose a new lane-changing rule considering velocity differences with neighboring vehicles; in addition, we embed the rules into a variant of the Nagel-Schreckenberg (NaSch) model, called the S-NFS model, by considering an open boundary condition. Using numerical simulations, we clarify the basic characteristics resulting from different assumptions with respect to lane changing.", "paper_title": "ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF LANE CHANGING ON TRAFFIC-FLOW DYNAMICS BASED ON THE CELLULAR AUTOMATON MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000289467600005"}
