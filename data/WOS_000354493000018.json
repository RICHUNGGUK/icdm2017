This method can evaluate the quality of a video in real-time because less transmission bandwidth is required. Because the video active area attracts significant human eye attention, any deterioration in the active area will directly affect video evaluation results. Given the advantage of reduced reference model in VQM (Video Qualify Metric), this paper proposes a reduced reference evaluation model named RR-PEVQ (Reduced Reference Perceptual Evaluation of Video Quality) for weighting the active video area. According to the experimental results, the RR-PEVQ evaluation score is similar to that of the full reference PEVQ and the proposed method's practicability is greatly improved for big data purposes.", "paper_title": "The RR-PEVQ algorithm research based on active area detection for big data applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000354493000018"}
