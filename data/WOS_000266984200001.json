Simultaneously, the provision of survivability of WDM networks is important, because the transmission of huge data should be protected when a fiber fails. Thus, the combination of survivability and reconfiguration is an important issue in WDM networks. In this paper, the Virtual Topology Reconfiguration Problem (VTRP) in survivable WDM networks with a reconfiguration constraint is studied. Given the physical topology, dedicated path-protection VT, and a new traffic demand matrix, the goal of VTRP is to reconfigure the current VT under the pre-specified reconfiguration constraint so that the objective value can be minimized. The object cost of VTRP is the average weighted propagation delay (AWPD). Because designing a polynomial time algorithm to find the optimal solution of VTRP is impractical, in this paper, a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm and a genetic algorithm (GA) are proposed to solve this problem. Experimental results of these algorithms are also given.", "paper_title": "Solving virtual topology reconfiguration problem on survivable WDM networks by using simulated annealing and genetic algorithms", "paper_id": "WOS:000266984200001"}
