However, in order to enable the provisioning of real-time services, such as video delivery or voice conversations, in aggregate scheduling networks, end-to-end delay bounds for single flows are required. In this paper, we derive per-flow end-to-end delay bounds in aggregate scheduling networks in which per-egress (or sink-tree) aggregation is in place, and flows traffic is aggregated according to a FIFO policy. The derivation process is based on Network Calculus, which is suitably extended to this purpose. We show that the bound is tight by deriving the scenario in which it is attained. A tight delay bound can be employed for a variety of purposes: for example, devising optimal aggregation criteria and rate provisioning policies based on pre-specified flow delay bounds.
