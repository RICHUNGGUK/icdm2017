So, learning with unlabeled data has attracted much attention during the past few years. This paper shows that how such techniques can be helpful in a difficult task, content-based image retrieval, for improving the retrieval performance by exploiting images existing in the database.", "paper_title": "Learning with unlabeled data and its application to image retrieval", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500003"}
