We show that if a Pslg with n vertices can be augmented to a 3-edge-connected Pslg, then at most 2n-2 new edges are always sufficient and sometimes necessary for the augmentation. If the input Pslg is, in addition, already 2-edge-connected, then n-2 new edges are always sufficient and sometimes necessary for the augmentation to a 3-edge-connected Pslg.", "paper_title": "Augmenting the Edge Connectivity of Planar Straight Line Graphs to Three", "paper_id": "WOS:000296284800011"}
