The proposed scheme is based on a delay line and a polarization rotator; the phase-shift keying signal is first converted into a polarization shift keying signal. Then, this signal is converted into an intensity-modulated signal by a polarization beam splitter. Finally, the intensity-modulated signal is detected by balanced photodetectors. In order to demonstrate that our proposed receiver is suitable for using as a PM-DQPSK demodulator, a set of simulations have been performed. In addition to testing the sensitivity, the performance under various impairments, including narrow optical filtering, polarization mode dispersion, chromatic dispersion and polarization sensitivity, is analyzed. The simulation results show that our performance receiver is as good as a conventional receiver based on four delay interferometers. Moreover, in comparison with the typical receiver, fewer components are used in our receiver. Hence, implementation is easier, and total cost is reduced. In addition, our receiver can be easily improved to a bit-rate tunable receiver.", "paper_title": "A low-cost alternative scheme to detect a 100 Gbps PM-DQPSK signal", "paper_id": "WOS:000344002500001"}
