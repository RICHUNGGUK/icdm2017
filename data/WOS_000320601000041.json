To test the efficacy of this approach, a three-dimensional model of the breast organisms is numerically carried out by the FDTD method. The PML absorption boundary condition is developed in the computer system. The norm constrained capon beamforming (NCCB) algorithm is employed to create the weighting vector for the image reconstruction. The tumor with the size of 3 mm in diameter detected successfully in the reconstructed image demonstrates the robustness of the beamforming algorithm. The study verifies the feasibility of detecting the small breast tumors by using the NCCB imaging algorithm. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
