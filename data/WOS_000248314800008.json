We employ the polynomial kernel function and epsilon-Insensitive loss function for our support vector regression. To improve the accuracy of the estimation, rate and distortion related features are incorporated in the statistical learning framework. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve good performance, e.g., modelling the rate-distortion curves accurately.", "paper_title": "A rate and distortion analysis of multiscale binary shape coding based on statistical learning", "paper_id": "WOS:000248314800008"}
