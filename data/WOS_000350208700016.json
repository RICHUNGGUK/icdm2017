The nonmonotonic dependence of ROF-induced delay faults on the supply voltage (V-DD) poses a concern as to whether single-V-DD testing will suffice for low power nanometric designs. Our analysis shows multi-V-DD tests could be required, depending on the test speed. This knowledge can be exploited in small delay fault testing to reduce the chances of test escapes while minimizing cost.", "paper_title": "Resistive Open Faults Detectability Analysis and Implications for Testing Low Power Nanometric ICs", "paper_id": "WOS:000350208700016"}
