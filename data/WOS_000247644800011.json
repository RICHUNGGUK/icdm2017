In order to make the results of the system available even to users who are located away from the enterprise, it has been equipped with the possibility of remote access-a Web and telephony interface. The multiagent design of the ExtraPlanT makes the integration of these interfaces robust and simple. The telephony interface uses VoiceXML technology so that it can be built without extensive knowledge of speech processing. The interface also uses innovative techniques to overcome the common disadvantages of speech as a medium for machine output.", "paper_title": "An intelligent telephony interface of multiagent decision support systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000247644800011"}
