Convergence theorems of a sequence of Choquet integrals for set-valued mappings are shown. However, in the case of the monotone convergence theorem of the nonincreasing sequence of Choquet integrals for set-valued mappings, we point out that the integrands must be closed. Specially, this kind of real-valued Choquet integrals for set-valued mappings can be regarded as the Choquet integrals for single-valued functions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.
