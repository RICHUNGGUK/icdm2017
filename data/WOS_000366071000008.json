We attempt to develop an alternative approach based on a right-inverse of the robot Jacobian which is not the Moore-Penrose inverse with, as a goal, to generate closed-form and compact expressions of the joint velocities. Considering the definition of the determinant of a rectangular m x n matrix (m < n) as the sum of its m x m minors, and using the weak inverse proposed by the Indian mathematician Joshi we show that it is possible to derive a general expression of its projector onto null space. These mathematical tools are applied to a new approach for redundancy solving including optimization criteria and multiple task performance. It is also shown that the combinatorial explosion peculiar to the method for highly redundant robots can be controlled in the case of some classes of modular robotic structures. Simulation results are reported for the regional redundant structure of a 7R-robot arm and a 30 d.o.f. planar elephant trunk-like robot. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
