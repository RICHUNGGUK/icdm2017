By exploring the block correlation between the cover-image and the secret-image, the stego-image quality can be greatly improved. Experimental results demonstrate that the stego-image has a high peak signal-to-noise ratio and the stego-image is almost the same as the cover-image. (c) 2005 Pattern Recognition Society.
