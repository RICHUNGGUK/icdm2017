Determining the implied volatility is a typical PDE inverse problem. In this paper, we propose the total variation regularization model for determining the implied volatility and make a rigorous mathematical analysis for this inverse problem. We not only discuss the existence and uniqueness to the solution, but also give the necessary optimality conditions for the related minimization problem. Furthermore, the stability analysis for this regularized approach are presented.", "paper_title": "The total variation model for determining the implied volatility in option pricing", "paper_id": "WOS:000330603200010"}
