The knowledge of multiplicities, of the roots is critical for the topological coherence of the results. In this aim, we propose an original two-steps algorithm based on successive differentiations which separates any root (even multiple) and guarantees that the assumptions of Newton global convergence theorem are satisfied. The complexity is v(n(4)) but the algorithm can easily be parallelized. Experimental results show its efficiency when facing ill-conditioned polynomials. (c) 2007 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V.
