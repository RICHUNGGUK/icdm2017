In this study, we extended the Technology Acceptance Model to include technical support as a precursor and then investigated the role of the extended model in user acceptance of WebCT. Responses from 836 university students were used to test the proposed structural model. The data showed that technical support has a significant direct effect on perceived ease of use and usefulness, while perceived ease of use and usefulness are the dominant factors affecting the attitude of students using WebCT. The results indicate the importance of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in mediating the relationship of technical support with attitude and WebCT usage. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.
