We show that for every pair {x, y} of mutually opposite points of H-n, W can be written as a direct sum W-0 circle plus W-1 ... circle plus W-n such that the following four properties hold for every i is an element of {0,..., n}: (1) < e(Delta(i)(x) boolean AND Delta(n-i) (y))> = PG(W-i); (2) < e(boolean OR(j <= i)Delta(j)(x))> = PG(W-0 circle plus ... circle plus W-i); (3) < e(boolean OR(j <= i)Delta(j)(x))> = PG(Wn-i circle plus Wn-i+ 1 circle plus ... circle plus W-n); (4) dim(W-i) = |Delta(i) (x) boolean AND Delta(n-i)(y)| = ((n)(i)) - ((n)(i-1)).((n)(i+1)).", "paper_title": "A decomposition of the universal embedding space for the near polygon H-n", "paper_id": "WOS:000303512700007"}
