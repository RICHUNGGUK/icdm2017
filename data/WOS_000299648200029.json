Complementing the existing work on t-way testing strategies, PSTG serves as our research vehicle to investigate the applicability of Particle Swarm Optimization for t-way test data generation. The experimental results demonstrate that PSTG is capable of outperforming some of the existing strategies as far as the test size is concerned. Additionally, the evaluation also indicates the effectiveness of PSTG in generating an efficient test suite for testing consideration.", "paper_title": "CONSTRUCTING A T-WAY INTERACTION TEST SUITE USING THE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION APPROACH", "paper_id": "WOS:000299648200029"}
