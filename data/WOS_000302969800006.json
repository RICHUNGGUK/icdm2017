Design/methodology/approach - Interpolating cubic splines: are interpolating functions (they pass through the given data points); are cubic, i.e. are polynomials of third degree; have first and second derivatives in the data points, implying that they connect data points in a smooth way; satisfy a best-approximation property which tends to reduce curvature. These properties are illustrated in the paper using real citation data. Findings - The paper reveals that calculating splines yields a differentiable function that still captures small but real changes. It offers a middle way between connecting discrete data by line segments and providing an overall best-fitting curve. Research limitations/implications - The major disadvantage of the use of splines is that accurate data are essential. Practical implications - Spline functions can be used for illustrative as well as modelling purposes. Originality/value - Splines have hardly ever been used or studied in the information sciences.", "paper_title": "A continuous description of discrete data points in informetrics Using spline functions", "paper_id": "WOS:000302969800006"}
