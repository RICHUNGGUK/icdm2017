The current Mobile IPv6 protocol fails to support the enhanced fault tolerance capabilities that,are enabled by the availability of multiple interfaces. In particular, established MIPv6 communications cannot be preserved through outages affecting the home address. In this article, we describe an architecture for IPv6 mobile host multihoming that enables transport layer survivability through multiple failure modes. The proposed approach relies on the cooperation between the MIPv6 and the SHIM6 protocols.", "paper_title": "IPv6 multihoming support in the mobile internet", "paper_id": "WOS:000250239500014"}
