Resolving noise and ambiguity is a precondition for correct natural language processing. In order to satisfy this condition, the AKPG, as a module of an NLP system, combines linguistic and IR methods. Preprocessing modules are incorporated into the AKPG to handle spelling-errors that render correct phoneme generation impossible. In addition, the preprocessing modules convert alphanumeric symbols into Korean characters. Finally, in order to remove part-of-speech (POS) ambiguities and those of homographs with the same POS, homograph collocations are collected from a large corpus using the IR method. In addition, those homographs are integrated into dependency rules for partial parsing.", "paper_title": "Automatic Korean Phoneme Generation via input-text preprocessing and disambiguation", "paper_id": "WOS:000241103500056"}
