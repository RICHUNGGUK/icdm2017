Furthermore, we investigate some topological properties such as the completeness and the isomorphism, and we also give some inclusion relations among these sequence spaces. In addition, we compute the alpha-, beta- and gamma- duals of these spaces, and characterize certain matrix transformations on these sequence spaces. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.
