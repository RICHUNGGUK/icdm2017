In this paper, we investigate physical properties of the simplest MSMs composed of mass points and linear springs. The nodes are either placed on a cubic lattice or positioned randomly within the system. We calculate the elastic moduli for such models and relate the results to other studies. We show that there is a well-defined relationship between the geometric characteristics of the MSM systems and physical properties of the modeled materials. It is also demonstrated that these models exhibit a proper convergence to a unique solution upon mesh refinement and thus can represent elastic materials with a high precision.", "paper_title": "Elastic moduli of simple mass spring models", "paper_id": "WOS:000360759800004"}
