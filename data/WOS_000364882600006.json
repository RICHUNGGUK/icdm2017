Their construction follows a uniform recipe: build the minimal dfa for L in a locally finite variety V, and apply an equivalence between the category of finite V-algebras and a suitable category of finite structured sets and relations. By instantiating this to different varieties, we recover three well-studied canonical nfas: V = boolean algebras yields the atomaton of Brzozowski and Tamm, V = semilattices yields the jiromaton of Denis, Lemay and Terlutte, and V = Z(2)-vector spaces yields the minimal xor automaton of Vuillemin and Gama. Moreover, we obtain a new canonical nfa called the distromaton by taking V = distributive lattices. Each of these nfas is shown to be minimal relative to a suitable measure, and we derive sufficient conditions for their state-minimality. Our approach is coalgebraic, exhibiting additional structure and universal properties of the canonical nfas. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.
