In the past several decades, pioneers of lean manufacturing have developed numerous useful tools and techniques to realize the waste-elimination concept. With the abundant lean tools, applying the right tools at the right time on the right spot relies on extensive knowledge and experiences. Yet, such an expertise is not always accessible or affordable. This paper presents an adaptive lean assessment approach that provides an effective way to guide the lean implementation process. Using the web-based program, an assessment model is generated adaptively for each user to evaluate the Current status of the system, pinpoint the urgent targets for improvement, and identify the appropriate tools and techniques for developing action plans. With the decision support information, lean concepts can be implemented more systematically and efficiently. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.
