Monotone encodings are relevant to the study of tamper-proof data structures and arise also in the design of broadcast schemes in certain communication networks. To answer this question, we develop a relaxation of k-superimposed families, which we call alpha-fraction k-multiuser tracing ((k, alpha)-FUT (fraction user-tracing) families). We show that r(n, k) = circle minus(k log(n/k)) by proving tight asymptotic lower and upper bounds on the size of (k, alpha)-FUT families and by constructing an (n, k)-monotone encoding of length O(k log(n/k)). We also present an explicit construction of an (n, 2) -monotone encoding of length 2log n + O(1), which is optimal up to an additive constant.", "paper_title": "Optimal Monotone Encodings", "paper_id": "WOS:000263928600029"}
