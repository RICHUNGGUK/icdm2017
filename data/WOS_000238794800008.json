The notion of the intuitionistic fuzzy vector is introduced and an entropy measure is derived based on the normalized inner product between intuitionistic fuzzy vectors in the unit intuitionistic fuzzy cube. Some considerations regarding the geometrical representations of intuitionistic fuzzy sets are also stated and a connection between the different notions of entropy in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting is established. Finally, the relation of the proposed entropy measure to the concepts of correlation and informational energy for intuitionistic fuzzy sets is revealed and a new correlation coefficient is introduced.", "paper_title": "Inner product based entropy in the intuitionistic fuzzy setting", "paper_id": "WOS:000238794800008"}
