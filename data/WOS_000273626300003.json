A multi-classifier is proposed which explores problem domains with a large number of independent pattern classes typically found in forensic and security databases. Specifically, the multi-classifier system is demonstrated on the exemplar of fingerprint identification problem typical to forensic, biometric, and security. Furthermore, the multi-classifier is able to provide a reasonable solution to benchmark problems from medicinal and physical (science) fields, which are determining the health, state of thyroid glands and determining whether or not there is a structure in the ionosphere, respectively.", "paper_title": "A Novel Weightless Artificial Neural Based Multi-Classifier for Complex Classifications", "paper_id": "WOS:000273626300003"}
