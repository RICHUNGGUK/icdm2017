The storage capacity of the network increases in proportion to the network size in the case of random patterns, but, in general, the capacity suffers from correlation among memory patterns. Numerous solutions to this problem have been proposed so far, but their high computational cost limits their scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel and simple solution that is locally computable without any iteration. Our method involves XNOR masking of the original memory patterns with random patterns, and the masked patterns and masks are concatenated. The resulting decorrelated patterns allow higher storage capacity at the cost of the pattern length. Furthermore, the increase in the pattern length can be reduced through blockwise masking, which results in a small amount of capacity loss. Movie replay and image recognition are presented as examples to demonstrate the scalability of the proposed method.", "paper_title": "Pseudo-Orthogonalization of Memory Patterns for Associative Memory", "paper_id": "WOS:000325981800014"}
