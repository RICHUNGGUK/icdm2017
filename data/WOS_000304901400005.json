One typical post-processing task for group photos is to produce a key or legend to identify the people in the photo. This is most often done using simple bounding boxes. A more professional approach is to create a picture legend that uses either a full or partial silhouette to identify the individuals. This paper introduces an efficient method for producing picture legends for group photos. Our approach combines face detection with human shape priors into an interactive selection framework to allow users to quickly segment the individuals in a group photo. Our results are better than those obtained by general selection tools and can be produced in a fraction of the time.", "paper_title": "Creating Picture Legends for Group Photos", "paper_id": "WOS:000304901400005"}
