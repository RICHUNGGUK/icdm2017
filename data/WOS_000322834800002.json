In this article, an original approach combining accuracy and speediness is proposed to shorten time-to-market design cycles when such structures are involved. By introducing the quasi-symmetric approach, CPU-time required to analyze asymmetric coupled-lines can be significantly reduced, leading to faster models without sacrificing the overall design accuracy. To achieve this aim, a rigorous formulation was developed and, for the first time, trial functions of C- and -modes were obtained from the quasi-symmetric case and applied to the asymmetric case. The proposed approach, easily implementable in commercial simulators, was demonstrated through comparisons with published data. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
