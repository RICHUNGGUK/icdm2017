We propose to design an augmented radiolucent drill to assist surgeons in completing the distal locking procedure without any additional X-ray acquisitions. Using an augmented reality fluoroscope that coregisters optical and X-ray images, we exploit solely the optical images to detect the augmented radiolucent drill and estimate its tip position in real-time. Consequently, the surgeons will be able to maintain the down the beam positioning required to drill the screws into the nail holes successfully. To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed augmented drill, we perform a preclinical study involving six surgeons and ask them to perform distal locking on dry bone phantoms. Surgeons completed distal locking 98.3% of the time using only a single X-ray image with an average navigation time of 1.4 +/- 0.9 min per hole.", "paper_title": "Multi-Modal Intra-Operative Navigation During Distal Locking of Intramedullary Nails", "paper_id": "WOS:000349338900011"}
