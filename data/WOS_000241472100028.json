In this paper we investigate an algorithm to generate diversity locally in regression ensembles of neural networks, which is based on the idea of imposing a neighborhood relation over the set of learners. In this algorithm each predictor iteratively improves its state considering only information about the performance of the neighbors to generate a sort of local negative correlation. We will assess our technique on two real data sets and compare this with Negative Correlation Learning, an effective technique to get diverse ensembles. We will demonstrate that the local approach exhibits better or comparable results than this global one.", "paper_title": "Ensemble learning with local diversity", "paper_id": "WOS:000241472100028"}
