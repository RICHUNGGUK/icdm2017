Considering the properties of wavelet filters and the relationship between wavelet basis and characteristics of ECG artifacts, the concepts for selecting a suitable wavelet basis and scales used in the process are developed. The analysis via the selected basis is without suffering time shift for decomposition and detection/elimination procedures after wavelet transformation. The detection rates, above 97.5% for MlT/BIH and NTUH recordings, show a pretty good performance in ECG artifact detection and elimination. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.
