The Minkowski sum equals the union of cells with positive crossing numbers in the arrangement of the convolution, as is the case for the kinetic convolution. The monotonic crossing number is bound by the kinetic crossing number, and also by the maximum number of intersecting pairs of monotone boundary chains, which is typically much much smaller. We give a Minkowski sum algorithm based on the monotonic convolution. The running time is O(s + n alpha(n) log(n) + m(2)), versus O(s + n(2)) for the kinetic algorithm, with s the input size and with n and m the number of segments in the kinetic and monotonic convolutions. For inputs with a bounded number of turning points and inflection points, the running time is O(s alpha(s) log s), versus Omega(s(2)) for the kinetic algorithm. The monotonic convolution is 37% smaller than the kinetic convolution and its arrangement is 62% smaller based on 21 test pairs.", "paper_title": "A monotonic convolution for Minkowski sums", "paper_id": "WOS:000251316600006"}
