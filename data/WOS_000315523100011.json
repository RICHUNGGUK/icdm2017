Furthermore, the new generation phones commonly incorporate an accelerometer which may be used to capture the acceleration signals produced as a result of owner's gait. Nowadays, gait identification in basis of acceleration signals is being considered as a new biometric technique which allows blocking the device when another person is carrying it. Although distance based approaches as Euclidean distance or dynamic time warping have been applied to solve this identification problem, they show difficulties when dealing with gaits at different speeds. For this reason, in this paper, a method to extract an average template from instances of the gait at different velocities is presented. This method has been tested with the gait signals of 34 subjects while walking at different motion speeds (slow, normal and fast) and it has shown to improve the performance of Euclidean distance and classical dynamic time warping.", "paper_title": "SPEED-INDEPENDENT GAIT IDENTIFICATION FOR MOBILE DEVICES", "paper_id": "WOS:000315523100011"}
