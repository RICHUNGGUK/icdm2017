The wireless network is operated as a single cell, i.e., only one successful transmission is supported at a time. Data packets are sent between source-destination pairs by multihop relaying. We assume that nodes self-organize into a multihop network such that all hops are of length d meters, where d is a design parameter. There is a contention-based multiaccess scheme, and it is assumed that every node always has data to send, either originated from it or a transit packet (saturation assumption). In this scenario, we seek to maximize a measure of the transport capacity of the network (measured in bit-meters per second) over power controls (in a fading environment) and over the hop distance d, subject to an average power constraint. We first motivate that for a dense collection of nodes confined to a small region, single cell operation is efficient for single user decoding transceivers. Then, operating the dense ad hoc wireless network (described above) as a single cell, we study the hop length and power control that maximizes the transport capacity for a given network power constraint. More specifically, for a fading channel and for a fixed transmission time strategy (akin to the IEEE 802.11 TXOP), we find that there exists an intrinsic aggregate bit rate (Theta(opt) bits per second, depending on the contention mechanism and the channel fading characteristics) carried by the network, when operating at the optimal hop length and power control. The optimal transport capacity is of the form d(opt)((P) over bar (t)) x Theta(opt) with d(opt) scaling as (P) over bar (t) (1/eta), where (P) over bar (t) is the available time average transmit power and eta is the path loss exponent. Under certain conditions on the fading distribution, we then provide a simple characterization of the optimal operating point. Simulation results are provided comparing the performance of the optimal strategy derived here with some simple strategies for operating the network.", "paper_title": "Optimal Hop Distance and Power Control for a Single Cell, Dense, Ad Hoc Wireless Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000308997900001"}
