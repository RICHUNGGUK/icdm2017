Load balancing via multipath routing is a promising solution to increase lifetime. This idea is practised by some algorithms, mostly through limited number of disjoint paths, to reduce inter-path interference. In this paper a proactive multipath routing algorithm called MRPL is proposed, based on the recent standard routing protocol for LLNs. The algorithm tries to distribute the traffic load through a set of braided paths, with the objective of maximizing the network lifetime and minimizing total transmission cost. The traffic distribution mechanism is formulated by a linear program and a heuristic method is proposed to implement it in a distributed manner. Simulation results provide enough evidence for energy and cost efficiency of the proposed routing mechanism.", "paper_title": "Minimum cost load balanced multipath routing protocol for low power and lossy networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000343925600021"}
