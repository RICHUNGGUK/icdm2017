It is written in ISO C and distributed under the open source LGPL license. The package employs libSBML structures for formula representation and associated functions to construct a system of ordinary differential equations, their Jacobian matrix and other derivatives. SUNDIALS' CVODES is incorporated for numerical integration and sensitivity analysis. Preliminary benchmarking results give a rough overview on the behavior of different tools and are discussed in the Supplementary Material. The native application program interface provides fine-grained interfaces to all internal data structures, symbolic operations and numerical routines, enabling the construction of very efficient analytic applications and hybrid or multi-scale solvers with interfaces to SBML and non SBML data sources. Optional modules based on XMGrace and Graphviz allow quick inspection of structure and dynamics.", "paper_title": "The SBML ODE Solver Library: a native API for symbolic and fast numerical analysis of reaction networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000238356700020"}
