In addition, to obtain the optimal number of hidden-layer neurons and the optimal linking weights of the MINN-CP2, the paper develops an algorithm of weights and structure determination (WASD) via cross-validation. Numerical studies show the effectiveness and superior abilities (in terms of approximation and generalization) of the MINN-CP2 equipped with the algorithm of WASD via cross-validation. Moreover, an application to gray image denoising demonstrates the effective implementation and application prospect of the proposed MINN-CP2 equipped with the algorithm of WASD via cross-validation.", "paper_title": "Weights and structure determination of multiple-input feed-forward neural network activated by Chebyshev polynomials of Class 2 via cross-validation", "paper_id": "WOS:000344775800021"}
