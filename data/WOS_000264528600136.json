The existing methods proposed in the literature addressing the topic, however, have paid little attention to the bounded rationality (BR) of the expert. This paper introduces a confidence belief function (BF) qualitatively and quantitatively under the assumption of BR, generated from a set of BFs sampled from the expert by interacting with a number of reliable information providers in a valid time interval. Besides, a procedure for quantitatively producing a confidence BF is presented, which is based on a statistical method mainly involving three steps, dividing the set of BFs into a number of non-conflicting or consistent Subsets. forming the confidence interval-valued belief structures (IBSs) of the subsets, and integrating the IBSs into the confidence IBS of the set. A numerical example about a manager in a telecommunications company deciding whether to upgrade a business campaign or not is given to show the procedure for generating a confidence BF. Since the method of generating a confidence BF is on the power set of a frame of discernment, its scalability, is also discussed. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
