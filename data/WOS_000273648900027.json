The so-called multiple chaotic system actually consists of three chaotic or hyperchaotic maps, namely Logistics Map [1], 2-D Baker Map and a 4-D hyperchaotic Map [2]. The three secret key Junctions are carried out as partial encryption when compressing the video data, as block permutation and confusion after the video compression respectively. The implemented software fatly substantiates the favorable efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of speedy compression and encryption, overall high security and small size preservation.", "paper_title": "VIDEO COMPRESSION AND ENCRYPTION BASED-ON MULTIPLE CHAOTIC SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000273648900027"}
