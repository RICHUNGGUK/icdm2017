After a short simulation based research period, several testbeds have been set up for the study of particular research topics. As wireless mesh networks are entering a phase of wide-spread commercial application, novel approaches for holistic research are required. In this paper we review the trends, advances, and challenges in experimentally driven wireless mesh network research. The evolution of the experimentation facilities is elaborated by distinguishing three generations of testbeds. Based on the review and the current trends of research, open issues are discussed. We introduce the Distributed Embedded Systems Testbed (DES-Testbed) at Freie Universitat Berlin as an example of the current third generation. Further on, its features are elaborated and requirements for future holistic research of wireless networks are discussed.", "paper_title": "Trends, Advances, and Challenges in Testbed-based Wireless Mesh Network Research", "paper_id": "WOS:000277203400002"}
