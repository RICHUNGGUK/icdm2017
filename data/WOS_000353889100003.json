We introduce the user-centric design of VLC for heterogeneous networks (HetNet), where three key aspects are identified and elaborated on: signal coverage quality, system control, and service provision aspects. More explicitly, the concepts of amorphous cell formation as well as separated up-link (UL) and down-link (DL), decoupled data and control, dynamic load balancing (LB), etc., all demand radically new thinking. The advocated user-centric VLC design is of key significance in the small-cell scenarios of the emerging 5G design philosophy.", "paper_title": "VISIBLE LIGHT COMMUNICATIONS IN HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS: PAVING THE WAY FOR USER-CENTRIC DESIGN", "paper_id": "WOS:000353889100003"}
