The simulation results suggest that increased dopamine brings about irregular and aperiodic activity, interpreted as schizophrenic state. Hypoglutamatergic conditions have the same effect on the membrane potential of pyramidal cells. Increased glutamate level was able to neutralize the effects of the hyperdopamine state and normal periodic bursting behavior appeared. We suggest that glutamate receptor activation may have therapeutic results in schizophrenic patients. Surely, this hypothesis must be evaluated in the light of experimental studies on animal models or clinical trials. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.
