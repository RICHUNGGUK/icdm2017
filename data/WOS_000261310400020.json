In the past, many related fingerprint-quality checking methods have typically considered the condition of input images. However, when using the preprocessing algorithm, ridge orientation may sometimes be extracted incorrectly. Unwanted false minutiae can be generated or some true minutiae may be ignored, which can also affect recognition performance directly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel quality-checking algorithm which considers the condition of the input fingerprints and orientation estimation errors. In the experiments, the 2-D gradients of the fingerprint images were first separated into two sets of 1-D gradients. Then, the shapes of the probability density functions of these gradients were measured in order to determine fingerprint quality. We used the FVC2002 database and synthetic fingerprint images to evaluate the proposed method in three ways: 1) estimation ability of quality; 2) separability between good and bad regions; and 3) verification performance. Experimental results showed that the proposed method yielded a reasonable quality index in terms of the degree of quality degradation. Also, the proposed method proved superior to existing methods in terms of separability and verification performance.", "paper_title": "Fingerprint-Quality Index Using Gradient Components", "paper_id": "WOS:000261310400020"}
