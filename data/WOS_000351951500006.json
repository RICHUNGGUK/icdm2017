Among these scenarios, there is a strategy to experiment from the human-centric perspective, whereby the users, and not universal procedures, are the owners of the rules operating things. Following an IoT approach, we propose a smart building management system in this paper. An important aim of our user-centric building management system is to raise energy literacy and environmental consciousness by providing personalised steps for saving energy. This building management platform has been deployed in a real building where experimental tests have been carried out. The first experimental stages of our system operation already reflect energy savings of about 9% at building level when users are included in the loop of the management process. Furthermore, user feedbacks about their experience and their confidence level in the proposed system were gathered and taken into account for the subsequent adjustment of the system.", "paper_title": "An IoT based framework for user-centric smart building services", "paper_id": "WOS:000351951500006"}
