In this paper, we present a multi population pattern searching algorithm (MuPPetS), which is supposed to be an answer to situations where long coded individuals are a must. MuPPetS uses some of the messy GA ideas like coding and operators. The presented algorithm uses the binary coding, however the objective is to use MuPPetS against real-life problems, whatever coding schema. The main novelty in the proposed algorithm is a gene pattern idea based on retrieving, and using knowledge of gene groups which contains genes highly dependent on each other. Thanks to gene patterns the effectiveness of data exchange between population individuals improves, and the algorithm gains new, interesting, and beneficial features like a kind of \"selective attention\" effect.", "paper_title": "Multi Population Pattern Searching Algorithm: A New Evolutionary Method Based on the Idea of Messy Genetic Algorithm", "paper_id": "WOS:000296011700009"}
