Improvement of the objectives is obtained by simultaneous flight retiming and aircraft rerouting, subject to a Fixed fleet assignment. Approximations of the Pareto optimal front are obtained by applying a multi-meme memetic algorithm. We investigate biased meme selection to encourage exploration of the boundaries of the search space and compare it with random meme selection. An external population of high quality solutions is maintained using the adaptive grid archiving algorithm. The presented approach is applied to investigate simultaneous improvement of reliability and flexibility in real world schedules from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Experimental results show that the approach enables us to obtain schedules with significant improvements for the considered objectives. A large scale simulation study was undertaken to quantify the influence of the robustness objectives on the operational performance of the schedules. Rigorous sensitivity analysis of the results shows that the influence of the schedule reliability is dominant and that increased schedule flexibility could improve the operational performance.
