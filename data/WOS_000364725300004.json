It complements existing sampling algorithms by using the rules from body to head instead of in the other direction. We present an implementation in OpenCL, which is able to exploit the multicore architecture of modern CPUs to compute a large number of samples in parallel, and demonstrate that this is competitive with existing inference algorithms.
