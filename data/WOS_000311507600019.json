Owing to the lengthy wafer fabrication process, work in process (WIP) usually affects the cycle time and throughput in the semiconductor fabrication. As the applications of semiconductor have reached the era of consumer electronics, time to market has played an increasingly critical role in maintaining a competitive advantage for a semiconductor company. Many past studies have explored how to reduce the time of scheduling and dispatching in the production cycle. Focusing on real settings, this study aims to develop a manufacturing intelligence approach by integrating Gauss-Newton regression method and back-propagation neural network as basic model to forecast the cycle time of the production line, where WIP, capacity, utilization, average layers, and throughput are rendered as input factors for indentifying effective rules to control the levels of the corresponding factors as well as reduce the cycle time. Additionally, it develops an adaptive model for rapid response to change of production line status. To evaluate the validity of this approach, we conducted an empirical study on the demand change and production dynamics in a semiconductor foundry in Hsinchu Science Park. The approach proved to be successful in improving forecast accuracy and realigning the desired levels of throughput in production lines to reduce the cycle time.", "paper_title": "Manufacturing intelligence to forecast and reduce semiconductor cycle time", "paper_id": "WOS:000311507600019"}
