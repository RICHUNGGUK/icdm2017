To fit the input scale of RELM, the latent semantic analysis was used to represent text for dimensionality reduction. Moreover, a classification algorithm based on RELM was developed including the uni-label (i.e., a document can only be assigned to a unique category) and multi-label (i.e., a document can be assigned to multiple categories simultaneously) situations. The experimental results in two benchmarks show that the proposed method can produce good performance in most cases, and it could learn faster than popular methods such as feedforward neural networks or support vector machine.", "paper_title": "Text categorization based on regularization extreme learning machine", "paper_id": "WOS:000314844300004"}
