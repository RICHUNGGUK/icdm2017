Each call r(j) specifies a pair of nodes to be connected. A lightpath is a path in G together with a wavelength lambda is an element of W. Upon arrival of a call, an online algorithm must decide immediately and irrevocably whether to accept or to reject the call without any knowledge of calls which appear later in the sequence. If the call is accepted, the algorithm must provide a lightpath to connect the specified nodes. The essential restriction is the wavelength conflict constraint: each wavelength is available only once per edge, which implies that two lightpaths sharing an edge must have different wavelengths. The objective in OCA is to maximize the overall profit, that is, the number of accepted calls. A result by Awerbuch et al. states that a c-competitive algorithm for OCA with one wavelength, i.e., X := vertical bar W vertical bar = 1, implies a (c+1)-competitive algorithm for general numbers of wavelengths. However, for instance, for the line with n + 1 nodes, a lower bound of n for the competitive ratio of deterministic algorithms for X = I makes this result void in many cases. We provide a deterministic competitive algorithm for X > 1 wavelengths which achieves a competitive ratio of X((x)root n + 2) on the line with n + 1 nodes. As long as X > 1 is fixed, this is the first competitive ratio which is sublinear in n + 1, the number of nodes.", "paper_title": "Deterministic online optical call admission revisited", "paper_id": "WOS:000236483500015"}
