The proposed fuzzy decision making method can overcome the drawback of Rodriguez et al.'s method (2012) and Wei et al.'s method (2014) for fuzzy decision making, which cannot distinguish the preference order of alternatives in some situations. The proposed fuzzy group decision making method is more flexible than Rodriguez et al.'s method (2013) for fuzzy group decision making because it considers different hesitant fuzzy linguistic operators for fuzzy group decision making. The proposed methods provide us with a useful way for decision making in fuzzy environments. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.
