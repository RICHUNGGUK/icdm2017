We introduce a novel method for activity recognition which leverages the predictability of human behavior to conserve energy by dynamically selecting sensors. We further present a taxonomy of existing approaches to dynamically reducing consumption while maintaining recognition rates. The novel algorithm conserves energy by quantifying activity-sensor dependencies and using prediction methods to identify likely future activities. The approach is implemented and simulated using two activity recognition data sets, and the effects of the novel method are evaluated in terms of recognition rates, energy consumption, and prediction rates. The results indicate that switching off sensors only significantly affects prediction under extreme conditions and that these effects can be counteracted by adjusting system parameters. Large savings in energy can be achieved at very low cost, for example, recognition losses of 1.5 pp with 84.8 % energy savings for the first data set, and 2.8 pp and 89.9 % for the second.", "paper_title": "Activity recognition for creatures of habit", "paper_id": "WOS:000329238400019"}
