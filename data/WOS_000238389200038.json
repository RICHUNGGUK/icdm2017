The goal of the Node is to make good use of physically distributed resources in the field of remote sensing science such as data, models and algorithms, and computing resource left unused on Internet. Implementing it we use workflow technology to manage the node, control resources, and make traditional algorithms as a Grid service. We use web service technology to communicate with Spatial Information Grid (SIG) and other Grid systems. We use JSP technology to provide an independent portal. Finally, the current status of this ongoing work is described.", "paper_title": "A remote sensing application workflow and its implementation in remote sensing Service Grid Node", "paper_id": "WOS:000238389200038"}
