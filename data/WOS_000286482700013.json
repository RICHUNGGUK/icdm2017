Computation at B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory was performed for this purpose. Changes in charges at atoms and characteristics at bond critical points (BCPs) of the H-bond region and also in distant parts of the systems were investigated by means of natural bond orbitals (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) analyses. It is shown that at the border line between partially covalent and non-covalent H-bonding (Espinosa et al. in J Chem Phys 117:5529, 2002; Grabowski et al. in J Phys Chem B 110:64,44, 2006) with the OH center dot center dot center dot F interatomic distance similar to 1.8 angstrom the hydrogen atom has the most positive charge. In addition, the change in the atomic charge values in the interacting region affects the phenyl ring properties. The decrease of the sum of atomic charges as well as of the aromaticity was noticed when the OH center dot center dot center dot center dot F distance is shortened.", "paper_title": "Hydroxyl group as a substituent with varying electronic properties: Effect of strength of H-bonding on charge density changes in Ph-OH center dot center dot center dot F- complexes", "paper_id": "WOS:000286482700013"}
