In this paper, a novel adaptive discretizer based on a dichotomic entropy and a statistical distribution index is proposed to preprocess the continuous attributes in the instance information system, and then multi-knowledge approach is applied to make decisions. The experimental results on benchmark data sets show that the adaptive discretizer can improve the decision accuracy. The decision accuracies for combination of this discretizer and multi-knowledge approach is better than other approaches.", "paper_title": "A novel discretizer for knowledge discovery based on multiknowledge approaches", "paper_id": "WOS:000240383400096"}
