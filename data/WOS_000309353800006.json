By proper adjusting of the magnification of the imaging system to the spatial period of the grating and the sampling grid of the camera, the aliasing effect along the non-uniform digital sampling realizes a tunable spectral distribution that is applied over the spectrum of the object. Preliminary numerical demonstration of the operation principle is provided.", "paper_title": "Optical spatial image processor based on aliasing of pseudo-periodic sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000309353800006"}
