Recently, Shapira and Yuster proved the following result on quasi-randomness of graphs. Let k = 2 be a fixed integer, a1,...,ak be positive reals satisfying \\documentclass{article}\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\\usepackage{amsmath, amssymb}\\pagestyle{empty}\\begin{document} \\begin{align*}\\sum_{i} \\alpha_i = 1\\end{align*} \\end{document} and (a1,....,ak)?(1/k,....,1/k), and G be a graph on n vertices. If for every partition of the vertices of G into sets V 1,....,V k of size a1n,...,akn, the number of complete graphs on k vertices which have exactly one vertex in each of these sets is similar to what we would expect in a random graph, then the graph is quasi-random. However, the method of quasi-random hypergraphs they used did not provide enough information to resolve the case (1/k,....,1/k) for graphs. In their work, Shapira and Yuster asked whether this case also forces the graph to be quasi-random. Janson also posed the same question in his study of quasi-randomness under the framework of graph limits. In this paper, we positively answer their question. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
