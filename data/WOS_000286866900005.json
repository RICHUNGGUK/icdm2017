However, it is surprising to notice that recent attempts to incorporate automatically acquired anaphoricity information into coreference resolution systems have been far from expectation. This paper proposes a global learning method in determining the anaphoricity of noun phrases via a label propagation algorithm to improve learning-based coreference resolution. In order to eliminate the huge computational burden in the label propagation. algorithm, we employ the weighted support vectors as the critical instances to represent all the anaphoricity-labeled NP instances in the training texts. In addition, two kinds of kernels, i.e., the feature-based RBF (Radial Basis Function) kernel and the convolution tree kernel with approximate matching, are explored to compute the anaphoricity similarity between two noun phrases. Experiments on the ACE2003 corpus demonstrate the great effectiveness of our method in anaphoricity determination of noun phrases and its application in learning-based coreference resolution.", "paper_title": "Learning Noun Phrase Anaphoricity in Coreference Resolution via Label Propagation", "paper_id": "WOS:000286866900005"}
