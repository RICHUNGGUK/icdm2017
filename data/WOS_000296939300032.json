Reversible data-hiding schemes assure that the original cover image can be completely recovered from the stego-image after the hidden messages are extracted. Such data-hiding techniques are suitable for applications in the military, medicine, high-energy particle physical experimental investigation and art in cases in which any distortion to the original images is not acceptable. Steganalysis techniques are used to identify possibly hidden images from cover images or determine whether there are messages embedded in cover images. In this paper, a novel steganalytic scheme that can detect the present of Ni et al.'s steganographic method and that is based on histogram feature coding is proposed. Experimental results show that the steganalytic scheme is capable of detecting Ni et al.'s steganographic method.", "paper_title": "STEGANALYSIS OF HISTOGRAM MODIFICATION REVERSIBLE DATA HIDING SCHEME BY HISTOGRAM FEATURE CODING", "paper_id": "WOS:000296939300032"}
