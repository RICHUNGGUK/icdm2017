In order to advertise workflows into a registry, we present in this paper a novel method to abstract behaviors of workflows into symbolic observation graphs (SOG). We present in addition an efficient algorithm for SOG matching, which is used for interconnecting workflows(1).", "paper_title": "Behavioral technique for workflow abstraction and matching", "paper_id": "WOS:000241137100042"}
