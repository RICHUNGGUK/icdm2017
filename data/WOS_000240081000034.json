According to whether the designator has a registered public key, two kinds of UDVRS are proposed. In order to distinguish the two types of UDVRS, we call it UDVRS Proof (UDVRSP) if the designator has not a registered public key, and this protocol is interactive. We give the formal security definitions and notions of UDVRS and UDVRSP. Then, we propose a UDVRS and a UDVRSP scheme, with rigorous security proofs without random oracles.", "paper_title": "Universal designated verifier ring signature (proof) without random oracles", "paper_id": "WOS:000240081000034"}
