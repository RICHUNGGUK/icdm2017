In the 2-D PSWF method, the k-space sampling area and a matching 2-D PSWF filter, with optimal signal concentration and minimal truncation artifacts, are determined by the shape and size of a given convex region of interest (ROI). The spatial information in the reduced k-space data is used to calculate the total image intensity over a nonsquare ROI instead of producing a low-resolution image. This method can be used for tracking dynamic signals from non-square ROIs using a reduced k-space sampling area, while achieving minimal signal leakage. However, the previous theory is limited to the case of rectilinear sampling. In order to make the 2-D PSWF method more suitable for dynamic studies, this paper presents a generalized version of the 2-D PSWF theory that can be applied to nonrectilinear data acquisition methods. The method is applied to an fMRI study using a spiral trajectory, which illustrates the methods efficiency at tracking hemodynamic signals with high temporal resolution.", "paper_title": "A generalization of the two-dimensional prolate spheroidal wave function method for nonrectilinear MRI data acquisition methods", "paper_id": "WOS:000239774800030"}
