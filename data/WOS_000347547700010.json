The model allows partial backlogging and permits part of the backlogged shortages to turn into lost sales. We develop the model without taking any specific distributional form of demand, only assuming the mean and the variance of the distribution of demand. Finally, we illustrate the model by numerical examples and compare our distribution-free model with the specific distributional form of demand.", "paper_title": "A distribution-free newsvendor problem with nonlinear holding cost", "paper_id": "WOS:000347547700010"}
