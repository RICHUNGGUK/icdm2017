Active routers are capable of processing both active and legacy packets. This scenario is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack, which consists in inserting false legacy packets into active routers. We propose a mechanism for detecting the injection of fake legacy packets into active routers. This mechanism consists in exchanging accounting information on the traffic between neighboring active routers. The exchange of accounting information must be carried out in a secure way using secure. active packets. The proposed mechanism is sensitive to the loss of packets. To deal with this problem some improvements in the mechanism has been proposed. An important issue is the procedure for discharging packets when an attack has been detected. We propose an easy and efficient mechanism that would be improved in future work.", "paper_title": "DoS protection for a pragmatic multiservice network based on programmable networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000241448700007"}
