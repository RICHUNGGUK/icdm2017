This paper concentrates on P2P reasoning technology based on description logic, trying to provide an intelligent solution for searching network resources. A P2P reasoning algorithm suitable for description logic called DL-DeCA is proposed in this paper, as well as its system implementation of DL-P2PRS (description logic P2P reasoning system). Experiment results show that DL-P2PRS can work correctly and effectively.", "paper_title": "Design and implementation of P2P reasoning system based on description logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000319507500007"}
