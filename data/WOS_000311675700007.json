We prove the equivalence of the LRSDP problem with the unconstrained minimization of a new merit function and we define an efficient and globally convergent algorithm, called SpeeDP, for finding critical points of the LRSDP problem. We provide evidence of the effectiveness of SpeeDP by comparing it with other existing codes on an extended set of instances of the Max-Cut problem. We further include SpeeDP within a simply modified version of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm and we show that the corresponding heuristic SpeeDP-MC can generate high-quality cuts for very large, sparse graphs of size up to a million nodes in a few hours.", "paper_title": "SpeeDP: an algorithm to compute SDP bounds for very large Max-Cut instances", "paper_id": "WOS:000311675700007"}
