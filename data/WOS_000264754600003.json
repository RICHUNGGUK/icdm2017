The model proposed copies some properties of the real world communication but also allows the easy integration of Task Analysis to the design of CVEs, helping the developer in the design of the application. Furthermore, some of the benefits that the usage of this model brings to the user are also shown. Finally, some implementation details of a prototype supporting the described model are given. This prototype is used all along the paper to illustrate the explanation of some parts of the model.", "paper_title": "A Model of Interaction for CVEs Based on the Model of Human Communication", "paper_id": "WOS:000264754600003"}
