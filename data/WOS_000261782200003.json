This entanglement strongly depends upon the polarization of the absorbed and of the radiated photons, kinematics of two emitted particles, and dynamics of photoionization; however, the photoemission dynamics plays no role in this entanglement. This hybrid entanglement can be used in teleporting a quantum state encoded in a flying/stationary material particle onto a light pulse, or vice versa. Stich an electron-photo it entanglement, in addition, will make it possible to learn about the polarization of a single photon or spin-polarization of a free electron without making any measurements on the corresponding particle itself.", "paper_title": "GENERATION OF ENTANGLEMENT BETWEEN SPIN OF AN ELECTRON AND POLARIZATION OF A PHOTON", "paper_id": "WOS:000261782200003"}
