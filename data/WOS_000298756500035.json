Individual betulin was optimized in different force fields to find the one exhibiting best agreement with ab initio calculations obtained in the Gaussian03 program. Dihedral torsions of active groups of betulin were determined for both procedures, and related calculated structures were compared successfully. The selected force field was used for subsequent optimization of betulin in a water environment, and a conformational search was performed using quench molecular dynamics. The total energies of betulin and its interactions in water bulk were calculated, and the influence of water on betulin structure was investigated.", "paper_title": "Study of the betulin molecule in a water environment; ab initio and molecular simulation calculations", "paper_id": "WOS:000298756500035"}
