Hydrotropism is considered as one controlling factor of root growth in the model. In the paper, the dynamic root model is simulated based on L-systems. The space colonization algorithm is employed to compute hydrotropism caused by soil moist gradient. The soil water flow, caused by water extraction rather than by evaporation and irrigation, is solved by finite-element method. A root simulation study is presented for water uptake by a maize root system. Effects of hydrotropism on root are demonstrated. The results show that the proposed method can couple root development to surroundings and analyze effects of hydrotropism to water uptake and root length fraction. Based on grid technology, the proposed method can provide a flexible root model which can be easily coupled with soil processes.
