Specifically, we derive upper bounds on the network lifetime when multiple BSs arc employed, and obtain optimum locations of the base stations that maximise these lifetime bounds. For the case of two BSs, we jointly optimise the BS locations by maximising the lifetime bound using genetic algorithm. Joint optimisation for more number of BSs becomes prohibitively complex. Further, we propose a suboptimal approach for higher number of BSs, Individually Optimum method, where we optimise the next BS location using optimum location of previous BSs. Individually Optimum method has advantage of being attractive for solving the problem with more number of BSs at the cost of little compromised accuracy. We show that accuracy degradation is quite small for the case of three BSs.", "paper_title": "Enhancing lifetime of wireless sensor networks using multiple data sinks", "paper_id": "WOS:000292347900003"}
