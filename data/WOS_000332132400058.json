First, based on a linear state transformation, the unknown control coefficients are lumped together and the original system is transformed to a new system for which control design becomes feasible. Then, after the introduction of an observer, an adaptive neural network (NN) output-feedback control scheme is presented for such systems by using dynamic surface control (DSC) technique and Lyapunov-Krasovskii method. The designed controller ensures that all the signals in the closed-loop system are 4-Moment (or 2-Moment) semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded. Finally, a numerical example is given to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control design. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
