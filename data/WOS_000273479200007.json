The recent developments in the embedded system architecture have allowed real time implementation of low-level vision tasks such as stereo disparity computation. At the same time, an intermediate level task such as segmentation is rarely attempted in an embedded system. To solve the planar surface segmentation problem, which is iterative in nature, our system implements a Segmentation-Estimation framework. In the segmentation phase, segmentation labels are assigned based on the underlying plane parameters. Connected component analysis is carried out on the segmentation result to select the largest spatially connected area for each plane. From the largest areas, the parameters for each plane are reestimated. This iterative process was implemented on TMS320DM642 based embedded system that operates at 3-5 frames per second on images of size 320 x 240.", "paper_title": "Embedded planar surface segmentation system for stereo images", "paper_id": "WOS:000273479200007"}
