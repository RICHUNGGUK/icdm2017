While recent studies have primarily focused on maximizing resource utilization or minimizing migration cost separately, there has been little attention on jointly taking these two objectives into account. In this paper, we present the optimization model taking minimum migration cost and maximum resource utilization with multi-resources such as storage, bandwidth, CPU, and disk space into account. The optimization of our proposed model is non-deterministic polynomial-time hard. According to the model, we present an efficient approximate algorithm based on bin packing algorithm, called MinCost, to resolve our model and obtain a near-optimal solution. Finally, the simulation results in this paper show that our model and algorithm is efficient.
