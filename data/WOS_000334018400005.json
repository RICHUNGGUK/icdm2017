Past studies have examined the environment that supports effective use of social networking technologies in the developed world. This study argues that the enabling environment in developed and developing countries may vary and therefore may impact Facebook adoption and its socio-economic benefits differently. The model integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and revised UTAUT. Using a structured questionnaire on a sample of 367 Facebook users, the results show that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions (affordability and regulatory environment) are important factors that impact Facebook adoption in a developing country such as Malaysia. The study contributes to the literature by identifying that Facebook user's perceived socio-economic benefits act as a mediator between adoption and actual use behaviour (information seeking, socialisation, entertainment and business development). The findings also indicate that religion, ethnicity, language, gender and education are significant factors moderating the adoption-perception-use behaviour of Facebook. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed in the paper.", "paper_title": "Facebook and socio-economic benefits in the developing world", "paper_id": "WOS:000334018400005"}
