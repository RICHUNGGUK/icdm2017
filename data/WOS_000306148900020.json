Their motivation derived from two papers that recommended to estimate such models using a Poisson likelihood, which is according to Kuss and McLerran \"statistically correct but computationally inefficient\". Kuss and McLerran propose several estimating methods. Some of these are based on the fact that the multinomial model is a multivariate binary model. Subsequently a procedure proposed by Wright [5] is exploited to fit the models. In this paper we will show that the new computation methods, based on the approach by Wright, are statistically incorrect because they do not take into account that for multinomial data a multivariate link function is needed. An alternative estimation strategy is proposed using the clustered bootstrap. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.
