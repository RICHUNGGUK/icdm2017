As the input, several technical indicators and statistical measures are selected. In order to conduct appropriate verification dedicated system with the ability to proceed walk-forward testing was designed and developed. In conjunction with modified SVM classifier, we use Fishers method for feature selection. The outcome shows that using the example weighting combined with feature selection significantly improves sample trading strategy results in terms of the overall rate of return, as well as maximum drawdown during a trading period.
