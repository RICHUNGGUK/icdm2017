Situation agents have all the abilities of typical agents. In addition, they can influence the steering decisions of any agent, including other situation agents, within their sphere of influence. Encapsulating steering logic into moving agents is a powerful abstraction which provides more flexibility and efficiency than traditional informed environment approaches, and works with many of the current steering methodologies. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a number of challenging scenarios.
