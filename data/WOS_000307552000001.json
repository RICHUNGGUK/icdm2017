Compared with known relevant results mainly concentrating on continuous neural networks, the obtained criteria consider impulse effects. Moreover, it does not use Cauchy matrix, and the corresponding hypotheses about linear impulse systems which are often used in the reference. The obtained criteria are easily applicable and checkable, and an illustrative example with simulations shows this. Furthermore, the proposed results are applicable to some other networks with periodic impulses.", "paper_title": "Almost periodic solution of impulsive Hopfield neural networks with finite distributed delays", "paper_id": "WOS:000307552000001"}
