In this paper, we start from the consideration of this inherent topology property and propose the usage of such a semantic criterion for clustering. The corresponding learning algorithms are provided. Theoretical justification and analysis of the algorithms are shown. Promising results are reported by the experiments that generally fail with conventional clustering algorithms.", "paper_title": "Clustering with a semantic criterion based on dimensionality analysis", "paper_id": "WOS:000241753100088"}
