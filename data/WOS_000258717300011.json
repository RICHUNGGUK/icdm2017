Design details, simulations and measurements results of the monolithic implementation of a highly accurate synchronous rectifier are shown. The circuit implements an envelope detector with a +/- 1.5 V output swing on a 15 pF load. It dissipates 15 mW from a +/- 2.5 V voltage supply, and presents SNR = 81 dB measured at a THD = -40 dB for an input signal having 100% modulation index.", "paper_title": "A 0.35 mu m CMOS AM demodulator", "paper_id": "WOS:000258717300011"}
