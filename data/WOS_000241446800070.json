Though some researches have proposed the methods based on domain ontology, it is difficult to implement the general IR because different ontology bases are heterogeneous. Aiming at the questions above, a distributed IR model based on semantic web services (D-IRSW) is proposed. This model puts different Semantic Retrieval Service (SRS) on special ontology base and the results returned by SRS are processed by Semantic Retrieval Service Engine (SRSE). Experiment shows that this model can improve the precision and recall of IR obviously.", "paper_title": "A distributed IR model based on Semantic Web", "paper_id": "WOS:000241446800070"}
