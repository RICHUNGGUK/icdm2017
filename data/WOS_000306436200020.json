There is a set of criteria on which to judge route of product, machine grouping and part family simultaneously in terms of the effective utilization of these cells. In this study, we consider four objectives simultaneously: (1) Minimizing the total fixed and variable cost including costs of purchasing, operation, and maintenance; (2) minimizing cost of intercellular movements; (3) maximizing the utilization of machines in the system; and (4) minimizing deviations among the levels of the cell utilization (i.e., balancing the workload between cells). In this paper, these objectives are first weighted by their relative importance and then a new mathematical model is presented. To solve this model, a scatter search (SS) algorithm is proposed to select a process plan for each part with the minimum cost along with forming the part family and machine grouping simultaneously. The performance of the proposed SS is compared with the Lingo 8.0 software. A number of test problems are carried out to verify the good ability of the proposed SS in terms of the solution quality and computational time. The computational results reveal that the SS finds promising results, especially in the case of large-sized problems.", "paper_title": "A cell formation problem considering machine utilization and alternative process routes by scatter search", "paper_id": "WOS:000306436200020"}
