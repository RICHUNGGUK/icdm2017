The governing system of equations is the system of generalized Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible viscous fluids flow. Generalized Newtonian fluids can be divided to two parts: shear thickening fluids and shear thinning fluids. Newtonian fluids are the special case with constant viscosity. For a viscosity function a power-law model is used. Numerical solution of the described model is based on cell-centered finite volume method using explicit Runge-Kutta time integration. The time-marching system of equations with steady boundary conditions is solved by finite volume method in conjunction with an artificial compressibility method. For the time integration an explicit multistage Runge-Kutta method of the second order of accuracy is used. In the case of unsteady computation two numerical methods are considered, artificial compressibility method and dual-time stepping method. Numerical results obtained by these methods are presented and compared.", "paper_title": "Numerical study of steady and unsteady flow for power-law type generalized Newtonian fluids", "paper_id": "WOS:000338630100023"}
