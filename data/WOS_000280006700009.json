In order to reduce the computational burden of that integration process, a selection stage is necessary. In general, a large number of feature selection techniques have been proposed. However, a specific texture feature selection must be typically applied given a particular set of texture patterns to be classified. This paper describes a new texture feature selection algorithm that is independent of specific classification problems/applications and thus must only be run once given a set of available texture methods. The proposed application-independent selection scheme has been evaluated and compared to previous proposals on both Brodatz compositions and complex real images. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.
