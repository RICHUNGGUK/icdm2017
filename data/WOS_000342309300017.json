By analyzing the hierarchy of functions of Urban Waterfront, namely ecological function, social function and context function, an index system of assessing its functions is proposed. In order to overcome the drawbacks which are only used numerical scales or simple linguistic values in the traditional expert evaluation for the functions of Urban Waterfront, a proportional 2-tuple linguistic representation model is introduced. Some proportional 2-tuple linguistic aggregation operators are proposed, such as PTWA, PTOWA, PTHA operators. A group decision making procedure to evaluate the functions of urban waterfront by the proposed proportional 2-tuple linguistic operators is developed. A case study of two typical redevelopment projects in West Lake Waterfront of Hangzhou of China is also provided.", "paper_title": "Evaluation on Functions of Urban Waterfront Redevelopment Based on Proportional 2-Tuple Linguistic", "paper_id": "WOS:000342309300017"}
