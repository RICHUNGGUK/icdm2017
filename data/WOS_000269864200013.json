However, neither the underlying reasons, nor the exact character and magnitude of the phenomena involved are sufficiently well understood. Here we present a probabilistic approach to the virus transmission events. For a sample ensemble, we construct a model of the infectivity as a function of the ambient conditions, and we determine its parameter values on the basis of the available experimental data.
