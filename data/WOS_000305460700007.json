In some wireless networks, the active base station is able to provide a list of channels operated by neighboring base stations. However, some of these candidate channels may not be accessible to the mobile station (MS); nonetheless, the MS scans the candidate channels consecutively. For this reason, it may take a relatively long time for the MS to select an adequate target base station channel. This process can degrade the quality of service (QoS) during handovers. To shorten the scanning latency efficiently, in this paper we propose a cooperative channel scanning method whereby groups of MSs scan candidate channels using a dispersive schedule. They then share the scanning results amongst themselves, which results in a fast handover channel decision. To apply the proposed method to a real network environment, we present a group scanning architecture and detailed application scenarios appropriate for IEEE 802.16e worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX) networks. Numerical analyses and simulation results show that our proposed method achieves a shorter target channel scanning latency. Our method is thus more efficient in terms of scanning time and channel selection accuracy.
