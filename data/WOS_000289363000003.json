In this paper, four UDR development cases are reviewed (Section 508 standards, Web accessibility guidelines, the British Standard on managing inclusive design, and Irish guidelines on public access terminals). Evidence of a user-centered design approach was found in only one case. The needs of people making universally usable products and services in industry are discussed in the context of the use of UDRs and results of organizational research studies. Nine recommendations are made on the development of user-centered UDRs and the setup and management of accessibility teams in organizations.", "paper_title": "User-centered design in universal design resources?", "paper_id": "WOS:000289363000003"}
