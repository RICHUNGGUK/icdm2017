Many algorithms have thus been proposed for incrementally mining frequent itemsets. Maintaining a frequent-itemset lattice (FIL) is difficult for databases with large numbers of frequent itemsets, especially huge databases, due to the storage of links of nodes in the lattice. However, generating association rules from a FIL has been shown to be more effective than traditional methods such as directly generating rules from frequent itemsets or frequent closed itemsets. Therefore, when the number of frequent itemsets is not huge (i.e., they can be stored in the lattice without excessive memory overhead), the lattice-based approach outperforms approaches which mine association rules from frequent itemsets/frequent closed itemsets. However, incremental algorithms for building FILs have not yet been proposed. This paper proposes an effective approach for the maintenance of a FIL based on the pre-large concept in incremental mining. The building process of a FIL is first improved using two proposed theorems regarding the paternity relation between two nodes in the lattice. An effective approach for maintaining a FIL with dynamically inserted data is then proposed based on the pre-large and the diffset concepts. The experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the batch approach for building a FIL in terms of execution time.", "paper_title": "An effective approach for maintenance of pre-large-based frequent-itemset lattice in incremental mining", "paper_id": "WOS:000342426700007"}
