However, all the methods require assistance from a global positioning system (GPS), which is not always available. In this paper, we propose a method of constructing an axis-based virtual coordinate assignment in 3D wireless sensor networks (ABVCap_3D) that requires no GPS assistance. We also propose a routing protocol based on ABVCap_3D, which guarantees packet delivery in 3D networks. Using simulations, we evaluate the performance of ABVCap_3D routing and other well-known routing protocols, such as greedy-random-greedy routing, greedy-hull-greedy routing, and the routing based on axis-based virtual coordinate assignment in 2D wireless sensor networks (ABVCap routing). Simulations show that ABVCap_3D routing requires significantly relative lower cost for guaranteeing packet delivery in comparison with ABVCap routing. Simulations also demonstrate that ABVCap_3D routing ensures a moderate ratio for routing path length to the shortest (ideal) path length.
