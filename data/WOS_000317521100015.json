For this reason, Mandarin learning has recently been getting more and more popular around the world. More and more people are coming to Taiwan and China from abroad to learn Mandarin at a wide variety of language learning centers. An effective and convenient mobile Mandarin learning system will people to learn Mandarin anytime and anywhere. The TRIZ theory was developed based on innovation theory by the Russian scholar, Genrich Altshuller, in 1946. The important features are the contradiction matrix and 40 principles. There are 39 corresponding parameters for finding out the suggestion on how to solve problems based on the principles. In the study, TRIZ theory is applied to discuss problems for constructing a mobile learning system. There is a shortage of information about the development of the mobile learning system by the application of TRIZ theory. TRIZ theory is found to provide systematic and effective analysis for solving problems. (c) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
