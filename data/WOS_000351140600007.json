From logical point of view, filters correspond to sets of provable formulae. The aim of this paper is to solve two problems appeared in (alpha, beta]-intuitionistic fuzzy filters of residuated lattices. Some characteristics of (alpha, beta]-intuitionistic fuzzy filters ((alpha, beta]-intuitionistic fuzzy P-filters) are obtained. The relations among (alpha, beta]-intuitionistic fuzzy filters, cut sets and s-upper cut sets are established. The \"Extension property\" and \"Triple of equivalent characteristics\" of (alpha, beta]-intuitionistic fuzzy P-filters are also presented.", "paper_title": "Generalized intuitionistic fuzzy filters on residuated lattices", "paper_id": "WOS:000351140600007"}
