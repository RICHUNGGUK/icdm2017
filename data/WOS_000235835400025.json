For this aim we use logical operators, t-norms and fuzzy sets to obtain a compressed file and approximate the function obtained this way, by some polynomial, rational function, trigonometric polynomial or spline for decompression. Error estimates and experimental results for the proposed method are presented.", "paper_title": "Image file compression using approximation and fuzzy logic", "paper_id": "WOS:000235835400025"}
