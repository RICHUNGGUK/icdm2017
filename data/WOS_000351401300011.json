It is imperative to adequately detect anomalous events and identify malicious activity that would affect Cloud users' data assets. It is therefore becoming increasingly important for RAID-based storage systems to be able to track data changing of any point-in-time and to provide Continuous Data Protection (CDP). We propose a novel hybrid RAID6 architecture, referred to as, HR6TAP, which is able to provide block level data changing information for detection and subsequent analysis of incidents and to recover data from both arbitrary two concurrent disk failures and logical errors. We developed three flavors of HR6TAP, that is, HR6TAP-RL/SL/ML, which have their own characteristics. Extensive trace-driven evaluations by using DBT-2 and file system benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed HR6TAP scheme outperforms existing HDD-based or SSD-based RAID6 in terms of performance, energy efficiency, failure recovery ability and reliability.", "paper_title": "HR6TAP: A Hybrid RAID6 Storage Architecture Tracking Data to Any Point-in-time for Enterprise Applications", "paper_id": "WOS:000351401300011"}
