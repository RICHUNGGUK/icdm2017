Compared to market basket analysis, which focuses on the transaction-leveled relation between products, the suggested product network analysis focuses on extended network-leveled point of view of the relation between all products. For such a purpose, we suggest two kinds of product networks, market basket networks and co-purchased product networks. Two networks are comparatively evaluated to analyze the topological characteristics and the structure of those networks. The extended use of market basket analysis, network-leveled analysis are expected to be more effectively and efficiently used in personalized services, such as cross selling, up selling, and personalized product display utilizing the deep relation between products.
