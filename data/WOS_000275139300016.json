First, the fuzzy differential equation is replaced by a system of ordinary differential equations. A trial solution of this system is written as a sum of two parts. The first part satisfies the initial condition and contains no adjustable parameters. The second part involves a feed-forward neural network containing adjustable parameters (the weights). Hence by construction, the initial condition is satisfied and the network is trained to satisfy the differential equations. This method, in comparison with existing numerical methods, shows that the use of neural networks provides solutions with good generalization and high accuracy. The proposed method is illustrated by several examples. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.
