We say a rooted tree T has child sequence c if it is possible to order the nodes of T as v(1),..., v(n) so that for each 1 <= i <= n, v(i) has exactly c(i) children. Let T be a plane tree drawn uniformly at random from among all plane trees with child sequence c. In this note we prove sub-Gaussian tail bounds on the height (greatest depth of any node) and width (greatest number of nodes at any single depth) of T. These bounds are optimal up to the constant in the exponent when c satisfies Sigma(n)(i=1) c(i)(2) = O(n); the latter can be viewed as a \"finite variance\" condition for the child sequence.
