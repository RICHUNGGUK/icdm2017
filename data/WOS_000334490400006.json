For securely relaying data between a node and a base station or two nodes, an end-to-end data security method is adopted by this protocol. Further employing a distributed key revocation scheme to efficiently remove compromised nodes then forms our key management protocol celled multi-BS key management protocol (MKMP). Through performance evaluation, we show that MKMP outperforms LEDS Ren et al. (IEEE Trans Mobile Comput 7(5):585-598, 2008) in terms of efficiency of resilience against the node capture attack. With the analysis of key storage overheads, we demonstrate that MKMP performs better than mKeying Wang et al. (A key management protocol for wireless sensor networks with multiple base stations. In: Procceedings of ICC'08, pp 1625-1629, 2008) in terms of this overhead.", "paper_title": "Key management protocol with end-to-end data security and key revocation for a multi-BS wireless sensor network", "paper_id": "WOS:000334490400006"}
