Current methods perform voxel-wise statistical analysis on some features, such as the Jacobian determinant or the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor, which are not complete descriptors of the local deformation. This article introduces a right-invariant Riemannian distance on the GL(+)(n) group of Jacobian matrices making use of the complete geometrical information of the local deformation. A numerical recipe for the computation of the proposed distance is given. Additionally, experiments are performed on both a synthetic deformation study and a cross-sectional brain MRI study.", "paper_title": "Multivariate Tensor-Based Morphometry with a Right-Invariant Riemannian Distance on GL(+)(n)", "paper_id": "WOS:000339823000003"}
