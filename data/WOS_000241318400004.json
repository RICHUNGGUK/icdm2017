This paper presents a new method for classifying protein sequences based upon the hydropathy blocks occurring in protein sequences. First, a fixed-dimensional feature vector is generated for each protein sequence using the frequency of the hydropathy blocks occurring in the sequence. Then, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier is utilized to classify the protein sequences into the known protein families. The experimental results have shown that the proteins belonging to the same family or subfamily can be identified using features generated from the hydropathy blocks.
