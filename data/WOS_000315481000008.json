To improve the printability of 1-D cell design, it is essential to insert dummy patterns and optimize line-end gap distribution for each layer. This paper presents novel 1-D cell generation algorithms that simultaneously minimize 1-D cell area and enhance the printability. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms can effectively and efficiently reduce the number of diffusion gaps, minimize used routing tracks, insert sufficient dummy patterns, and eliminate stage-like line-end gaps without power and timing overhead. Consequently, the 1-D cell area is minimized and the printability of the cell is enhanced. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first work in the literature that considers line-end gap distribution during 1-D cell generation.", "paper_title": "1-D Cell Generation With Printability Enhancement", "paper_id": "WOS:000315481000008"}
