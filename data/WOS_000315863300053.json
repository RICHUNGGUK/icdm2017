The fact that most couples declare that they are committed to an enduring and happy relationship allows us to model their sentimental relationship as a simple optimal control problem. A state variable monitors the wellness of the relationship whose natural decay in time must be counteracted with effort - the control variable - according to a widely accepted principle in marital psychology. Equilibria are basic desirable solutions of this control problem. In this note key properties of equilibria - in particular, existence, dynamical instability and sensitivity analysis - are obtained for a class of decaying sentimental dynamics. An underlying mechanism combining the existence of an effort stress with the instability of the model may be identified as a main cause of distress for the couple relationship. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
