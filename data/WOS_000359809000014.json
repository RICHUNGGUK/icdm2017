This concept is realized as a portable system that consists of a white cane, a Microsoft Kinect sensor, a numeric keypad, a tactile feedback device, and other components. By the use of the Kinect sensor, the system searches for an object that a visually impaired user instructs the system to find and then returns a searching result to the user via the tactile feedback device. The major advantage of the system is the ability to recognize the objects of various classes, such as chairs and staircases, out of detectable range of white canes. Furthermore, the system is designed to return minimum required information related to the instruction of a user so that the user can obtain necessary information more efficiently. The system is evaluated through two types of experiment: object recognition test and user study. The experimental results indicate that the system is promising as a means of helping visually impaired users recognize objects.", "paper_title": "Kinect cane: an assistive system for the visually impaired based on the concept of object recognition aid", "paper_id": "WOS:000359809000014"}
