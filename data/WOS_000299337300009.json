The recent widespread use of Internet technology has increased the accessibility of the general population to financial data, thereby increasing the average portfolio size. This increase, compounded by the need for accurate real-time results, has led to a rising demand for faster risk simulations. Often, accurately pricing widespread instruments, such as Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs), can take excessively long due to their multifactor assets dependency. We present a hardware implementation for a MultiFactor Gaussian Copula (MFGC) CDO pricing algorithm. Through a detailed benchmark exploration we demonstrate how reconfigurable hardware could be used to exploit fine-grain parallelism. Our results show that our implementation mapped onto a Xilinx Virtex 5 (XC5VSX50T) FPGA is over 71 times faster than corresponding software running on a single core 3.4 GHz Intel Xeon processor.", "paper_title": "FPGA Acceleration of MultiFactor CDO Pricing", "paper_id": "WOS:000299337300009"}
