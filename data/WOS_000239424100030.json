The hierarchies are induced by natural fragments of a calculus based on finite types and Godel's T, and all the classes in the hierarchies are uniformly defined without referring to explicit bounds. Deterministic complexity classes like LOGSPACE, P, PSPACE, LINSPACE and EXP are captured by the hierarchies. Typical subrecursive classes are also captured, e.g. the small relational Grzegorczyk classes epsilon(0)(*), epsilon(1)(*) and epsilon(2)(*).", "paper_title": "Complexity-theoretic hierarchies", "paper_id": "WOS:000239424100030"}
