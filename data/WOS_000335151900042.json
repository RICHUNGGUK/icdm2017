Considering a ternary m-sequence of period 3(3r) - 1, we determine the cross correlation distribution for decimations d = 3(r) + 2 and d = 3(2r) + 2, where gcd(r, 3) = 1. Meanwhile, for a binary m-sequence of period 2(2lm) - 1, we make an initial investigation for the decimation d = (2(2lm) - 1)/(2(m) + 1) + 2(s), where l >= 2 is even and 0 <= s <= 2m - 1. It is shown that the cross correlation takes at least four values. Furthermore, we confirm the validity of two famous conjectures due to Sarwate et al. and Helleseth in this case.", "paper_title": "Some New Results on the Cross Correlation of m-Sequences", "paper_id": "WOS:000335151900042"}
