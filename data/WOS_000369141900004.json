We define balanced multiresolution such that it allows balanced decomposition i.e. decomposition of a high-resolution image into a low-resolution image and corresponding details of equal size. Such a balanced decomposition makes on-demand reconstruction of regions of interest efficient in both computational load and implementation aspects. We find this balanced decomposition and perfect reconstruction based on an appropriate combination of symmetric/antisymmetric extensions near the image and detail boundaries. In our method, exploiting such extensions correlates to performing sample (pixel/voxel) split operations. Our general approach is demonstrated for some commonly used symmetric/antisymmetric multiresolution filters. We also show the application of such a balanced multiresolution scheme in real-time focus+context visualization. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.
