CxBR can be used to represent tactical human behavior in simulations or in the real world. In problem solving, the context can be said to inherently contain much knowledge about the situation in which the problem is to be solved and/or the environment in which it must be solved. This paper discusses some of the issues involved in a context-driven representation of human behavior and introduces a formal description of CxBR.
