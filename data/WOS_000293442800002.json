We assume the nodes in the network to be identical and the coupling matrix to be asymmetric. Some sufficient conditions to guarantee global cluster synchronization are presented. Furthermore, a centralized adaptive intermittent control is introduced and theoretical analysis is provided. Then, by applying the adaptive approach on the diagonal submatrices of the asymmetric coupling matrix, we also get the corresponding cluster synchronization result. Finally, numerical simulations are given to verify the theoretical results.", "paper_title": "Cluster Synchronization in Directed Networks Via Intermittent Pinning Control", "paper_id": "WOS:000293442800002"}
