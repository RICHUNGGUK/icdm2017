In most applications, however, a decision diagram is compiled with respect to a single combinatorial structure. We propose to expand this representation by incorporating additional constraints in the decision diagram via a Lagrangian relaxation. With this generic approach we can obtain stronger bounds from the same decision diagram, while the associated cost-based filtering allows for further refining the relaxation. Experimental results on the traveling salesman problem with time windows show that the improved Lagrangian bounds can drastically reduce solution times.", "paper_title": "Lagrangian bounds from decision diagrams", "paper_id": "WOS:000354216900005"}
