It is already known to provide a very expressive language; embeddings have been defined of the V calculus, Bloo and Rose's lambda x, Parigot's lambda mu and Curien and Herbelin's lambda mu mu. We investigate various notions of polymorphism in the context of the X-calculus. In particular, we examine the first class polymorphism of System F, and the shallow polymorphism of ML. We define analogous systems based on the X-calculus, and show that these are suitable for embedding the original calculi. In the case of shallow polymorphism we obtain a more general calculus than ML, while retaining its useful properties. A type-assignment algorithm is defined for this system, which generalises Milner's W.", "paper_title": "Approaches to polymorphism in classical sequent calculus", "paper_id": "WOS:000236905200007"}
