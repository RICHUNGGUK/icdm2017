The communication complexity of our protocol is proportional to the size of an obtained multiple-valued-input ESOP expression. Since the historical research on minimizing ESOP expressions is now still active, our protocol will turn to an efficient one as this research progresses. Thus, this paper gives an application of ESOP expressions to designing cryptographic protocols, and we hope that it would motivate further research on minimizing ESOP expressions.", "paper_title": "Secure computations in a minimal model using multiple-valued ESOP expressions", "paper_id": "WOS:000238091800052"}
