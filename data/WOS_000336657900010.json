They represent a natural generalization of classical Gabor frames by allowing for adaptivity of windows and lattice in either time or frequency. In this paper, we show a general existence result for this family of frames. Then, we give a perturbation result for nonstationary Gabor frames and construct nonstationary Gabor frames with non-compactly supported windows from a related painless nonorthogonal expansion. Finally, the theoretical results are illustrated by two examples of practical relevance.", "paper_title": "Nonstationary Gabor frames - Existence and construction", "paper_id": "WOS:000336657900010"}
