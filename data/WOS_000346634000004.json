The authors present an r3tos-based inverter controller of a real-world railway traction system that is proven to recover from most of the errors provoked to it without requiring any human intervention.", "paper_title": "R3TOS-BASED AUTONOMOUS FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEMS", "paper_id": "WOS:000346634000004"}
