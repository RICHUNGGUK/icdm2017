A distinct from most existing image completion methods, which exploit only the target image's own information to complete the damaged regions, our algorithm makes full use of a large displacement view (LDV) of the same scene, which introduces enough information to resolve the original ill-posed problem. To eliminate any perspective distortion during the warping of the LDV image, we first decompose the target image and the LDV one into several corresponding planar scene regions (PSRs) and transform the candidate PSRs on the LDV image onto their correspondences on the target image. Then using the transformed PSRs, we develop a new image repairing algorithm, coupled with graph cut based image stitching, texture synthesis based image inpainting, and image fusion based hole filling, to complete the missing regions seamlessly. Finally, the ghost effect between the repaired region and its surroundings is eliminated by Poisson image blending. Our algorithm effectively preserves the structure information on the missing area of the target image and produces a repaired result comparable to its original appearance. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method.", "paper_title": "Image completion based on views of large displacement", "paper_id": "WOS:000249207600023"}
