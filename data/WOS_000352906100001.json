It is deemed suitable for deploying with large-scale in the environment for variety of applications. Recent advances in WSN have led to many new protocols specifically for reducing the power consumption of sensor nodes. A new scheme for predetermining the optimized routing path is proposed based on the enhanced parallel cat swarm optimization (EPCSO) in this paper. This is the first leading precedent that the EPCSO is employed to provide the routing scheme for the WSN. The experimental result indicates that the EPCSO is capable of generating a set of the predetermined paths and of smelting the balanced path for every sensor node to forward the interested packages. In addition, a scheme for deploying the sensor nodes based on their payload and the distance to the sink node is presented to extend the life cycle of the WSN. A simulation is given and the results obtained by the EPCSO are compared with the AODV, the LD method based on ACO, and the LD method based on CSO. The simulation results indicate that our proposed method reduces more than 35% power consumption on average.", "paper_title": "A Balanced Power Consumption Algorithm Based on Enhanced Parallel Cat Swarm Optimization for Wireless Sensor Network", "paper_id": "WOS:000352906100001"}
