We first give a complete proof of this result, showing that the infinite Post Correspondence Problem in a regular omega-language is Sigma(1)(1)-complete, hence located beyond the arithmetical hierarchy and highly undecidable. We infer from this result that it is Pi(1)(1)-complete to determine whether two given infinitary rational relations are disjoint. Then we prove that there is an amazing gap between two decision problems about omega-rational functions realized by finite state Buchi transducers. Indeed Prieur proved in [Pri01, Pri02] that it is decidable whether a given omega-rational function is continuous, while we show here that it is Sigma(1)(1)-complete to determine whether a given omega-rational function has at least one point of continuity. Next we prove that it is Pi(1)(1)-complete to determine whether the continuity set of a given omega-rational function is omega-regular. This gives the exact complexity of two problems which were shown to be undecidable in [CFS08].", "paper_title": "THREE APPLICATIONS TO RATIONAL RELATIONS OF THE HIGH UNDECIDABILITY OF THE INFINITE POST CORRESPONDENCE PROBLEM IN A REGULAR omega-LANGUAGE", "paper_id": "WOS:000314423000006"}
