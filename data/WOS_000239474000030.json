Although it is known that generic encode-then-encrypt construction of chosen cipher-text secure public-key encryption also applies to secure Tag-KEM construction and some known encoding method like OAEP can be used for this purpose, it is worth pursuing more efficient encoding method dedicated for Tag-KEM construction. This paper proposes an encoding method that yields efficient Tag-KEM schemes when combined with set partial one-way functions such as RSA and Rabin's encryption scheme. We also present an efficient Tag-KEM which is CCA-secure under general factoring assumption rather than Blum factoring assumption.", "paper_title": "Tag-KEM from set partial domain one-way permutations", "paper_id": "WOS:000239474000030"}
