To cope with the influence of faulty components, reaching a common agreement in the presence of faults before performing certain tasks is essential. However, the Byzantine Agreement (BA) problem is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems. In previous studies, protocols dealing with the BA problem focused on static networks; however, these do not perform well in dynamically changing mobile networks. The most well known mobile network is the Mobile Ad-hoc Network (manet). To enhance fault tolerance and manet reliability, the BA problem in virtual subnets of manet is revisited in this paper. The proposed protocol is called the Hybrid Agreement Protocol (HAP). It achieves agreement on a common value among all functional mobile processors in a minimal number of message exchange rounds and can tolerate a maximal number of allowable faulty components in the virtual subnet of manet.", "paper_title": "Reaching agreement among virtual subnets in hybrid failure mode", "paper_id": "WOS:000257869100009"}
