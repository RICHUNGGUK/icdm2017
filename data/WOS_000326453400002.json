This method employs graphical sensitivity curves of certain performance metric with respect to device sizes, called size sensitivity, to guide the designer to choose proper device sizes semi-automatically. It is shown that the plot of sensitivity curves in the frequency-domain can exhibit quantitative performance dependence to device sizes nearby dominant pole/zero locations. For accurate sensitivity calculation, the dependence on dc sensitivity in the computation of ac sensitivity to device size is emphasized and an EKV model-based implementation is outlined. The proposed graphical semi-automatic analog sizing methodology differentiates itself from the traditional black-box approaches with which the user has no interference in the optimization process. An interactive semi-automatic analog sizing tool with a graphical interface allows the user to decide which device sizes are more rewarding to tune. An operational amplifier is sized by using the proposed interactive tool.", "paper_title": "A size sensitivity method for interactive CMOS circuit sizing", "paper_id": "WOS:000326453400002"}
