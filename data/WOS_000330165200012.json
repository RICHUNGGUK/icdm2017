We propose a model that allows for the presence of common breaks in a system of factor models for individual hedge fund investment strategies, which share common investment characteristics. We develop a Bayesian approach to inference for the unknown number and positions of the structural breaks, based on a set of filtering recursions similar to those of the forward-backward algorithm. Furthermore, we identify relevant risk factors, common among the series of hedge funds, using a Bayesian model comparison approach. We apply our method to a set of correlated hedge fund strategies, which are mainly characterized by equity related bets. Multiple common breaks are identified, consistent with well-known market events, which reveal evidence for structural changes in the risk exposures as well as in the correlation structure of the analysed series.", "paper_title": "Detecting structural breaks in multivariate financial time series: evidence from hedge fund investment strategies", "paper_id": "WOS:000330165200012"}
