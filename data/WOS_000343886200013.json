In this paper, we consider two-, three-, and four-way methods for parallel implementation of binary polynomial multiplication. We propose optimized three-and four-way split formulas which reduce the space and time complexity of the best known methods. Moreover, we present a block recombination method which provides some further reduction in the space complexity of the considered two-, three-, and four-way split multipliers.", "paper_title": "Efficient Subquadratic Space Complexity Binary Polynomial Multipliers Based on Block Recombination", "paper_id": "WOS:000343886200013"}
