When only elementary (leaf) membrane division rules are allowed, the computing power decreases to P-PP = P-#P, the class of problems solvable in polynomial time by deterministic Turing machines equipped with oracles for counting (or majority) problems. In this paper we investigate a variant of intermediate power, limiting membrane nesting (hence membrane division) to constant depth, and we prove that the resulting P systems can solve all problems in the counting hierarchy CH, which is located between P-PP and PSPACE. In particular, for each integer k >= 0 we provide a lower bound to the computing power of P systems of depth k.", "paper_title": "Membrane Division, Oracles, and the Counting Hierarchy", "paper_id": "WOS:000352646800009"}
