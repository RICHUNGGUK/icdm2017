HMIPv6 supports micro-mobility within a domain and introduces a new entity, namely mobility anchor point (MAP) as a local home agent (HA). However, HMIPv6 has caused load concentration at a particular MAP and longer handover latency when an inter-domain handover occurs. In order to solve such problems, this paper establishes a virtual domain (VD) of a higher layer MAP and proposes a MAP changing scheme. The MAP changing scheme enables complete handover by using binding-update of the on-link care of address (LCoA) only when inter-domain handover occurs. In addition, the concentrated load of a particular MAP is distributed as well.
