The antenna consists of a 2-by-1 array of slot antennas at 60 GHz. An in-house developed on-chip antenna measurement setup was used to characterize the fabricated antenna. The measurement results show an antenna gain of more than 5dBi with a return loss of 18dB at 60 GHz. The better-than-10-dB impedance bandwidth of the antenna covers the 60-GHz unlicensed band from 57 to 64 GHz. The 3-dB beamwidths of the antenna are 105 degrees and 76 degrees at E-plane and H-plane at 60 GHz, respectively. The size of the die of the antenna is 2 mmx4.5 mm. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
