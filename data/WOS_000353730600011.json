The service times, which depend on the size of the batch, are generally distributed. We obtain, in steady-state, the joint distribution of the random variables of interest at various epochs. Efficient computational procedures in the case of phase type services are presented. An illustrative numerical example to bring out the qualitative nature of the model is presented.
