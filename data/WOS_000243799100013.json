How to decrease these threats is an important issue in medical treatment. Thus, this paper suggests a model of a chronic diseases prognosis and diagnosis system integrating data mining (M) and case-based reasoning (CBR). The main processes of the system include: (1) adopting data mining techniques to discover the implicit meaningful rules from health examination data, (2) using the extracted rules for the specific chronic diseases prognosis, (3) employing CBR to support the chronic diseases diagnosis and treatments, and (4) expanding these processes to work within a system for the convenience of chronic diseases knowledge creating, organizing, refining, and sharing. The experiment data are collected from a professional health examination center, MJ health screening center, and implemented through the system for analysis. The findings are considered as helpful references for doctors and patients in chronic diseases treatments. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
