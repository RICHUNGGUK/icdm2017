In this paper, we show that the projection neural network can also be used to solve pseudomonotone variational inequalities and related pseudoconvex optimization problems. Under various pseudomonotonicity conditions and other conditions, the projection neural network is proved to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov and globally convergent, globally asymptotically stable, and globally exponentially stable. Since monotonicity is a special case of pseudomononicity, the projection neural network can be applied to solve a broader class of constrained optimization problems related to variational inequalities. Moreover, a new concept, called component-wise pseudomononicity, different from pseudomononicity in general, is introduced. Under this new concept, two stability results of the projection neural network for solving variational inequalities are also obtained. Finally, numerical examples show the effectiveness and performance of the projection neural network.", "paper_title": "Solving pseudomonotone variational inequalities and pseudoconvex optimization problems using the projection neural network", "paper_id": "WOS:000241933100012"}
