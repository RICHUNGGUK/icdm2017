There are many studies on information-sharing mechanisms and bandwidth estimation methods in the IMS environment; however, most focused on how to effectively take advantage of network bandwidth to more quickly transmit data to the receiver by the Greedy approach. Nevertheless, with increasing numbers of users in the IMS environment, more and more connections and data transmission will easily result in too heavy network traffic load. Hence, this paper proposed cross-layer playback-rate based streaming services, which can maintain network transmission quality and receive data before playback reliably in IMS networks with many users. The experimental results show that the services could reduce the overall network load without the occurrence of dropped packets.", "paper_title": "Playback-Rate Based Streaming Services for Maximum Network Capacity in IP Multimedia Subsystem", "paper_id": "WOS:000297425200013"}
