Our system enables a user to create and edit content both through direct manipulation using hand gestures in an immersive environment, and by using a 2D GUI on a PC desktop. The system also exploits various features of 3D information visualization to produce effective and interactive presentations. In a system trial, users found that the system enhanced their experience. The system helps users create 3D educational materials more easily and learn through the materials with greater interest and motivation.", "paper_title": "Poster3D: a system for three-dimensional authoring and presentation in immersive virtual environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000236078600003"}
