Indirect reference can appear in many guises, such as heap pointers, higher-order functions, object references, and shared-memory mutexes. We give a general method to construct models containing indirect reference by presenting a \"theory of indirection\". Our method can be applied in a wide variety of settings and uses only simple, elementary mathematics. In addition to various forms of indirect reference, the resulting models support powerful features such as impredicative quantification and equirecursion; moreover they are compatible with the kind of powerful substructural accounting required to model (higher-order) separation logic. In contrast to previous work, our model is easy to apply to new settings and has a simple axiomatization, which is complete in the sense that all models of it are isomorphic. Our proofs are machine-checked in Coq.", "paper_title": "A Theory of Indirection via Approximation", "paper_id": "WOS:000274028100017"}
