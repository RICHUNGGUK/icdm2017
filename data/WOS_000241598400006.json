We makes use of principle geodesic analysis (PGA) to parameterize the facial needle-maps. Using feature selection, we determine which of the components of the resulting parameter vector are the most significant in distinguishing gender. Using the EM algorithm we distinguish gender by fitting a two component mixture model to the vectors of selected features. Results on real-world data reveal that the method gives gender discrimination results that are comparable to human observers.", "paper_title": "Gender classification using principal geodesic analysis and Gaussian mixture models", "paper_id": "WOS:000241598400006"}
