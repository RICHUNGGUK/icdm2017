We introduce the probability that the cross point is taken up by the same kind of vehicle during two successive time steps to describe the complex behaviors when conflict happens. The flux of both motorized vehicle and bicycle depending on the inflow rates are investigated and the spatiotemporal diagrams are also presented to show different traffic states as the inflow rates change. The simulation results show that the model can describe the interactions between motorized vehicle and bicycle. It makes foundations for future research on mixed traffic flow.", "paper_title": "MODELING THE INTERACTION BETWEEN MOTORIZED VEHICLE AND BICYCLE BY USING CELLULAR AUTOMATA MODEL", "paper_id": "WOS:000263880100003"}
