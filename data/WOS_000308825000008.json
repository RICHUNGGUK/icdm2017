By applying an approximation method, we give a set of parameter values with which an asymptotically stable limit cycle exists, and the sufficient conditions on the coupling parameters that guarantee asymptotically global synchronization are established under the same external input. A gradational classifier is introduced to detect synchronization, and the network model based on the analytical results is applied to image segmentation. The performance is comparable to the results from other segmentation methods.", "paper_title": "Qualitative analysis and application of locally coupled neural oscillator network", "paper_id": "WOS:000308825000008"}
