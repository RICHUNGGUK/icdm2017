A subset S of P is called a (k,epsilon)-kernel if for every direction, the directional width of S epsilon-approximates that of P, when k \"outliers\" can be ignored in that direction. We show that a (k,epsilon)-kernel of P of size O(k/epsilon((d-1)/2)) can be computed in time O(n+k(2)/epsilon(d-1)). The new algorithm works by repeatedly \"peeling\" away (0,epsilon)-kernels from the point set. We also present a simple epsilon-approximation algorithm for fitting various shapes through a set of points with at most k outliers. The algorithm is incremental and works by repeatedly \"grating\" critical points into a working set, till the working set provides the required approximation. We prove that the size of the working set is independent of n, and thus results in a simple and practical, near-linear epsilon-approximation algorithm for shape fitting with outliers in low dimensions. We demonstrate the practicality of our algorithms by showing their empirical performance on various inputs and problems.", "paper_title": "Robust shape fitting via peeling and grating coresets", "paper_id": "WOS:000253753900004"}
