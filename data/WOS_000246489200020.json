The key result which allows such an extension is the construction of a small number (two for a 10(-2) relative error in reaction potentials inside the sphere) of image point charges for source point charges inside or outside the dielectric sphere. Numerical results validate the accuracy and high efficiency of the resulting algorithm. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.
