For this is proposed the SMAC routing protocol. Before this work the SMAC protocol was suitable to perform one hop communications only. However, with the developed mechanisms, it is possible to use multi-hop communication. Performance results from the implemented protocol are presented and analyzed in order to define important requirements for wireless sensor networks, such as robustness, self-healing property and low latency.
