A special class of generators on L-I is the class of representable generators which can be represented using generators on ([0, 1], <=). A representation of involutive negators on L-I by means of continuous additive generators which is similar to the representation of involutive negators on ([0, 1], <=) is given. We also investigate additive and multiplicative generators of t-norms on L-I.", "paper_title": "Additive and multiplicative generators in interval-valued fuzzy set theory", "paper_id": "WOS:000245684800008"}
