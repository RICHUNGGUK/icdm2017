Within this context this project has developed a new interaction device (incorporating gestural platform technology) and user interfaces to facilitate interactive access to digital media in a lounge room setting. This paper provides an overview of an interdisciplinary design process applied by Australasian CRC for Interaction Design (ACID) researchers-in order to develop the device and present in detail its unique features.", "paper_title": "Interactive lounge: an interdisciplinary approach to the design of a gestural interaction device", "paper_id": "WOS:000246339100020"}
