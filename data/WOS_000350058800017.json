Moreover, growth of families by duplication and retention is an important mechanism by which organisms gain new functions. Therefore the ability to infer the evolutionary histories of families is an important step in understanding the evolution of function. We have recently developed DupliPHY, a software tool to infer gene family histories using parsimony and maximum likelihood. Here, we present DupliPHY-Web a web server for DupliPHY that implements additional maximum likelihood functionality and provides users an intuitive interface to run DupliPHY.", "paper_title": "DupliPHY-Web: a web server for DupliPHY and DupliPHY-ML", "paper_id": "WOS:000350058800017"}
