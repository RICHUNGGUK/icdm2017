Here we replicate and dissect one of those models, Armony and colleagues' neurocomputational model of fear conditioning, which is based on LeDoux's dual-route hypothesis regarding the rat fear circuitry. The importance of the model's modular abstraction of the neuroanatomy, its use of population coding, and in particular the interplay between thalamo-amygdala and thalamo-cortical pathways are tested. We show that a trivially minimal version of the model can produce conditioning to a reinforced stimulus without recourse to the dual pathway structure, but a modification of the original model, which nevertheless preserves the thalamo-amygdala and (reduced) thalamo-cortical pathways, enables stronger conditioning to a conditioned stimulus. Implications for neurocomputational modelling approaches are discussed.", "paper_title": "The dual-route hypothesis: evaluating a neurocomputational model of fear conditioning in rats", "paper_id": "WOS:000264530000003"}
