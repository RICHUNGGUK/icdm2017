This calculus is related to Boudol's resource calculus and is derived from Ehrhard and Regnier's differential extension of Linear Logic and of the lambda calculus. We extend it with new constructions, to be understood as implementing a very simple exception mechanism, and with a \"must\" parallel composition. These new operations allow to associate a context of this calculus with any point of the model and to prove full abstraction for the finite sub-calculus where ordinary lambda calculus application is not allowed. The result is then extended to the full calculus by means of a Taylor Expansion formula. As an intermediate result we prove that the exception mechanism is not essential in the finite sub-calculus.", "paper_title": "FULL ABSTRACTION FOR THE RESOURCE LAMBDA CALCULUS WITH TESTS, THROUGH TAYLOR EXPANSION", "paper_id": "WOS:000315381600009"}
