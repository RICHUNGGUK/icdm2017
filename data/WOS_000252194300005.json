The coupling between qubit and data bus may be turned on and off by controlling the DC gate voltage and externally applied flux of the superconducting charge qubit. In our proposal, the entanglement between two arbitrary qubits and W states of three qubits can be generated quickly and easily.", "paper_title": "Generating quantum entanglement in scalable superconducting charge qubits", "paper_id": "WOS:000252194300005"}
