In particular, the affordability and the versatility of SRAM-based FPGAs make them attractive with respect to ASIC implementations. FPGAs have thus been used extensively and successfully in many fields, such as implementing cryptographic accelerators. Hardware implementations, however, must be protected against malicious attacks, e.g. those based on fault injections. Protections have been usually evaluated on ASICs, but FPGAs can be vulnerable as well. This work presents thus fault injection attacks against a secured AES architecture implemented on a SRAM-based FPGA. The errors are injected during the computation by means of voltage glitches and laser attacks. To our knowledge, this is one of the first works dealing with dynamic laser fault injections. We show that fault attacks on SRAM-based FPGAs may behave differently with respect to attacks against ASIC, and they need therefore to be addressed by specific countermeasures, that are also discussed in this paper. In addition, we discuss the different effects obtained by the two types of attacks.", "paper_title": "Glitch and Laser Fault Attacks onto a Secure AES Implementation on a SRAM-Based FPGA", "paper_id": "WOS:000288712100002"}
