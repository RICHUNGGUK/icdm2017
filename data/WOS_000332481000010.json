We introduce knowledge-enhanced phylogenetic problems for both supertree and supermatrix phylogenetic analyses. These problems seek an optimal phylogenetic tree that can only be assembled from a user-supplied set of, possibly incompatible, phylogenetic relationships. We describe exact polynomial time algorithms for the knowledge-enhanced versions of the NP-hard Robinson Foulds, gene duplication, duplication and loss, and deep coalescence supertree problems. Further, we demonstrate that our algorithms can rapidly improve upon results of local search heuristics for these problems. Finally, we introduce a knowledge-enhanced search heuristic that can be applied to any discrete character data set using the maximum parsimony (MP) phylogenetic problem. Although this approach is not guaranteed to find exact solutions, we show that it also can improve upon solutions from commonly used MP heuristics.", "paper_title": "Efficient Algorithms for Knowledge-Enhanced Supertree and Supermatrix Phylogenetic Problems", "paper_id": "WOS:000332481000010"}
