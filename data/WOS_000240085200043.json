The extension rule (ER) method is a new method for theorem proving, which is potentially a complementary method to resolution-based methods. But the first-order ER approach is incomplete and not realized. This paper gives a complete first-order ER algorithm and describes the implementation of a theorem prover based on it and its application to solving some planning problems. We also report the preliminary computational results on first-order formulation of planning problems.", "paper_title": "An extension rule based first-order theorem prover", "paper_id": "WOS:000240085200043"}
