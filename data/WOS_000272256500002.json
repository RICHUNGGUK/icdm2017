The system classifies users' resource application roles, divides users' application information into different cooperative grades, and provides a basis for users' cooperative work. Functions, authorization, page flow, operating methods, and relevant database table of cooperative roles are shown in detail. At the same time, the ASP system will be introduced into the system, and a special fee management system will be established for effective management of the system. Functions and page flow of the fee management system are also designed. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
