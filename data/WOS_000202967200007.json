Recently, Heubach and Mansour enumerated the number of compositions of n with m parts in A that contain the subword tau exactly r times, where tau is an element of {111, 112, 221, 123}. Our aims are ( 1) to generalize the above results, i.e., to enumerate the number of compositions of n with m parts in A that contain an l-letter subword, and ( 2) to analyze the number of compositions of n with m parts that avoid an l-letter pattern, for given l. We use tools such as asymptotic analysis of generating functions leading to Gaussian asymptotic.", "paper_title": "Counting l-letter subwords in compositions", "paper_id": "WOS:000202967200007"}
