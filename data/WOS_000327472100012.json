The last decade has seen a revival of interest in pebble games coming from the field of proof complexity. Pebbling has proven to be a useful tool for studying resolution-based proof systems when comparing the strength of different subsystems, showing bounds on proof space, and establishing size-space trade-offs. This is a survey of research in proof complexity drawing on results and tools from pebbling, with a focus on proof space lower bounds and trade-offs between proof size and proof space.", "paper_title": "PEBBLE GAMES, PROOF COMPLEXITY, AND TIME-SPACETRADE-OFFS", "paper_id": "WOS:000327472100012"}
