This study compares the performances of classification and ensemble models for predicting dispute handling methods in public-private partnership (PPP) projects. Model analyses use machine learners (i.e., Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and Tree-augmented Naive (TAN) Bayesian), classification and regression-based techniques (i.e.. Classification and Regression Tree (CART), Quick, Unbiased and Efficient Statistical Tree (QUEST), Exhaustive Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (Exhaustive CHAID), and C5.0), and combinations of these techniques that performed best for a set of PPP data. Analytical results exhibit that the combined technique of QUEST + CHAID + C5.0 has the best classification accuracy at 84.65% in predicting dispute resolution outcomes (i.e., mediation, arbitration, litigation, negotiation, administrative appeals or no dispute occurred). Moreover, as the dispute category and phase in which the dispute occurs are known during project execution, the best classification model is the CART model, with an accuracy of 69.05%. This study demonstrates effective classification application for early PDR prediction related to public infrastructure projects. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
