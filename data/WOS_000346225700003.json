The design involves determining the weights of the selected recurrent dynamics so that for a given base stimulus, the dynamics converges to one of several optima (local attractors) on the given Lyapunov energy surface. Experiments undertaken reveal that for small noise amplitude below a selected threshold, the dynamics essentially converges to fixed stable attractor. However, with a slight increase in noise amplitude above the selected threshold, the local attractor of the dynamics shifts in the neighbor-hood of the attractor obtained for the noise-free standard stimuli. The other important issues undertaken in this paper include a novel algorithm for evolutionary feature selection and data-point reduction from multiple experimental EEG trials using principal component analysis. The confusion matrices constructed from experimental results show a marked improvement in classification accuracy in the presence of data point reduction algorithm. Statistical tests undertaken indicate that the proposed recurrent classifier outperforms its competitors with classification accuracy as the comparator. The importance of this paper is illustrated with a tea-taster selection problem, where an olfactory perceptual-ability measure is used to rank the tasters.", "paper_title": "EEG Analysis for Olfactory Perceptual-Ability Measurement Using a Recurrent Neural Classifier", "paper_id": "WOS:000346225700003"}
