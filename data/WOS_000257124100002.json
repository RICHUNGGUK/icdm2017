Control design for nonlinear systems with uncertain components is usually carried out on a per system basis, especially when physical control constraints, and certain control performance measures such as optimum time control are imposed. Elegant adaptive control techniques are difficult to apply to this type of problems. A new neural network based control design is proposed and presented in this paper to deal with a special class of uncertain nonlinear systems with multiple inputs. The desired system dynamics are analyzed and utilized in the process of the proposed intelligent control design. The theoretical results are provided to justify the design procedures. The simulation study is conducted on a second-order bilinear system with two inputs and uncertainties on its parameters. The simulation results indicate that the proposed design approach is effective.", "paper_title": "On near optimal neural control of multiple-input nonlinear systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000257124100002"}
