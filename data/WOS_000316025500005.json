The methodology takes into account the structural effect of the control forces and includes the modal control design. Location points for the actuation forces are chosen a priori. Structural topology optimization is used for distributing material on a fixed domain, using continuum finite element discretization for the static and free vibration analyses. Optimal control for transient response in modal space is used to derive the control force. The cost function for the optimization combines the strain energy and the control energy. Results of the numerical simulations validates the proposed methodology.", "paper_title": "Integrated topology optimization and optimal control for vibration suppression in structural design", "paper_id": "WOS:000316025500005"}
