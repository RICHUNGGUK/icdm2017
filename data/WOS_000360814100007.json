This representation is based on the definition of a linear projection and a nonlinear prediction operator, which locally adapts to the function to be represented. This adaptivity of the prediction operator proves to be very interesting for image encoding in that it enables a considerable reduction in the number of significant coefficients compared with other representations. Applications of this new nonlinear multiscale representation to image compression and super-resolution conclude this paper.", "paper_title": "Nonlinear and Nonseparable Bidimensional Multiscale Representation Based on Cell-Average Representation", "paper_id": "WOS:000360814100007"}
