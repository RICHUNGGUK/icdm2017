In the preprocessing step, the portions of the mesh with high curvature are detected and clustered as fine geometric details. Then the fine grids with optimal orientations are defined for each detected portions, while the coarse grid is chosen for global evolution. The solutions on different scale grids are synthesized as the final results. Compared with the level set solution on the uniform grid, our approach can achieve a good compromise between computational costs and mesh evolution quality. The implementation results also show that it is an efficient and robust method.", "paper_title": "Adaptive level set method for mesh evolution", "paper_id": "WOS:000238089300133"}
