In order to overcome these inherent shortcomings shared by most ACO algorithms, we divide the ordinary ants into two types: the utilization-oriented ants and the exploration-oriented ants. The utilization-oriented ants focus on constructing solutions based on the learned experience like ants in many other ACO algorithms. On the other hand, inspired by the adaptive behaviors of some real-world Monomorium ant species who tend to select paths with moderate pheromone concentration, a novel search strategy, that is, a completely new transition rule is designed for the exploration-oriented ants to explore more unknown solutions. In addition, a new corresponding update strategy is also employed. Moreover, applying the new search strategy and update strategy, we propose an improved version of ACO algorithm-Moderate Ant System. This improved algorithm is experimentally turned out to be effective and competitive.", "paper_title": "An Ant System based on Moderate Search for TSP", "paper_id": "WOS:000314392000010"}
