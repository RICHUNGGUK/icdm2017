Many operation support systems were proposed to help the plant operator with such judgment and operation decision making, but most of them could not indicate the rationale for operation, because they used only information on the result of plant design. Therefore, plant operator could not get the theoretical information for operation decision making from it. This paper proposes the safety operation support system which helps the operation decision making based on the risk management information (RMI). The RMI is useful one for the theoretical operation decision making, because it is considered and updated through the plant life cycle (PLC) and includes the information on the design rationale (DR) of the safety countermeasure, the intents of corresponding operation, etc. PVC batch process is used for verifying the effectiveness of proposed method.", "paper_title": "Study on safety operation support system by using the risk management information", "paper_id": "WOS:000242122600072"}
