It could be regarded as a binary representation of 1st order derivative between the central and its neighbors. Based on LBP definition, in this paper, a framework of local directional derivative pattern (LDDP) is proposed which could represent high order directional derivative feature, and LBP is a special case of LDDP. Under the proposed framework, like traditional LBP, rotation invariance could be easily defined. As different order derivative information contains complementary features, better recognition accuracy could be achieved by combining different order LDDPs which is validated by two large public texture databases, Outex and CUReT.", "paper_title": "Local directional derivative pattern for rotation invariant texture classification", "paper_id": "WOS:000309878400009"}
