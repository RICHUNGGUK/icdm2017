Monotonicity greatly increases the efficiency of the coupler. We prove the validity of the multigamma coupler when the coalescence probability rho is variable; specifically, a function of the bounding chains. This variation is more efficient than the fixed rho version, and can always be used when the multigamma coupler is monotonic. We apply our algorithm to two examples.", "paper_title": "Monotonic multigamma coupling for perfect sampling", "paper_id": "WOS:000303234800008"}
