Our new approach is based on structure deformation and propagation for achieving the overall consistency in image structure and intensity. The new stitching algorithm, which has found applications in image compositing, image blending, and intensity correction, consists of the following main processes. Depending on the compatibility and distinctiveness of the 2D features detected in the image plane, single or double optimal partitions are computed subject to the constraints of intensity coherence and structure continuity. Afterwards, specific 1D features are detected along the computed optimal partitions from which a set of sparse deformation vectors is derived to encode 1D feature matching between the partitions. These sparse deformation cues are robustly propagated into the input images by solving the associated minimization problem in gradient domain, thus providing a uniform framework for the simultaneous alignment of image structure and intensity. We present results in general image compositing and blending in order to show the effectiveness of our method in producing seamless stitching results from complex input images.", "paper_title": "Image stitching using structure deformation", "paper_id": "WOS:000253135600006"}
