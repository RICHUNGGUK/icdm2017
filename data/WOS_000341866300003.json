In particular, the asymptotic behavior of the departure process is investigated, as the size of the network grows. Our result provides a complete characterization of a properly scaled limiting departure process, i.e., the joint probability density function of any finite number of consecutive inter-departure times, as the size of the network increases.", "paper_title": "On the departure process of the linear loss network", "paper_id": "WOS:000341866300003"}
