In order to achieve these objectives, three dynamic neural networks are introduced to model the dynamics of the wheels on all three axes independently. Due to the dynamic property of the wheel, the architecture utilized is the Elman recurrent network with backpropagation learning algorithm. The effectiveness of this neural network-based FDI scheme is investigated and a comparative study is conducted with the performance of a generalized observer-based scheme. The simulation results have demonstrated the advantages of the proposed neural network-based method.", "paper_title": "Dynamic neural network-based fault diagnosis for attitude control subsystem of a satellite", "paper_id": "WOS:000240091500034"}
