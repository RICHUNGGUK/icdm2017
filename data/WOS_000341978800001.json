Using results of Evans (Oper Res 26 (1978), 673-679) and of Soun and Truemper (SIAM J Algebr Discrete Meth 1 (1980), 348-358), the multicommodity flow problem on a graph that is two-isomorphic to a suspension graph is reduced to a single-commodity flow problem on an enlarged graph, called a rolodex graph. Such a reduction allows us to apply results of Granot and Veinott (Math Oper Res 10 (1985), 471-497), developed for single-commodity network-flow problems, to derive qualitative sensitivity analysis results for multicommodity flow problems on graphs which are two-isomorphic to suspension graphs.
