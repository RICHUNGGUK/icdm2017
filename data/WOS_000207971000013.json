We study the routing problem for multihop wireless ad hoc networks based on cooperative transmission. The source node wants to transmit messages to a single destination. Other nodes in the network may operate as relay nodes. In this paper, we propose a cooperative multihop routing for the purpose of power savings, constrained on a required bit error rate (BER) at the destination. We derive analytical results for line and grid network topologies. It is shown that energy savings of 100% are achievable in line and grid networks with a large number of nodes for BER = 10(-4) constraint at the destination.", "paper_title": "Energy-efficient cooperative routing in BER constrained multihop networks", "paper_id": "WOS:000207971000013"}
