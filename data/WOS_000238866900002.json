Each user specifies upper and lower QoS bounds. We formulate the considered problem as a game, and first examine the non-cooperative case. We then compare it to its cooperative counterpart (through the Nash bargaining solution). The use of the cooperative scheme shows significant reduction in the transmission power of the mobile terminals, while the achieved QoS is slightly compromised, compared to the non-cooperative scheme.", "paper_title": "A cooperative uplink power control scheme for elastic data services in wireless CDMA systems", "paper_id": "WOS:000238866900002"}
