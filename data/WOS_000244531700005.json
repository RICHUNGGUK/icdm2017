The systems follows the paradigm of a parameterized family of logics established by Schaerf's and Cadoli's system S-l. We show that s(l) inherits several of the nice properties of S-l, while presenting several attractive new properties. The family s(l) deals with the full propositional language, has a complete tableau proof system which provides for incremental approximations; furthermore, it constitutes a full approximation of classical logic from above, with an approximation process with better relevance and locality properties than S-l. When applied to clausal inference, s(l) provides a strong simplification method. An application of s(l) to model-based diagnosis is presented, demonstrating how the solution to this problem can benefit from the use of s(l) approximations.", "paper_title": "Anytime approximations of classical logic from above", "paper_id": "WOS:000244531700005"}
