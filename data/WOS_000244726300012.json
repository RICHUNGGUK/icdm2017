However, modality specific image artifacts, such as the phenomena of intensity inhomogeneity in magnetic resonance images (MRI), are still prominent and can adversely affect quantitative image analysis. In this paper, numerous methods that have been developed to reduce or eliminate intensity inhomogeneities in MRI are reviewed. First, the methods are classified according to the inhomogeneity correction strategy. Next, different qualitative and quantitative evaluation approaches are reviewed. Third, 60 relevant publications are categorized according to several features and analyzed so as to reveal major trends, popularity, evaluation strategies and applications. Finally, key evaluation issues and future development of the inhomogeneity correction field, supported by the results of the analysis, are discussed.", "paper_title": "A review of methods for correction of intensity inhomogeneity in MRI", "paper_id": "WOS:000244726300012"}
