A battery-powered square waveform generator was developed to mimic the electrostatic-coupling intra body communication system operating in the environment of the ground free. The measurement results are then confirmed using a reliable measuring method (single tone) and spectral analysis. The results demonstrate that the proposed measurement approach is valid for up to 32.5 MHz, providing a data rate of over 16 Mbps.", "paper_title": "Measuring the Transmission Characteristic of the Human Body in an Electrostatic-Coupling Intra Body Communication System Using a Square Test Stimulus", "paper_id": "WOS:000276761000015"}
