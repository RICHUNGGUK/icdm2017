To address this challenge we dynamically coupled a three-dimensional surface water model with a soil hydro-geochemical model of the riparian zone and used the coupled system to simulate the impacts of acid sulfate soils on the water quality of a morphologically complex coastal lake system in South Australia. A 3-yr simulation was undertaken to capture a period of exposure and re-flooding of pyrite-bearing sediments and acid fluxes to the lake. Model performance was assessed against data from several acidification events that occurred and the simulations reproduced the observed spatio-temporal variation in the expression of soil and water acidity. The model approach introduced here has potential for simulating systems where the terrestrial-aquatic linkage is important in shaping water quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
