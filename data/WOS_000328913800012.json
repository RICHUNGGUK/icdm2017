The electrical and optical properties of the resulting materials were optimized; by studying the argon and oxygen gas flow rates and the sputtering power effects. At optimal deposition conditions, thin films of IZO were achieved with a low sheet resistance (about 20 Omega/sq) and an optical transmittance of ca. 80% in the visible spectrum range. These materials retained these properties for more than 8 months. Electrochromic devices (ECDs) with several configurations were built with those conductive papers and life cycling and contrast were measured for the ECDs. These devices exhibited a very good color contrast (as defined using L*a*b* color coordinates, = 32) and electrochromic cyclability up to 30,000 redox cycles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.
