Two equal terms are added to and subtracted from the right-hand side of the PDE: the first is a damping term and is treated implicitly, the second is treated explicitly. A criterion for absolute stability is found and the scheme is shown to be convergent. The method is applied with success to the mean curvature flow equation, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in a Hele-Shaw cell, including the effect of surface tension.
