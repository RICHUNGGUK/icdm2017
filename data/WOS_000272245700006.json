This is partly due to the \"pull\" nature of task distribution in volunteer computing environments, where workers request tasks from the master rather than the master assigning tasks to arbitrary workers. In this paper we propose algorithms for computing batches of medium grained tasks with deadlines in pull-style volunteer computing environments. We develop models of unreliable workers based on analysis of trace data from an actual volunteer computing project. These models are used to develop algorithms for task distribution in volunteer computing systems with a high probability of meeting batch deadlines. We develop algorithms for perfectly reliable workers, computation-reliable workers and unreliable workers. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithms through simulations using traces from actual volunteer computing environments.", "paper_title": "Computing Low Latency Batches with Unreliable Workers in Volunteer Computing Environments", "paper_id": "WOS:000272245700006"}
