However, extreme process variation and high failure rates, mainly due to atomic device sizes, are major challenges for crossbar nano-architectures. This article presents variation- and defect-tolerant logic mapping on crossbar nano-architectures. Since variation/defect-aware mapping is an NP-hard problem, we introduce a set of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulations to effectively solve the problem in a reasonable time. The proposed ILP formulations can be used for both diode-based and FET-based crossbars. Experimental results on benchmark circuits show that our approach can reduce the critical-path delay 39% compared to the Simulated Annealing (SA) method. It can also successfully achieve 97% defect-free mapping with 40% defect density. It can tolerate process variations to meet timing constraints in 95% of the cases, compared to only 77% achieved by SA.", "paper_title": "ILP Formulations for Variation/Defect-Tolerant Logic Mapping on Crossbar Nano-Architectures", "paper_id": "WOS:000327261500005"}
