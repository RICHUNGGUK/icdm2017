This paper considers the association control problem for vehicular WiFi access in the Drive-thru Internet scenario. In particular, we aim to improve the efficiency and fairness for all users. We design efficient algorithms to achieve these objectives through several techniques including approximation. Our simulation results demonstrate that our algorithms can achieve significantly better performance than conventional approaches.", "paper_title": "Association Control for Vehicular WiFi Access: Pursuing Efficiency and Fairness", "paper_id": "WOS:000292047500008"}
