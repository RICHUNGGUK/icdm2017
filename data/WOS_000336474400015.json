MutualCascade improves the classic method of cascade to remove irrelevant and redundant features. The mutual correlation coefficient is utilized as a criterion to determine whether a feature should be chosen or not. Experimental results show that the MutualCascade method is more efficient and effective than Voila and Jones' cascade and some other Adaboost-based method, and is comparable with HOG-based methods. It also demonstrates a higher performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.
