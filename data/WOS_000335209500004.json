We consider Gardner's rninichess variant in which all pieces are set as in a standard chessboard (from Rook to King). This game has roughly 9 x 10(18) legal positions and is comparable in this respect with checkers. We weakly solve this game: we prove its game-theoretic value and give a strategy to draw against best play for White and Black sides. Our approach requires surprisingly little computing power. We give a human readable proof. The way the result is obtained is generic and could be generalized to bigger chess settings or to other games.", "paper_title": "GARDNER'S MINICHESS VARIANT IS SOLVED", "paper_id": "WOS:000335209500004"}
