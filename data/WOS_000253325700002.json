The emphasis is given to the description of coupling conditions at pipe-to-pipe intersections. The accurate prediction of these coupling conditions is essential in order to achieve good performance and reliable numerical simulations of network simulations. Nowadays, a variety of theoretical results for a reduced geometry exists. We conduct a numerical simulation of the two-dimensional representation at a pipe intersection. The results are used for verification and comparison with known theoretical results. High-order and non-oscillatory discretizations are used for solving the governing equations of gas flow. Verifications are conducted for two types of junctions to analyse the most adequate coupling conditions.
