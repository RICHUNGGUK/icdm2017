With the advanced digital signal processing, this work presents an asynchronous digital controller with dynamic power saving technique to achieve high power efficiency. The regulation is based on the off-time modulation, in which an adaptive resolution adjustment is proposed for the extension toward light-loaded range. The DC-DC converter is fabricated in a 0.18-mu m CMOS process. The input voltage is from 2.7 to 3.6 V and the regulated output is 1.8 V. The switching frequency is from 44 kHz to 1.65 MHz and the maximum output ripple is 20 mV with a 10-mu F capacitor and a 2.2-mu H inductor. The power efficiency is higher than 91% for the workload range from 3 to 400 mA.", "paper_title": "A High-Efficiency, Wide Workload Range, Digital Off-Time Modulation (DOTM) DC-DC Converter With Asynchronous Power Saving Technique", "paper_id": "WOS:000312835000007"}
